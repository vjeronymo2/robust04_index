			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Regulatory Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.202&blank;Permissible Charges by Lenders to Borrowers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 427A of the HEA. The changes in this section include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creation of variable interest rates for new Stafford loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowers and the return of excess interest to certain Stafford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan borrowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an additional 250,000 hours to comply with the requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess interest be returned to certain Stafford loan borrowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This requirement is taken directly from the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.208&blank;Due Diligence in Servicing a Loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 428(b)(2)(F) of the HEA. Under the regulations, in cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the holder of the loan remains the same, but there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicing change that results in a change in the identity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party to whom the borrower must send payments or direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communications, the Secretary would apply the same borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification requirements that are required by current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations at 34 CFR 682.208(e) when a loan is sold or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary does not view this requirement as one that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposes any additional burden because lenders and servicers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already notify borrowers, as a normal business practice, whenever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a servicing change that results in a change in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identity of the party to whom the borrower must send payments or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct communications. This requirement is taken directly from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.402&blank;Death, Disability, Closed School, False  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certification, and Bankruptcy Payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 437 of the HEA. The regulations reflect the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory provision for cancellation of a parent's PLUS loan if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student for whom the parent borrowed died. This was not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject of controversy at the regional meetings or during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations implement the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA with regard to the discharge of a borrower's liability on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL Program loan if the student was unable to complete an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational program because of the closure of the school. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing criteria to be used to determine a borrower's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for a closed school loan discharge, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that a student who completed his or her educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed school to another school, or who completed the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through a teach-out of the educational program at a different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school, should not qualify for a loan cancellation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that the closed school discharge was intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to benefit students who could not complete their education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because their school closed, and does not believe that a student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who was able to complete the educational program for which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan paid should be able to avoid repaying that loan. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary is particularly interested in receiving public comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as to the appropriate treatment of a borrower's loan obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the educational program for which the loan was obtained was a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multi-year program and the student was able to complete one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more years of that program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also believes, contrary to the majority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sentiment expressed at the regional meetings and by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators, that a borrower should submit to the holder a sworn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement that demonstrates that the borrower is eligible for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed school discharge to assist the Secretary or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's designees in pursuing claims against the closed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school, and to secure the borrower <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s written commitment to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representations on which he or she seeks relief. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that an affidavit or sworn statement is essential in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protecting the interests of the federal taxpayer, and therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes that one be obtained from the student as a condition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan discharge. By virtue of Federal law (28 U.S.C. 1746), this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affidavit or statement need not be notarized, but the borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must state in the document that the borrower makes the statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under penalty of perjury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

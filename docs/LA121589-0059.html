			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHNIC EATING: GRILLED CHICKEN FOR THE AGES AT KOKEKOKKO  </P> <P> There's an old saying about resourceful cooks using every portion of a pig but  the squeal. Well, even the "squeal" -- or in this case, the "cluck" -- is used  at Kokekokko.  </P> <P> This Little Tokyo eating place specializes in grilled chicken -- the Japanese  call it yakitori -- and makes amazingly thorough use of the bird.  </P> <P> Livers, gizzards, leg meat, breast meat and skin -- you get them all in a  series of snack-like courses. The parts of the chicken that don't appear on the  plate no doubt are tossed into the pot to make the broth that accompanies the  meal.  </P> <P> It's a lively place with a woodsy log cabin look and is open only at night,  much like the street stalls of Tokyo that dispense yakitori after dark. The  atmosphere is as jovial and noisy as a sushi bar -- probably noisier due to the  sizzle and hiss emanating from the grill.  </P> <P> Most of the customers crowd around the counter, and the food is prepared and  served a morsel at a time, like sushi. Almost everything is speared on wooden  sticks and grilled over charcoal. Exceptions include sauteed chicken bits  spooned over rice and chicken sashimi.  </P> <P> You can order either a half-course of yakitori (five sticks) or a full-course  (10 sticks), and if you are obviously unacquainted with yakitori customs, the  cooks will ask how you like your meat (medium rare, well done) and check  whether you eat livers and gizzards.  </P> <P> I skipped the innards and selected medium rare on the cook's advice.  </P> <P> First came a little cup containing crisp sweet green beans seasoned with  sesame, soy sauce and sugar. The meal proper started with breast meat chunks  lightly daubed with wasabi. Next, I had chicken meat wrapped around eggplant  slices while a friend went for grilled livers that were perfectly cooked --  rare and tender inside, crisp outside. Then we tried skewers of chicken with  green onions, chicken meatballs, salted chicken leg meat, leg meat with  yakitori sauce, gizzards, grilled chicken skins and chicken wings. Toward the  middle, we received a skewer of hard-boiled quail eggs, a green salad and  broth.  </P> <P> Yakitori sauce, which tastes much like teriyaki sauce, is the restaurant's own  blend of seasonings and crucial to the reputation of its food. And Kokekokko's  sauce is a good one.  </P> <P> After consuming our 10 sticks, we ordered some of the dishes we saw prepared  for other customers. Plump fresh shiitake mushrooms made a nice contrast to the  long parade of meat. And then we tried two forms of chicken sashimi. First came  the breast meat, shaved thin and wrapped around fine strands of the white part  of green onion. The soy sauce-based dip that accompanied this included a raw  quail egg. Next, the cook took out chicken leg meat that had been wrapped with  the skin into a roll and frozen so that when sliced it looked like sausage. A  few moments on the plate, however, and it thawed into a shapeless mass. Chopped  green onion flavored its salty dipping sauce.  </P> <P> We also tried the house special rice, which was topped with finely diced  chicken seasoned with soy sauce, sugar and thin strips of nori (dried seaweed).  We finished with big mugs of green tea. By then it was around 8 on a Monday  night, and the restaurant was so crowded that standees filled the doorway.  </P> <P>  Kokekokko Yakitori House, 203 S.

			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RISING-BIRTHRATES FORECAST HOLDS TROUBLE FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Due to increased birthrates, California public school enrollment will increase  even more sharply than expected over the next 10 years, aggravating an already  severe shortage of classroom space, new estimates by the state Department of  Finance show.  </P> <P> The new numbers project an average annual increase of 160,000 pupils in  kindergarten through 12th grade -- 20,000 more per year than the department's  population experts were predicting a year ago. Total enrollment is expected to  increase from about 4.5 million this year to almost 6.1 million in 1998 -- a  35% jump.  </P> <P> School districts in several Southern California counties will be especially  hard hit by heavy new enrollment demands, according to the Department of  Education.  </P> <P> Riverside County is expected to experience an 89% enrollment increase in the  next 10 years, San Bernardino 78%, San Diego 46%, Orange County 27%, Ventura  24% and Los Angeles County 23%.  </P> <P> Some outlying San Diego County school districts are experiencing annual growth  rates of 10% because of new housing developments -- but the San Diego Unified  School District expects only a 1% rate of growth this coming school year,  officials said Friday.  </P> <P> Countywide in San Diego, enrollments have been increasing about 6% annually in  recent years, said Glen Pierson, assistant superintendent for personnel in the  county's Office of Education.  </P> <P> "You only need to drive through Rancho San Diego (in East County) and North  County to see all the growth," he said.  </P> <P> School officials in San Diego County's suburbs -- already overcrowded and  relying heavily on portable classrooms on playgrounds -- have long anticipated  continued growth. Voters in Escondido in June approved a $27-million bond issue  to build new classrooms, and a similar measure will go before voters in the  Vista Unified School District in November.  </P> <P> Pierson noted that, though school officials monitor new housing construction to  anticipate student enrollment increases, "We never know for sure how many  students we'll have until the first week of school when they show up."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District is expecting an increase of 61,623  students in the five-year period ending in 1993-94, which would bring district  enrollment to an all-time high of 656,425.  </P> <P> The new projections are bad news for school officials, who already face a  backlog of more than $5 billion in unmet school building needs statewide.  </P> <P> State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said $1.6 billion in bond issues  approved by voters last year already has been committed to new school  construction and that another $3.5 billion is needed by 1992.  </P> <P> Honig has asked Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders to place a  $1.5-billion general obligation school bond issue on the June, 1990, ballot and  another $1.5-billion measure on the November, 1990, ballot. In addition, Honig  has asked for $500 million in revenue bonds or other new revenue sources to  finance construction needs between now and June, 1990.  </P> <P> "We've got to keep this building program going," Honig said Friday. "Otherwise,  we're looking at double sessions in a lot of school districts in a couple of  years."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Unified Budget Director Henry Jones said the district will need $1  billion for new and modernized schools by the 1992-93 school year.  </P> <P> The Department of Finance's increased projections were caused by rising  fertility rates among black and white California women and a continuing high  rate among Latinas, said Mary Heim, research manager in the department's  population unit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Study Fertility Rates  </P> <P> In the past, department researchers have studied "trends in total fertility,"  Heim said. This year they looked at racial and ethnic fertility rates and then  changed their projections because "the mix is changing," she said.  </P> <P> In 1987, the last year for which data is available, there were 106.3 live  births per 1,000 Latinas of child-bearing age (15 to 44), while the rate for  Asian women was 78.8 per 1,000, for black women it was 78.3 and for white women  63.5.  </P> <P> Between 1982 and 1987, the number of live births per 1,000 Latinas remained  about the same -- 106.4 in 1982, 106.3 in 1987 -- but for black women the  number jumped from 72.8 births per 1,000 women in 1982 to 78.3 in 1987.  </P> <P> For white women there was an increase from 59 to 63.5. Among Asian women, the  number dropped from 81.6 in 1982 to 78.8 in 1987.  </P> <P> California's fertility rate for all racial and ethnic groups was 76.6 live  births per 1,000 women in 1987, the highest it has been since 1970 and well  above the U.S. average of 66.1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Keeps Going Up'  </P> <P> "California just keeps going up," said Gwendolyn Doebbert, chief of the  demographic section in the state Department of Health Services, which compiled  these figures.  </P> <P> These numbers translate into serious overcrowding for many of the state's  school districts, which already are running well behind the demand for new  classrooms, laboratories, cafeterias and other needed facilities.  </P> <P> Jim Murdoch, Sacramento lobbyist for an organization called Coalition for  Adequate School Housing, said the state office of local assistance, which  allocates money to local school districts, has a $4.3-billion backlog of  applications for new and updated school buildings.  </P> <P> Another $700 million to $750 million in applications are pending in the office  of the state architect, Murdoch said.  </P> <P> In a recent letter to Deukmejian and to majority and minority leaders of the  Assembly and Senate, schools' chief Honig called this a "crisis facing our  overcrowded schools."  </P> <P> State voters approved an $800-million school bond measure in June of last year  and another $800 million last November, but Honig said all these funds have now  been committed to new construction projects.  </P> <P> Proposition 98, approved by voters last year, assures public schools and  community colleges of at least 40% of state general revenues, but it applies  only to operating budgets, not construction.  </P> <P> Pending in the Legislature are two more $1-billion school bond issues -- one  for the June, 1990, ballot, the second for November, 1990. However, these  measures must compete with bond issue requests by other state agencies, and the  governor has been reluctant to place too many bond issues before the voters in  a single election.  </P></p>

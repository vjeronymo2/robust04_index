			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Occidental in Dollars 34m deal to explore for oil in Peru THE PERUVIAN arm of US-owned Occidental Oil and Gas Corporation has signed a USDollars 34m exploration contract with state oil company Petroperu. The contract awards exploration rights for six years over an 880,000-hectare (2.2m-acre) area of the Peruvian Amazon, attractive for its proximity to the north eastern oil pipeline. Occidental is Peru's oldest established private operator, responsible for almost half of the country's present crude output of about 120,000 barrels a day. The signing underlines a new willingness by the Peruvian state to speed up approval for contracts with private operators. Petroperu's president, Mr Jaime Quijandria, points out that Peru, although almost virgin territory in oil terms, 'is not the only petroleum-rich country in the region, nor the most important. We have to compete for investment with Ecuador and Colombia to name but two'. Petroperu aims to sign exploration contracts worth a total of at least USDollars 110m a year until the end of the century, according to Mr Quijandria. This will boost both the flagging reserves position and current output. 'Peru must aim at supplying all its internal oil requirements and becoming a medium-sized exporter,' he says.</p>

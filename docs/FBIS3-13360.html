The address expressed  unequivocal support for a just and comprehensive peace in the  Middle East and strongly refuted Israeli claims and attempts to  mislead world public opinion. President al-Asad noted Syria is  totally open to the peace process and has offered much to bring  this process to a successful conclusion. He stressed that our  delegation to the Washington talks is invested with authority  and is very trustworthy. Israel's security claims and demands,  such as upgrading the level of the talks, are part of a pattern  of prevarication, extortion, and avoidance of the needs of  peace, topped by withdrawal from the occupied territories and  recognition of Palestinian rights.    For over two years, Arab delegations have heard nothing from  the Israelis except security pretexts. Upon reviewing  documented events in UN reports and resolutions, we see that  Israel has always been the aggressor. Since 1948, Israel has  been denounced by the United Nations on all fronts of the  Arab-Israeli conflict. Today's events clearly reveal the  continuation of this premeditated hostile Israeli policy.  Southern Lebanon, for example, is exposed daily to thousands of  Israeli shells from the ground, air, and sometimes the sea.  Palestinian people are daily losing their sons, who are either  killed or wounded by the bullets of the Israeli Army and  settlers.    After luring the Palestinian negotiating side into an  agreement whose clauses are almost entirely based on ways and  means to protect Israeli security and Zionist settlers, Israel  committed, at the hands of its settlers, the ugliest and most  serious massacre of the modern age when it killed over 50  Palestinian citizens in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque while they  were kneeling in prayer to God.    Since 1948, Israeli security has only been a pretext for  aggression and expansion. Israel launched several wars in the  name of this alleged security. It forcibly seized Arab lands  and planted them with settlements. Today, it refuses to return  these lands, even in exchange for peace and despite the fact  that its settlements are insecure. No people in the world would  remain silent over the usurpation of their land. Tomorrow,  Israel might embark on new aggressions and expansions to protect  the security of its settlements.    In the midst of this cycle of violence, which it itself  created and which it sustains, Israel is naturally ignoring the  fact that a real just and comprehensive peace in the region is  the certain and ideal security guarantee.    In his speech to the Palestinian delegation, President  al-Asad revealed that former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Shamir made every possible effort to sabotage the U.S. peace  initiative, but was forced to go to the Madrid conference  because of Syria's positive attitude, although he rejected the  U.S. initiative. Rabin came, and people regarded this as a good  omen. Substantive issues were discussed in the Washington  talks, but no substantial progress was made due to continuing  Israeli prevarication. The question that poses itself is: Is  Rabin implementing Shamir's plan? It is known that Shamir  disclosed he was planning for futile negotiations in Washington  for at least five years, during which he would be able to  Judaize all the occupied Arab territories and confront the world  with an accomplished fact.    Washington's talks have entered their third year, but the  Israeli position continues to be the same, not changing even an  iota. Israel's lies and its rulers' falsehoods are countless.  Israel has no word or pledge to honor. It claims peace and  works against it. It claims a desire for a just settlement to  the conflict in the region, but does all it can to fuel the  conflict. It claims to protect Palestinians, but slaughters  them. We shoud remember that a senior Israeli military  commander refuted all the Rabin government's claims when he told  the inquiry commission formed to investigate the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre that the Israeli Army had clear orders not to  attack Zionist settlers, even if they were shooting at Arabs  with an intent to kill. Thus, the settlers entered the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque and committed the massacre before the very  eyes and ears of the Israeli Army and with the instigation of  the Israeli Government.    Building peace in the Middle East requires sincere  intentions, sincere efforts, and a sincere commitment. The  rulers of Israel possess none. Their intentions are aggressive  and expansionist, their efforts do not go beyond attempts at  delusion, and their commitment is missing. Thus far, they have  not abided by UN principles and resolutions, to which they owe  their existence.    The Arabs, however, will continue the peace process to the  end and until everyone in this world is convinced that Israel  and peace are at odds.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: A field of the highest quality - Colin Amery reviews three further finalists for the FT's architecture prize to be awarded today We are almost there. Tomorrow's FT will publish the name of this year's winner of the Financial Times Architecture Award. He or she will receive Britain's most independent and highly regarded architectural prize at a luncheon in London today. The long period of judging and visiting is over and there will be an opportunity in tomorrow's paper for an assessment of the significance of the award and of the state of architecture in Britain today. Previous articles have looked at five of the eight shortlisted schemes: Stansted Airport and Cranfield Library by Sir Norman Foster and Partners; and Bracken House, Schlumberger Research and Bedfont Lakes (IBM) Business Park by Michael Hopkins and Partners. The remaining three schemes on the shortlist represent three very different types of building. The Queen's Stand at Epsom Racecourse by Richard Horden Associates; the new car park in Chichester by Birds Portchmouth and Russum; and Winchester City offices designed by the Hampshire County Architects department. Epsom clearly needed an elegant new stand that could comfortably house the crowds on Derby day as well as provide a centre for functions and entertainments throughout the year. The choice of Richard Horden and Associates as architects was a brave one. The practice is known for its structural and engineering expertise and its experimental approach to building technology. The client, United Racecourses, has, by choosing a radical approach that is both refined and practical, acquired a new stand that is the acme of contemporary design. The problem of new buildings in England's cathedral cities has been tackled in two very distinctive and different ways in Winchester and Chichester. Both cities have mixed reputations when it comes to new architecture, but it is fair to say that both places take great care about any additions to their ancient fabric. Winchester has a county architects department that is one of the most distinguished in the country. Under the direction of Colin Stansfield-Smith, Hampshire has acquired a high reputation, particularly for its new schools and other educational buildings. The site of the new offices, which are partly occupied by the architects' department, is a typical, tight Winchester street, but one that had been spoiled in earlier days by the erection of a large multi-storey car park. The new offices try to be both modern and vernacular, adopting a traditional pitched roofline but lighting the offices through a completely glazed wall. This gives it the appearance of working in an atrium, except that it has a remarkable view over the city. An agreeable courtyard garden designed around an existing tree is another feature of the scheme, adding to its overall picturesque qualities. The pavement passed close to one side of the new block and this facade has been enlivened by the presence of specially commissioned stained glass windows. Chichester had a problem. The city is keen on traffic management and car parking is a crucial element of any traffic scheme. The decision to build a large, new multi-storey car park on the edge of the city centre but outside the old city walls was a controversial one. Chichester decided to commission a relatively unknown young practice, Birds Portchmouth and Russum, and the resulting building is extraordinary in many ways. The architects decided not to diminish the scale of the whole operation but to make the car park look like a new set of city defences. The length of the building is broken up by the fat, circular staircase towers which are built of perforated brick work. Once you have parked your car the journey from the car park into the city centre takes you on a series of high level pedestrian bridges from which you can view the ancient town. Even in these recessionary years the quality of the best of British architecture is very high. Choosing a winner for the FT award will not be easy.</p>

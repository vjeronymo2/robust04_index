			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Salvador Rico] </F>   [Excerpt] Yesterday, after the Mexican Chamber of Deputies  authorized President Carlos Salinas' trip to Cuba and Colombia,  the deputies agreed to donate one day's salary to buy oil and to  ship it to the Caribbean island.    The proposal for this donation was made by the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI] deputies, and it was immediately  backed by the legislators of the Party of the Democratic  Revolution [PRD]. Regarding this cooperation, deputy Rodolfo  Becerril Straffon said "it is of a symbolic nature, regardless  of how much is collected" and "it implies Mexican congressional  solidarity with the Cuban people."    In yesterday's session, the PRD bench denounced the fact  that  a former president of the National Association of the Processing  Industry, Vicente Gutierrez Camposeco, is probably trying to  secure votes illegally, and for this reason the General Council  of the Federal Electoral Institute has been asked to carry out  an investigation "to establish where its financial resources  come from and whether such financing represents an electoral  crime."    Deputy Jesus Martin del Campo said Gutierrez Camposeco sent  a  personal letter to businessmen urging them to bury their  "political paralysis" and encourage their workers to vote "to  avoid postelection conflicts." Gutierrez also sent the  businessmen a biographical sketch of PRI presidential candidate  Ernesto Zedillo.    Regarding President Salinas' visit request, the PRD bench  said it agrees with the trip, but Deputy Martha Maldonado Zepeda  made the following observation: "We believe it is necessary for  the Mexican Government to change the ritual practiced by four  administrations: a presidential visit to Cuba at the end of the  six-year-term in office, when it cannot have any domestic weight  and is a mere formality."    The PRD bench proposed that Salinas should discuss the need  to fully reincorporate Cuba into the inter-American system as  befits the new dynamics of international relations at the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit to take place in Colombia."    Maldonado also said that "our solidarity must be expressed  with specific and congruent actions, regardless of how small  they might look." Deputy Maldonado noted that not permitting  Cuba's integration to the San Jose Pact does not contribute to  strengthening a modern international relations framework.    The authorization granted by the Chamber of Deputies allows  the chief of state to be absent from the country, as of 10 June,  for five days. It has been reported that in Cuba, Salinas will  meet with Fidel Castro and, in Colombia, he will participate in  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit where the issues of trade and  integration as elements for development in the continent will be  analyzed.    Regarding the presidential trip, the first to take the floor  was Popular Socialist Party [PPS] Deputy Martin Tavira  Uriostegui who referred to the recent visit of U.S. Congressman  Roberto Torricelli to Mexico. He said: "In a cynical fashion,  Mr. Torricelli is demanding that the Mexican people junk their  nationalistic spirit, which is the result of lengthy battles for  liberty and independence. He has come here to see what benefits  he can derive from the country at a moment when we face some  political problems, problems that only we can resolve, with  sovereignty and nationalism."    In expressing the PPS' support for the presidential trip,  Tavira said Salinas' visits are to promote economic, scientific,  technological, and cultural integration with Cuba and Colombia.    In responding to the PRD comment, Deputy Becerril said  Salinas' trip to Cuba "is not a ritual, it is a demonstration of  congruence with and allegiance and fidelity to foreign policy  principles and norms that have for many years prevailed in  Mexico's foreign policy."

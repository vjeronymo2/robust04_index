			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT 13 ALL-STARS WIN 2 DIVISIONAL TITLES  </P> <P> Ventura County produced the best 15-year-old and 18-year-old Little League  teams in Southern California this summer, and the 15-year-olds advanced to  within one opponent of the World Series. It marked the first time that District  13 (Oxnard to Thousand Oaks) has had two state divisional champions in the same  season.  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley 15-year-olds defeated Everett, Wash., 16-13, and Spring  Valley, Nev., 3-2, last week in the four-team Western Regional Senior League  tournament after falling into the losers' bracket with a 14-4 loss to Union  City, Calif. Union City eliminated Conejo Valley, 5-4, Friday and advanced to  the World Series.  </P> <P> Conejo Valley (14-4) won district, sectional and divisional tournament  championships to advance to the regional as the representative of Southern and  Central California.  </P> <P> The District 13 Big League team, composed mostly of players from Hueneme and El  Rio, won seven consecutive games to sail through the sectional and divisional  tournaments before losing two in a row last week at the Western Regionals in  Long Beach.  </P> <P> First baseman Vince Reynoso, right fielder David Frazier, second baseman Adrian  Estrada and left fielder Reyno Ortega were the top hitters for the Big League  team. Julio Gonzalez, Tim Beal and David Soliz combined to do the pitching.  </P> <P> Four pitchers divided the work almost evenly for the Conejo Valley Senior team.  Left-hander Chris Loll (4-1) pitched four complete games and left-hander Adam  West (3-1) pitched two two-hit shutouts and struck out 44 in 32 1/3 innings.  Right-hander Andy Bushart (4-1) led the staff by allowing only 38% of opposing  batters to reach base. Right-hander Jeff Naster (3-1, two saves) led the team  with a 1.62 earned-run average.  </P> <P> Second baseman Ryan Kritscher and West -- who played first base when not  pitching -- were the top Conejo Valley hitters. Kritscher, the leadoff batter,  hit .500 (39 for 78), drove in a team-leading 20 runs, scored 22 runs and  struck out only once in 86 plate appearances. West hit .413 and had eight  doubles and three home runs.  </P> <P> Left fielder Jeff Olin and catcher Cory Bowen each batted .339. Olin led the  team with 11 stolen bases and Bowen had six extra-base hits. Outfielder Trent  Martin batted .313 and shortstop Brian Capella batted .304 with 13 RBIs.  </P> <P> Center fielder Bryan Corey and third baseman Michael Moore helped bolster the  Conejo Valley defense. Joe Liou batted .333 and had six stolen bases, Jim  Colocchio batted .500 in a pinch-hitting role and Craig Arnold and Richard  Murray each batted .333.  </P> <P> Conejo Valley showed a remarkable ability to overcome odds and win close games.  </P> <P> After losing to Northridge, 15-2, in the sectional, the team came back to win  three games, including two in a row over Northridge. Conejo Valley opened  divisional play the following day and defeated San Diego, 8-0. In a  second-round game, Rowland Heights, which had eliminated Conejo Valley two  years ago in the 13-year-old tournament, took a 3-1 lead into the seventh  inning. Conejo Valley rallied to tie the score and eventually won, 4-3, in nine  innings.  </P> <P> In its next game, Conejo Valley turned double plays with the bases loaded in  the sixth and seventh innings of a 3-1 win over South El Monte and advanced to  the championship round. South El Monte defeated Conejo Valley, 7-1, to force a  championship game, which Conejo Valley won, 10-4.  </P> <P> After dropping the regional opener to Union City, Conejo Valley outslugged  Everett, which loaded the bases with none out in the seventh and failed to  score.  </P> <P> Conejo Valley's last victory also included seventh-inning thrills. Spring  Valley advanced a runner to third with one out but a suicide squeeze attempt  failed and West struck out the final batter.  </P></p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Technology: Catalogue grows of IT woes US and European information technology managers share a common headache: trying to find a match between their information systems strategy and their company's business goals. The problem emerged as the central issue in surveys carried out last year by the US consultancy CSC Index among senior information systems executives at 444 US and Canadian organisations and 122 European companies. The surveys reveal a worrying lack of co-ordination between IS departments and corporate planners. In the US, for example, 41 per cent of technology executives said they were insufficiently involved in the planning activities of their organisations. The results of the survey*, now in its fifth year, also show a measure of disenchantment with the results of IT. Using IS for competitive advantage for example, a hot topic throughout the 1980s, has dropped to 11th place on the European managers' list of concerns and 14th on the US list. At the top of the table in the US are bread-and-butter worries like re-engineering business processes through IT, creating an information architecture and utilising data. The Europeans are chiefly concerned about developing an IS strategic plan, and improving the quality of their IS staff. The results confirm surveys which show the difficulty companies are having in extending efficient data processing - accounting and payroll, for example  -to effective IT. Data processing budgets will continue to be shaved as a consequence of the recession and pressure to produce a better return on investment. In Europe, average IS budgets are estimated to grow only 5.2 per cent this year compared with 9.2 per cent in 1991. In the US, comparable figures are 3.5 per cent and 5.3 per cent. *Critical Issues of Information Systems Management for 1992, available free from CSC Index, Butler Cox House, 12 Bloomsbury Square, London WC1A 2LL.</p>

What bill the British Hong Kong Government  adopts now is their own business. He stressed that the  three-tier councils set up by the British Hong Kong authorities  unilaterally would totally cease to exist on 30 June 1997. By  that time, the Chinese Government will reorganize the three-tier  councils in Hong Kong together with Hong Kong citizens in  accordance with the Basic Law and its relevant provisions.    While attending a Spring Festival reception hosted by  XINHUA's Kowloon office, Zhang Junsheng expressed the above  views when asked by a reporter about the Legislative Council  debate on Patten's partial political reform bill.    Talking about the British side claiming to publicize the  contents of the Sino-British talks, Zhang Junsheng reiterated  that the Chinese side would certainly make an appropriate  response if the British side unilaterally did so.    When a reporter asked him about the issue of continued  service by civil servants at the directorate level after 1997,  Zhang Junsheng said: The Basic Law has made definite  stipulations on this issue. Except for secretaries and other  senior officials who should be nominated by the chief executive  of the special administrative region [SAR] and report to the  central government for appointment, all other public servants  may remain in employment.    Zhang Junsheng said: The 180,000 Hong Kong civil servants  have served the Hong Kong people for a long time and have  performed substantial work. They have also rendered  considerable deeds toward the stability and prosperity of Hong  Kong today. Zhang Junsheng hoped that they would remain in  service and continue to serve the SAR government and the Hong  Kong people sincerely after the establishment of the SAR  government. As the government at that time will be the Chinese  people's own government, they should serve it even more  enthusiastically.</p>

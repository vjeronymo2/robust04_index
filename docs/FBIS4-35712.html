			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Amman, 1 Jun (PETRA) -- Mr. Tahir al-Masri,  speaker of the House of Representatives, has said that the house  and the Jordanian people whom we represent are vigorously  opposed to the fighting taking place between the brothers in  Yemen. Jordan, al-Masri said, stands for the unity of the  Yemeni people and their country.    In a letter replying to one from Mr. Anis Hasan Yahya, a  member of the Yemeni House of Representatives, al-Masri noted  that, toward that end, Jordan's political leadership has done  all it could. Jordan, al-Masri's letter went on, will pursue  urgent efforts and consultations with our country's political  leadership, as well as with brother Arabs, and explore avenues  to bring the fighting to an end. Jordan's moves will be based  on its conviction in the cause of the unity of the Yemeni people  and territory, the letter said.    The house speaker had received a message from Mr. Yahya  seeking the Jordanian House of Representatives' good offices to  bring the hostilities to a halt and end the dispute in brotherly  Yemen.

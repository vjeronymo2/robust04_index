			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Mafia don convicted at fourth attempt US PROSECUTORS yesterday achieved the most important Mafia conviction since that of Al Capone in the 1930s, when a jury of 12 brave New Yorkers found John Gotti guilty on murder and other charges. The 51-year-old reputed leader of the biggest organised crime family in America smiled confidently at the jury as it convicted him for having ordered the 1985 assassination of his predecessor as head of New York's Gambino clan. Gotti, known as 'the Teflon Don' because he had escaped conviction in three previous trials, was also found guilty of racketeering, illegal gambling, loan sharking and obstruction of justice. The Armani-clad mobster was convicted after a two-month trial interrupted by three bomb threats, and shouting matches between defence lawyers and the judge. The most dramatic moment in the Brooklyn trial came last month when Mr Salvatore 'Sammy the Bull' Gravano, identified by federal officials as Mr Gotti's second-in-command, described in chilling detail how he and his boss had spent ten months plotting the assassination of Paul Castellano, the former Gambino leader. 'John was the boss. I was the underboss. I helped John run the family,' Mr Gravano explained, having turned state's witness. Also engaging was the courtroom playing of a clandestine tape-recording made by the FBI, in which the voice of Gotti was heard speaking of Castellano and telling his cronies: 'He's gonna die ..' Gotti, who sarcastically blew kisses at the prosecutor during the trial, was also accused of having tampered with jurors in previous trials. Midway through the trial, the foreman of a jury that acquitted Mr Gotti in 1987 was indicted on charges that he accepted Dollars 60,000 from the Gotti organisation to sell his vote and influence the jury.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Major stands firm on Europe and economy MR JOHN MAJOR has signalled his determination to ride out a threatened winter of discontent among Conservative MPs over the economy and Europe. The prime minister, who will spell out his strategy in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry in Glasgow tonight, has told colleagues that his critics have completely underestimated his commitment to the permanent defeat of inflation. The speech, which will include a further reaffirmation of his support for closer European co-operation, coincides with intense discussions among senior ministers on the best strategy to outflank Tory critics of the Maastricht treaty. In spite of growing unease on the Tory back benches about the high level of interest rates needed to preserve sterling's parity in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, Mr Major has flatly rejected suggestions that he will be forced eventually to devalue. The prime minister is convinced that the duration of the recession is linked much more closely to the rapid slowdown in the world economy than to sterling's rate against the D-Mark. He is also pointing to the turmoil that has engulfed Nordic currencies to refute the argument of those arguing that sterling could be insulated from large-scale speculation outside the ERM. Colleagues say that Mr Major is under no illusions that the combination of a row over Maastricht and the depth of the recession threatens a stormy few months on the Tory back benches. But he is said to be as adamant in private as in public that he will not jeopardise his central objective of defeating inflation by yielding to short-term pressures. Senior ministers, meanwhile, are discussing a range of options for the return to the House of Commons of the legislation to implement Maastricht if the French referendum endorses the treaty on September 20. A Yes vote in France is expected to be followed within two weeks by the promised Danish white paper outlining the Copenhagen government's options as a result of the treaty's rejection in a June referendum. Ministers argue that Mr Major will then face strong pressure to hold a 'paving' debate on the principle of Maastricht as soon as the Commons returns from its summer recess in mid October. Party managers are far less certain about whether the government could then risk holding the detailed line-by-line debate that would be necessary to turn the bill into law. Mr Major is said to be anxious to be able to demonstrate to his European colleagues by the time of the Edinburgh summit in December that he can guarantee the passage of the legislation. But with hundreds of amendments already tabled by the Euro-sceptics, party managers estimate that it might take three weeks or so of day-and-night debates to get the legislation through. That is prompting some ministers to urge a further delay until early next year.</p>

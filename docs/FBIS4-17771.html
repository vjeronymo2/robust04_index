			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "In Brief" column: "The </F> Agro-Industrial Complex Resists Zaveryukha"]    [Text] The Russian Government intends to "intensify this  year the reformation of agricultural enterprises and elaborate  procedures for their bankruptcy." This was announced to  INTERFAX by Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha.    According to him, agricultural production in the country's  agrarian sector has fallen 13 percent in the first quarter of  this year, and "it has proved impossible so far" to stabilize  it. More than 30 percent of kolkhozes and sovkhozes,  joint-stock companies, and other collective agricultural  enterprises, according to the vice premier, "are not earning  enough even to pay their employees."    At the same time, A. Zaveryukha noted, any attempt by the  government "not even to recommend but simply approve a  particular approach to reform -- be that the Nizhniy Novgorod or  Moscow option of disaggregation [razukrupneniye]" -- meets with  resistance from agro-industrial complex leaders.</p>

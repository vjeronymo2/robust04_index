			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Art collection sale blocked THE National Heritage Department has blocked Treasury approaches about the possibility of selling off the government's art collection. The works hang in ministries and British embassies. 'There was an initial exchange of letters,' the heritage department said. 'But there are no plans'.

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Warm welcome for Toyota Motor Credit Corp Y50bn issue Primary activity was subdued and most investors remained on the sidelines as the markets continued their tense vigil for the US Federal Reserve's next monetary tightening move. Only the Euroyen sector saw a spurt of activity, prompted by the return of Japanese investors from last week's Golden Week holiday and arbitrage opportunities. The largest of the day's four new issues, Y50bn of 3 1/2 per cent bonds due September 1997 for triple-A rated Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, received a positive market response. Most traders said the bulk of the deal would likely be placed in Japan, but lead manager Merrill Lynch also reported good demand from non-Japanese accounts. The issue was deemed to be generously priced. 'They paid due respect to current difficult market conditions,' said one trader. Other yen issues included Y15bn of four-year bonds for De Nationale Investeringsbank via IBJ International, Y10bn of two-year paper for the Urban Mortgage Bank of Sweden via Nomura, and Y10bn of three-year bonds for Sony Capital Corporation via IBJ. In the French franc sector, Credit Local de France, the triple-A rated French municipal financing agency, issued FFr1bn of 7 1/4 per cent nine-year bonds via Caisse des Depots et Consignations and UBS France, which took about three-quarters of the issue. According to UBS, the deal saw strong demand from French institutional investors. Yielding 21 basis points over the 99.59 re-offer price, the issue was deemed to be fairly priced. Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein decided to tap recent retail demand for short-dated dollar paper by issuing Dollars 200m of two-year bonds. Lead manager Lehman Brothers reported good demand from Benelux and Swiss retail investors attracted by the 6 3/8 per cent coupon and the short maturity, but other dealers said the issue would be slow to place amid uncertain market conditions. The sterling sector today is expecting a Pounds 400m bond issue for Lloyd's Bank, split into a 15-year fixed-rate tranche and a floating-rate tranche. Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and S. G. Warburg are tipped as joint leads. Otherwise, primary activity is expected to remain thin this week, overshadowed by nervousness regarding US interest rates and Thursday's Ascension holiday in most parts of Europe. Caja de Madrid, Spain's second-largest savings bank, today is to sign a Dollars 1bn debt programme, arranger Morgan Stanley said. The flexible multi-currency facility will allow Caja de Madrid to issue both public transactions in the Euromarkets as well as small private placements. The dealer group will include Caja de Madrid, Chase Investment Bank, Citibank, First Chicago, Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, SBC and UBS.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, Chinese  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said here  this afternoon that China is ready to show flexibility on some  issues concerning restoration of China's signatory party status  in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    She made the remarks when meeting with Assistant Trade  Representative for GATT Affairs Dorothy Dwoskin from the United  States, who led a delegation here to attend the eighth round of  Sino-U.S. talks on China's resumption of its GATT membership.    During the meeting with the U.S. delegation following the  end  of the two-day talks, Wu said that China has taken a series of  major steps in reforming its economic and trade system, adding  that China has made active efforts in its talks with the U.S.    "We are ready to show flexibility on some issues of concern  by signatory parties," she said. However, she added, China  sticks to the principle of balance between rights and  obligations required of her before being allowed to re-enter  GATT.    "It is impossible for us to accept excessive demands well  above the level of China's economic development," she said.    Dwoskin expressed appreciation for the measures China has  taken in reforming its economic and trade system, especially in  reforming its foreign exchange system.    She also reiterated the firm support on the U.S. side for  the  resumption of China's signatory party status in GATT, pointing  out that China should fully observe the obligations as a member  of a World Trade Organization (WTO).    In the eighth round of the talks, both delegations agreed  that negotiations on China's re-entry into GATT is multi-lateral  work which demands efforts from all GATT members.    They held that this round of negotiations has made full  preparation and provided a sound basis for the 16th meeting of  the GATT working party on China, which is scheduled to open in  Geneva in March, to achieve constructive results.    This is the first round of talks between the two countries  on  the issue after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT  talks.    The two delegations exchanged in-depth views on a wide range  of specific issues concerning China's re-entry into GATT.</p>

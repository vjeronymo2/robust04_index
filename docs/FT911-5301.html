			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: Westinghouse on target with 53% profit plunge WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the diversified US technology group, has reported a 53 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, in line with company forecasts. The company recently announced a restructuring, particularly of its troubled financial services subsidiary. In this area, it plans to sell or liquidate about Dollars 3bn in under-performing assets over the next few years. Net income for the three months ended March 31 was Dollars 98m, or 34 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.78bn, against profits of Dollars 210m, or 71 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.86bn in the 1990 first quarter. Mr Paul Lego, chairman, said the company expected economic conditions to improve, particularly in the second half. Operating profits in the first quarter were Dollars 157m, giving an operating margin of 5.7 per cent, against Dollars 294m and a 10.3 per cent margin in the same period last year. The company's broadcasting business had substantially lower operating profits. Westinghouse blamed this on the recession and the effect of the Gulf war on advertising. Revenues were essentially flat. Recession also hurt operating profits at Westinghouse's Electronic Systems unit, particularly in the non-defence area. The deterioration was attributed to start-up costs. The company's financial services also had worse operating profits for the quarter, thanks to a lack of gains from the sale of equity interest in financing transactions, and significantly higher levels of non-earning receivables. Westinghouse's main financial services subsidiary, Westinghouse Credit, had net income of Dollars 21.2m on revenues of Dollars 255.4m, against Dollars 42m on revenues of Dollars 282.8m last time. Westinghouse, along with the rest of the US financial services industry, has been hit by sharp erosion in property, junk bonds and highly-leveraged companies. The company's power generation business, which turned in a strong fourth quarter, had substantially lower operating profits. The company attributed these to non-recurring licensee income in the 1990 first quarter.</p>

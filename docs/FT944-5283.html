			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Budapest mayor savours political spotlight: Europe's changing cities - Virginia Marsh analyses the transformation of Hungary's capital The only thing Budapest mayor Gabor Demszky was worried about as his city prepared for today's 53-nation European security summit was the traffic. And he should know. One of his jobs during the communist era when he was banned from practising law was a taxi driver in the capital, central Europe's largest metropolis. As it happened, main roads were blocked off last night and guarded by several thousand extra police officers bussed in from the countryside. Two hundred new Mercedes limousines, ordered for the occasion, were lined up to whisk heads of governments, foreign ministers and their many attendants into the city centre. 'We're closing schools and telling everyone to stay at home or to use public transport,' said Mr Demszky. 'There'll be no problems if there are no traffic jams,' he said. A doctor of law, Mr Demszky drove taxis when he was not allowed to practise as a lawyer because he had a police record for organising a political demonstration at university in the days of the Soviet domination of eastern Europe. Later, as a founder and leader of Hungary's underground publishing movement, he become one of the country's most prominent - and persecuted - dissidents. Now consistently rated as one of Hungary's most popular leaders, the 42-year-old mayor looks set to be re-elected for another four years in next Sunday's local elections. 'I was the organiser behind the underground movement,' he said. 'The others liked to speak and write but I was the one responsible for keeping the whole thing moving and alive. This job is the same.' He said one of his most difficult tasks was balancing the rapidly changing and differing needs of the city's more than 2m inhabitants as the country moved towards a market economy. His electorate includes both the newly rich entrepreneurial classes who live in mansions perched high above the Danube in the hills of Buda as well as slum-dwellers living on the other side of the river in Pest whose flat suburbs stretch for miles towards the puszta, the Great Plain. 'It's incredible how rich some people have become in the last five years,' he said. 'You just have to count the cars coming across the bridges from Buda in the morning. There are more Mercedes 600s in this town than in Vienna.' There are also more Trabants. The rattling and spluttering two stroke vehicles, made in the former East Germany, account for a fifth of the city's 550,000 cars. The mayor, a dedicated environmentalist, plans to change this. His city council is offering up to three years of bus passes for those willing to consign their Trabant to a scrap heap. Last year, more than 2,000 Trabant owners obliged. The collapse of heavy industry in the last five years and a shift to trade and commerce, Budapest's traditional mainstays, have also helped cut pollution that has blackened the facades of the capital's otherwise elegant boulevards. The mayor estimates the number employed in the financial services sector will more than double to 200,000 in three years, leaving few employed in heavy industry. Many new jobs are being created by multinational companies using Budapest as a base for expansion into eastern Europe. 'Vienna was the regional base for many companies in the communist-era but we're the last frontier to eastern markets now,' he says. Rivalry with Vienna, some 300km up the Danube, is nothing new. Much of the city was built in Hungary's golden era after the country was freed from direct Austrian rule in 1867. Hungary's new kings combined the ancient cities of Obuda, Buda and Pest to form Budapest in 1872 and, in the years up to the First World War, set about creating a city to rival the Austrian capital, according to Mr Andras Vegh, historian at the City Museum. 'Many of the city's greatest landmarks - the tower on the Matthias church, St Stephen's Basilica and the parliament - were built during this time when a main aim was to be able to compare Budapest with Vienna and compete with the Austrians,' he said. These days, however, Mr Demszky prefers to compare modern Budapest with New York which he chose as the capital's twin city. He said the two cities shared the same cosmopolitan, fast-moving atmosphere: 'It's not surprising. New York was built by emigrants from this country and this (Austro-Hungarian) monarchy,' he said. 'You feel the same central European and Jewish culture and see the same architecture as you do in Budapest. The city has its own engine, its own lines of development. 'This will push it forward,' he said, 'regardless of what happens elsewhere in the country.'</p>

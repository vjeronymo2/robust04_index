			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku May 27 TASS -- One should learn lessons from  the history in order not to repeat the mistakes which resulted  in the Azeri loss of independence 74 years ago, Azeri President  Geydar Aliyev told a ceremonious meeting on the occasion of the  independence day here today. The national holiday will be  marked on May 28.    In the opinion of the Azeri state head, there is much in  common between today and a period from 1918 through 1920, the  time of the first Azeri Democratic Republic. "Same as in  1918-1920, Azerbaijan is under powerful pressure of outer  forces, its territory has been subjected to an aggression,  complicated political processes are underway to weaken  statehood," said Aliyev.    Many events of the Azeri history, including the Soviet  period, should have an objective estimation, said the president.  In his opinion, the Soviet period was a "significant historical  time for Azerbaijan which did not lose its statehood being part  of the Soviet Union and losing its independence". The republic  managed to create a huge economic, cultural, social and  intellectual potential.    The current path taken by Azerbaijan aims to build an  independent, democratic and law-governed state to guarantee all  rights and freedoms of citizens, their equality regardless  nationality or religion, said Aliyev. The republic remains  adherent to the market reforms which aim to ensure high living  standards of the population.    In the foreign political sphere Azerbaijan stands for equal  mutually beneficial relations with all states.    Speaking of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, the president  stressed that Azerbaijan wants a peaceful settlement within the  framework of international organizations and in cooperation with  the leading nations, including Russia.    At the same time, Azeri conditions remain unchanged --  provision of territorial integrity and inviolability of Azeri  borders, liberation of all the occupied lands of Azerbaijan, and  the return of refugees to places of their permanent residence.  The problem can be solved on condition of observation of these  fundamental principles.    The president stressed the intention to continue the peace  talks, but said that the national army should be ready to  protect the Azeri borders and territory.</p>

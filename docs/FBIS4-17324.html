			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The Federation Council has  begun to discuss the draft treaty on civic concord. Previously  President Yeltsin sent a note to Vladimir Shumeyko, which  expressed hope that the Federation Council would manage to  prepare the text of the treaty for signing. Yeltsin appealed to  "the wisdom of deputies and their understanding of common  responsibility before Russian citizens."    Academician Boris Topornin, official representative of the  Russian president and co-chairman of the public chamber, told  the deputies that the draft treaty was the result of collective  work and was approved by the majority of members of the working  group, which prepared it. "The provisions, that contradict each  other, were not included in the text, because it is going to be  a document of concord," he explained.    Topornin stressed that the country cannot overcome the  economic crisis without political stability. Authors of the  draft treaty wanted it to be "neither a party, or group  document, but a document reflecting common interests." The  treaty will neither amend nor replace the Constitution and other  legal acts.    According to Topornin, the item on responsibility for the  non- fulfilment of the treaty was removed from the draft  document, because "it cannot be based on enforcement and  sanctions... Public control and the attitude of the population  to it are the most reliable guarantee of its fulfilment,"  Topornin said.</p>

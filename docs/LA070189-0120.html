			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WARRANTS ISSUED FOR 4 SUSPECTS IN UCI HIGH-TECH THEFTS  </P> <P> Arrest warrants were issued Friday for four current or former UC Irvine  students who are suspected of breaking into dozens of university offices and  stealing $120,000 in computer and electronic equipment through underground  tunnels that link campus buildings.  </P> <P> The suspects, who are believed to have operated as a ring, were traced through  witnesses who saw computers and other apparently stolen items in the suspects'  dorm rooms or apartments, and through classified ads offering computers for  sale in Orange County, Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, according to  Bruce Patterson, a district attorney supervising deputy.  </P> <P> One suspect has agreed through his attorney to surrender, Patterson said. Two  others are rumored to have fled to Canada, and police have information on the  whereabouts of the fourth, he said.  </P> <P> The suspects are Paul Wesley Granados, 21, of San Jose and Henry Theodore Yeh,  21, of Ridgecrest, both engineering students; Eric Howard Shay, 20, of La  Crescenta, a social ecology major, and Robert Fan, 20, of Cerritos, a former  UCI student. All four are charged with four counts of burglary, one count of  grand theft and one count of receiving stolen property.  </P> <P> "They would go through the tunnels underneath campus and surface in different  buildings," Patterson alleged Friday, adding, "Then they would go into unlocked  offices or use keys to go into locked areas and steal computer equipment and  other items of value."  </P> <P> The warrants follow an investigation by university police and the district  attorney's office. Patterson said the continuing investigation may lead to  charges against additional suspects who may have aided the four in selling  stolen goods.  </P> <P> The burglars, who struck mainly during holiday breaks and over long weekends,  entered and escaped through a network of 10-foot-wide utility tunnels, which  provide access for repair and maintenance of electrical, cooling and other  systems, investigators allege. Police found an empty beer can propping open a  door leading to the underground tunnel system on Dec. 27, when workers  discovered that nearly $20,000 worth of equipment had been stolen from the  Social Sciences Tower over the Christmas weekend.  </P> <P> University Police Lt. William Miller described the thieves as "very bright  people" who consistently stole the most expensive computer equipment, often  passing over less-marketable brands or components.  </P> <P> The thefts, which occurred on 14 occasions beginning in February, 1988, in the  Social Sciences Tower, Adminstration Hall and the Graduate School of  Management, ended after an April news story about the ring. The suspects are  believed to have left the Irvine area a short time later, Patterson said.  </P> <P> Those whose offices were burglarized included Dennis Aigner, dean of the  Graduate School of Business Management; Dennis Galligani, assistant vice  chancellor of academic affairs, and Kathleen Kunz, finance director for the  Office of University Advancement.  </P> <P> In addition to the stolen computers, which have not been recovered, valuable  research data also was stolen and may never be replaced, investigators said. At  the social sciences word-processing center, where thieves struck in May, 1988,  and again last Thanksgiving, several computers and duplicate discs stored in  the same room were taken. Professors and researchers who reported thefts also  complained that they had lost months of work and, in some cases, one-of-a-kind  computer files.  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sharp rise at Bank Austria in first half BANK Austria, Austria's largest bank, has reported a sharp improvement in earnings in the first half and forecast a 26 per cent rise in full-year pre-tax profits to Sch4.3bn (Dollars 358m). Improved interest margins, active securities markets and rationalisation measures following the 1991 merger which created the bank, contributed to a 51 per cent jump in first-half pre-tax profits to Sch2.01bn. Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, the chief executive, said the bank expected for the second half 'a basic continuation of the positive tendencies in the first half'. The bank announced that it planned to launch an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme on its preferred shares in the autumn. Last year, it started ADRs on its ordinary shares. A London listing was postponed earlier this year because of the bank's poor 1992 results. It would be considered next spring at the earliest, the bank said. In the first half, net interest income grew 11.6 per cent to Sch5.8bn due largely to the unwinding of an inverted yield curve during the period. The bank said lending business was sluggish, and loans outstanding fell 0.8 per cent to Sch349.2bn. Commission income was flat at Sch1.23bn. Partial operating profit, which excludes securities trading for the bank's own account, soared 41 per cent to Sch1.15bn. The bank cautioned that this growth rate figure, like that of pre-tax profit, was flattered by the depressed banking conditions in the first half of last year. Total assets grew 3.3 per cent to Sch562.8bn. The bank said its rationalisation programme was on schedule. The number of employees has been cut to 9,350 from 9,924, since the merger, and 18 of a planned 86 branch mergers completed. Bank Austria is 51 per cent owned by two institutions controlled by the city of Vienna.</p>

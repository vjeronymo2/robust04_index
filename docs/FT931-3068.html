			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Observer: Flying in the fast lane Would Norman Lamont count as an economic indicator the number of tycoons rummaging around in Lord Hanson's executive toy locker? He might be pleased to hear from Colin Whicher, one of Lord Hanson's retainers, that Hanson Air has just sold its first whirlybird of 1993. 'We are doing well if we sell 10 helicopters and 10 aeroplanes a year,' says Whicher, who reports a notable pick-up in interest in executive flying machines. He is particularly proud of his latest sales coup - a state-of-the-art flying bird which has no tail rotor, hence its name, Notar. It is so modern that it has not even been certified in the UK and is aimed at the new breed of environmentally-conscious entrepreneur who wants to land anywhere without flattening everything around. True, it may guzzle Pounds 200 of gas an hour, but it's much quieter than other 'copters and is also said to be safer - which may help keep down down the life insurance premiums. However, when it comes to revolutionary executive toys, the Dollars 755,000 Notar - bought by racing car-owner David Richards - is pretty small beer. Last month Hanson Air sold its first Beech Starship - a futuristic aircraft with its propellers back to front - to Tom Walkinshaw, another racing car junkie. Indeed, when it comes to being first with new-fangled machines, competition in the air seems to be almost as fierce as on the race-track. However, given that Walkinshaw's craft goes almost twice as fast as Richards' chopper, and costs more than six times as much, there is little doubt who has won the latest contest to impress. 'Dave has never been in Tom's league,' said one old racing driver yesterday.</p>

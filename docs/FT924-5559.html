			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Deficit in motor trade widens THE UK motor industry trade balance deteriorated sharply in the third quarter with the deficit increasing by 154 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn from Pounds 471m in the same period a year before. The deficit in cars, commercial vehicles and automotive parts and accessories in the first nine months rose by 131 per cent to Pounds 2.56bn, more than double the deficit for the whole of last year. The motor industry alone accounted for more than a third of the total UK visible trade deficit of Pounds 3.25bn in the third quarter. The performance has worsened in the face of faltering exports of automotive products and a rapid rise in the value of imports. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned that 'it may be some time yet' before the motor industry trade balance benefited from the devaluation of sterling. The value of automotive imports continued to rise with a jump of 22 per cent in the third quarter. The SMMT warned yesterday that 'stocks of imported cars must already be at relatively high levels and any further growth could result in serious stock problems in coming months.'  ---------------------------------------------------------                  UK MOTOR TRADE (Pounds m)                     January-September  ---------------------------------------------------------                          Exports  ---------------------------------------------------------                                     1992       1991  --------------------------------------------------------- Cars                               2,681      2,841 Comm. vehicles                       699        612 Parts and accessories              3,646      3,438 Others*                              859        942  --------------------------------------------------------- Imports  --------------------------------------------------------- Cars                               5,121      4,322 Comm. vehicles                       586        442 Parts and accessories              4,339      3,817 Others*                              404        361  ---------------------------------------------------------                        Trade balance  --------------------------------------------------------- Cars                              -2,440     -1,481 Comm. vehicles                      +113       +170 Parts and accessories               -693       -379 Others*                             +455       +581  --------------------------------------------------------- Total balance                     -2,565     -1,109  --------------------------------------------------------- *Others includes agricultural tractors, dumpers, trailers, caravans, industrial works trucks and freight containers.  --------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and Customs and Excise  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Paprika banned in poisoning scandal The Hungarian government yesterday banned the sale of paprika in the country and ordered all retailers and wholesalers to make their paprika stocks available for inspection. The move follows widespread contamination with lead oxide of the tangy spice Hungarians use to flavour and colour their food. The ban is expected to last for 7-10 days, the government said. More than 40 people have had hospital treatment for poisoning. The police believe some vendors have been using red pigment containing high quantities of lead oxide to enhance the colour of low quality paprika or paprika substitutes. The police said yesterday they were holding 18 people in connection with the case. Ms Erzsebet Schreiber, deputy head of the food product department at the national quality control institute said: 'This is the worst case of food contamination we know of in Hungary. 'The paint has been mixed with poor quality paprika or other paprika substitutes and sold as the real thing,' she said. Traces of the toxic substance had been found in around 15 per cent of paprika sold in unsealed, unmarked containers which the institute has tested. Hungary produces about 10,000 tonnes a year of paprika, which is made from dried red peppers. Around 55 per cent is exported, accounting for up to 6 per cent of world production. The government stressed that toxic substances had not been found in foods due for export. Mr Zoltan Bertha, head of the red pepper growers association, blamed the paprika poisoning on 'adventurers' who entered the industry in the hope of quick profits after the state monopoly was dismantled in 1991. Vendors fear the bad publicity from the poisoning would affect sales and exports for years to come. 'I sell mainly to tourists,' one vendor said, pointing to a basket of fancily packaged paprika costing Ft2,200 (Pounds 12.90) per kilo. 'This scandal could hurt our national image. Paprika is our symbol. It's like hamburgers to Americans and what would America be if hamburgers were not on sale?'</p>

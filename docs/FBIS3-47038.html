			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Kagehide Kaku, director of the Research </F> Statistics Bureau, Bank of Japan (BOJ), by unidentified KINYU  ZAISEI JIJO reporter; place and date not given: "A Period of  Adjustment to Asset Deflation That Has Resulted From the High  Yen Burden; Development of a Horizontal Division of Labor and  `Hollowing Out'"]    [Text] In addition to the unforeseen cold summer and  long rains and the high yen in the original forecasts, the fact  that the impact of asset deflation exceeded everyone's  expectations is the reason a business recovery in the latter  half of the fiscal year is in jeopardy. Even though adjustments  in inventories appear finally complete, we cannot ascertain the  period of recovery at present. Although in response domestically  to the high yen, business continues to shift production  overseas, the issue is one of creating new production and a  demand for replacement. Although fiscal and financial policies  have not changed, they have a truly limited effect, given asset  deflation. The primary criterion for a business recovery is to  reverse the mindset of business and households.  <H5>  Higher Than Anticipated Asset Deflation </H5>   [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Low growth in the last fiscal year that  has continued into this one is certainly evident. What is the  biggest factor putting in jeopardy the business recovery  originally forecast for the latter half of the year?    [Kaku] Although the possibility of a latter-half recovery is  not entirely out of the question, there is considerable risk  that it will be forestalled.    I can point to two reasons. The first is an unforeseen  factor  which this spring added pressure to the slump and continued into  summer. These were the external factors of a cold summer and  long rains as well as a stricter policy vis-a-vis China, but  even more than this has been the enormous impact of the high yen.    However, this is not all. There is also the possibility that  the impact of asset deflation has exceeded expectations; in  other words, we have miscalculated the location of the recovery  launch pad.    A symbolic example is domestic sales of passenger cars which  rose from January through March but which then fell. Of course,  we knew when the January through March numbers became clear that  they were artificial and had been brought on by unusual sales  efforts by dealers and that the April through June figures would  be different. The issue then is the degree to which the reaction  to the downturn exceeded expectations, ran counter to then  current perceptions, and made clear later that passenger car  sales were no longer "carved in stone."    [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] With capital investment and individual  consumption in the doldrums, to what extent do you see inventory  adjustments continuing?    [Kaku] Although inventory adjustments have been sweeping,  each progressed in its own way. Inventory adjustments in unit  housing occurred the quickest, being completed by the end of the  year before last. Although sales of condominium apartments have  been the slowest, inventory adjustments in this category appear  to have been completed about the beginning of this year.    On the other hand, the most prolonged adjustment seems to  involve office buildings. Because there will still be building  starts, recovery prospects are not established, given that  demand continues to be soft.    Within this category is the inventory of durable goods and  business equipment. I have the impression that these adjustments  have all progressed satisfactorily. But, I don't know the clear  turning point at which inventory adjustments will have  progressed far enough. Judging by past patterns, I would not  find it strange to learn we had already reached that turning  point, but I couldn't specify when.    [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] It seems appropriate to believe that  there are factors external to the business environment which are  lengthening the business slump.    [Kaku] This is inconceivable in attacking the high yen.  Still, the high yen should not be thought of as a sudden  disaster. Rather, the Japanese economy should be thought of as  surfacing an issue which it had kept contained until now. The  Japanese economy shouldered the issue of converting to growth in  the form of sustained leadership in domestic demand at the time  of the high yen slump following the Plaza Accord in 1985. But,  because the illusion was that there was expansion in domestic  demand which perpetuated the bubble economy following that, the  resolution of the issue was lost sight of.    This issue is now once again being pointed to. Moreover,  unfortunately, the economy is having to bear the heavy burden of  cleaning up of asset deflation. Therefore, we must once again  respond to this issue but this time with a greater handicap than  that experienced following the 1985 Plaza Accord.    [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] What is the reason for the large size of  the high yen impact this time?    [Kaku] The timing of its occurrence is utterly different  from  the last time (about 1985). Although there were dark clouds on  the horizon last time, this time the high yen arrived following  a business recession that had lasted over two years. The  strikingly lower earnings ratio compared to other industries of  electronics and automobiles, the two strongest export  industries, is the direct result of the high yen.    Additionally, in some industries the superior competitive  strength of Japanese products in terms of quality, not to  mention price, continues to be driven downward. For example,  this becomes strikingly apparent for Japanese cars destined for  the U.S. market when compared to U.S. cars. It is not as simple  as blaming high prices as in the prior high yen period. That  course is a dead end.    Still, overemphasizing the view that we have fallen victim  to  the high yen which is undermining the Japanese economy and that  the high yen exceeds the true strength of the Japanese economy  is incorrect. Such thinking is somehow full of contradictions.  Supposing such a high yen, not only would exports almost totally  disappear but foreign exchange would revert to a cheap yen in  accordance with market principles. It is impossible for the high  yen to continue endlessly.    Eventually, a yen which has gone too high will commonly be  corrected based on market cognizance. But, if we look at the  market over time and the type of response we expect to be there,  such judgments are not always accurate. Because from time to  time there are such opinions regarding the market, the fear is  that the market will temporarily go too far. Therefore, there is  nothing to say that the current level is absolutely rational.  <H5>  The True Nature of the High Yen </H5>   [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Business in reality is taking great  pains  in response to the high yen.    [Kaku] The response of business is not particularly a  changed  methodology, but merely an aggregation of basic efforts to  switch to internal demand, stop exports, or shift to new and  rationalized products.    The true issue with the high yen is that "Japanese wages  have  risen in terms of the U.S. dollar." The plusses and minuses of  the high yen definitely stem from this. An advantage of the high  yen is that purchasing power overseas increases because the  value of the Japanese labor force is highly rated. If domestic  margins were restored, imported goods could be bought cheaply,  exclusive of overseas travel. On the other hand, one  disadvantage is that when we think of the labor force as a cost,  the cost of Japanese products goes up.    It makes sense that business not make use of things that are  high priced. Basic policy is exhaustive on this point.  Consequently, although business is moving the production base  overseas or is importing parts, which is same as importing a  labor force, the issue is whether or not this is inviting a  withering of the domestic economy.    [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Is there fear of a "hollowing out of  production?"    [Kaku] I suspect there is such fear. Nonetheless, although  we  hear such ugly phrases as the "hollowing out of production,"  this is advancing the horizontal division of labor, to put it  another way. This is the natural outcome of the high yen, or to  put it another way, we have the high yen because Japan has not  developed a full response to this matter. The issue is whether  to shift production overseas on a scale and with the speed to  meet changing demands or to change industries to compensate for  this domestically. It is reckless to try to restrain the  evolution of "hollowing out" or the horizontal division of  labor, which is altogether a different discussion.    [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] What do you think about the relationship  between the high yen and domestic employment?    [Kaku] With unemployment rapidly increasing, this in reality  is not now the issue. The growth rate in the number of employed  is dropping but it is still growing. The issue is the fear that  employment will emerge as a major topic in the near future.    Although in the long-term employment judgments made by  business depend on how they forecast demand, that forecast  itself is influenced just the same if stagnation in real demand  drags out. In this sense, while the employment issue is  axiomatic, trends in business conditions are the drivers.    In addition to our basic approach, we now must think anew  the  process that translates changes in the production structure and  the issue of what to do about the Japanese employment system,  which signifies lifetime employment. This has actually changed a  bit. For example, the percentage of part-time employment has  steadily increased. Because such changes in the employment  situation will have to move forward anew from this point on, it  may be reckless to consider at what pace and in what form.  <H5>  There Is No Clear Answer </H5>   [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Despite the lowest interest rates in  history, demand is not growing. What do you think about the  effectiveness of our financial policy?    [Kaku] To make the impact of deregulation clear, one needs  to  make comparisons with a "period when the discount was not  lowered." Doing this is appropriate and gets us thoroughly  comfortable with business earnings. Furthermore, although the  lowering of interest rates is not a direct objective, the result  should be a boost in stock prices. Although when actual  investment activity is not clearly evident, we conclude that  "financial policy is ineffective," but then looking at it in  retrospect we find it was too effective. It is all the more  deeply colored this way because the factor of asset deflation is  involved this time.    If we get away from the general effects of financial policy  and confine ourselves to the impact of the official discount  rate, we find significant changes. Although we formerly had  interest rates that were changed in accordance with the system  or customary practice when the regulated official discount rate  moved, now such interest rates are almost gone. In the final  analysis, unlike the official discount rate before, the idea of  a "regulated interest axis" has been almost totally lost,  indicating a major policy judgment. In the final analysis, the  effect of the announcement in the broad sense has been steadily  purified. In this sense, even though the position of the  official discount rate will change as deregulation of interest  rates progresses, this is not to say that the position of  financial policy or its effectiveness has changed.    [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] More than 20 trillion yen in public debt  has been issued since last year. However, this still is not  linked to private consumption. How about the effectiveness of  public debt?    [Kaku] The extent of the "effectiveness of government fiscal  policy" is calculated according to the size of the multiplier.  What determines this are the expenditure trends of business and  households. In the final analysis, the issue is whether the  economy itself which receives money expended through fiscal  policy immediately reuses it.    Now, because the overall outlook is bad, expenditure trends  have dropped. For example, if you do construction, you will  receive payment for it. However, if general construction does  not buy new construction equipment with the construction fees it  has received, or, if the laborers hired to do the construction  work do not spend the wages they receive, the effectiveness of  expanded government financing to boost business will be less  effective.    [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] How can the disposition to spend be  encouraged?    [Kaku] There is no clear answer. The disposition to spend is  decided by the psychology of the economic entity. There is no  good scheme for changing that psychology.    [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Are not deregulation and restoration of  a  high yen margin effective?    [Kaku] Deregulation will have an impact if we do it  earnestly. On the other hand, restoration of the high yen margin  is a weird phrase. The advantage of the high yen is that the yen  base by which payment is made is lowered when importing and this  occurs instantly. The problem is what this reverts to. Margin  restoration is chiefly talk of changing that distribution. As  soon as there is a way to change the distribution, the receiving  economic entity may use this money. However, it makes no sense  if it is not used. Therefore, if we do restore margins, we  cannot say in general it will boost the economy.  <H5>  Conditions for a Favorable Turn of Mind </H5>   [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Tax reform which would combine a  decrease  in the income tax with an increase in the consumption tax has  surfaced. How do you see the impact of this on the business  recovery?    [Kaku] It is very, very difficult. If a decrease in the  income tax and an increase in the consumption tax had no impact  on revenue, that is, if they were in revenue-neutral form, and  they were enacted at the same time, I think that, whatever you  say, they would have a negative impact on business conditions.    Although decreasing the income tax would increase income, it  is best to use that money or to save it. A reduction in the  income tax itself ought to be neutral regarding consumption  tendencies. I think that if income taxes were definitely reduced  there would be more spending because take-home pay would  increase. But there would be no incentive to raise or lower the  portion of the take-home pay used for consumption.    For example, say one's income is 100 yen and the income tax  rate is 20, then his net income is 80 yen. If he sets his  consumption rate in this case at 50 percent, then he would save  40 yen and spend 40. Now, were we to reduce the income tax rate  to 10 percent, the net take home pay would be 90 yen. However,  with a fixed consumption rate, only 45 yen would then be used  for consumption. With the first 40 yen in consumption becoming  45, the increase in consumption would increase only because net  pay increased. There would be no change in consumption tendency.    However, because the consumption tax depends on consumption,  but clearly works as a restraint on consumption, in the final  analysis, we must conclude that it works against consumption.  Were we to enact a decrease in the income tax and an increase in  the consumption tax in revenue-neutral form, I believe it would  have a deflationary impact.    If we want this to have a positive impact on business  conditions, we must put a bridge between tax decreases and  increases. However, should a gap open up between the two, it  would be natural for a deficit to develop between the two and  therefore have a major impact on the fiscal balance. Therefore,  there are definite tradeoffs in the case of tax increases versus  decreases between fiscal balance and their impact on improving  business conditions. This is a major issue.    Even having said this, I know of no other way to do it.  Meanwhile, at some point we must tackle tax reform that will  have a directly proportional correction unrelated to business  conditions. Nonetheless, it is only natural that a perception  emerge linking these two things.    [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] The Japanese economy once experienced a  high rate of economic growth, even reaching 10 percent.  Following that, having survived the oil shock, we entered a  period of stable growth at 4-5 percent. Do you not sense that we  have now entered a third stage, which is a low rate of growth?    [Kaku] I don't know. Everyone agrees that a 5-percent  average  growth rate for the four-year period we are calling the "Heisei  economy" is extraordinarily high. The growth rate for the period  following the oil shock and preceding the "Heisei economy" did  not achieve 5 percent. Although one can make various  calculations regarding the growth rate, I don't think they  reflect the true earnings. I think a larger issue is the fact  that various business people are not increasing their demand. If  everyone thinks this way, the result will be a lower growth  rate. The major issue is how one should go about changing this  thinking. It makes almost no sense to argue that the growth rate  is such and such based on some abstract model.</p>

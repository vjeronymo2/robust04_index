			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Blue Arrow jury convicts four: Year-long Pounds 35m trial is most expensive in UK criminal history THE marathon Blue Arrow fraud trial ended yesterday with four prominent City of London financial advisers being convicted at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to defraud over their handling of the 1987 rights issue for the employment agency. A year and four days after the trial began, the jury returned guilty verdicts against Mr Jonathan Cohen, Mr David Reed, Mr Nicholas Wells, all former executives with County NatWest, the merchant banking subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, and Mr Martin Gibbs, a former director of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities. All the verdicts were unanimous. A not guilty verdict was returned against the fifth remaining defendant, Mr Christopher Stainforth, a former corporate financier with UBS P&amp;D. The four found guilty were allowed home on bail and will return to court on Monday for sentencing. It is considered certain that solicitors will lodge appeals on behalf of all four after sentencing. After his acquittal, Mr Stainforth merely said he was 'pleased' by the jury's verdict in his case. Neither NatWest nor UBS P&amp;D, which have been paying the defendants' legal fees, made any comment. The verdicts will be seen as partial consolation for the Serious Fraud Office which brought the prosecution. They came at the end of week which, following the collapse of the second Guinness trial, has seen unprecedented questioning of the way the SFO and regulators tackle large fraud cases. The Blue Arrow trial, however, will be regarded as only a mixed success for the SFO. Of the 10 defendants originally standing trial, six have now been acquitted. Two individuals and all three corporate defendants were acquitted on the instruction of the judge earlier in the trial. The length of the trial and its cost - at some Pounds 35m it was the most expensive trial in UK criminal history - is already fuelling the debate about how fraud cases can be most effectively dealt with by regulators and the courts. After the verdicts were returned, the prosecution announced it would apply to recover from the convicted defendants some of the Pounds 1m costs of the Department of Trade and Industry inquiry. A second Blue Arrow trial is still in prospect. Conspiracy charges are outstanding against four other individuals involved in the rights issue. They are: Mr Charles Villiers, the former County chairman; Ms Elizabeth Brimelow, County's former compliance director; Mr Paul Smallwood, a former equities director with UBS P&amp;D; and Mr Tim Brown, another former equities director with P&amp;D. The SFO is expected to announce shortly whether it will proceed. The charges arose from the handling by County NatWest and UBS P&amp;D of the Pounds 837m Blue Arrow rights issue to fund the takeover of Manpower, the US employment group. At the time the issue was the largest ever attempted in the UK. The prosecution alleged that the defendants had dishonestly conspired to mislead the markets by secretly buying shares, totalling almost a fifth of Blue Arrow, in the failed issue to present it to potential investors as a success. The defendants all argued that in the post-Big Bang world they were entitled to do this.

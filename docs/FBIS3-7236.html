			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Foreign Ministry source indicated on 23 March  that, in connection with the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected  development of nuclear devices, amendments to the Self-Defense  Forces Law (to allow the use of government aircraft to rescue  Japanese abroad) should be promptly included on the Diet's  agenda to facilitate the rescue of around 10,000 Japanese living  in South Korea in case of an emergency situation developing on  the Korean peninsula.    This source also touched on the issue of stopping  remittances  to North Korea from Japan if the UN Security Council [UNSC]  decides to impose economic sanctions. He said that while  remittances through banks can be stopped, those passing through  Hong Kong and other third countries can only be stopped with the  cooperation of the governments concerned. However, regarding  cash carried in person to North Korea from Japan: "It is  impossible to prohibit North Korean residents in Japan from  visiting the DPRK. We are still considering to what extent we  can check the flow of cash when they exit the country, and  whether or not to issue reentry visas (because human rights  issues are involved)."    The Foreign Ministry source also stated that economic  sanctions will be imposed in several stages and that in such a  case, considerable measures can be taken under existing laws.    With regard to the UNSC resolution that may be adopted by 25  March (New York time) at the earliest, this source predicted  that "it will not touch on sanctions and will be limited to a  call to accept unconditional inspections by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." He said that whether or not  sanctions are imposed "depends on how North Korea behaves after  the resolution is adopted."</p>

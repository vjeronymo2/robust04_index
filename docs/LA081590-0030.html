			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'QUIXOTE DE LA JOLLA': MANY JOKES, LITTLE PASSION  </P> <P> It's time for the talent show at La Jolla Playhouse Summer Camp.  </P> <P> That's what "Don Quixote de La Jolla" amounts to -- happy campers showing off  for a friendly audience. Lots of self-referential humor. Allusions to other  plays, movies, obscure Actors' Equity policies, the National Endowment for the  Arts, the lambada and, yes, "Don Quixote." Pirandellian pratfalls. Props that  look homemade or bought from a practical-jokes store.  </P> <P> Of course, these particular campers are unusually talented. Onstage are the  clown, Geoff Hoyle ("The Fool Show," La Jolla, 1988), funny sidekicks Robert  Dorfman and Ellen McElduff and one-woman band Gina Leishman. Behind the scenes  are playwright Eric Overmyer ("On the Verge, or the Geography of Yearning") and  director Stan Wojewodski Jr.  </P> <P> The conceit -- and apparently the reality -- is that these people came to La  Jolla a few weeks ago to stitch together something called "Don Quixote de La  Jolla." Hoyle is cast as the Man of La Mancha, Dorfman plays a New York actor  who is assigned the role of Sancho Panza and McElduff plays the blond bombshell  who is charged with the role of Dulcinea.  </P> <P> Other than that, to quote Overmyer's script, "the play doesn't seem very set,  does it?"  </P> <P> It doesn't seem all that funny, either. Which is a big problem, because there  is nothing here except the jokes.  </P> <P> The show's creators talked of more ambitious aims in preopening interviews.  Reading those quotes, one would expect to be moved as well as amused.  </P> <P> Forget it. While this show does require a broader cultural literacy than might  be needed at the Comedy Store, it's no less punch-line oriented. The tone  hardly ever transcends aren't-we-clever and its corollary:  aren't-you-clever-for-understanding-our-jokes. Any attempt to show us our own  plight, or even that of these actors, as parallel to Don Quixote's or anyone  else's, takes a faraway back seat to all the hip yuk-yuks.  </P> <P> Those yuks are of varying quality -- depending on your personal sense of humor.  Hoyle does an uncanny impersonation of a man vomiting, which will surely  disgust as many people as it entertains (count me among the latter). The  quartet dons Zapata-style mustaches for a brief mariachi number. Silly, yes,  but good for a chuckle.  </P> <P> Another highlight is the stream of cross-references to "Waiting for Godot,"  culminating in a scene in which fog covers the stage and the Boy from "Godot"  (Hoyle's son Jonah) encounters Don Quixote and Sancho -- a couple of guys who  are not accustomed to waiting. This scene very briefly sets off the sort of  larger speculation that might have made the show more challenging, more  rewarding.  </P> <P> Hoyle is the only one onstage who takes "Don Quixote" seriously. And because  the script doesn't take the book seriously at all, Hoyle's act comes off --  intentionally, no doubt -- as a bit pompous and -- unintentionally, no doubt --  as one-dimensional. Dorfman and McElduff are allowed to move in and out of  character, creating a few comic sparks as they go.  </P> <P> Dorfman gets many of his laughs from debunking the book, in his guise of  smooth-talking American actor. He points out how "the windmill thing comes  down" too early in the book for maximum dramatic impact; why can't they  rearrange the story to save the best for last? He notes how the  buddy/road/male-bonding genre is getting stale.  </P> <P> McElduff comes on as Marilyn Monroe, complete with the famous white dress that  rises in an updraft. She also gets the show's best costume change (designer:  Christine Dougherty) when she finally consents to put on the fat-housekeeper  outfit she has been resisting.  </P> <P> Considering the freewheeling nature of this enterprise, the actors were very  precise and knowing on opening night. Leishman adds valuable musical support.  </P> <P> But nothing is as funny as it's supposed to be. The in-joking (a half-dozen  references to La Jolla artistic director Des McAnuff) is tiresome. The show  looks very post-modern, but is it all that different from the old days of La  Jolla Playhouse, when Hollywood stars would come down the coast for a summer  workout, more or less as a lark?  </P> <P> While these aren't Hollywood stars, it still feels as if this  Playhouse-commissioned show is hardly a major priority in the careers of its  creators (with the possible exception of Hoyle, who thought it up). Otherwise,  they would surely have something more pressing to say, something more  passionate to express.  </P> <P>  At the Warren Theatre, UC San Diego, La Jolla, Tuesdays through Sundays at 8  p.m., Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2, through Sept. 16. $20-$26.

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Swedish insurer back in the black TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the leading Swedish insurance group, said yesterday it had returned to profit in the first four months of this year. This follows a plunge into heavy losses in 1992 through subsidiaries which were embroiled in the country's severe banking crisis. Mr Bjorn Sprangere, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting the group had shown an operating profit of SKr550m (Dollars 56m) in the first four months. It did not report figures for the same period in 1992, but the profit follows a full-year loss in 1992 of SKr5.2bn. The bulk of last year's losses were due to the SKr6bn cost of writing down to zero the value of Trygg's holdings in Gota AB, the holding company for the collapsed Gotabank, and two collapsed credit insurers, Svenska Kredit and International Credit. Mr Sprangere said Trygg was also pulling out of reinsurance activities, which caused losses last year of several hundred million kroner. He told shareholders the group was concentrating on its Swedish retail core business and international industrial insurance, including the profitable Home Holdings group in the US. Trygg said its solvency margin - the ratio of shareholders assets to premiums - now stood at 132 per cent, compared with as low as 110 per cent at the height of its crisis last year.</p>

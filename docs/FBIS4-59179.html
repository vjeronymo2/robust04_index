			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message from Ayatollah Jannati to the Bosnian people; place </F> and date not given--read by announcer]    [Text] Thanks to Almighty God, the master of [word  indistinct] worlds. Thanks to God, who is allowing and enabling  the voice and vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as the  loudest voice of protest against the terror against the Bosnian  people, against the ruthlessness and aggressive propaganda from  the West, to express our compassion for your terrible and  enormous suffering.    Our message to you from here is that, God willing, we will  use all of our strength to support you. The great leader of the  Islamic revolution has left as his legacy to us the right and  obligation as a nation to help all of our neighboring brothers.    The people are ready to offer all possible help, even above  their means, not only in the form of propaganda, political, or  financial help, but in every way. We hope that other Muslims  will also feel the same obligation and that they will remember  the suffering your state is experiencing--a state of Muslims,  and not a state with just one Muslim community.    Hatred of you is the reason for the Bosnian tragedy that we  are watching. This is not a feeling proscribed by Islam or by  your faith. This is an aggression against the purity and  holiness of Islam and Muslims. This is why all Muslims are firm  in their decision to stand by you bravely and resolutely. I am  sure that the emissary of Islam, our dear God, shares your pain  and suffering, the religious rights and [words indstinct], for  you have been the victims of aggression and terror, and because  they want to destroy you simply because you are Muslims.    God willing, Muslims will see the light. Muslims are ready  to stand before their enemies and oppose them. They must stand  up and resist the Serb criminals. They must fight against all  forces that remain silent in the face of crime, against the  advocates of war who instigate new attacks and aggression. I  hope, God willing, that these dark nights will end as soon as  possible. The dawn of your victory is coming. We will witness  the day when Islam rises and become a mainstay in the area. You  will be strong, [word indistinct] with us and other Muslims in  the world. God willing, the flag of Islam will be erected there  so that the light of Islam can shine in the area.    I humbly pray to Almighty God to give us as soon as possible  the gift of living in happiness, beside one another, in  prosperity, celebrating our joint success. God willing.</p>

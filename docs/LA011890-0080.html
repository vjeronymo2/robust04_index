			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUSH COMMENDS HOMELESS CENTER  </P> <P> President Bush on Tuesday named the St. Vincent de Paul-Joan Kroc Center for  the homeless in San Diego one of his "thousand points of light," an example of  how volunteerism can help solve America's social problems.  </P> <P> The 350-bed shelter for men is actually part of a larger St. Vincent de Paul  Center, including a separate 150-bed shelter for families and others without a  home.  </P> <P> The men's shelter was opened in 1987 with the help of a $3.5-million gift from  Joan Kroc, widow of the founder of the McDonald's restaurant chain and owner of  the San Diego Padres baseball team.  </P> <P> Kroc, who has donated millions to help the needy as well as in support of  nuclear disarmament, also gave $1 million to the Democratic National Committee  in 1987, making her the biggest donor in party history. Her late husband, Ray,  was a major contributor to Republican causes.  </P></p>

Noting that they had requested 100,000 tonnes of grain from  Turkey, Aliyev stated that their request was received favorably.    Stating that they had no territorial demands from Armenia,  Aliyev added that Azerbaijan wanted only the political and  economic return of the mountainous Karabakh region and the  occupied territories.    In answer to a question by a correspondent on whether the  PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist organization was active  in Azerbaijan, Aliyev replied: There is no way this terrorist  organization can function in Azerbaijan. We are against all  initiatives in that direction. We will eradicate all efforts of  that organization to function.    Following the news conference, Aliyev visited the grave of  Turgut Ozal to lay a wreath at the tombstone. Aliyev later  departed Turkey.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President-elect Bush told the National Economic Commission that he wants it to  present its recommendations for cutting the federal budget deficit March 1 as  scheduled rather than to continue deliberating until autumn as its leaders had  hoped. Both Drew Lewis, the NEC's Republican co-chairman, and Robert S.  Strauss, the panel's Democratic co-chairman, have warned that the commission  could end up split along party lines if it is forced to meet the deadline. They  suggested that the NEC could have more impact if the recommendations were  delayed. The 14-member panel, set up by Congress in 1987, was designed to  hammer out a bipartisan deficit-cutting plan similar to the way an earlier  commission formed a new Social Security financing blueprint.  </P></p>

The demonstration was originally announced as a sit-in by  the  Independent Union of Radio Broadcasters (IURB), but the  protesters could not sit down because the square was watered  earlier by unidentified persons.    IURB president Laszlo Gyori said the demonstration was to  show solidarity for the 129 radio employees summarily laid off  on March 4. "This was a deliberate move by Hungarian Radio  leaders against 129 employees and press freedom," he said    Miklos Gyorffy, a well-known radio journalist, said that the  dismissed have the sympathy of many colleagues still in place.  He stated the radio has been undergoing a political cleansing.  "It is not democracy when all this can be done without any  objections," he added.    Several speakers called for the resignation of Laszlo Csucs,  the radio vice-president invested with full presidential powers.    Editor-reporter Jozsef Barath announced that the presidium  of  the National Association of Hungarian Journalists (NAHJ) on  Wednesday decided to lodge a complaint against Csucs for paying  public money to workers whom he does not allow to work. (The  dismissed were given notices effective in 30 days, but they were  suspended from their duties immediately.)    In addition, the NAHJ will initiate an ethical examination  against those of its members who played a part in the cleansing.    Simultaneous with the nearly 90-minute-long protest, an  organization calling itself the "Patriotic Committee for  National Radio and Television" organized a counter-demonstration  (a so-called "standing strike" in Pollack Mihaly Square for  those "who want a national radio".    One of the counter-demonstrators (most of whom who were  standing in small groups amid the crowd of protesters) argued  that nobody demonstrated for the hundreds of thousands of people  who have been laid off, nor did anybody speak out in parliament  in their defence. The middle-aged man, who stood on the edge of  the officially announced protest (which had previously been  granted a permit) was shouting through a loudspeaker and  disturbing the other demonstrators. Police drove him away from  the square.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUPER-SUBS SURFACE TO MAKE WAVES IN WORLD CUP GAMES  </P> <P> From a 38-year-old recently summoned out of retirement to a goalkeeper with one  game of international experience, the World Cup has been a stage for substitute  stars.  </P> <P> Players coming off the bench have inspired their teams to great achievements.  Depth has become so important that Argentina has used 22 players in its four  games, including goalie Sergio Goycochea.  </P> <P> "Now, I look to the sky and I give credit to God," Goycochea says of his  unexpectedly crucial role with the defending champions. "I am the backup for  Pumpido, but if I have to play, I know my teammates have faith in me and I know  I can justify all the faith people have shown in me."  </P> <P> Goycochea has to play in this World Cup because Pumpido, who backstopped  Argentina to the 1986 title, sustained a broken leg in the middle game of the  opening round.  </P> <P> The second-string goalie suddenly became No. 1, even though his only previous  action on this level was in an exhibition against Italy in January. And  Goycochea has responded well, although he did make several mistakes against  Brazil, which either hit the goal post or crossbar or shot wide with him out of  position.  </P> <P> Goycochea had little hope of being with the national team after a shoulder  injury sidelined him for seven months last season.  </P> <P> "Considering that I had been injured," said the goalie for Millionarios in  Colombia, "for me now to play on the national team is my reward."  </P> <P> Also being rewarded by Coach Carlos Bilardo is Claudio Caniggia, a forward who  has become a favorite of team captain and resident superstar Diego Maradona.  Caniggia might not have been on the team if not for the insistence of Maradona  and, of course, what Diego wants, Diego gets.  </P> <P> So Caniggia made the squad. When the offense stalled against Cameroon in the  tournament opener, Caniggia moved into the lineup. Argentina began playing  better.  </P> <P> Against Brazil, it was Caniggia who scored the only goal -- on a setup by  Maradona, naturally.  </P> <P> "Claudio scored the goal, Claudio deserves the credit," Maradona said of the  23-year-old striker for Atalanta of the Italian League. "He has become a great  player."  </P> <P> Another substitute who seems headed for stardom is Italy's Salvatore Schillaci.  The hosts have won four games and he has scored the winner in three of them.  </P> <P> Schillaci began the tournament on the bench, playing behind Andrea Carnevale  and Gianluca Vialli. His first international game was in March.  </P> <P> But when he connected against Austria and Vialli and Carnevale did little  against the United States, Schillaci moved into the starting lineup. He won't  be moved out, at least not in this World Cup.  </P> <P> "He has done very well in creating scoring advantages for us," Italian coach  Azeglio Vicini said. "He also has finished off some plays on his own."  </P> <P> Two other Italian replacements have scored goals. Roberto Baggio got a superb  one in a 2-0 victory over Czechoslovakia that clinched the Group A title, and  Aldo Serena assisted on one and scored the other in a 2-0 second-round win  against Uruguay.  </P> <P> Baggio has been considered one of Italy's brightest young stars. He played for  Fiorentina last season and was the league's second leading scorer.  </P> <P> Then he was sold to Juventus, where Schillaci plays, and the  multimillion-dollar deal angered fans in Florence. When Italy trained near  Florence before the tournament, Baggio was whistled at and yelled at by fans.  </P> <P> But his play for the national team should quiet those critics.  </P> <P> Two teams from the United Kingdom, England and Ireland, have made the  quarterfinals with great help from benchwarmers.  </P> <P> The English have yet to display much offense in the World Cup, but their  biggest goal, in the final minute of overtime against Belgium, got them into  the final eight. It came off the foot of David Platt, who was on the field  mainly because team captain Bryan Robson is back home with a foot injury.  </P> <P> Platt scored one of the nicest goals of the tournament, volleying a free kick  from Paul Gascoigne while turning.  </P> <P> "It was just an instinctive thing," said Platt, 24. "If I had let the ball  bounce, it was going to get away."  </P> <P> Ireland found its way into the quarters with the assistance of subs Niall  Quinn, whose goal against the Netherlands got the Irish into the second round,  and David O'Leary. It was the 32-year-old O'Leary who came off the bench and  put in the winning penalty kick in a shoot-out with Romania.  </P> <P> "I couldn't be happier for David," coach Jack Charlton said. "He has waited so  long for this."  </P> <P> The man who has waited longest for World Cup glory is Roger Milla. He was with  Cameroon in 1982, when it tied three first-round games and was eliminated on  tiebreakers.  </P> <P> Since then, Milla played in France, then went into retirement from the  professional ranks, moving to an amateur team on the island of Reunion.  </P> <P> But he was summoned back to the team for this World Cup and, usually coming on  for the second half, has four goals. He personally beat Romania in the opening  round and Colombia in the second phase.  </P> <P> Does that mean Milla will follow Schillaci's path into the starting lineup? Not  likely. At 38, he is most effective being used sparingly.  </P> <P> Like most supersubs.  </P></p>

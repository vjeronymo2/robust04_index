			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Therefore, the requirements promulgated today for LDTs will be implemented in two stages. The first stage will cover LDTs with a GVWR of 6,000 or less (LLDT), the second will cover LDTs with a GVWR of 6,001 to 8,500 lbs GVWR (HLDT). LLDTs represent about 70 percent of LDT sales. HLDTs represent the remaining 30 percent. For LLDTs, the ORVR requirement will begin implementation in the 2001 model year and will phase in over three model years according to the same percentages as LDVs. For HLDTs, the ORVR requirement will begin implementation in the 2004 model year and will phase in over three model years according to the same percentages as LDVs (40/80/100). This schedule will permit the development and application of cost-effective, economically achievable technology, as required by section 202(a)(2) and will still allow consideration of the Stage II phaseout provisions of section 202(a)(6) of the CAA in the long term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions of 40 CFR 86.085&hyph;1(b) permit manufacturers to certify HDVs with a GVWR of 8,501&hyph;10,000 lbs GVWR as LDTs. This option will remain in effect for refueling controls. HDVs certified under this option would be treated as HLDTs for purposes leadtime, phase-in and sales compliance determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not view the provisions of section 202(a)(3) as applying to refueling controls, as that provision was probably intended to apply only to exhaust emission standards, as did its predecessor provision. However, even if it did apply, this section would provide for at least four years of leadtime. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is allowing this much leadtime for HLDTs anyway, designating section 202(a)(2) or 202(a)(3) as authority for HDV leadtime has no practical significance here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Small Volume Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Today's rule includes a short-term provision for small volume light-duty vehicle manufacturers. Several small volume manufacturers commented that, as a practical matter, they cannot phase in their compliance due to their small size and limited product lines. Small volume manufacturers also claimed that they sometimes rely on control technology developed by larger manufacturers to develop their compliance strategies, and this would not be possible if they must comply at essentially the 100 percent of sales level before the larger manufacturers. R&amp;D cost concerns were cited as obstacles as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that these comments state valid concerns. As is described in three recent Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices, EPA has allowed small volume manufacturers to delay compliance to the last model year of the phase-in: in the Tier 1 exhaust emission standard rule (June 5, 1991, 56 FR 25724), the cold CO exhaust emissions rule (July 17, 1992, 57 FR 31888), and the enhanced evaporative emission standards rule (March 24, 1993, 58 FR 16003), and has decided to allow the same accommodation for the ORVR requirement for light-duty vehicles. This provision is included, not only for the reasons raised by the manufacturers, but also because it would be inconsistent to face ORVR compliance before evaporative emission compliance when the comments indicate that most manufacturers plan to use integrated refueling/evaporative control systems and these are desirable for both cost and safety reasons. In addition, requiring phased compliance for these manufacturers effectively denies them the opportunity Congress intended to phase in the control technology. (Cf.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 997 F. 2d 1520, 1535 (D.C. Cir. 1993) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exception to seemingly literal statutory language can be allowed where failure to allow the exception frustrates a Congressional goal or leads to absurd results)). Thus, small volume manufacturers of light-duty vehicles, as defined in 40 CFR part 86, may delay compliance to model year 2000 (i.e., the third model year of the phase-in), but must comply with 100 percent of sales in that and subsequent model years. Because of the additional leadtime EPA is affording to LDTs, the Agency is not implementing this small-volume manufacturer provision for these vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Inclusion of Inherently Low Refueling Emission Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As was discussed in the May 1993 notice, vehicles meeting the refueling emission standard because they are inherently low in refueling vapor emissions (those certified without a control system using the engineering evaluation option), and thus are waived from testing, cannot be counted in either the vehicles complying or base sales figures in determining compliance with the sales requirements of the statute. Compliance for these vehicles is to be calculated separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Refueling Emission Test Procedures and Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule includes test procedures for the measurement of refueling emissions and a corresponding emissions standard by which to judge the adequacy of ORVR control system designs. The test procedures accommodate integrated system designs, which control both refueling and evaporative emissions with a common vapor storage unit, as well as non-integrated system designs, which do not share vapor storage units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The test procedures for these two types of control systems, although different in some ways (explained below), involve the same basic steps: Load the storage canister with hydrocarbon vapor, drive the vehicle to provide opportunity for canister purge, and refuel the vehicle while measuring emissions (see Figures 1 and 2). The first two steps together are referred to as the preconditioning phase and are discussed in detail further on in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d570 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSER06AP94.000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d572 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSER06AP94.001 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;P&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Refueling Emissions Test <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The procedure for the refueling step is common to both integrated and non-integrated systems. It involves disconnecting the vapor line from the fuel tank to the canister, draining the fuel tank, refueling with test fuel to 10 percent of the nominal tank capacity, soaking the vehicle for 6 to 24 hours at 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (26.7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.7  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C), reconnecting the vapor line, and fueling the vehicle with test fuel at 67 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.5  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (19.4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.8  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) in a sealed enclosure (SHED) while measuring emissions. Fueling is performed at a rate of 4 to 10 gallons per minute (15.1 to 37.9 liters per minute) and is terminated at the first automatic shutoff that occurs after a quantity of fuel has been pumped equal to at least 85 percent of the nominal tank capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the key issues raised in the July 1993 hearing and the subsequent comment period concerned the test temperature specifications for the dispensed fuel and the residual in-tank fuel, both of which have a major impact on the refueling vapor generation and therefore on ORVR system designs. Hearing participants discussed the merits of setting the test dispensed fuel temperature at 67  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (19.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) while maintaining the residual in-tank fuel temperature specification of 80  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (26.7  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C). Previous proposals had included a dispensed fuel temperature specification of 81&hyph;84  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (27.2&hyph;28.9  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Bank airs its doubts on the budget: Governor Fazio has no quarrel with spending cuts, but wonders if they will bring the expected savings For the second year in a row the Bank of Italy finds itself in the uncomfortable position of casting judgment on economic policies formulated by one of its own who has passed over to the government. First, it was the policies of a former governor, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who became prime minister. Now, it is Mr Lamberto Dini, the bank's former director-general, who has been Treasury minister since May, and is the key figure in the Berlusconi government's economic team. In neither case can the bank be accused of being too soft. The underlying theme has been to hammer home the dangers of failing to tackle with sufficient energy the problem of Italy's public finances. This was evident this week when Mr Antonio Fazio, the bank's governor, appeared before parliament to comment on the outlines of the 1995 budget and the macroeconomic framework for 1995-1997. The government, he said, had inherited a budget deficit far greater than originally projected despite interest rates falling more than expected. But, having got in this little dig at Mr Ciampi, he then made several telling observations, which, despite the measured language, could be interpreted as friendly warnings. The first related specifically to the 1995 budget which seeks to hold the deficit down to 9.4 per cent of gross domestic product, relying on a mix of spending cuts and revenue raising measures. Mr Fazio did not quarrel with Mr Dini's aim to find L45,000bn (Pounds 18.5bn) in extra funds next year - an ambitious target for any Italian government. However, he voiced concern that the spending cuts would not produce the required sums and that too much of the new revenue was coming from one-off measures. This was not just a reference to the unresolved dispute between the government and the unions over the extent of cuts in Italy's generous state-run pensions scheme. It also raised a question mark over cuts proposed in health care and hospital management. At the same time he noted that the government had yet to make any provision for the recent constitutional court decision ordering back-payments on pensions totalling more than L30,000bn. On the revenue side, Mr Fazio appeared anxious about the way the government was planning to raise money through temporary measures rather than create sustained sources of funding. The main source of L18,000bn in new revenue will be a tax amnesty and a pardon on illegal buildings. Similar measures in the past have tended to yield less than expected. He also implicitly questioned whether the government was right in its determination to avoid increasing the fiscal pressure. He pointed out that it remained below that of France and Germany 'and other countries which have the same pattern of public sector expenditure as Italy'. More generally, he observed: 'The experience of the past five years shows just how costly it has been continuously missing the targets; likewise, it has shown that adopting one-off measures has been counter-productive since both spending and the deficit have systematically increased.' Mr Fazio's second friendly warning concerned employment, and was aimed specifically at Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, who promised to create a million jobs during his election campaign. The governor doubted whether the private sector could create more than 350,000 jobs over the next three years - even with the positive effect of easing hire and fire laws plus giving tax incentives for job creation. Public sector employment would decline, he said. But perhaps his real warning was on the effect of political uncertainties on the lira. In the second quarter of the year, he said, there had been a net outflow of portfolio investments to the tune of L20,600bn. Of this, L11,700bn had taken place in June. These capital outflows had weakened the currency, especially against the D-Mark. The lira, he insisted, was as much as 10 per cent undervalued against the D-Mark, especially with exports still booming and a domestic recovery beginning against low inflation. If the lira remained weak, there was a risk of renewed inflation. Italy then could move into a vicious cycle, with interest rates being pushed up once again. As it is, interest rates in Italy are now more than 3 percentage points higher than in Germany. A rise in interest rates affects Italy in particular, with its huge stock of debt, now equivalent to 123 per cent of GDP. A 1 percentage point rise increases the annual borrowing requirement by some L15,000bn. In other words, it could wipe out the equivalent of a third of all the new revenues the government is pledged to find next year. The government fully recognises the problem of the debt stock in its economic planning document and projects that it will peak at 124 per cent of GDP next year before falling back. But its sheer size and the continuous need to fund it makes Italy so vulnerable to a crisis of confidence. In parliament yesterday, Mr Dini appeared to take on board the governor's comments in the spirit they were offered, well aware of the difficulties ahead in fleshing out the details of the budget in the autumn. But he was also bullish on the economy. The strong recovery in progress could see next year's growth exceed 2.7 per cent, he said. The government's economic team will be given only a small breathing space by the summer break since concrete proposals for spending cuts will have to be finalised by mid-September. In the meantime, a hint of the problems ahead came this week from the senate where the government lacks a clear majority and where the health, labour and industry commissions rejected various budget proposals. These could pass in a full house; but the government cannot take for granted a safe passage for the most controversial of its proposals - the pardon on buildings constructed illegally. This proposal has been criticised by the mayors of most large cities and attacked by the environmentalists as condoning the large scale speculative development that has blighted many municipal suburbs. If the scope of the pardon is reduced as result of these protests, the government faces the difficult task of finding replacement revenue.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> POLL PLANNED ON AID DURING EARTHQUAKE  </P> <P> Ojai officials are preparing to ask residents if they will need special medical  attention or can help others in the event of a major earthquake.  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday approved the first draft of a new pamphlet, "Plan  to Be a Quake Survivor," with tips on what to do before, during and after an  earthquake.  </P> <P> Residents who are willing to offer portable phones, generators, ham radios,  medical training or ability to transport animals may list their skills or  services on a portion of the pamphlet and mail it to City Hall.  </P> <P> Counselors, language translators and those with tow trucks or construction  equipment are also asked to sign up before disaster strikes.  </P> <P> "We're motivated by our topography because the potential for isolation from  other emergency agencies is very real here," said Elaine Willman, assistant to  the city manager.  </P> <P> The brochure will be mailed to all Ojai households early next year after it is  reviewed by the Ventura County Fire Protection District and the Sheriff's  Department Office of Emergency Services.

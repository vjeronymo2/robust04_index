			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Semso (Luka) from Zenica] </F>   [Excerpt] Every new road is of strategic interest these  days, both from the military and from the civilian point of  view. That is why the members of the Zenica Engineering  Battalion had cause for pride today, as they officially  announced that a new road has been marked out, and it will be  used for bringing in supplies more quickly and safely to our  defense lines, for taking care of the wounded, and also for  linking up the existing [word indistinct] between important  points in Zenica and the neighboring municipalities.    Midhat Ibrahimagic, commander of the Engineering Battalion,  stressed today in front of his soldiers-builders that the  marking out of this road -- 3,600 meters long, passing through  inaccessible terrain and under the worst of weather conditions,  in only 10 days -- was a real achievement. The order from Army  General Staff has thus been carried out, and the next task on  surfacing and [words indistinct] until the road is completed  will most certainly be done within the deadline.

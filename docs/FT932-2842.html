			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Managers seen to be missing the IT message BRITISH managers are drowning in paper and surrounded by fancy technology they do not know how to use. They are spending ever more time in meetings and sending each other increasing numbers of meaningless memos, a study has found. The Institute of Management and Aspen Business Communications investigated the tangled lines of communication inside British companies and Mr Roger Young, institute director-general, said the results were 'depressing'. He added that managers were 'resorting to the tools of Dickens to communicate with each other'. The survey showed that less than 15 per cent of the 700 managers surveyed understood the potential of their IT systems, and only half thought their system was installed in a sensible fashion. The survey questioned the conventional wisdom that communication had improved as a result of the restructuring of British companies from hierarchical to 'flatter' structures. The idea was that flatter companies would mean easier and faster communications, with managers given more authority to make decisions. But more than 40 per cent of the managers said they were sending and receiving more memos than before, while two thirds were spending more time in meetings. Only four-in-10 said their company communications strategy was clearer than before. Respondents complained that the cutting out of the old layers of management had made their organisations less caring. More than half said they had become more accountable in their jobs, but had not been given the corresponding authority to take decisions. However, most agreed that the shift from paternalistic management had the positive effect of making their companies more open, informal and progress-ive. Most managers reported that the introduction of technology had speeded the flow of information through the company, and had increased their access to it. However, only four in 10 said it had improved its relevance. 'Much of the information is poorly targeted and of little relevance to the recipient,' said Mr Young. In spite of the elevation in the role of the memo, less than half the respondents thought it an effective way of communication. Over two thirds said that to talk to someone face-to-face was more effective than to communicate on paper or technology. Are Managers Getting the Message?

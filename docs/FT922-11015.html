			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Preston focuses on aid for poor MR Lewis Preston, World Bank president, is giving priority to securing additional aid commitments for the poorest countries, in spite of heavy demand for capital from former communist countries. At the meetings this week in Washington, the bank is trying to persuade governments to support the tenth replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), its soft-loan affiliate. IDA loans are available only for countries with per capita incomes of Dollars 800 (Pounds 452) or less. No interest is charged and maturities extend to 40 years. 'Our objective is to persuade people that IDA Ten has to be significantly better in real terms than IDA Nine,' Mr Preston said in an interview. The bank managed to raise Dollars 15.5bn for IDA Nine, the three-year replenishment that is to expire in the middle of next year. Mr Basil Kavalsky, the official responsible for raising IDA funds, says that, if the bank is to maintain the purchasing power of programmes, it will need at least Dollars 18bn for IDA Ten, which runs from the middle of 1994. However, Dollars 18bn will not meet needs because the populations of IDA countries are rising rapidly and the number of nations qualifying for concessional finance is growing. To fund new recipients fully on the same basis as existing ones, the bank would need an additional Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn, indicating a target for IDA Ten of about Dollars 21bn. Developing countries cannot be expected to spend as much on environmental protection as rich nations and may have to set up their own regional trade blocs if the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks are not concluded soon. These warnings were delivered by Mr Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean finance minister and chairman of the joint IMF/World Bank development committee, whose meeting today is expected to focus mainly on trade and environmental issues, ahead of the Earth Summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro this June.</p>

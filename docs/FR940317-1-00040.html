For FY 1994, interexchange carriers (long distance telephone companies) (``IXCs'') will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $60.00 per 1,000 presubscribed access lines. Similarly, local exchange carriers (local telephone operating companies) (``LECs'') will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $60.00 per 1,000 access lines. As noted above, for IXCs, we have identified regulatory fee payment amounts greater than $500,000.00 as large. For LEC holding companies, we have identified $700,000.00 as a large amount. Thus, we propose to permit IXCs whose annual regulatory fee exceed $500,000.00 and LEC holding companies whose fee payments exceed $700,000 to make installment payments. A relatively small number of companies will incur annual fees in excess of these amounts compared with many other entities who are subject to much lower fees. Specifically, we have estimated that the average fee for all interexchange carriers will be approximately $20,000. However, the top three carriers will be paying from $530,000 to $6 million dollars per year in regulatory fees. The estimated average fee for only the top 20 local exchange carriers is approximately $417,000. We have tentatively chosen as a logical cut-off point $700,000 because only a few carriers will pay this above-average fee and the vast majority of carriers will pay a fee that is significantly below the top 20 average fee. In fiscal year 1994, large fees may be paid in two installments. Given the higher annual operating revenues of these types of companies, we also believe that the proposed amounts for ``large'' fees are appropriate in this context. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Conforming and Clarifying Amendments to Application Fee Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 47. In addition to the new rules for regulatory fees, we are proposing to revise several sections of our rules governing the payment and collection of fees associated with applications and other filings. As noted above, these fees are assessed and collected pursuant to section 8 of the Communications Act and are separate and apart from the regulatory fees authorized under section 9. However where appropriate, our section 7 and section 9 fee collection procedures will be integrated. For the most part, the proposed modifications related to our filing fees are ministerial in nature to conform our application fee and regulatory fee regulations or will clarify existing fee payment requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 48.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fees for resubmitted applications. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  First, we propose to amend section 1.1107(d) of the rules, which governs fee payments relating to applications and other filings when resubmitted in the appropriate timeframe following a staff request for additional or corrected information. Ordinarily, no additional fee payment is required for resubmitted applications and other filings. However, the rules do require a supplemental fee payment whenever the revised information causes a change in the category of the filing with the result that a higher fee payment is now due under the fee schedule. Our rules provide that the additional fee payment,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the difference between the fee initially submitted and the correct fee payment now due, must be submitted with the revised application or other filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49. In order to clarify our rule governing those procedures applicable when an additional fee is due, we propose to amend &sect;1.1107(d) to require persons submitting revised applications and other filings to submit any fee payment balance due when the revised application or other filing is submitted. Such applications and fees must be filed at the lockbox bank. In the event that the staff discovers, within 30 days after the resubmission, that the additional fee payment was not submitted, the application or other filing will be dismissed as deficient and the previously submitted section 8 fee payment will be retained under this proposal. A new fee payment (covering the entire amount) will be required with any future filing of the application or other filing. However, if the staff discovers the fee payment deficiency more than thirty days subsequent to the resubmission, the application or other filing will be retained but a 25 percent late fee will be assessed on the deficient amount even if the Commission has completed its action on the application or other filing involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

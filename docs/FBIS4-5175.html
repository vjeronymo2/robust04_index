			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il, in his historical work "On Some Questions in  Understanding the Chuche Philosophy" published on April 2, 1974,  gave a comprehensive exposition of the basic characteristics of  the chuche philosophy, the chuche-based viewpoint of man, the  chuche-based outlook on the world, a scientific understanding of  independence and other theoretical and practical questions  arising in the development of the chuche philosophy.    In a by-lined article dedicated to the 20th anniversary of  the publication of the work, NODONG SINMUN today says it is a  monumental work that newly formulates all the fundamentals of  the chuche philosophy and systematizes them in an integral whole  and an immortal famous work greatly conducive to the development  of the philosophical idea of the working class.    It says:    The dear leader expounds that the chuche philosophy is an  anthropocentric philosophy which is elaborated and systematized,  focussing on man. This is a scientific formulation of the basic  characteristics and originality of the chuche philosophy.    The chuche philosophy is fundamentally different from the  human philosophy. It does not explain the human question only  but raises such fundamental questions as the relationship  between the world and man and the position and role of man in  the world and elucidates the man-centred outlook on the world.    The work is a precious ideological and theoretical treasure  which newly raises and explains the human question and a great  textbook of the chuche idea which gives a new correct outlook of  the chuche philosophy on the world.    The dear leader defined man as a social being with  independence, creativity and consciousness, thus making it clear  that the chuche philosophy and the bourgeois human philosophy  are diametrically opposed to each other in their view of man.    By elucidating the view of the world that nature and society  are dominated and transformed by man, the chuche philosophy  brilliantly fulfilled the philosophical task of our time in  which the popular masses are masters of their own destiny and  history.    It is a noteworthy event in the history of human philosophy  that the dear leader gave a scientific exposition of the  formation and development of man's independence and its  characteristics.    The chuche philosophy explains that independence is not a  product of evolution but a social product. As a result, it has  been made clear that man is not a simple biological being that  represents on the highest level such natural attribute as desire  for existence which other living matter in general has, but the  most developed social being that represents such social  attribute as independence which other living matter cannot have.</p>

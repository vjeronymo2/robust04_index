			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Paul Dufour: ``Nuclear Waste Storage No </F> Longer Causes Fear'']    [Text] Construction of underground laboratories  involves mediation.    ``There has been a complete reversal of direction. People  have abandoned the logic of refusal in favor of the assault of  enticement,'' says Christian Bataille, deputy (PS [Socialist  Party]) for Nord Department, who does not yet know whether he  should be pleased or worried about this development. When  Bataille arrived in Gard--the most heavily nuclearized  department in France (Footnote 1. In particular, Gard is the  site of the Marcoule center, the Eurodif [European Dissemination  Agency] uranium enrichment plant, and the Phoenix breeder  reactor)--he certainly did not expect to encounter much  opposition on his mission of mediation with respect to the  construction of underground laboratories for the management of  high-level radioactive waste. But if you recall the disturbances  that this issue caused in January 1990 in Vendee, it is indeed  surprising to see a region almost unanimously--and with such  conviction--clamoring for ``its'' waste.    Appointed to the post of mediator by Pierre Beregovoy and  retained in that capacity by Edouard Balladur, Bataille is  charged with a very precise mission: that of ``de-emotionalizing  the debate.'' Aided by the crisis and the unemployment  situation, his task could indeed prove less difficult than  anticipated. After visiting Gard Department on 7 and 8 October,  he went to Marne on 19 October and Haute-Marne on 21 and 22  October. The elected officials--who had invited him ``to obtain  information''--are now telling the mediation delegation that  they hope to reinforce the candidacies of their respective  departments. And although some associations and some elected  officials of the Greens have expressed their opposition and  reservations, they did so calmly, Bataille said, ``after having  heard--sometimes at great length--the arguments of the mediator,  who for his part took their positions into consideration.''    For the time being, the Bataille mission constitutes the  final chapter in a story that began in 1983. Charged with  conducting the studies looking toward the construction of an  underground storage center for long-life, high-level radioactive  waste, the National Agency for the Management of Radioactive  Waste (ANDRA) selected--amid the greatest secrecy--a total of 28  favorable geologic sites. Of that total, Alain Madelin--who was  serving as minister of industry--four years later chose four  sites that corresponded to the four most suitable geologic  formations: Neuvy-Bouin (Deux-Sevres) for granite; Le  Bourg-d'Ire (Maine-et-Loire) for shale;  Montcornet-Sissonne-en-Bresse (Aisne) for clay; and Montrevel  (Ain) for salt. The geologists are charged with selecting the  two ``finalists'' from among these four.    At the respective sites, however, the geologists had to  confront resolute opposition from the local populations and even  veritable riots such as occurred at Bourg-d'Ire (LE MONDE, 30  January 1990). On 9 February 1990, Prime Minister Michel Rocard  therefore ordered a moratorium ``of at least one year.''  Christian Bataille, deputy and vice president of the Regional  Council of Nord Department, was charged with drafting a report  that served as the basis of the law of 30 December 1991  ``relating to the research on the management of radioactive  waste'' which sets forth the French position on this issue (see  box).  <H5>  Approximately Thirty Candidacies </H5>   Gard was the first of 15 departments that Bataille will  visit  before submitting his recommendations in mid-December to  Minister of Industry, Posts, Telecommunications, and Foreign  Trade Gerard Longuet, representing 15 sites chosen from  approximately 30 spontaneous applications. ``Just one article in  the GAZETTE DES COMMUNES brought in 20 applications,'' said a  member of his team, still astonished at this unexpected success.  Sites where the substratum was clearly unsuitable were obviously  ruled out as a matter of course. All of the other sites will in  principle be visited by the mediator.    Bataille's coming was widely announced in the press and by  personal letter to every person (pronuclear and antinuclear  alike) of influence in the region. Once he was installed ``on  neutral ground'' in the prefecture, the mediator received  whoever had submitted an application--elected officials, labor  union members, officials of associations, or even private  citizens--provided they had a local constituency of some  consequence. He then discussed the various points in the  dossier, answered questions, and collected the opinions and  positions of each person.    During two days in Nimes, for example, Bataille met with at  least 40 persons, only one of whom--Marie-Anne Sabatier  (Greens), a member of the Regional Council--voiced strong  opposition to the plan. On the other hand, elected officials of  all tendencies--and the presidents of the commercial tribunals  and employer organizations--explained how important the plan  would be for the economy of the region. Even more unexpected was  the fact that the environmental protection associations limited  themselves to demanding ``the most complete openness,''  believing--in essence--that such a laboratory would create jobs  without aggravating the pollution in a region that is already  highly nuclearized. The winegrowers--who are used to  expropriations resulting from urban or industrial  development--hinted to the mediator that if the scales were  tipped slightly to redefine the boundaries of the control areas  on which trade names are based, they would regard it as an  acceptable trade-off.    Christian Bataille does not, of course, expect to receive  the  same welcome everywhere. ``Some applications come from a single  mayor, or even from a member of a municipal council of a small  municipality,'' he acknowledges. In such cases, the prefect  Jacques Monestier, director of the team that is assisting  Bataille, acts as an advance man to ``reconnoiter the terrain''  and unofficially establish contacts capable of enlarging the  support base for a request that comes from too limited a source.  ``Obviously,'' Monestier says, ``it is impossible for us to  leave immediately with the mediator in response, for example, to  the request of a single mayor of a municipality consisting of 65  residents. But,'' he smilingly adds, ``if that small village  sits astride a magnificent dome of granite, nothing prevents us  from contacting other elected officials and attempting to reach  an agreement....''  <H5>  ``Buying Consciences?'' </H5>   It is all suggestions and advice, however. There is no  attempt to force anyone's hand. In any case, the mediator does  not go anywhere unless invited. The only exception to this  golden rule is the four sites chosen previously by Alain  Madelin. Bataille insists that the purpose of the visits is ``to  determine the current state of mind of the local population and  present the new points in a dossier that has evolved  considerably.'' Where the opposition is too strong, the visit  can be replaced by a simple interview in Paris with elected  local officials. ``If there are any tensions, they will not  originate with us,'' the mediator emphasizes. ``Let the  opponents be reassured: there are plenty of candidacies.''    It is true that in these times of crisis the offer is  somewhat seductive. Each of the two laboratories will represent  an investment of at least Fr1.5 billion--plus Fr70 million per  year of operation--and will provide 150 jobs ``with priority  being given to job applications from local residents.'' ANDRA  will also participate--to the extent of Fr60 million per  year--in the financing of ``project realizations and supporting  actions.'' This largesse will be managed by a public interest  group (GIP) that brings together--alongside the state and  ANDRA--the region, the department, and all the municipalities  situated less than 10 km from the site.    ``It is not a question of buying consciences,'' Christian  Bataille counters. ``Anyway, what does Fr60 million represent?  Scarcely five km of freeway constructed on a level surface. Most  of the candidacies submitted are more farsighted and are based  on a nobler logic of overall economic development.''  <H5>  ``A Scientific History'' </H5>   This is obviously true in the case of Gard Department where,  with the projected closing--in 1998--of the unit for the  reprocessing of fuels from UP1 graphite-gas power plants,  several hundred jobs will disappear from the Marcoule site,  despite the start-up of the Melox plant in early 1995. Gilbert  Baumet, president of the general council, emphasizes that ``for  the Rhone district of Gard Department, Marcoule is somewhat the  equivalent of Renault.'' The site currently employs more than  3,000 persons, not counting the jobs in related industries. The  labor unions sent a form letter to the elected officials--and to  the executives of the commercial and employer  organizations--requesting that they support Gard's candidacy in  negotiations with the mediation mission. They explained to  Christian Bataille that the Marcoule site ``possesses an  infrastructure--and a scientific and technical history--that are  propitious for siting the project here.''    Some university professors pointed to the existence nearby  (at Montpellier) of university and CNRS [National Council for  Scientific Research] laboratories--``especially those in the  field of the earth sciences''--that are ready to participate in  the research. Business executives cited the talent available at  a local school for training engineers in the field of computer  science, and most of them said quite frankly that in addition to  the laboratory, they hope in fact to obtain the storage center  properly speaking. ``Gard was the first department to accept a  nuclear installation, in 1954,'' Gilbert Beaumet pointed out.  ``It truly deserves to have the nation return the favor.'' It  was an opinion that the mediator seemed to share, when he  acknowledged that ``your social and human conditions make a good  case for this department.'' It remains for the geologists to  substantiate this favorable impression at the technical level.  <H5>  [Box, p 18] </H5> <H5>  Fifteen Years of Research </H5>   The law of 30 December 1991 defined with precision all the  stages that will lead to the selection of a site for the deep  underground storage of long-life, high level nuclear waste.    The mediator, Christian Bataille, was initially assigned the  task of conducting the dialogue leading to the selection of the  sites where preliminary work on construction of an underground  laboratory can be carried out. In December, Bataille will submit  a number of conclusions on the basis of which the government  will select two sites.    At the conclusion of the two years of preliminary work  (extensive geological investigations), two underground  laboratories will be dug to a depth of from 200 to 1,000 meters,  depending on the nature of the sites. This work will continue  for five years. The scientists will then be able to set up shop  there for eight years of research with the aim of verifying the  behavior of the rocks. These laboratories will not receive any  waste, although a few small sources or samples necessary for the  experiments will be able to be lowered to the laboratories.  Simultaneously, other research will be carried out in two  complementary directions: reduction of the volume and life of  the waste, and procedures for conditioning the waste with a view  to possible future long-term surface storage.    Finally, around the year 2006, Parliament will decide--on  the  basis of the results obtained--whether to pursue the research or  to decide on a method of managing the waste, which could be to  bury them underground.    A center will then be dug, probably--but not  necessarily--near one of the laboratories. Because the  laboratories will have only one access well and a few galleries,  they themselves cannot be converted into storage centers, which  would have to be much larger: in fact, veritable underground  cathedrals.    The storage of waste in these centers will be reversible, so  that the waste can be recovered if scientific progress permits  its elimination in a more ecological manner.</p>

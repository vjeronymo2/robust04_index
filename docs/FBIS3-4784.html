			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Thailand and the United States last week failed to  bring to a conclusion talks on extending the bilateral agreement  on export quotas for Thai garments and textiles. However,  Foreign Trade Department director-general Oranut Osathanon said  she believed that the prospects looked bright for the next round  of talks.    Ms Oranut last week led the Thai delegation for the second  round of negotiations with the US textiles negotiating team in  an attempt to extend the bilateral agreement that expired in  December last year.    The first round of talks, last December, failed because the  US placed very tough punishment conditions in cases where the US  found trans-shipment or re-routing of Thai products to third  countries before entering the US, a method designed to get  around quotas known as "circumvention". Ms Oranut said last week  that the US had relaxed its condition on the "circumvention"  clause, saying that it would cut quotas only once in the case of  products found to be shipped to the US illegally. And if the  Thai side was able to prove its innocence in the case, the US  must compensate for all quotas cut.    She said the US had relaxed its earlier stance insisting on  investigations, without advance warning to the Thai side, of  factories suspected to have conducted "circumvention". Both  sides last week agreed that the US must inform the Thai  Government and investigate the factories accompanied by Thai  officials.    However, neither side discussed the amount of quotas or the  growth rate of quotas for which the US will allow imports from  Thailand each year. Hence the need for another round of  negotiations. Ms Oranut said the Foreign Trade Department will  today call a meeting of private-sector representatives to  determine what the country's position should be.</p>

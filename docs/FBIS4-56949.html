			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 8 May (EFE) -- The National Renewal, the  main rightist party in Chile, this weekend hardened its position  on the government of President Eduardo Frei. National Renewal  President Andres Allamand accused him of being "ambiguous" and  "lacking coherence" in a harsh speech to mark the seventh  anniversary of the party, which is considered the most moderate  of the Chilean right. Allamand also criticized Interior Minister  German Correa.    Allamand said the current administration, which was  inaugurated on 11 March, is "dragging its feet." He said it  lacks coherence, as reflected in the change of priorities of the  announced policies in which institutional reforms have overtaken  social reforms.    He said the government has not sent Congress any legal  initiatives for solving the problems of poverty, education, and  health.    He called on Frei to take "clear and personal" command. He  added that those "in charge" are the leaders of the political  parties of the government coalition which comprises the  Christian Democrats, the Socialists, and the Social Democrats.    Allamand said the call asking the opposition to play a role  is incoherent, because the interior minister [German Correa]  made "unfortunate comments," saying that the charges of  corruption by the opposition stain the Chilean image abroad.    In a harsh attack on Correa, who has become the target of  the  criticism of the right, Allamand recalled that the majority of  Correa's Socialist friends in Spain are either "detained, at  large, or writing their resignations."    He added that attitudes like that of Minister Correa in  Chile  open "the doors to generalized corruption" -- just like in Spain.    Allamand called on his party to free itself from the past  and  to preserve the unity of the "Union for Chile" rightist  alliance, which also includes the Independent Democratic Union  and the Center-Center Union.    Allamand offered his party's help to the government in  solving the problems of poverty, health, and education but  discarded any support for moves that seek "to destroy the basis  of the institutions."    The government is studying a package of bills that it will  send to Congress that seek to eliminate from the Constitution --  which was approved by the military regime of General Augusto  Pinochet -- what has been called "the authoritarian remnants of  the system."    These remnants include a clause that prevent the commanders  of the Armed Forces from being removed, a clause that appoints  senators without elections, and a clause to perpetuate the  proportional representation electoral system.</p>

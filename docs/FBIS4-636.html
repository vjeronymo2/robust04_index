			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The national organizer of the Egle Party, Shaykh  Ibrahim Amartey, has observed that the call for national unity  by the Progressive Alliance is in the interest of all political  parties in the country. This is because no matter which  political party is in power at any given time, no meaningful  development can take place in any country which is divided  against itself.    Shaykh Amartey made this observation at a rally of the Egle  Party at Bawku in the Upper East Region. He drew the attention  of the politicians and journalists to the fact that the more  they fan national disunity the more they retard the nation's  development.    Shaykh Amartey announced that the National Electoral  Commission has given approval to the party to change its name  from Egle to the Eagle Party. He said the Eagle stands for  Every Accountable Ghanaian Living Everywhere. [passage omitted]</p>

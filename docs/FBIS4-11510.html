			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 27 Apr (AFP) -- In a communique issued  today in Caracas by the Foreign Ministry, the Venezuelan  Government condemns for the Haitian Armed Forces for "the  massacre of 23 Haitians" in that country on Saturday. In the  communique, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry "deplores the  worsening of the Haitian crisis and deeply regrets this wave of  violence, intimidation, torture, disappearances, assassinations,  and illegal imprisonment of people linked to democratic  political and labor movements." After indicating the death of  the 23 Haitians "should be added to the list of other equally  condemnable events in recent months," the Venezuelan Foreign  Ministry states that there is "a systematic campaign by the  Haitian military sector to exterminate the Haitian Democratic  Movement and prevent a return to peace and institutional  normality."    The Venezuelan Government calls on Latin American and  Caribbean countries "to join efforts to end the situation of  violence and terror." It reiterates its support for OAS and UN  efforts to restore institutional norms to Haiti.    In conjunction with the United States, Canada, and France,  Venezuela forms part of the so-called "Friends of Haiti Group,"  which has tried to mediate the return of ousted President Jean-  Bertrand Aristide. Aristide took asylum in Venezuela for some  months after the military coup against him in September 1991.</p>

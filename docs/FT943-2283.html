			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola sales exceed estimates for third quarter Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, yesterday announced its third-quarter volume estimates ahead of third-quarter results because it said the figures 'significantly exceeded' stock market analysts' projections. The volume of soft drinks sold in international markets was expected to be 14 per cent ahead of last year, the company said, and in the US domestic market, 5 to 6 per cent ahead. Worldwide volume was expected to rise by about 12 per cent. For the first nine months of the year, volumes were expected to be 10 per cent higher internationally and 6 per cent higher in the US, making a total of 8 per cent worldwide. Analysts had been predicting a jump of 25 per cent in earnings per share, to 55 cents in the third quarter, reflecting a favourable comparison with last year's weak figures, and Coca-Cola said it was 'comfortable' with this. The shares were up Dollars 1 1/8 to close at Dollars 48 7/8 . Coca-Cola's large increase in volumes comes at a time when the company is facing competition from private label colas in some markets, particularly Canada and the UK. But the company said inroads by private label manufacturers had been more than outweighed by volume increases elsewhere.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- XINHUA reporter  recently interviewed a responsible person of the State General  Administration of Taxation and asked him some questions about  the value-added tax. The responsible person said: With the  State Council's approval, we have begun collection of the  value-added tax at production, wholesale, and retail stages.  The tax, with a uniform basic rate of 17 percent, is levied  only on the increased portion of the value at each stage. Some  people are worried that the collection of the value-added tax  will cause commodity price increases. Some enterprises construe  it as adding the 17-percent tax to the original selling price of  any commodity. Others think that the tax is collected on the  total value of a commodity both during its production and during  its marketing. None of these interpretations is correct.    The responsible person said: The collection of the  value-added tax will not cause price increases. It is because  the new tax is a conversion from the old product tax,  value-added tax and business tax; and it is only a change in the  mode of tax collection. During the conversion, we have not  increased the total tax burden. So, it should not cause any  changes in retail prices. Then, why do we generally collect the  value-added tax at the commodity production and wholesale  stages? The value-added tax is a common practice in foreign  countries, and it is much better than our old tax system of  collecting product taxes, value-added taxes, and business taxes  separately. First, the new tax rate is simpler, with a basic  tax rate of 17 percent and a preferential tax rate of 13  percent. In the old system, the value-added tax had 12  different rates, the business tax had four different rates, and  the product tax had several dozen different rates, making the  collection a very complex process. Next, the new procedures for  paying the value-added tax require a special invoice which  indicates all the value-taxes paid for the product earlier so  that they will be deducted from current payment and thus avoid  the old problem of double taxation. The separation of tax from  calculated price makes the tax amount clear at a glance.  Besides, the value-added tax is conducive to specialized  production.    The responsible person said: Some enterprises construe the  tax not included in the calculated prices as adding a 17-percent  tax to original selling price. This is a misinterpretation.  For a long time, China had practiced a tax-inclusive pricing  system in marketing commodities. So, the tax was included in  the selling prices of most commodities in the past. For  instance, if a commodity had a price tag of 100 yuan, its actual  price was 85.5 yuan and there was a tax of 14.5 yuan; but the  tax of 14.5 yuan was not separately indicated. The new  value-added tax system, unlike the old practice, requires  separate indication of commodity price and tax. In this way,  the price of a commodity at present actually consists two parts  before it reaches the retailer. Moreover, in selling a product,  the enterprise must make out a special value- added tax invoice  showing both the price of product and the tax amount. Take the  above-mentioned 100-yuan commodity, for instance. Its actual  price is 85.5 yuan, and the tax is 14.5 yuan. The tax amount is  17 percent of 85.5 yuan. So, it is evidently wrong to construe  the tax not included in the calculated prices as adding a  17-percent tax to the original selling price.    Then, why is it wrong to say that the value-added tax is  collected on the total value at both the production and  marketing stages? Because according to the regulations, the  value-added tax is levied on only the increased portion of the  value of a product, and the previously-paid value-added tax for  the product may be deducted. This is greatly different from the  old practice of collecting product tax according to selling  price. For instance, a garment factory pays 100 yuan plus a tax  of 17 yuan for material before making a garment. After the  garment is completed, the factory sells it for 150 yuan. The  value-added tax at this stage should be: 150 x 17 percent - 17 =  8.5 yuan. The formula may also be: (150-100) x 17 percent = 8.5  yuan. It is very clear that the value-added tax does not mean  collection of 17 percent of tax on the total value at both the  production and the marketing stages. The tax is levied only on  the increased portion of the value. The two interpretations are  greatly different from each other. Of course, I must make it  clear that we adhered to the principle of no change in total tax  burden in designing the value-added tax reform. The uniform tax  rate may reduce the tax burden of most enterprises, but will  perhaps increase the tax burden on a small number of enterprises  because their products carried less tax in the past. The  increased tax burden of enterprises can be compensated for by  the lower income tax rate and the abolition of the "two funds."  Besides, enterprises should offset the increased burden by  improving management and product quality and by lowering costs.  They should not solve the problem by raising prices.    The responsible person said: It merits our attention that  some enterprises at present deliberately drive up prices while  the new tax system has just begun and some people still lack  sufficient knowledge of it. Such unreasonable price increases  must be resolutely stopped.</p>

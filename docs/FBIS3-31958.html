The incidents reached peak intensity in Quito. Since early  in the morning, the areas surrounding public schools and  universities turned into the sites of bitter clashes between  demonstrators and the police who tried to keep the riots from  spreading to the city's downtown area. The situation was also  tense in other Ecuadoran cities in spite of the government's  announcement that it "will not permit any break of the peace."    The United Workers Front, the Federation of Secondary School  Students, and the National Union of Teachers called for "mass  protests" against the announced economic adjustment.  Reportedly, the adjustment will be limited to severe fuel price  increases of up to 70 percent.    The liberal government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen has  described the measure as "absolutely inevitable" because of the  collapse of the international price of oil, which is the  country's main source of income. The price drop is keeping the  country from receiving $1 million daily. In November, the  government proposed increasing taxes to compensate for the  budget deficit but the plan was rejected by Congress, which is  controlled by the opposition. The fuel price increase reportedly  will include the imposition of a new domestic marketing  structure for oil by-products, with the private sector competing  with the state enterprise -- currently a monopoly -- in the  framework of prices freely set by the supply and demand  mechanism.    All the parties, of both the right and the left, have spoken  out against the planned adjustment and are prepared to stop them  in Congress. Meanwhile, the United Workers Front announced its  decision to call for a "combative and indefinite" general strike.</p>

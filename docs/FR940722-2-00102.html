This order approves the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34084 (May 18, 1994), 59 FR 27092. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change modifies NSCC's clearing fund requirements for those NSCC members for which NSCC sponsors an account at The Depository Trust Company (``DTC''). The modified requirements are designed to more accurately reflect NSCC's risks associated with such sponsoring. The modified requirements also will be more consistent with the way in which NSCC and DTC address similar risks associated with dual NSCC/DTC members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently under certain situations, NSCC applies a factor in calculating its clearing fund requirements for members' non-continuous net settlement (``non-CNS'') activity ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , envelope settlement system activity''). <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The DTC settlement activity of members which NSCC sponsors into DTC (``sponsored members'') is included in the non-CNS calculation. The factor is applicable when a member's average daily envelope settlement system debits exceed the member's excess net capital. For the reasons set forth below, NSCC desires to eliminate application of the factor in the clearing fund calculation related to sponsored members' DTC settlement activity. In lieu thereof, NSCC has determined to add an additional advisory surveillance criteria to its guidelines for placing a member on surveillance status in order to cover circumstances where a sponsored member's average daily envelope settlement system debits plus its average daily DTC settlement debits exceed the sponsored member's excess net capital. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The factor is a number, calculated and adjusted in order to provide a minimum of one and a maximum of three, by which the member's non-CNS clearing fund requirement is multiplied in order to increase the requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Advisory surveillance status permits NSCC, among other things, to increase a member's clearing fund requirement 2.5% (or in the discretion of NSCC up to 5%) of the member's average daily non-CNS and non-mutual fund services debits plus 2.5% of the member's average daily non-CNS and non-mutual fund services credits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10, NSCC amended its clearing fund formula to permit the collection of additional clearing fund deposits from members using NSCC's envelope settlement system. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Calculation of the additional clearing fund deposits involved use of a factor. The primary purpose of the additional clearing fund deposits and the use of a factor was to better protect NSCC against the risks presented by the envelope settlement systems ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that securities delivered through the envelope settlement systems would not be available for return to the deliverer in the event the receiver were to become insolvent and be unable to pay for the delivery). However, NSCC did not limit the application of the factor to only the calculation of clearing fund requirements for physical envelope deliveries but also applied it in the calculation of clearing fund requirements associated with the DTC settlement activity of sponsored members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18852 (June 18, 1982), 47 FR 29426 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10] (order approving proposed rule change). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC believes that its current clearing fund formula, as applied to sponsored members, can result in excessive clearing fund requirements. NSCC believes that the risk associated with sponsored members' DTC settlement activities will be adequately addressed without the application of a factor. The proposed rule change, while eliminating the use of a factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with respect to DTC settlement activity, gives NSCC the ability to place a sponsored member on advisory surveillance status with an increased clearing fund requirement under the circumstances where previously the factor would have been applied. Furthermore, NSCC will continue to collect from each sponsored member a clearing fund deposit based not only on the member's NSCC settlement activities but also based on its DTC settlement activities. The portion of NSCC's clearing fund deposit based on DTC settlement activities generally will be the same amount the sponsored member would be required to deposit with DTC for that DTC settlement activity if the sponsored member had a regular account at DTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of clearing agencies be designed to assure the safeguarding of funds in the custody or control of clearing agencies or for which they are responsible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with NSCC that the elimination of the factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with respect to DTC settlement activity will more appropriately reflect the relevant risks and that it will be consistent with the way in which DTC addresses settlement risks for its members. At the same time, the Commission believes that the modified NSCC clearing fund formula provides for the collection of deposits adequate to protect NSCC from the risks associated with the DTC settlement activities of sponsored members. Accordingly, the modified clearing fund formula should result in a more equal distribution of the financial burdens placed on NSCC sponsored members while allowing NSCC to fulfill its statutory safekeeping obligation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

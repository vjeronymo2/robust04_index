			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Bovt and Svetlana Sukhova with follow-up </F> comment: "Russia and Brazil Will Increase Commodity Turnover  Sharply"]    [Text] Jose Eduardo do Andrade Vieira, minister of  industry, commerce and tourism of Brazil, and Oleg Davydov,  minister of foreign economic relations of Russia, yesterday  signed a statement of intent between the two countries on trade  and economic cooperation. The colossal Brazilian market is  opening up to Russian businessmen. It is attractive not just by  its size--Russia can operate thereon in the role not only of  exporter of raw material but of supplier of machinery,  equipment, and technology.    The present state of trade relations does not satisfy either  Brazil or Russia. According to Mr. Vieira, in 10 months of 1993,  Brazilian exports to Russia amounted to only $146 million  (Russian exports were only a little more). Trade is at times of  a sporadic nature--from one incidental contract to another--and  many transactions are effected via middlemen. The statement  signed yesterday, on the other hand, opens the Brazilian market  to Russian businessmen. It is planned within five years to reach  a commodity turnover level of a minimum of $2 billion (it will  in 1994 even have doubled compared with the present year). The  trade plans are notable not only for the bare figures alone, for  that matter: As distinct from trade with the West (where exports  to us are supported by government credit, as a rule), trade with  Brazil will be supported by credit from pools of commercial  banks. From the Russian side lines of credit will be provided,  it is anticipated, by, in particular, the Moscow Business Bank,  the Mezhkombank, the Imperial Bank, and the Export-Import Bank.    Brazil's big interest in the Russian market fits perfectly  well within the program of the encouragement of exports with a  simultaneous adjustment of foreign trade priorities which has  been announced by this country. The North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) will create certain problems for South  American commodities, nor is the European Union in any hurry  fully to open its doors to them. Russia and Brazil frequently  run into antidumping measures in respect to identical  commodities (textiles, aluminum, isobutanol, and such) on  European markets, incidentally. Besides expanding the  possibilities for the coordination of trade policy in third  countries, the statement signed yesterday creates a real basis  for the mutual--and conflict-free--realization of the foreign  trade plans of Russia and Brazil.    Thus, Russia, preoccupied with a restructuring of its  agricultural imports (hitherto largely oriented toward the  West), intends to pay more attention to purchases (together with  the traditional coffee and cocoa) of Brazilian soybeans, sugar,  and meat. A certain niche in Russian imports could be filled by  inexpensive Brazilian footwear also. The Brazilians, in turn,  are interested in Russian turbines and engines, chemical  fertilizers, and raw material for the chemical industry and  pharmaceuticals. The Lado do Brasil company, specializing in the  sale and service of VAZ automobiles, has already settled in on  the Brazilian market. Plans for the purchase from Russia of  specialized fishing vessels and floating fish-processing plants  and a research ship for Brazilian research in Antarctica were  agreed in the course of the Moscow negotiations.    Russia has long been mulling over plans for an outlet onto  the Latin American arms market. Brazil could become a good  springboard for products of Russia's aerospace complex. The  Brazilian side expressed once again in Moscow an interest in the  joint development of inertial-guidance systems for space-launch  vehicles. At Brazil's suggestion, a plan of Russia's  participation in the creation of a global information system,  which with the aid of 66 satellites would link all countries of  the world, is being developed. Brazil's Alcantara Cosmodrome, in  the state of Maranhao, would be used for the launches of these  satellites, which would reduce the cost of the project  considerably: The geographical location of the cosmodrome would  permit a savings at the time of the launch of up to 30 percent  of the rocket fuel.    [Boxed item]  <H3>  Enterprises That Participated in the Russian-Brazilian  Negotiations </H3>   --The Russian Finance Corporation --The Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Russia --The State  Investment Corporation --The Oboroneksport, Prodintorg, and  Obshchemasheksport all-Russia associations --The Agrarian  Technologies of Russia company --The Shipbuilders of St.  Petersburg joint-stock company --The Krylov Research Institute  --The Konversiya-Interservis Association --The Union of Aviation  Industry of Russia--Aviaprom and Myasishchev    [End box]    [Boxed item]  <H5>  International Life Department Comment </H5>   The results of the Brazilian delegation's visit were yet  further confirmation of Moscow's interest in the assimilation of  the Latin American market. Russia is counting on the states of  the region (specifically, Brazil, which ranks among the "new  industrial countries") that are prepared to purchase not only  Russian raw materials but also its finished products. Russia  could to some extent tackle problems of conversion here also,  having obtained access to an ample arms and dual-purpose  technology market. It has thus far belonged practically  exclusively to the United States. And it is not fortuitous that  a Russian exposition will appear for the first time at a  close-combat arms exhibition in Uruguay in April-May 1994.    The first attempts to organize broad-based cooperation with  Brazil were made a year ago, when Moscow was visited by a  delegation of the FINEP major government investment corporation.  Even at that time (as now also), the Brazilians supported the  creation of joint ventures in the field of telecommunications  and displayed an interest in solid-fuel rocket engines. This  approach objectively corresponds to Russia's interests: The  relocation overseas, primarily in the "new industrial  countries," of enterprises of the military-industrial complex  (in the form of joint ventures or affiliates) could to some  extent remove them from the heightened interest on the part of  Western competitors supporting strict control of Russian  research-intensive exports. But it remains an open question to  what extent it will be possible to avoid debate with the West  about which kind of technology Russia may export, and which,  not. And it cannot be ruled out that participation in the  reconstruction of Brazil's cosmodrome could, as in the case of  the infamous "Indian deal," cause an outcry in Washington.</p>

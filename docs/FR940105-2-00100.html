By letters dated June 14 and July 26, 1984, UCLA requested termination of Facility License No.  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> R&hyph;71. A ``Notice of Proposed Issuance of Orders Authorizing Disposition of Component Parts of Terminating Facility License'' was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on September 24, 1984 (49 FR 37484). Following hearings and stipulations on the license renewal and termination applications by the parties involved, an order was issued on November 8, 1985, by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that approved a Settlement Agreement dated September 30, 1985, between the Regents of the University of California, the Campus Committee to Bridge the Gap, and the staff of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission/NRC). The Order also terminated UCLA License No. R&hyph;71. The Settlement Agreement stipulated a timetable for the decommissioning of the UCLA facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By application dated October 29, 1985, as supplemented, UCLA submitted a Phase I decomissioning plan. An order authorizing Phase I dismantling of the UCLA facility and disposition of component parts was issued by the Commission on July 14, 1986. Phase I concerned the removal of all UCLA facility components except for the concrete building structure, concrete biological shield, components affixed to or embedded in the biological shield, the holdup tank, primary water pump, sump pump, compressor system, floor drains, decontamination sinks, and fuel storage pits. Phase I of decommissioning was completed on August 18, 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By application dated June 10, 1988, as supplemented, UCLA submitted its Phase II decommissioning plan. An order authorizing Phase II dismantling of the UCLA facility and disposition of component parts was issued by the Commission on July 28, 1989. Phase II decommissioning concerned the removal of components that remained after completion of Phase I decommissioning. When Phase II decommissioning was completed, UCLA submitted final survey information on January 4 and 28 and February 22, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reactor fuel has been removed from the core and shipped to a Department of Energy (DOE) facility. The UCLA reactor facility has been completely dismantled and all NRC and settlement agreement requirements pertaining to residual radioactivity, personnel and external radiation exposure, and fuel disposition have been met. Confirmatory radiological surveys verified that the UCLA facility met the recommended regulatory guidance for release of the facility for unrestricted use. Accordingly, the Commission has found that the UCLA facility has been dismantled and decontaminated pursuant to the Commission Orders dated July 14, 1986, and July 28, 1989, and the Settlement Agreement. Satisfactory disposition has been made of the component parts and fuel in accordance with the Commission regulations in title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) chapter I, and in a manner not inimical to the common defense and security, or to the health and safety of the public. Therefore, on the basis of the Settlement Agreement, applications filed by UCLA and pursuant to sections 104 and 161 b, i, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the UCLA facility is released for unrestricted use as of the date of this Order. In accordance with 10 CFR part 51, the Commission has determined that the issuance of this Order will have no significant environmental impact. The Environmental Assessment was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68445).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action see (1) UCLA final survey information dated January 4 and 28 and February 22, 1993, (2) the Settlement Agreement of September 30, 1985, (3) the Commission Safety Evaluation related to release of the UCLA facility for unrestricted use, (4) the Environmental Assessment, and (5) the ``Notice of Proposed Issuance of Orders Authorizing Disposition of Component Parts of Terminating Facility License,'' which was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on September 24, 1984 (49 FR 37484).

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> TRASH INCINERATOR TAKEOVER WILL AVOID SHUTDOWN  </P> <P> To avoid a shutdown of Long Beach's new trash-burning plant on Terminal Island,  the city is taking over the plant from the company that built it.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the city will pursue legal claims against that company, Dravo  Corp. of Pittsburgh, which has indicated it intends to sue the city for  additional construction and testing costs.  </P> <P> Dravo, insisting it has fulfilled its contract obligations, has also informed  the city it will soon pull out of the plant. To keep it running, the City  Council and the plant's governing board Tuesday voted to assume responsibility  for the facility and continue the contract with the company that is actually  operating the plant, Montenay Pacific Corp.  </P> <P> Using money from a construction escrow account, the city will attempt to finish  the repairs it says are necessary to get the plant running the way it is  supposed to. Officials also voted to stop any remaining payments on the $107  million plant and to pursue legal claims against Dravo for breach of contract.  </P></p>

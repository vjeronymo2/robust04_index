			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 24 April (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] is to decide about participation in a  government coalition at a delegates assembly following the  parliamentary elections in May. Until then, it will concentrate  on achieving a good result at the elections.    This earlier decision was confirmed on Sunday [24 April] in  Budapest, during a meeting by the party's National Council.    SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar reported about the  meeting  at a press conference. He said that if the SZDSZ achieves a good  result at the elections, that will imply a guarantee for  replacing the current government coalition, and for forming a  new government. Magyar also said that the chances of the SZDSZ  are now better than ever before, and the party will most  certainly be a political factor to be reckoned with when forming  the new government.    SZDSZ prime minister candidate Gabor Kuncze briefed  journalists about his participation in the founding session of  the Democratic Union of Slovakia, in Bratisla on Saturday [23  April], and his talks with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik,  who was elected chairman of the union.    Kuncze said the good will exists in Slovakia to settle  bilateral relations and uphold the dialogue.</p>

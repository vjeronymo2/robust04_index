A certified statement of such intent and reclamation shall be filed pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;7. The number of mining claims or sites that may properly qualify for a reclamation waiver pursuant to this paragraph is not restricted to a 10-claim limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Pursuant to the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act (50 U.S.C. appendix 565), military personnel on active duty status may, under certain conditions, qualify for an exemption from the performance of assessment work and the payment of maintenance fees.

Deferments are governed by the following conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If a petition for a deferment of assessment work, as required by &sect;3852.2 of this title, is filed with the proper BLM office on or before August 31 for a given year, the maintenance fee need not be paid on the claims listed in the petition for deferment until the authorized officer has acted upon the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If the petition is granted, maintenance fees for the claims are deferred for the upcoming assessment year.

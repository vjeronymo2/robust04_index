"Forcing upon the developing countries market opening and  liberalisation of foreign trade with the economic `aid' as the  lever is an important feature of the neo-colonial method the  imperialists are employing," he noted, adding: "Market opening  and liberalisation of foreign trade are, in actuality, for the  stronger to overpower the weaker."    "As the reality shows, in consequence of the neo-colonial  policy of the imperialists, the developing countries are daily  getting poorer and the bipolarization of `the rich gets richer  and the poor poorer' is now expanding worldwide, and this deals  a hard blow at the developed capitalist and imperialist  countries, too", he stated.    He stressed the need to abolish the old international  economic order based on neo-colonialism and establish a new fair  one based on democratic principles.    "It is important," he said, "to democratise the  international  economic relations so that all the countries and all the nations  may exercise the sovereignty, irrespective of their size and  strength, and disparity in wealth. For this purpose, an end  must be put to the unfair old international economic order such  as unfair division of labour, dependent trading structure,  non-equivalent exchange and predatory monetary and financial  system which are forced by imperialism today. If a fair  international economic order is to be established, the  developing countries must be independent in economy. For this,  the developing countries must, first of all, adhere to the  principle of self-reliance. They must actively develop  South-South cooperation on the principle of collective  self-reliance."    In the second part of the report, he stressed the need to  establish a fair international political order. "If the  developing countries are to be freed from the neo-colonial yoke,  it is important for them to have political sovereignty," the  reporter noted, and added:    "What is essential to the establishment of political  sovereignty is to unite the popular masses as an independent  political motive force capable of shaping their destiny by their  own efforts with an independent fighting target."    The reporter quoted His Excellency Kim Chong-il as saying:    "The decisive guarantee of victory in the revolutionary  struggle and constructive work is to strengthen the party, the  general staff of the revolution, and closely unite the masses of  people around the party and the leader and thus reinforce the  driving force of the revolution."    He noted:    "Unity is the life and soul of an independent driving force  and the source of its invincible strength.    "The imperialists who are seeking economic subjugation and  political domination are most afraid of the unity of the popular  masses into one independent motive force and resort to the  splittist moves to obstruct it. One of such manoeuvres of the  imperialists is the `multiparty parliamentary democracy' of  Western style forced on the developing countries.    "The `multiparty parliamentary democracy' is the application  of the principle of free competition to the political arena,  which is aimed at setting up a political domination system  commensurate with the economic domination system.    "What the people of the developing countries need is not  `multiparty parliamentary democracy' of the West but an  independent political system which can ensure the unity of  patriotic forces under the banner of independence against  imperialism.    "Therefore, the people of the African countries should  develop by themselves a political formula conducive to the unity  of all the patriotic forces in conformity with the specific  conditions of their countries. What is important here is to  reject the interference of all outside forces in their internal  affairs and establish a democratic order strictly defending the  sovereignty of each country in the international community. All  the countries should reject any privilege and interference in  other's internal affairs ignoring the principle of fairness and  international justice in the international relations and develop  friendship and unity and cooperation on the principle of  equality and mutual benefit."    In the third part, the reporter said that all the victories  and achievements of the Korean people in building a new  independent society are results of the application of the chuche  idea.    "The reality of Korea proves that the chuche idea which  regards independence as the life and soul of the country and the  nation and sets it as the basic way of building a new society to  strengthen the motive force and enhance its role is, indeed, the  guiding idea of the revolution and construction with invincible  vitality," the reporter noted, and said:    "We should make sincere efforts for the building of a new  independent society by creatively applying the universal truth  of the chuche idea to the specific conditions of our countries  and strengthen international cooperation among the peoples  aspiring after independence. We should resolutely oppose the  moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries who are  obstructing the reunification of Korea and wage a more powerful  international solidarity movement in support of the  reunification of Korea."</p>

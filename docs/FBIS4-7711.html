			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by SRNA Journalist Mirjana Kusmuk] </F>   [Text] We have learned from the Serbian Army Command in  Rogatica that Muslim forces were fiercely attacking Serbian  defense lines today from the direction of Gorazde along the  lines of Mesici-Jabucko Sedlo and Ustipraca-Kopaci using all  available weapons. The Muslim attempts at breaking through were  successfully repelled and, according to Colonel Dragisa Masal,  commander of the Visegrad Tactical Group, in these battles a  score of Muslim soldiers were killed while there were no  casualties in the ranks of the Serbian Army.    We have learned from intelligence sources of the Serbian  Army  in Rogatica that battles were again waged in Gorazde today  between forces loyal to the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo and  those who favor seeking a peaceful solution through agreements  with the Serbs. Shots are being heard in the town during the  entire day today and, according to the radio messages that have  been monitored, there have been casualties on both sides. In a  general panic, the civilian population of Gorazde is leaving the  town and trying to go toward Sarajevo via Orahovice and Grebak.    According to well-informed Serbian military sources,  Abduselam Sijeric (Belam), the Muslim commander responsible for  the death of more than 300 Gorazde Serbs, was seriously wounded  in inter-Muslim battles in Gorazde. Forces loyal to Izetbegovic  under the command of Serif Buljubasic, which are mostly  comprised of Muslims who had arrived from [word indistinct], are  accusing Gorazde Muslims of an unsuccessful beginning of the  long-planned offensive against Serbian positions in the  direction of Cajnice, Rogatica, Srbinje, and Ustipraca. Open  clashes between Muslims in Gorazde took place after this  morning's raids in the town and arrests of military draftees who  had not responded to summons to mobilization, as well as the  execution of several deserters who were supposed to serve as  examples to others.    The meeting held today between Radovan Karadzic, president  of  the Srpska republic, and Major General Manojlo Milovanovic,  chief of the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic,  with General Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, touched upon the  current situation in Gorazde and the obligations of the army of  the Srpska republic and UNPROFOR toward the peace process. As  Gen. Milovanovic said after the meeting, special attention was  devoted to protected zones in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the obligations that UNPROFOR should meet in Srebrenica and Zepa.    Also discussed at the meeting was the realization of  obligations taken in the Sarajevo region. Gen. Milovanovic  pointed out that obligations are mostly met according to the  agreement between representatives of the army of the Srpska  republic and UNPROFOR from the meeting held on 9 February.    In reply to journalists' questions regarding the situation  in  Gorazde, Gen. Rose said that he does not know for sure what is  happening in that town and that he cannot rely on reports by  television stations such as CNN. He announced that, with a view  to getting a more complete insight into the situation in the  region, he will personally travel to Gorazde on Wednesday [6  April].    The meeting between Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the  Srpska republic, and Andreas (Kuhn), representative of the  International Red Cross Committee, is under way at the building  of the presidency of the Srpska republic at Pale. The topic of  the meeting is the current situation in Prijedor.</p>

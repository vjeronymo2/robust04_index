			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edwin Gongora from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Drug expert Carlos Aviles reported that U.S. Embassy  personnel are involved in a drug network in El Salvador. Aviles  added that the incident which resulted in the death of  Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Rivera can only be explained by his  emotional state as Rivera's autopsy revealed that he had used a  considerable amount of marijuana and meta-amphetamines  [metanfetaminas]. The drug expert said meta-amphetamines are  only produced in the United States, thus the officer had brought  it into the country and committed a serious crime by doing so.    [Begin Aviles recording] How does this make the U.S. Army  and  Government look? How do they look when one of their soldiers  brings meta-amphetamines from the United States to our country?  Drug consumption....[pauses] Marijuana is a drug that Rivera  could have bought here or in Guatemala, but it is still a very  serious crime. This shows that our government must take a  stronger stand and demand that foreign personnel in our country  meet some basic requirements. [end recording]    Aviles thinks our nation is not respected because we do not  require members of U.S. military delegations to pass drug tests.    [Begin Aviles recording] I have said this for several  months.  I have said that we must stricter. Nationalism is not something  found only in songs. It requires us to ensure that our  Constitution and laws are respected. Unfortunately, nobody has  paid any attention to me. Today we sadly see how another  scandal has erupted that has shown not only that the officer  used marijuana and meta- amphetamines but that meta-amphetamines  are powerful, synthetic stimulants that make cocaine look like  breath mints. [end recoding]    According to Aviles, U.S. diplomats should practice what  they  preach in U.S. counternarcotics efforts because this is not the  first time U.S. Embassy personnel have been involved in  drug-related incidents.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Surveyors do not have the authority to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> binding enforcement determinations; rather, either HCFA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State makes binding enforcement determinations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with criteria at &sect;488.452.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.406&blank;Available Remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While analyzing the comments for this section, we again  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed the provisions of the Act to ensure conformance in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final regulation. In doing so, we noted that proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.206(c) did not include the remedies of civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties, temporary management, and closure of the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and transfer of residents, or their equivalents, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing of available remedies. We have also clarified that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of what other additional remedies a State may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have approved, the State must establish, at a minimum, those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified remedies, or an approved alternative to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified remedy, that is, termination, State monitoring,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of payment for new admissions, closure of a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the State in emergency situations and/or transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents, civil money penalties, and temporary management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are correcting this oversight in this final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, during the process of reviewing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzing comments, we added another remedy. This remedy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed in-service training, is described in the discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;488.425.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, since the proposed &sect;488.228, ``Alternative or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional State remedies'', contained virtually the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information as this section, we are eliminating the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.228 and moving the remaining non-duplicative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions to this section. All comments received in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to proposed &sect;488.228 are being included and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One of the major concerns expressed throughout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the comments was that it should be possible to address many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or most instances of facility noncompliance through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditional plan of correction. Several commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that plan of correction should be added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list of possible remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A plan of correction is a minimum requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any facility with deficiencies other than those isolated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual harm with a potential for minimal harm, and, as for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other providers and suppliers, it is not considered an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement remedy. Therefore, while we are clarifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation to require that a facility complete and submit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan of correction each time deficiencies are noted (other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines constitute no actual harm with a potential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimal harm), we are not adding plan of correction to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing of available remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters expressed concerns that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed remedies are punitive rather than corrective in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature, excessively burdensome in relationship to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies, too harsh or that they will direct the focus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> away from resident care, thereby having a negative effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long term care. Some commenters stated that the remedies do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not allow for one time digressions from a facility's history  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of compliance. Others believed that the proposed remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would threaten job security for nursing home staff or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> security of facility residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As indicated in response to the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, many commenters assumed that it was not possible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a plan of correction as the only corrective measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required in a facility, even when the deficiencies were of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low degree of seriousness. In this final regulation, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledge that a traditional plan of correction may be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only measure needed to correct deficiencies in some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities which have only lower level deficiencies. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we believe that using plans of corrections in this fashion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should alleviate some of the concerns expressed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters, we do not accept the notion that the use of more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severe remedies for more severe deficiencies is excessive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There can be little question that the Congress was concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about what it concluded was an unsatisfactory enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheme prior to nursing home reform. As a result, it wrote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the law a series of remedies that it expects to be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should circumstances at individual facilities warrant. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driving force behind the legislation in this context was to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the Secretary and the States with the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggressively enforce the Act's new requirements in a way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would discourage facility noncompliance that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress believed to be widely evident between surveys, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereby, to encourage lasting compliance. The design of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these enforcement rules provides for incrementally more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severe remedies as cited noncompliance is more egregious.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not believe that an enforcement approach styled this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way is harsh or excessive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

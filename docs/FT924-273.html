			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Invesco director quits after board power struggle MR NICHOLAS Johnson has resigned as a director of Invesco MIM and head of the fund management group's non-American operations following a boardroom power struggle with Mr Charles Brady, Invesco's recently-appointed chief executive. Mr Johnson's departure on Christmas Eve means that Mr Brady, who built up the group's Atlanta operations, has emerged as the key figure in the group. Mr Brady and Mr Johnson were joint deputy chairmen until Mr Brady pipped Mr Johnson for the chief executive's post in July after Lord Stevens stepped down following pressure from non-executive directors. Lord Stevens has stayed on as chairman but is to relinquish the post at the group's annual meeting in April. The latest boardroom changes come after a difficult year for Invesco in Britain, and further consolidate the grip held over the group by its US businesses. Invesco MIM manages around Pounds 34bn worldwide, but about two-thirds of that is managed from the US. While the North America operations are highly profitable and now dwarf those in Europe and the Pacific, the group has been dogged by adverse publicity in Britain which has undermined the group's ability to attract new clients. The group's links with Mr Robert Maxwell, the disgraced tycoon, caused embarrassment in the aftermath of the publisher's death. Invesco was also fined Pounds 75,000 by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation for accounting failures relating to its Personal Equity Plans. More recently, the group agreed to pay compensation to investors in Drayton Consolidated, the investment trust managed by Invesco, which specialised in unquoted stocks before it was put into liquidation by shareholders last month. Mr Brady is expected to announce further boardroom changes at Invesco. Peregrine Investments, the Hong Kong securities house backed by some of the colony's most powerful businessmen, lifted its stake in Invesco to just over 24 per cent last month.</p>

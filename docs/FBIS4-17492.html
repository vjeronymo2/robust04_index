			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federation Council entirely shares the position  of the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding the situation in the  former Yugoslavia, Chairman of the International Affairs  Committee of the Parliament's Upper Chamber Vladimir Podoprigora  declared in an interview with Interfax on Friday. He underlined  that during the visit of the Russian parliamentary delegation to  Strasbourg he said at the sitting of the Parliamentary Assembly  of the European Council that one should take into consideration  Russia's opportunity to influence the situation in Yugoslavia to  a greater extent. "One should not resort to arms until all  other opportunities are used. Now the Russian Foreign Ministry  is sticking to this position and we entirely share it," said  Podoprigora.    He pointed out that in contrast to the State Duma there are  no contradictions on this issue within the Federation Council  and said that the lower chamber had sent its own delegation to  Yugoslavia in order to clarify its position.    However, as Podoprigora said, "deputies should interfere in  practical policy only in extreme cases, their aim is to  determine foreign political strategy and decide on how to  coordinate foreign policy with the Constitution and current  legislation."    Podoprigora said that according to the Constitution the  president determines foreign policy and the parliament prepares  decrees. That's why the Federation council does not intend to  consider issues on Russian policy in Yugoslavia at its sittings,  said Podoprigora.</p>

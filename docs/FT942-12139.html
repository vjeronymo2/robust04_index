			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: Museum for our time - As the Tate expands into Bankside, William Packer applauds the principle but wonders where it will all end So Bankside it is. Last Thursday the rumour of recent weeks was confirmed, that after months of agonising the Tate's Trustees had opted for Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's monumental power house on the Southwark side of the river, opposite Saint Paul's, and that London at last was to get its long-awaited, much-needed Gallery of Modern Art. Long-awaited indeed, for the possibility was mooted the moment the Tate immediately out-grew its extension of the mid-1970s. But much-needed? The answer has to be a resounding Yes - that is if we accept the need for national museums of any kind. And the reasons are of principle rather than circumstance. There are, of course, countless justifications of opportunity  -the inaugural press-conference rang with them - from the incidental conservation of a great building; the creation of jobs within the local community and the regeneration of the locality, to the encouragement of investment in the City; the stimulation of international cultural tourism and the great exhibitions that might at last come to London. As it is, the Tate Gallery and its satellites at Liverpool and St Ives already attract some 2.5 million visitors a year, and the new gallery would expect to achieve nearly 2 million a year on its own account within five years of its opening in the year 2000. Such arguments are perhaps the more immediately persuasive, certainly to ministers and councillors, sponsors and administrators. Enabling practicalities, spin-offs and pay-offs are not to be sniffed at. But all this is secondary: the first and only reason why we need a museum of modern art at all is because art is always with us, and all true art is modern art in its time. We would betray ourselves if we had not the confidence to look critically at the achievement of our own times and to hold it in trust for the future to form its own judgment, just as we now value what is left to us of the past. The problem is only that the field is so vast. Here is the opportunity to address the job properly. The Victorians never had difficulty in seeing themselves and their achievement in the light of history, and the National Gallery had happily been hanging contemporary British painting in the context of the older European schools. But by the end of the century the British collections had grown too large to hold at Trafalgar Square. Sir Henry Tate's Gallery was opened in 1897 as our museum of British art, from the 16th century to the present, and has gone on collecting British painting and drawing, prints and sculpture ever since. In monitoring the currency of activity, however, it has always been necessary to acquire far more than could ever be shown at once. If that created a problem just with British art in the 20th century, by how much more was it increased as the collections were extended into international fields. The process was slow at first, and piecemeal. The first Degas came in 1916, Monet in 1926, Cezanne in 1927, Van Gogh, Picasso and Matisse in 1933. Only since the war, with regular purchase grants available from central funds, have both the British and international collections been able to grow more by policy than by the happy chance of gift or bequest. Thus the Tate has been doing three things at once: maintaining the historic collection of the British School; continuing to monitor its current development within both British and international contexts; and establishing a comprehensive collection of the international art of the 20th century. Each of these duties is incremental: all are heavy in the demands they make in money and space. The colonisation of Bankside will allow scope for the comprehensive presentation of 20th century art, with the British School taking its proper place. The Tate at Millbank will be free once more to present the British School in its historic development, from the earliest to the latest moment. What actual policies will emerge, and whether they will be generously catholic or conventionally avant-garde, remain to be seen, but such caveats in no way moderate the splendid opportunities that now present themselves. But time runs on, and art won't stop. The question remains hanging in the air: will our descendants of the mid-2090s be looking at yet another redundant edifice - Canary Wharf perhaps, or Terminal 4 - as a home for our national collections of the art of the 21st century, with all their special needs of jiggery and pokery and, above all, space? And will they be as excited, as we are at the prospect of Bankside? We shall see.</p>

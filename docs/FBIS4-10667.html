			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana  radio and television in Spanish between 12 and 14 April.    Radio Reloj at 1945 GMT on 12 April reports that the goal of  Havana Province's Agro-94 is to harvest 1.5 million quintals of  tubers and vegetables. Potatoes constitute 900,000 quintals of  this figure. A portion of this amount is to be distributed  directly to the population and the rest stored in refrigerated  facilities. The breakdown of the expected harvest is 190,000  quintals of carrots, 240,000 quintals of cabbage, and 130,000  quintals of plantains .    Cuba Vision Network at 0000 GMT on 13 April reports that an  animal feed factory, the first in Cuba, is under construction in  Primero de Enero Municipality, Ciego de Avila Province. The  factory, which is 60 percent completed, uses Cuban technology  and will produce 750 tons of feed daily. The product will be  enriched with oils and honey, producing a Cuban feed that will  serve, basically, to replace imported feed for poultry and pigs  in Ciego de Avila Province.    In the same newscast, Cuba Vision Network reports that a  bridge that is almost finished along the Caibarien-Cayo Santa  Maria causeway is considered the biggest of its kind in Cuba.  The bridge is over 7 meters high and 350 meters long and is  expected to be finished by 21 April.    Radio Reloj at 1934 GMT on 13 April reports that the  fishfarming center in Cumanayagua Municipality, Cienfuegos  Province, has promised to produce over 7 million tilapia fry by  the end of this year to be sown at dams and minidams. The radio  also reports, from Cienfuegos, that a 2.5-megawatt  turbogenerator has been installed at the Espartaco complex in  Palmira.    Radio Reloj at 1940 GMT on 13 April reports that 250,000  campers have used campsites from January to date. During a press  conference, Francisco Rodriguez, operations director of the  National People's Camping Enterprise [Empresa Nacional de  Campismo Popular], announced that, with a view to improving  campsites, the price of lodgings and equipment rentals will be  raised as of 1 May.    Radio Reloj at 1943 GMT on 13 April reports that 130,000  poles of tobacco have been collected to date by the cooperatives  and small farmer sectors in Los Palacios, Pinar del Rio  Province, a quantity that represents 50 percent of the plan for  the current harvest.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 13 April reports that Cuba  expects to be ready to test a Cuban-made cholera vaccine in some  Latin American country by the end of the year. Cuba is employing  genetic engineering to produce the vaccine.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 14 April carries an 1-minute  interview with Colonel (Rene Alvarez Perez), chief of the Giron  de Victoria unit in Havana Province, who says that members of  the unit are supporting the potato harvest and that 630,000  quintals of potatoes and 29,000 quintals of carrots have been  harvested. The unit has surpassed the original objective of  500,000 quintals of potatoes. This force of approximately 1,800  men has worked in six municipalities.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 14 April reports that the  British tourist operation company Sun World will tender its  letter of credentials in Cuba to begin operations on the Santa  Lucia beach in Camaguey Province. It intends to bring the first  tourists by next month. The same report adds that at the close  of the first quarter this year, as compared to the same period  the previous year, Cubanacan's regional administration has  reported an increase in the number of tourists brought to this  northern coast beach.    The same newscast reports that the National Poultry Complex,  the CAN, is celebrating its 30th anniversary. Agriculture  Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales said that the CAN represents an  example of organization, integrity, and efficiency. Despite  difficulties affecting the supply of raw materials and other  resources necessary for egg and poultry production, egg  production has increased during the first quarter of this year.  The CAN is capable of processing its own raw materials and to  carry out complete production.    Radio Rebelde in the same newscast reports that  approximately  500,000 tons of potatoes have been harvested in Matanzas  Province with 15 caballerias yet to be harvested. This forecasts  a lower result than expected. The setbacks this time are related  to the appearance of insects. In Las Tunas Province, 1,240  caballerias of sugarcane were weeded during the past 10 days and  50 caballerias of cane were planted.</p>

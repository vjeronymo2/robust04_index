			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Bank supervision The Bank of England will have less excuse for dithering in the event of another BCCI now that it is to acquire the power to deny licences to banks whose structure is unduly complex or secret. Even without that power it could have acted sooner, as is manifestly clear from yesterday's Bingham report. Had it done so, depositors might have suffered smaller losses, but it would be wrong to suppose that the outcry would have been any less shrill. The danger - amid all the undoubtedly justified recrimination - is that the public will conclude that perfect supervision can create a world where bank deposits are always free of risk. A deposit market which differentiates risk through pricing is a useful discipline on bank managements to whom the funds are entrusted. It only works, though, if depositors heed the message in the price, especially large ones like local authorities.</p>

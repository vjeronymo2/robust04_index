			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Peru may settle ship deal debt with banks An important barrier between Peru and its commercial banking creditors may be lifted soon. A congressional commission investigating a long-standing government debt with Chemical Bank and American Express Bank has recommended it should be recognised and, by implication, settled. The controversial debt is small in money terms - some Dollars 36m principal, now worth perhaps twice that with unpaid interest - but large in political significance. It arose in 1981 when the state shipping line CPV bought two cargo ships which proved virtually unusuable. Chemical and American Express financed the purchase under a leasing agreement. Alleging irregularities, President Alan Garcia's 1985-90 government refused to recognise the debt, a position initially assumed by current President Alberto Fujimori. But the Citibank-led advisory committee which represents some of the biggest of Peru's more than 200 commercial banking creditors, has insisted the debt be settled before negotiations are opened. The commission found 'no evidence that the entities which financed the operation acted irregularly'. Blame was laid at the doors of CPV officials and former ministers. Peru's congress still has to ratify the commission's recommendation. But, assuming the government majority has its way and the administration then accepts the decision to pay, long-delayed renegotiations over Peru's Dollars 7bn debt with the commercial banks should soon be under way.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / India opens door to Rs10bn foreign investments THE Indian government has approved foreign investments totalling Rs10.2bn (Pounds 220m), including plans for two oil refineries, a steel mill, a cement works and a tyre factory. The decisions take to about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.3bn), the total amount of foreign investment approved by the authorities since the launch of reforms by Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, in mid-1991. This compares with less than Dollars 1bn in the previous decade, but is still well short of the much larger sums invested each year in China, Indonesia and other fast-growing east Asian economies. The actual flow of direct investment has been smaller than the total approved - about Dollars 400m from mid-1991 to the end of May 1993. Final decisions on some larger projects - such as power stations and oil refineries - take time to complete. The latest batch of approvals, cleared by the cabinet committee on foreign investment on Friday, include two proposals by the Oman Oil Company, owned by the Omani government, to take 26 per cent stakes in two 6m-tonnes-a-year oil refineries - one in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, where the partner is Bharat Petroleum, and the second in the western state of Maharashtra, in partnership with Hindustan Petroleum. The Indian partners, both state enterprises, will hold 26 per cent stakes, with the rest of the capital to be offered to the public. Oman is considering investing Rs3.47bn in the Madhya Pradesh refinery, which will cost a total of Rs45bn, and Rs2bn in the Rs30bn Maharashtra project. The other projects approved were a Rs16.5bn steel mill, in which a group of Indians living in Dubai plan to invest Rs4bn, a Rs5.25bn cement plant, which will be built with support from F L Smidth, a leading Danish cement maker; and a Rs4bn tyre factory in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, where the investor is Mr Frederick Harrison, an American lawyer.</p>

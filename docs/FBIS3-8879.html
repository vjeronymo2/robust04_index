			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Marcela Feraru report: "Daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI has </F> Submitted a Complaint to the Council of Europe About President  Ion Iliescu Violating the Human Rights Convention"]    [Text] One year ago, that is, on 13 May 1993, Romanian  President Ion Iliescu suspended the accreditation of the  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI daily to Cotroceni Palace [Romanian  Presidency]. Our journalists were banned from participating in  news conferences given by the president and their access to the  presidential palace or close to the president's circle at  various events or visits throughout the country or abroad was  banned, because they are guilty of publishing a figure that  represented the salary that President Iliescu was about to  receive after a vote in the parliament.    The requests of the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI to have the  accreditation returned remained without response. Currently,  our daily continues to be submitted to presidential sanctions.  In these conditions, in which the domestic means of attack have  been exhausted, the only solution to settle this situation,  which involves the violation of a fundamental principle of the  European Convention on Human Rights -- the free access to  information -- remains to bring it to the attention of the  Council of Europe [CE]. We wish to note that we are not talking  about the rights of our paper, but the rights of our readers --  those people who are paying their taxes to the state and thus  participate in supporting the expenses of the presidency -- to  be informed about President Ion Iliescu's activity.    As a matter of fact, the situation is already known by the  Strasbourg Forum. The documents of the rapporteurs on Romania,  completed on the occasion of the procedure of admitting our  country to the Council of Europe, also mentions that the  accreditation of certain papers that criticize the leadership  has been suspended and it is suggested that this problem should  be solved immediately. The same issue can also be found in  Document 6953, which was distributed to European  parliamentarians at the 1994 January session, a document that  was initiated by Daniel Tarschys, president of the Liberal  political group.    We must note that, for the time being, the citizens of  Romania do not have the possibility to turn to the European  Court of Human Rights because -- in contradiction to the latest  affirmations of Florin Radulescu Botica, Social Democracy Party  of Romania [PDSR] senator -- the European Convention on Human  Rights has not been submitted to the parliament for  ratification. We are quoting a passage from Notification Number  176 in connection with Romania's request to be admitted to the  Council of Europe: "The Assembly attaches great importance to  the promises made by the Romanian authorities to sign and ratify  expeditiously the European Convention on Human Rights (Article  25 of the Convention) as well as the compulsory jurisdiction of  the European Court for Human Rights (Article 46 of the  Convention)."    In these conditions, our daily has decided to draw the  attention of the presidents of the two commissions that, on the  basis of the Halonen directive, are supervising the  implementation of the commitments assumed by Romania when it was  accepted to the Council of Europe:    Esteemed Mr. President:    Through you and through the commission that you head, we  turn  to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to ask  you to intercede with the Council of Europe through the  procedural means available to you, in order to put an end to the  violation of one of the fundamental standards of European  democracy, namely the freedom of the press and the right to have  free access to information.    We are referring to the act of banning the journalists of  our  publication, that is, the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI daily, from being  present at news conferences organized by Romania's president, as  well as banning them from all sources of information connected  with the activity of the presidential institution. This measure  was taken precisely as a punishment for articles and critical  news items that were published in our newspaper about the policy  promoted by the president or the government.    We would like to mention that the newspaper EVENIMENTUL  ZILEI  is the most popular daily in Romania and has three daily issues,  and that it is obvious that, precisely for this reason, out of  all the independent papers published in Romania, EVENIMENTUL  ZILEI is the most severely sanctioned, thus the most important  source in the written press is being obstructed.    This illegal punitive measure was adopted on 13 May 1993 and  it has not been lifted, either after our repeated requests or  upon the public's request; it has not been lifted upon the  recommendation of the Council of Europe either, which was  included clearly in the reports of Messrs. Friedrik Koenig and  Gunnar Jansson [Council of Europe rapporteurs].    Apart from the material and moral loss suffered by our  newspaper as a result of the lack of possibility to relate  various information from its own sources regarding the  presidential institution, the greatest damage is suffered by the  Romanian public itself, which is missing the possibility of  having complete and unhampered access to information.    We would like to add to the above that it was the same  presidential institution that, meantime, brought a series of  criminal charges against us for the most-aberrant crimes  imagineable. The fact that the respective trials had the purpose  of intimidating us and hampering us in our action to freely  exercise our profession is also proved by the fact that every  time the procedures began, the president withdrew the charges  and abandoned the act as unexpectedly as he had started it.    In accordance with the normal procedures, we would have  liked  to turn to the European Court of Human Rights with our problem,  however, unfortunately, we still do not have this possibility  because Romania, in spite of its pledges, has not, to this very  day, ratified the European Convention on Human Rights. We  reserve the right that after the ratification of the respective  Convention, we can turn to the Court of Justice in Strasbourg.  However, considering that the act of finding solutions to this  problem can no longer be delayed, we are turning to you for  support.    Within this context we also express our dissatisfaction with  the unjustified slow pace with which the current leadership is  going through the procedural moves of ratifying the European  Convention on Human Rights.    We thank you for the attention you pay to our problem and we  express our hope that the actions that you are going to take  will be effective and will be in favor of democracy.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFS: MINKOW: 'COMPULSIVE'  </P> <P> Barry Minkow was a "compulsive debtor" who had an uncontrollable need for  millions of dollars the way a drug addict needs a fix, his defense lawyer said  Friday. In a report filed for his sentencing Monday on 57 fraud counts stemming  from the 1987 collapse of his ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company, lawyers for  Minkow recanted the young entrepreneur's defense that the mob forced him into  committing the fraud and said Minkow was the victim of an unhappy childhood.  "The true story of ZZZZ Best is of a young man almost constantly in debt,  struggling to prove that he will not become the failure depicted by his  father," attorney David E. Kenner said in his report. "In Barry Minkow's case,  the hoped for 'Big Fix' was the infusion of new funds -- funds that he could  only obtain through activities that caused his prosecution."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shemsedin Memia: "Ryerson's Paradox Illustrated </F> in Own Words"]    [Text] The last U.S. diplomat left Albania in 1939 to  return again after a lapse of nearly four decades. Embassies  are now reopening and diplomats are knocking at the door....  William Ryerson is totally committed to his job, and expresses  satisfaction with what he has done in the past two years. What  our people were looking forward to, and what they expected from  him, was U.S. investment in Albania. He sidesteps this issue,  however, saying that "investments are expected to come only from  private U.S. companies," and that "the delay is a result of the  hurdles placed in the path of the Property Law." This law,  however, has already been 90 percent implemented by our  government. Is this simply a slip of the tongue, or it is his  suspicions that prompt him to say this? Is this the truth, or  it is just false information from the Albanian media?    Further, he adds that "one other decisive factor for the  involvement of U.S. companies in Albania is the restoral of  peace in Bosnia." Thus, there is a pretty long list of excuses  to justify the failure to keep past promises. What are the  arguments? Are they mere exercises in face-saving? Ryerson  himself brought to Albania a lot of warships, and the chemical  fertilizers and pesticides that are so badly needed by our poor  agriculture. That is why the Albanians "appreciated" Ryerson's  presence at the ceremony to commemorate the first anniversary of  our policymakers' coming to power and at several award  ceremonies, even various pioneers' events. In order simply to  get rid of Fatos Nano, who used to irritate Mr. Ryerson, they  found a pretext to imprison him. From now on, I believe Mr.  Ryerson will be left in peace to address his compliments to his  excellency the president and describe him as "the man who is  sacrificing himself for the sake of Albania." In addition, Mr.  Ryerson expresses joy over Albania's stability, freedom of  speech, and freedom of the press! Dictatorship, he says, does  not exist any more!    One can understand the reluctance of U.S. investors who,  before coming to Albania, have to consult with Mr. Ryerson, or  who are still waiting for the wars to end (God forbid that the  warnings that the wars have only just begun should come true),  but why do people from the Albanian diaspora in the United  States and other countries not come to Albania? Are they scared  by the "sweet" words of Mr. Ryerson, the U.S. plenipotentiary in  Albania? It seems that U.S. and other foreign investors do not  like tranquility and stability, or else they are astute enough  to realize that there is some truth behind the diplomat's words.</p>

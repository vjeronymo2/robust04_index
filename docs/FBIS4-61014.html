At the  same time, it was emphasized once again the the EU accepts the  Estonian law on foreigners and its legal logic.    The ambassadors who attended the meeting noted that the EU's  position on troop withdrawal remains the same, which means that  the Russian troops must leave Estonia unconditionally by 31  August. The EU has also notified the Russian Federation of this  position.    Juri Luik provided a progress report about the registration  of aliens as well as about reorganization of the citizenship and  immigration department.</p>

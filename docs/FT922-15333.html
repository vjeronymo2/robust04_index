			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Sweeteners - Ballot Box The Sugar Bureau, which speaks on scientific matters for the industry, reckons that John Major, Paddy Ashdown and Neil Kinnock are each burning up at least 3,500 calories a day - more than twice the daily requirement of the average male - during the election campaign. It recommends a diet of carbohydrates: potatoes, rice cereals and pasta for the starch, and fruit and vegetables for the sugar. That is the way to release the hormone serotonin in the brain which, the bureau says, 'induces a feeling of well-being'.</p>

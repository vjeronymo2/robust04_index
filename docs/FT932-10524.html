			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / War-war overshadows jaw-jaw: Palestinian deaths have more relevance than Washington talks to attempts to bring peace to the Middle East THE BLACK limousines which daily ferry the Arab and Israeli delegations to the State Department provide an illusion of progress in the Middle East peace talks. But what is happening in the region is proving more important than any developments around the negotiating table. In the past fortnight, 17 Palestinians have been shot dead by Israeli troops in the occupied territories and many more have been wounded. The violence was deplored by the Palestinian negotiators, largely ignored by the Israelis. The Israeli cabinet this week confirmed the indefinite physical separation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Israel. The 'green line', which divides Israel from the Arab territory it captured in 1967, has begun again to take on the appearance of a permanent border. The implications are considerable. The majority of Israelis appear to approve the measure which prevents more than 100,000 Palestinians in the territories from travelling to their jobs. It imposes some hardship on Israeli companies which depended on Palestinian labour, but far more on Palestinian families who no longer have their primary means of economic support. However, since the territories are now virtually sealed off, the random stabbings by individual Arabs within Israel has almost ceased. In the short term this represents a partial political success for Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, who last year campaigned on the promise to make Israel safer for its citizens. But it is a success which has been bought at some cost to the peace process, as several Israeli ministers recognise. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, heads the Labour group within the government which wants to offer more to the Palestinians and Syrians in order to accelerate negotiations. Most cabinet members have in the past also expressed an understanding about the extent to which economic deprivation is grist to the mill of the radical Islamic groups within the occupied territories, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which oppose the peace process. Opinion polls within Israel suggest the hardliners are so far winning the argument. The latest, by Gallup, showed 59 per cent opposed to territorial concessions, confirming impressions that most Israelis prefer the status quo to any formula which might satisfy the more pragmatic of Palestinian aspirations. Understandably, it is not something on which the Palestinian and Syrian delegations in Washington wish to focus. The Palestinians, representing the mainstream Palestine Liberation Organisation headed by Mr Yassir Arafat, accept they have little alternative to negotiations. That conviction may be waning. A PLO spokesman in Tunis warned yesterday that the talks were 'on the road to an impasse'. But to admit failure in Washington would be to hand a propaganda coup to Hamas comparable to that provided by Mr Rabin when he deported 415 of their supporters in December. The recent return of 30 Palestinians, deported by Israel before 1987, was seized on as an example of the benefits of negotiation. But many more such gestures are needed to offset the pain of the continued killings in the West Bank and Gaza, which caused the Palestinians to suspend the work of the human rights sub-committee set up with Israel to discuss such issues. For Syria there have been no such gestures. It continues to say that it is ready for a full peace, but will not provide details until Israel commits itself to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Neither government wishes to be the first to test domestic opinion by specifying anything, and is not under great pressure to do so. Mr Rabin's coalition government and the broad Palestinian movement are, however, showing similar signs of the strains created by talk of peace that is accompanied by violence. The issue may be less pressing domestically for Mr Rabin, providing he can patch up the differences within his party and the coalition. The Palestinians have less scope for manoeuvre, particularly as several members had their arms twisted to return to Washington. The ceremonial involvement of President Bill Clinton in the days ahead would help to focus attention on the positive world background to the Washington talks, but events in Israel and the occupied territories threaten to have the more decisive impact.</p>

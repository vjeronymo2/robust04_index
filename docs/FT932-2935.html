			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares wilt as rate cut hopes fade THE RECENT bout of strength in the UK equity market, which has seen the FT-SE 100 Index bump up against the top of its trading range, the 2,900 mark, evaporated yesterday as dealers decided that share prices have been 'overcooked' and that the scope for a further reduction in interest rates had diminished. Another substantial cash call, in the form of a Pounds 220m-plus rights issue from MEPC, the property group, was a further depressant on the market, as was a disappointing opening performance by Wall Street. The more cautious view adopted by the market was further encouraged by remarks made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer. His comments were read as indicating a determination to keep the lid on inflation. Dealers signed off at the end of what was described as an uninspiring session seeking, but not generally expecting, encouragement on the direction of economic policy from Mr Clarke in his speech last night. Stock prices settled around the day's lowest levels yesterday, although traders said activity continued to contract from recent levels. The equity market kicked off on a quiet note, with marketmakers opening prices around their overnight levels, encouraged by a good showing by Wall Street, and in spite of early news of MEPC's rights issue, the latest in a long line of cash calls from a property sector boosted by hopes of an early upturn and the recent intervention in the sector by Mr George Soros, the US investment specialist. What little early support was in evidence quickly evaporated in mid-morning as a deterioration in the Footsie future took the ground from underneath the cash market. The day's substantial batch of economic numbers, on industrial output and the Confederation of British Industry survey of distributive trades, provided little incentive for a market seeking direction from the chancellor's speech and awaiting the crucial May inflation numbers. 'It now seems that there is very little likelihood of a rate cut this week unless the inflation figures are very, very good indeed, and by that I mean no increase on the annual rate of inflation,' was the view of one City economist. Having started the session no more than a point easier, and enjoying a brief move into positive territory during the first hour or so of trading, the FT-SE 100 moved progressively lower, reaching the day's nadir of 2,869.7 as Wall Street opened. The US market performed disappointingly, especially after what was viewed as a satisfactory May inflation figure. 'The CPI number means no short term rise in US interest rates,' was the emphatic view from a London trader in international stocks. Share prices showed no inclination to rally towards the close, however, and the FT-SE 100 Index finished 15.5 down on the day at 2,870.0. And the market's overall disenchantment with the ever-diminishing rate cut story upset the highly resilient FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which retreated from its all-time high to end 8.1 off at 3,205.1. Turnover in the market was a disappointing 512.3m shares, only marginally above Monday's 500.1m, which was worth a fraction above Pounds 1bn in customer business.</p>

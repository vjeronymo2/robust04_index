			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: CBS shows deficit of Dollars 85.8m CBS, the US media group, yesterday posted a net loss of Dollars 85.8m, or Dollars 5.32 a share, reflecting an after-tax loss of Dollars 195.5m, or Dollars 12.06, from its baseball and football television coverage. In 1990, CBS had net earnings of Dollars 110.8m, or Dollars 4.30 a share, including an after-tax loss of Dollars 171.2m, or Dollars 6.65, on its sports contracts. Sales in the year fell 7 per cent to Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 3.26bn. Earnings in 1991 were further depressed by what Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive, called a 'stubborn' recession, expanding cable competition and rising programming costs. For the fourth quarter, the company had net income of Dollars 9.4m, or 61 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 937.4m, against a loss of Dollars 156m, or Dollars 6.06, on sales of Dollars 919.7m. The company had fourth-quarter operating earnings of Dollars 9.4m against an operating loss of Dollars 175.3m a year earlier. For the full year, CBS's loss from continuing operations was Dollars 98.7m against profits of Dollars 91.5m. CBS, which paid Dollars 1.06bn for its four year baseball contracts has had pre-tax losses of Dollars 604m for its sports coverage. CBS said these contracts have been reduced to net realisation value and no further write-offs are expected. Mr David Londoner, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said the results roughly met his expectations. 'I'm happy the third-quarter charge is done with. CBS has good ratings now and 1992 is starting to look better.' Mr Londoner expects CBS to earn Dollars 9-a-share in 1992. Mr Tisch said he expected the company to return to profitability in 1992 in spite of reduced advertiser demand for broadcast commercial time in the first quarter of 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peter Hack, member of the Alliance of Free </F> Democrats delegation at the coalition talks, by Lajos Bodnar;  place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Bodnar] You have placed  great emphasis on institutional guarantees, but less has been  said in public on the personal guarantees. However, one  interesting aspect has been discussed, namely the position of  coalition deputy prime minister. This appears to be an unusual  solution and, at first sight, it reveals compromises. The  question is how this political position can be fitted into the  public law?    [Hack] The coalition deputy prime minister is an institution  that is half-way between the current setup and, let us say, the  solution in Germany, where the institution of deputy chancellor  is known, and this position was, for a long time, filled by the  smaller coalition partner. In terms of public law, we do not  wish to establish this position of "deputy chancellor" -- deputy  prime minister. At the same time, in the government's statute,  we wish to mention the fact that, during the operation of this  government, there will be a minister within the cabinet who will  have the right to agree on certain issues. I would add that his  rights will not be decided by the ministry he heads, but rather  by the fact that he is the person nominated by the smaller  coalition partner. However, this will not be the minister who  deputizes for the prime minister when he is absent. The  government decree on the order of substitution can, without any  problems, regulate that some other minister, rather than the  interior minister -- if this position is filled by the coalition  deputy prime minister -- should substitute for the prime  minister in his absence.    [Bodnar] The disputed issues would be taken to a coalition  conciliation committee in which both parties would have one  vote. Do you think that this seems like a hallway to the right  of veto?    [Hack] I would not put it as sharply as a right of veto. At  any rate, the constraints to create consensus are included in  the way of operation. Therefore, we agree on a solution that  will, at one point, definitely bring the disputes to a consensus.    [Bodnar] The two parties made an important gesture to the  future opposition in the distribution of the committee places.  Does this have any risks, and in view of the known power  structure, does it have a real stake?    [Hack] It definitely has a stake because the parties  preparing for coalition offer higher positions and a bigger  chance for participation to the opposition than what would be  warranted by the proportion of their mandates. In my view, this  is an important gesture and the majority in 1990 did not do  this. It has a value and the opposition parties appear to  appreciate it. I add that the six-party agreement will lay down  these extra rights that will be due to the opposition only while  the coalition stands. We have agreed that, in certain  parliamentary committees, the proportion of opposition and  government will be 50 percent each. One of these is the  national security committee that was set up in proportion to the  mandates in the previous cycle. We also agreed that if  Parliament is to set up an investigation committee, the  proportion of government and opposition in it will again be 50  percent each. [passage omitted]</p>

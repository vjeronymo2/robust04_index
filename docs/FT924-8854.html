			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: German banks German banks are gaining ground in their battle with the authorities over new capital requirements due to come into force from January 1. Until recently, the federal supervisors have been pressing for a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 5 per cent for banks which wanted to count revaluation reserves on their securities holdings towards tier 2 capital. Last week, they appear to have quietly shifted to a 4 per cent minimum while still allowing banks to count revaluation reserves for up to a quarter of the tier 2 requirement. Provided the authorities stick to this line, German requirements will not exceed the standards applying under international and European Community rules. The resulting level playing field matters more to most institutions than the actual level of the tier 1 requirement in the short run. Most could meet a 5 per cent requirement with the possible exception of Commerzbank with its exposure to Russia, Olympia &amp; York and Hafnia. Admittedly Deutsche and BHF Bank would probably be the only large banks comfortable with a 5 per cent ratio. Others such as Dresdner and the Bavarian banks would not have much room for balance sheet growth. By insisting on 5 per cent, the authorities risked compounding the German slowdown by constraining banks' capacity to lend. But it is not as if a 4 per cent requirement would do much to stem the regular flow of bank share issues. A low return on equity and high payout ratios have long stymied German banks' ability to build capital through retained profit.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: MetLife to take part of Executive Life NEW York State insurance regulators yesterday said they had tentatively agreed to a deal under which Metropolitan Life, the nation's second largest insurer, would take over much of the business of Executive Life of New York (ELNY), writes Nikki Tait. ELNY was one of two operating units within the sizeable First Executive life insurance group. Heavy exposure to junk bonds prompted a policyholder run at Executive Life of California, and caused California's insurance regulators to seize this business in April. That exacerbated a similar problem at ELNY, the smaller sister operation with 103,000 policyholders, prompting similar action by the New York Insurance Department. However, the two state regulators have different solutions. In California, most of ELIC's junk bond portfolio was sold off; the cash proceeds added to some other remaining investments and the insurance liabilities restructured. In ELNY's case, a large portion of the liabilities and Dollars 1.46bn in the cash and cash equivalents are being transferred to MetLife. This will leave ELNY holding a large junk bond portfolio - with a book value of around Dollars 1.9bn - which will fund certain remaining liabilities. MetLife will probably pay around Dollars 60m-Dollars 70m for the single premium deferred annuity and life insurance business it acquires, although the figure could rise to Dollars 100m. Policyholders can remain with ELNY and be paid the cash surrender value of their contracts over a four-year period. Those who choose to move will generally be offered similar MetLife contracts. MetLife will also administer the business which remains with ELNY - single premium immediate annuities, such as pensions and structured settlements. MetLife will receive an annual fee, estimated at Dollars 1/2 m, while First Boston Asset Management will handle the investment portfolio.</p>

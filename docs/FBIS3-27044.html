In 1993, people  throughout Tibet, under the regional party committee's correct  leadership and guided by the goal of building a new socialist  market economic system, made every effort to carry out reform  and promote development. We focused on attention on the  following five projects:    1. We strove to emancipate our minds and heighten our sense  of urgency to develop the economy. Following the Fourth  Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Regional Party  Committee, we launched all kinds of sizable discussions  throughout Tibet about the need to emancipate our minds and  change our mindset. We also sent groups of different sizes to  other parts of the country to study their experiences. As a  result of studying the instructions and guidelines as well as  the discussions and visits, our cadres and masses have explored  new ways of thinking, broaden their visions, and realized the  big gap between our economic development and that in other parts  of the country. Our awareness of the need to speed up reform,  opening up, and economic development has heightened noticeably.  At the same time, we have discovered Tibet's potential and  strengths for economic development. Consequently our confidence  and courage of developing our productive forces and revitalizing  Tibet's economy heightened noticeably, and our enthusiasm of  making plans for launching development projects, building  markets, and setting up businesses soared with each passing day.  An environment highly favorable for economic construction began  to take shape in Tibet.    2. Guided by the goal of building a socialist market  economic  system, we made constant efforts to intensify reform. First, we  firmly gave our enterprises their operating autonomy and strove  to improve the environment for their production and operations  by fully implementing the State Council's Regulations for  Changing the Operating Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial  Enterprises and the regional government's procedures for  implementing those regulations. Second, we restructured the  systems governing planning, registration of enterprises, and  setting prices. That was a major step we took on our way to  establish a socialist market economic system. Third, we adopted  various ways to establish and improve our market system. Through  borrowing money from banks, raising capital ourselves, and  forming partnership, all our prefectures and cities established  many markets for trading agricultural products, livestocks, and  industrial goods. This has enlivened the economy and provided  the needed services for city and rural dwellers to improve their  livelihood. Fourth, we drew up the necessary policies needed to  encourage and support the development of independent and private  business.    3. We broadened the scope for opening wider to the outside  world as well as all channels for bringing in resources from  other parts of the country and establishing ties with the  outside world. First of all, we put an end to the situation  where foreign trade enterprises could monopolize the business,  encouraged and supported all types of enterprises to take part  in ocean-going trade [yuan yang mao yi] and border trade. By  launching these programs, our enterprises have diversified their  business, and more people have come to know how to conduct  foreign trade. Secondly, we set our minds in motion, broadened  our vision, and broadly promoted Tibet's economic partnerships  with other provinces and foreign countries. Taking advantage of  the various channels, all prefectures, cities, and enterprises  in Tibet succeeded in bringing in resources from the outside  world and establishing partnership projects with counterparts  elsewhere in the country. In 1993, Tibet officially approved  more than 40 projects of bringing in outside resources and  establishing partnerships with other parts of the country.  These projects amounted to negotiated investments of 67.11  million yuan and $9.63 million. Third, by encouraging  enterprises to invest in other parts of the country, we merged  Tibet's rich resources with the markets and technological  strengths in other parts of the country. A pattern for Tibet to  open itself to all directions began to take shape.    4. Tibet succeeded in building its infrastructure --  especially those projects relevant to the development of energy  resources and communications and telecommunications services.  In 1993, the region invested 1.59 billion yuan in fixed assets,  topping that of the preceding year by 15 percent. Compared with  those projects accomplished in the past, the quality and  progress of all priority projects were better and faster.    5. We ensured a healthy economic development by  intensifying and improving macroscopic regulation and control.  Last year, basing on the guidelines in the No. 6 Document  issued by the Central Committee and in view of Tibet's reform  and development problems, we adoped a series of effective  measures to intensify and improve Tibet's macroscopic regulation  and control. First of all, to put banking affairs in order, we  corrected various lawless interbanking lending businesses and  unruly money raising conduct. By the end of last year, banking  departments in Tibet had recovered more than 200 million yuan of  day-to-day loans, or more than 60 percent of the extended loans;  and rejected more than 2.5 million yuan previously approved to  be extended to borrowers as their collectively raised funds.  Second, we banned all unwarranted levies and fines, and  abolished more than 80 of the 1,320 paid services that had been  screened. By doing this we have lessened the burdens of  enterprises and the masses. Third, we launched a widespread  taxation, fiscal, and price inspection and discovered illegal  transactions involving 17.8 million yuan. Of this amount, over  2.6 million yuan has already been delivered to the treasury.  Because of these measures, we have effectively stopped the  massive outflow of capital, ensured the needs of priority  projects, tightened financial and economic discipline, protected  the interests of enterprises and people in cities and  countryside, and brought about a healthy national economic  development.    The successes achieved in launching these five projects have  powerfully expedited Tibet's economic construction. It is  estimated that Tibet's GNP will reach 3.65 billion yuan in 1993,  or 8.1 percent higher than that of the preceding year when  calculated in terms of comparable items. In 1993, Tibet's total  agricultural output reached 2.228 billion yuan, or 5.3 percent  higher than that of the preceding year; its total industrial  output reached 470 million yuan, topping that of the preceding  year by 7.8 percent; the region's revenues reached 149 million  yuan, topping that of the preceding year by 37 percent; and the  average per capita income of peasants and herdsmen reached 515  yuan, an increase of 5.1 percent over that of a year before.  This shows that Tibet's economic development as a whole has  been fast and healthy.    The year 1994 is a year crucial for accelerating the pace of  building a socialist market economic system. It also is an  important year in which Tibet will greet its 30th founding  anniversary with outstanding successes of national economic  development. To achieve a breakthrough in reforming Tibet's  economic system and even better results in developing Tibet's  social productive forces during the New Year, the regional  people's government recently called a regional economic  conference to study the guidelines, general policy, and specific  programs for reforming Tibet's economic system -- which will be  promulgated one after another for implementation after they have  been revised. On the basis of analyzing Tibet's economic  development in 1993, the conference also studied and came up  with certain major economic development projects for 1994.  These projects include: Focusing on increasing the incomes of  peasants and herdsmen, Tibet will energetically develop the  economy in its agricultural and pastoral areas, strive to  explore new areas for economic development, and do what is  essential for expanding Tibet's capacity for future economic  development. To ensure a smooth reform and economic  development, we will continue to stabilize Tibet's political and  social situation, promote administrative ethics, provide  stronger leadership, improve our style of work, and do a good  job in educating the masses. As long as people of all  nationalities in Tibet understand the need of reform, support  reform, throw themselves in reform, and concentrate their  efforts on studying how to develop Tibet's economy -- as they  have always been doing -- we certainly can make even greater  strides in building a socialist market economic system during  the New Year, and we certainly will be able to bring about  significant changes when Tibet marks its 30th founding  anniversary.</p>

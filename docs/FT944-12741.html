			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bologna bank fights L2,000bn bid Credito Romagnolo, the Bologna-based regional bank, is expected to call in foreign advisers to help ward off a hostile bid by Credito Italiano, Italy's fifth largest commercial bank. The bid, offering L19,000 per share for 48.2 per cent of Credito Romagnolo's stock, was rejected at a special board meeting on Friday. If Credito Italiano were successful it would create Italy's largest private bank. The offer by Credito Italiano is worth L2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn) and was launched last Wednesday after concerted buying of Credito Romagnolo stock. Credito Italiano holds just over 2 per cent of the shares. The move has already profoundly shaken the banking sector. Credito Romagnolo, which is controlled by a core of shareholders led by Olivetti chairman Mr Carlo De Benedetti, is understood to be considering recruiting at least one and perhaps two foreign advisers. Those being mentioned over the weekend included Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs International. Their task would be to assess the value of Credito Romagnolo and to draw up a possible list of 'white knights' that might be interested in helping fight the takeover. Under existing statutes, no shareholder of the Bologna-based bank can own more than 10 per cent. Credito Italiano would need the support of at least 20 per cent of the shareholders to call a special meeting to amend the statutes and allow majority control. Objections to the deal have centred on the price and the threat to Credito Romagnolo's identity. Although the price represents a sharp premium on the L13,674 pre-bid value, those shareholders tempted to sell are thought unlikely to accept the first offer - not least because it covers less than half the stock. The stronger objection comes from those who believe a highly profitable regional bank such as Credito Romagnolo risks losing its identity in the bigger and more ungainly Credito Italiano. Local Bologna politicians have begun to organise a campaign to prevent the bank being taken over, in spite of Mr Lucio Rondelli, chairman of Credito Italiano, saying that such fears were unfounded.</p>

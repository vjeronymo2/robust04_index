			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' today received  Viktor Posuvalyuk, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's envoy.    Attending the meeting were Dr. Ghassan Raslan, director of  the East Europe Department at the Foreign Ministry, and  Aleksandr Zotov, Russian ambassador in Damascus.    The talks dealt with developments in the peace process, and  Israel's arrogant policies, and its stands obstructing the  achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the region.    In this regard, the foreign minister urged the Russian  Federation and the United States, in their capacity as the peace  process sponsors, to denounce these Israeli policies and stands,  particularly the recent terroristic kidnapping operation carried  out by the Israeli troops inside the Lebanese territory.    The talks also dealt with relations between Syria and Russia  and means of promoting them.</p>

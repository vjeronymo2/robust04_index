			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 21 Apr (NA) -- During today's  cabinet meeting in which he reviewed the measures to be  implemented to foster production nationwide, Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo pointed out the need to "expedite" the credits  granted by the Argentine National Bank, especially those for  regional producers.    Cavallo's idea is to buttress regional economies so they  will  be able to compete with good-quality products both domestically  and on the international market.    The package of measures will be announced by President  Carlos  Menem on 1 May during the opening of a new session of Congress.    According to what official spokesmen reported after the  cabinet meeting, the trade balance deficit also was discussed at  the meeting. In order to reduce it, Cavallo reportedly  confirmed the decision to promote import restrictions and an  export drive.    In light of the fact that agroindustries and agricultural  production primary will play a central role in boosting trade,  new measures to aid regional economies will reportedly be  implemented and others already under way will be enhanced.    The economy minister reportedly explained to the president  and his colleagues that one should bear in mind that of the  $13,040 [figure as received] exported last year, more than  $8,200 [figure as received] -- approximately 60 percent --  corresponded to primary commodities and manufactured products  from the agriculture and livestock sector.    The plan for industry, which is fundamentally geared to  providing aid to small- and medium-scale enterprises (PyMEs),  will include financial aid through soft loans granted by the  BICE [Bank of Investment and Foreign Trade] and the Argentine  National Bank, a program for the development of suppliers -- the  so-called productive areas, and the support program for the  reorganization of the PyMEs.

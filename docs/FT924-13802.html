			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / The colour is grey for Paris spring fashions: Economic chill takes the brightness out of French designers' big week THIS morning the Paris fashion designers will unveil the first of their spring collections in the sumptuous Cour Carree of the Louvre museum against the gloomy economic backdrop of the global economic slowdown and this autumn's currency crisis. The Paris designers, like the rest of the international fashion industry, are already bruised by two years of recession in the US and the downturn in Europe. After a decade of uninterrupted growth their combined sales fell by about 11 per cent to FFr4.55bn (Pounds 530m) last year, according to the Chambre Syndicale de laCouture, the body which represents the French fashion houses. This year has been worse. Until recently the designers could count on healthy demand from Japan, by far their most dynamic market in the 1980s, to compensate for the slowdown in the west. But since the collapse of the Tokyo stock market in March, sales in Japan have fallen sharply. 'The market is in a very sensitive state, although we had anticipated most of the problems apart from the difficulties in Japan,' said Mr Michel Pietrini, chairman of Lanvin, one of the oldest French fashion houses which is staging a lavish relaunch in Paris this weekend. There are already signs of strain among the fashion houses. Jean Colonna, a leading young Paris designer, filed for bankruptcy this spring, although he has since managed to start up in business again. Yves Saint-Laurent, the bastion of France's fashion establishment, barely broke even in the first half of this year. Recent reports in the Japanese press suggest that some of the Tokyo designers may stop showing in Paris next season, which could damage the city's credibility as the international fashion centre. The outlook is worse. The immediate problem is the currency crisis which could depress sales of this week's collections because of the French franc's strength against key currencies such as the US dollar and Italian lire. 'Of course, the currency crisis is of prime concern,' said Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH luxury goods group, whose fashion interests include Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix and Givenchy. 'But it isn't the first and it won't be the last.' The short-term pressures of currencies and recession have disguised the longer term problems facing the fashion designers. One issue is the impact of the expansion of the new breed of luxury goods groups, notably LVMH and Dunhill, which this summer bought the Karl Lagerfeld fashion house and also hired Mr Lagerfeld as chief designer for the Chloe collection which will be shown this afternoon. These groups have deployed their financial resources to raise the cost of competing in designer fashion. Advertising budgets have escalated, as have the bills for fashion shows. The super-models, Linda Evangelista and Claudia Schiffer, can command fees of Dollars 10,000 to Dollars 15,000 a show because the big houses are willing, and able, to pay them. Mr Arnault has sunk at least Pounds 18m into launching Lacroix. L'Oreal, the cosmetics company, and Orcofi, the luxury goods consortium, are relaunching Lanvin on a similar scale. Such budgets, like the super-models' fees, are well beyond the means of independent houses and have intensified the financial pressure on young designers such as Jean Colonna. The designers must also adjust to the change in consumer tastes away from the ostentatious affluence that dominated the 1980s and was so beneficial to sales of designer fashion. 'Flamboyance is out,' said Mr Arnault. 'Today consumers prefer to indulge themselves rather than to show off.' So far the designers' have failed to respond. Fashion in the early 1990s has polarised between the baggy, black recyclage (recycled) look of the young designers, Jean Colonna and Martin Margiela, and the fin de siecle stylistic excesses of the established houses. The 'hippy de luxe' look seen at last week's fashion shows in Milan marked the start of the designers' attempts to adapt to the new era. It is now the turn of the Paris designers to show what they can do - however chilly the economic climate may be.</p>

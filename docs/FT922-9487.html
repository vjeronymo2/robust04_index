			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Major aims to avoid tax increases A FALL in Britain's budget deficit without the imposition of any increase in taxation was envisaged by Mr John Major, the prime minister, when he outlined the government's programme for the new parliament in the Commons yesterday. He insisted that the renewed confidence generated by the Conservative party's fourth successive general election victory was already being reflected in the economy. To government cheers, the prime minister underlined the favourable impact already made by Tuesday's  1/2 -percentage-point cut, which brought the bank rate down to 10 per cent. After the election, Mr Major said, business surveys had immediately reflected stronger prospects, the stock market had risen by 10 per cent, and sterling had risen to DM2.92. He emphasised that the policies endorsed by the British people were designed to encourage the creation of wealth - 'in Britain and for Britain'. He reaffirmed that the government intended to expand the 20p income tax band  -introduced in the March Budget for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income - 'steadily' up the income scale so that it applied to more and more people. He emphasised that the 40 per cent upper rate was at a 'proper and sustainable level'. He announced that the Finance Bill, to implement the proposals from the Budget that could not be enacted before the election, would be introduced later this month. Mr Major promised to carry forward the 'crusade' against over-regulation and state interference, and renewed his commitment to opposing any pressure from the European Community to reimpose handicaps on industry removed during the Thatcherite era. Amid further government cheers he said: 'Not for us the interventionism that would put people out of work with minimum wages and artificial restrictions on working times.' The prime minister also highlighted the developments it would fall to him to set in train when Britain assumed the presidency of the EC in July - with ensuring the survival of 'fledgling' democracies in eastern Europe a top priority. Labour backbenchers caustically reminded the prime minister that the public-sector borrowing requirement for the current financial year was expected to exceed Pounds 28bn. Mr Major referred his critics to the figures in the Budget statement, or Red Book, and assured the House: 'We will seek to stick to them until we have a balanced budget.' He said the budget deficit reflected cyclical factors and added: 'As we come out of recession, that deficit will begin to fall.' Pressed for a detailed explanation of his stance on Scotland, the prime minister underlined his determination to prevent the break-up of the UK, stressing that the union was not negotiable. The government would seek to be 'more responsive' to Scotland's needs, and he undertook to report back to the House after fulfilling his pledge to take stock of the situation in the light of the outcome of the election. Mr Major said the Citizen's Charter would be at the centre of the government's decision making, with policies designed to make public services more accountable. Tougher performance targets would be set by Mr William Waldegrave, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and he would ensure that high-quality, responsive public services were provided for the individual citizen.</p>

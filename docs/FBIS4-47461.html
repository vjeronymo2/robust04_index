			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. A. Lebedev, V. P. Shchukin, and V. P. </F> Leontyev, Polytechnical Institute, Tolyatti; UDC665.612]    [Abstract] In all industrially developed nations the  nitrogen industry is related to ammonia and methanol production.  Ammonia and other nitrogen compounds are used for the production  of fertilizers which have an annual estimated production growth  rate of 5 percent. About 70 percent of the world's ammonia  production is derived from natural gas; the most  energy-efficient method of producing technological feed gas for  ammonia is catalytic conversion of natural gas with steam in two  stages. In the first stage pre-treated natural gas is passed  over a nickel catalyst in a tubular reactor heated with natural  gas under conditions selected so that the residual methane  content in the dry converted gas is 9-11 percent by volume. In  the second stage the methane is converted with steam and air  oxygen in a columnar reactor where the entire oxygen content  reacts with hydrogen, methane, and oxides of carbon. Heating the  mix to 1250-1280 C shifts the equilibrium to catalytic  reaction of methane with the steam. The quantity of air supplied  to the reactor is controlled so that the CO and H[.sub]2[/]  to nitrogen ratio is 3.05-3.10 and residual methane is 0.3-0.5  percent by volume. The next step in the production of  technological feed gas is catalytic conversion of carbon  monoxide to increase the hydrogen content, remove carbon  dioxide, and methanize any residual oxides of carbon to give a  nitrogen-hydrogen mixture for the ammonia synthesis stage. Owing  to the sharp rise in energy costs, the problem of energy savings  became acute for multi-ton ammonia production, especially in  production of the technological feed gas. In the present work  some results are presented on a theoretical analysis of various  variants in organizing a technological scheme and simulating  processes in basic reactors making it possible to uncover  tendencies in the modernization of multi-ton aggregates for the  purpose of lowering energy costs. One such variant could be  lowering the temperature in the secondary reforming stage under  conditions of selective methane combustion to 1200 C.  Figures 3; references 16: 13 Russian, 3 Western.</p>

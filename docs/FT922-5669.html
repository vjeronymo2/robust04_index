			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y says restructuring of parent will go ahead OLYMPIA &amp; YORK said yesterday the appointment of an administrator for Canary Wharf, the property development in east London, should not affect the restructuring of the Canadian parent company and its other assets in Canada. Mr David Brown, who heads O&amp;Y's legal team, told a court in Toronto the Canadian companies had sufficient funds to maintain their operations during the restructuring. O&amp;Y revealed in court documents that it expected to spend almost CDollars 17m (USDollars 14.1m) over the next five months on restructuring costs. Legal and accounting fees alone will make up about two-thirds of the total. O&amp;Y's Canadian operations were placed under court protection on May 14 under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act. Its US operations were not affected. Mr Brown reaffirmed that the company would try, as far as possible, to separate the restructuring of its businesses in Britain, Canada and the US. O&amp;Y told the court it had lowered its estimate of its worldwide debt to CDollars 13.5bn from CDollars 14.9bn. Some CDollars 8.6bn of the total applies to the Canadian operations. Various creditors have submitted a total of 19 motions to the court, either seeking to safeguard their claims to O&amp;Y assets or to carve out various assets from the CCAA order. O&amp;Y and its large lenders submitted detailed proposals to the court to segregate income from the company's various Canadian buildings and investment holdings. The proposal would involve setting up 32 separate bank accounts. Balances in each account would be paid out to the creditors in July, when O&amp;Y is due to file a detailed debt restructuring plan. Mr Brown said the company was committed to an 'equitable' sharing of funds raised from asset sales. The restructuring cost estimates were contained in the first report submitted by Mr Bernard Wilson, the Price Waterhouse partner acting as 'information officer' between O&amp;Y and the creditors. Mr Wilson's report provides the first public glimpse into details of O&amp;Y's operations. It gives detailed projections for all O&amp;Y's Canadian assets, as well as dividend receipts from its portfolio investments.</p>

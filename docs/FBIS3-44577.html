"At the same time we have reason to believe that the North  is  prepared now to meet again with the South" in order to carry out  the denuclearization agreement, said Lynn Davis, undersecretary  of state for international security affairs, at a State  Department news briefing.    Davis described the development as "very good news," saying  a  third round of discussions between the United States and the  DPRK would take place after those two steps would have been  taken.    The United States and the DPRK held two rounds of  discussions  separately in June and July last year and they also held five  informal meetings last December in New York.    "So the most immediate step at this point is for the North  Koreans to meet with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy  Agency) and work out the details of those inspections of the  seven declared sites," Davis said.    In the third round of discussions, Davis claimed, "we will  be  seeking to bring the North Koreans into full compliance with  their obligations under the Nonproliferation Treaty, including  the requirement to receive inspections at the two non-declared  nuclear sites."    For the United States, it will "find ways to resolve once  and  for all our outstanding issues with respect to the nuclear  policies of North Korea," Davis added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has not clearly indicated how this definition would translate in practice to actions and proceedings under the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act and its implementing regulations. However, in an October 29, 1992, document entitled ``Statement of Principal Reasons for Adoption'' that accompanied the revised rules, the Council stated that ``the words `contested case' were added before the word `proceeding' *&blank;*&blank;* to clarify that fees may be awarded only in contested cases, as opposed to rulemaking hearings.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA or the Board) and the U.S. District Court for the Utah District declined to delineate the full reach of the phrase ``any administrative proceeding'' in section 525(e) of SMCRA when presented with an opportunity to do so.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc (NRDC), et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  107 IBLA 339, 356 n. 12 (1989);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Utah International, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department of Interior, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  643 F. Supp. 810, 825 n. 26 (D. Utah 1986). However, in deciding these cases, both the IBLA and the U.S. District Court held that this phrase should not be read literally, but rather must be interpreted in the context of the legislative history of SMCRA and case law concerning attorney fee and expense awards under other statutes. Both opinions contain extensive dicta suggesting that the phrase could or should be read to include only administrative proceedings of an adjudicatory nature, not proceedings that are part of the fact-finding process culminating in an initial agency decision, e.g., informal conferences on permit applications.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC, supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 354&hyph;360;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Utah International, supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 820&hyph;825. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1290 and 4.1291, which implement this section of SMCRA in part, provide for an award of costs and expenses only in connection with administrative proceedings resulting in the issuance of a final order by an administrative law judge or the IBLA. The preamble to these regulations notes that the Secretary rejected comments requesting that the scope of the rules be expanded to allow the award of costs and expenses in other types of administrative proceedings, such as rulemaking (43 FR 34385, August 3, 1978).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Secretary finds that the Wyoming statutory and regulatory provisions allowing the award of costs and expenses only in connection with a ``contested case'' proceeding are not inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and its implementing regulations, as interpreted by case law. However, the Secretary's approval is predicated upon Wyoming's interpretation of the term ``contested case'' to include all classes of actions in which participants would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295, consistent with the discussion set forth above. At a minimum, the term must include all administrative proceedings of an adjudicatory nature. Additionally, as more case law develops, it may be necessary to further expand the interpretation to include other types of administrative proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Award of Costs and Expenses: Eligible Issues [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to provide that a participant in a proceeding is eligible to receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if the issues resolved in the contested proceeding were raised in the original complaint and within the statutory timeframes of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) or within an enforcement action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 525(e) of SMCRA does not provide a basis for a limitation of this nature. The purpose of section 525(e) is to facilitate public participation in the administrative and judicial review process, as required by section 102(i) of the Act. As stated in the preamble to 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295 as originally proposed:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The legislative history of the Act is clear that section 525(e) of the Act is intended to encourage public participation in the administrative process. Such a provision is designed to encourage citizens to bring good faith actions to insure that the Act is being properly enforced. It is the intention of the Office that these proposed rules not be interpreted to discourage good faith actions on the part of interested citizens.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> 43 FR 15444, April 13, 1978. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative and judicial review entities may not be obligated to accept untimely filings or amended complaints, but if they do there is no basis for excluding participants in the affected proceeding from eligibility for an award of costs and expenses. Such persons are entitled to all the rights and privileges accorded to other litigants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

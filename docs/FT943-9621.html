			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unfair to suggest Abiola should join Nigerian government Sir, My attention has been drawn to the editorial comment 'Time to help Nigeria' (August 3). I have to thank the Financial Times for showing keen interest in Nigeria's economic and political affairs. However, its judgment on political issues has to be viewed against the background that it specialises in economic and financial matters. It is in this light that I am interpreting your suggestion for a coalition government in Nigeria at this moment to be headed by Chief MKO Abiola for a period of two years as no more than a simplistic Solomon-type of judgment. The fact of the matter is that the present government in Nigeria has articulated a political programme which Nigeria as a nation has accepted and is now being actively implemented. The first phase of the programme was the election and inauguration of the constitutional conference to draw up a political agenda, including a timetable for holding elections at all levels of our political system with a view to returning the country to a truly democratically elected government. The conference was inaugurated on schedule on June 27. During the inauguration speech the head of state, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, elaborated his administration's thinking on the current political developments in Nigeria, including the assurance that his government will not unduly interfere with the recommendations of the constitutional conference. He reiterated that the ban on political activities in the country will be lifted in the first quarter of 1995, when the political agenda, as recommended by the constitutional conference and approved by the provisional ruling council, will begin to take effect. Given this national consensus, it is unfair, to say the least, for your paper to suggest that a person currently charged with treason against the state should be called upon to become a head of another interim government for any period of time. As far as the vast majority of Nigerians are concerned, the question of Chief Abiola, June 12 and what have you is now a matter of history. As for Chief Abiola, the possibility or otherwise of his contesting any future elections will depend on the outcome of the ongoing judicial process. Let me emphasise that Nigeria now has a political programme that it believes in and which it intends to implement. We are aware that attempts are being made by some organisations in and outside the country, using the most undemocratic means including arson, intimidation, kid-napping etc, to derail the political programme and to destabilise the nation. It is in the light of the foregoing that the Nigerian government and people will remain eternally grateful to the British government, and in particular the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, for their understanding and support during the crisis and for the ongoing political programme. Finally, I would like to use this opportunity to call on all peoples of goodwill to support the government and people of Nigeria so as to ensure that the ongoing constitutional conference finishes its work peacefully and the country is returned to a democracy within the shortest possible time.

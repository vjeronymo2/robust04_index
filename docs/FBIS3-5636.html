			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The fifth contact of working-level representatives  for the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and  South was held behind closed doors in Tongilgak today on our  side of Panmunjom.    After the contact, the head of our side's delegation gave a  news conference to domestic and foreign reporters on the spot  and explained the details of the contact.    Our side stressed a need to break at all cost the deadlock  [kyochak sangtae] of the working-level contact and conclude the  discussions on the agenda items at this time. It once again  urged the South side to manifest first its clear position on the  demand -- raised by our side at the fourth contact -- that it  discontinue all large-scale nuclear war exercises against the  dialogue partner, an obstacle to the exchange of special envoys;  abandon the antinational international cooperation system;  withdraw the plan to introduce Patriot missiles and other new  types of weapons; and cancel the South's remarks that it cannot  shake hands with the dialogue partner.    Our side pointed out that the North-South exchange of  special  envoys will not be able to proceed in a favorable atmosphere if  the South does not manifest its clear position on this  four-point demand and that even if special envoys are exchanged,  just like the previous dialogues which underwent twists and  turns, the dialogue will become a nominal [yumyongmusil]  dialogue that will results in its discontinuation, resumption,  and breakup [kyollyol] and that this would disappoint all fellow  countrymen.    Out of a desire to immediately conclude discussions on  procedural matters for the exchange of special envoys and  exchange special envoys at the earliest possible date, it  presented a new momentous amendment to the Agreement on the  Exchange of Top-Level Envoys Between the North and the South, an  amendment that takes the South side's view into full  consideration.    Our side's amendment proposal includes detailed matters such  as the rank of the special envoys of both sides, their  accompanying personnel [tonghaeng inwon], the tasks of special  envoys and the mode of their exchange, the date of their  exchange and the timetable of their stay, procedures of their  travels and security arrangements, reporters' news coverage and  the provision of conveniences to reporters.    He proposed that special envoys of the two sides be  authoritative and responsible high-ranking officials appointed  by the top authorities of the North and the South and be  accompanied by about 10 aides and six reporters, that the South  side's envoy visit Pyongyang within 15 days from the date an  agreement is reached, and our side's envoy visit Seoul within 15  days from the last day of the South side's envoy's Pyongyang  visit, and that each side's envoy visit the other side for three  nights and four days.    Duties of the envoys presented in our side's draft of  agreement that was revised and supplemented include discussions  on the implementation of the Joint Declaration on  Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, joint measures to be  taken immediately to implement the North-South agreement,  pending issues of mutual interest, and a meeting between the top  authorities of the North and the South. In addition to these,  issues on the easing of tensions between the North and the  South, the maintenance of national self-reliance [minjok  chajusong], the promotion of the great national unity, and the  method to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of  the fatherland are presented in detail in our side's draft.  These issues are not included in that of the South side.    The epochal [hoekkijogin] draft of agreement revised by our  side is a fair one that was made by taking the South side's  intent into consideration. It is also a reasonable one that will  enable the envoy exchange to help make practical improvements to  North-South relations and opening a new phase in resolving the  country's reunification issue.    In today's contact, our side repeatedly urged the South side  to express a satisfactory [naptukhalmanhan] attitude in any form  toward the four just demands we made to hasten a complete  solution to problems regarding practical procedure [silmu  cholcha munjerul wanjonhi kyolsokchikko] and to realize an  exchange of envoys as soon as possible.    In the contact, the South side, instead of expressing a  clear  attitude toward our principled demands before discussing  practical issues, repeated absurd remarks that create obstacles  and are unnecessary, creating obstacles to the discussions on  issues.    The South side even deliberately raised an issue that has no  relation to the discussions on the practical procedure and  blemish the atmosphere of the talks, assuming an extremely  provocative attitude.    Immediately raising such absurd remarks and acts by the  South  side as an issue, our side has branded them as its declaration  to give up the working-level contact and sternly warned against  it. The South side, which was at a loss for answers, has  attempted to make an excuse for its wrong act.    Regarding the South side's remarks that it has never  conducted, even one time, a large-scale nuclear war exercise,  our side maintained that this is a preposterous sophistry, and  that this is not an attitude of dialogue, but rather an attitude  of continuously pursuing a position of confrontation.    Our side said that the South side's attempt to not accept  our  side's just demand that it give up the international cooperation  system shows that the South side gives priority to outside  forces over the nation, and that it admits itself to the nature  of its dependency upon outside forces and anti-national  position. Also, our side stressed that if the South side  continues pursuing the international cooperation system with the  backing of outside forces, it will raise the grave consequence  in which our nation can fall a victim of great powers.    Our side said: In its character, the exchange of the  North-South special envoys must succeed if it is prepared. It  must also satisfy the expectation of our nation as a sincere and  fruitful dialogue. If the exchange of special envoys is either  suspended or broken once again -- like other dialogues in the  past -- by the nuclear war exercise or any other factors after  it began, it will be difficult to hold the North-South dialogue  again. Although the South side regrets its act at a time when  the North-South dialogue is not held, an opportunity would never  come again.    Based on the sincere position to overcome, by any means, the  prevailing obstacles and to conclude the working-level contact,  our side has proposed a tete-a-tete contact between the heads of  the two side. Following this, the contact between the heads of  the two sides was held.    The North and South side have agreed to hold the next sixth  round of their working-level contact at the South side's area of  Panmunjom on 12 March.</p>

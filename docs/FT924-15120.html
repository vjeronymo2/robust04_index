			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (6): Telephones provide staying power - Raymond Snoddy checks the loyalty of cable subscribers THE numbers in Mr Larry Carlton's survey of the effect of offering telephone services on the loyalty of cable television were small but the results dramatic all the same. Mr Carlton is president of TeleWest the joint venture between TeleCommunications Inc, the US cable television operator, and US West, the American telephone company and the largest single cable company in the UK. He wanted to do a basic check on the anecdotal evidence that cable subscribers who take a telephone service as well as conventional cable television are much less prone to 'churn'. The term is industry jargon for subscribers who are disconnected either because they no longer want to pay or because they have simply moved house. Churn is the bane of the industry and can reach levels as high as 35 per cent a year which means as cable networks are built the search is always on for new subscribers not only to add to the existing total but to replace those who have been lost. TeleWest looked at 100 cable television-only subscribers in its London south franchise who were connected last year. By the end of the year only 55 were still hooked up. The small study then looked at 92 subscribers who had both cable television and a telephone service linked through the cable network to Mercury Communications, the Cable and Wireless rival to British Telecom. All 92 were still subscribing a year later. 'I didn't want to believe it. I asked my executive did he hand-pick them,' said Mr Carlton with a laugh. The results illustrate in a dramatic way the marriage of cable television and telecommunications services that is starting to happen all over the UK from Edinburgh, through Birmingham and the Midlands and Avon to London and the south coast and areas such as Portsmouth and Brighton. Next year the places where cable telephone services will start to become available will include Newcastle, Blackburn and Liverpool. The increasingly close link between cable television and telecommunications is symbolised by the link between TCI and US West itself. 'We are each trying to learn each other's technology,' says the TeleWest executive. In most cases where telephone services are being offered or are about to be offered the franchise investors include North American telephone companies, including Nynex and South Western Bell as well as US West and Bell Canada. The involvement by cable companies in providing telecommunication services goes back only a few years to the days when a small number of operators led by The Cable Corporation started installing telephone lines. Apart from good quality circuits the main advantage on offer was discounts averaging between 10 and 15 per cent. The demand was much greater than expected and telephone earnings started to outstrip those from conventional television channels. Quite apart from the prospects for reducing churn, cable companies are also finding it easier to market their services when they can offer the combination of television channels and telephone services complete with special discounts for those who take both. Some consumers see extra television channels as a discretionary purchase, perhaps even a bit of self-indulgence but the possibility of 15 per cent off their telephone bills is viewed in a much more practical manner. Depending on use, the savings on telephone bills could cover the cost of the extra television channels. It has now become conventional wisdom that the way forward is to offer combined television and telephone packages from the start. TeleWest, for example, is planning to construct 2,000 miles of cable network next year which will make the service available to a further 375,000 homes. East London Telecommunications, which owns six cable franchises in the London area covering about 630,000 homes and is now controlled by BCE Telecom International, a subsidiary of Bell Canada, plans to launch a large construction initiative in December offering a combined telephone and television service in the London borough of Redbridge. Videotron, the Canadian cable company which has 69,500 cable subscribers in the UK and only 2,500 residential and 1,000 business telephone subscribers in its Southampton franchise, has now decided to pause and go back to its existing south London networks to add telecom capacity. As a result the company will reduce its annual rate of construction to 35,000 new homes passed a year instead of the present figure of more than 100,000. The case for upgrading is simply made out by the figures. It will cost Videotron around Pounds 80 to Pounds 90 a home to upgrade existing networks but telephony revenue will almost equal the cable figure of around Pounds 200 a year. Mr Bill Aitken, cable operator marketing manager for Mercury, has seen the change in attitude to cable telephones services at first hand. Eighteen months ago he was selling a few lines a month to the cable industry. Now the figure is running at around 10,000 a month. Official figures from the Independent Television Commission, the industry regulatory body, show that from the beginning of January 1991 the number of cable lines has grown from 2,224 to 47,902 on July 1 this year. Mr Aitken believes the actual number is larger and the rate of increase is rising. It is limited mainly by the rate at which the cable industry can construct its networks. By 1994 there could be more than 300,000 cable telephone lines in place. For Mercury, cable gives important access to the local loop which is otherwise totally dominated by BT although further competition is on the way. Cable operators are already starting to suggest penetration rates - the ratio of homes passed by the cable network to those actually subscribing - of 40 per cent for television services and 25 per cent for telephone services.</p>

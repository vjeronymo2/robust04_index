			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / N-plant ruling sought from attorney-general THE ATTORNEY-general will be asked to step into the controversy over British Nuclear Fuels' new Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, in a move that could further delay the plant's operation. The Department of the Environment has been advised by lawyers that it may need to consider the wider economic and social case for the plant, as well as environmental implications, if it is to avoid the risk of judicial review which could be prompted by legal action from pressure groups. It has emerged in the past few weeks that the government's legal advice about which factors it should take into account conflicts with that received by BNF and may conflict on other points with that received by pressure groups. The environment department is preparing to ask the attorney-general for an opinion on which is strongest. Greenpeace, the pressure group, said last night: 'We have got a legal opinion that there must be a wide-ranging government inquiry looking at all the issues.' Whitehall observers believe the government is determined to avoid the risk of judicial review, even though formally weighing up the overall case for Thorp could delay a decision about whether to give it the go-ahead until autumn. BNF said yesterday: 'We are waiting for the pollution inspectorate to deliver its report (on the recent public consultation) to the Environment Department. We believe that all necessary issues will then have been covered.' It added: 'If there is another delay it will be expensive.' The inspectorate's report, which is expected to go to Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, in the next two months, addresses only the environmental and health questions about the plant's operation. Separately, the cabinet office has been co-ordinating meetings between senior civil servants from the environment, trade and industry and agriculture departments and the Foreign Office to look at the wider economic and diplomatic issues. Pressure groups have criticised the lack of open ministerial participation in the debate so far. An environment department decision that these wider discussions need to be brought formally into the Thorp decision would pave the way for ministerial-level meetings on the issues. However, environment ministers would have to erect a 'Chinese wall' during those meetings between their judicial role in evaluating the inspectorate's report and their views on the wider questions.</p>

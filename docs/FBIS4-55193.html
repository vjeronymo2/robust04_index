			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, May 11 (AFP) -- A pregnant woman and  two children were killed in mortar shelling of the Serb-held  city of Brcko in northern Bosnia, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  spokesman Major Dacre Holloway said Wednesday [11 May]. The  civilians were killed at 7:35 p.m. (1735 GMT) Tuesday in a  mortar attack on the city center. Thirteen other civilians were  injured by 120 mm mortars, he said.    The UN Protection Force did not officially attribute the  attack, but an UNPROFOR spokesman in Zagreb said there were  "very strong indications" that the shells were fired from  Bosnian Moslem positions. He said the UN military observers in  Brcko sited nine impact points where shells struck in downtown  Brcko. UN forces fear the city, a critical passage point on a  strategic corridor linking Serb-controlled zones in Croatia and  eastern and western Bosnia to Serbia, is becoming the new  flashpoint in the two-year-old Bosnian war. In Belgrade, a  spokesman for Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic gave a  different death toll, saying four people, including at least one  child and a pregnant woman, were killed. He blamed what he  called Tuesday's "savage" shelling on Bosnian Moslems. [passage  omitted]    In other developments, lawyers who visited 11 French aid  workers held by Bosnian Serbs for more than a month criticized  the "intolerable" psychological conditions of their detention  and accused French officials here of not trying to resolve the  matter. The lawyers, from the Brussels-based International  Federation of Human rights Leagues, said the aid workers from  the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) group had been left in  tight quarters, which created tension, and since have been  separted into two groups.    They are accused of smuggling arms for the Bosnian  Government, which their organization denies. The lawyers  blasted French officials in Sarajevo for "accepting that for a  month these people were left without defense, without a lawyer  and saw no one." French Ambassador here Henri Jacolin said he  saw the group Tuesday night, conceding they were upset over a  Serb decision to prolong their detention by a month but "coming  out of it."    The workers have been held since 8 April at the Sarajevo  suburb of Lukavica pending trial by Serbs, who say they could  face up to 15 years in prison.</p>

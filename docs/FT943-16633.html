			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Casino owner named in HK probe Mr Stanley Ho, Macao's casino king, has been named in a Hong Kong government investigation which alleges irregularities in the conduct of two companies. Mr Ho used to be chairman of one of them, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. The government released an abridged version of the report into the affairs of Tomson Pacific, the World Trade Centre Group (WTCG) and related companies at the weekend. The results of the 18-month investigation have been referred to the police and securities' market regulators for possible action. Mr John Lees, the independent investigator, says companies controlled by Mr Ho together with his Macanese flagship, Sociedad de Turismo e Diversoes de Macau, were involved in avoiding the colony's takeover code. Mr Ho denies any wrongdoing or knowledge of the transactions referred to in the report.</p>

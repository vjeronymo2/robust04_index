			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: A language with many accents - New York's ethnic soccer communities There are two kinds of people here who care passionately about the coming of the World Cup to America - the recently born and the recently arrived. For the first group, and their parents, who were reared on Little League baseball, soccer still represents something exotic and therefore a bit mysterious: 'You mean, no time-outs for beer commercials?' Not so those whose forbears first played the game in distant places and later on the playing fields of Astoria, Red Hook and Greenpoint. Each represents a New York neighbourhood defined by ethnicity. Brooklyn's Bensonhurst has endured as a transplanted Italian village for generations, while Flushing, in Queens, is, in its newest incarnation, Korean and Chinese. Immigrants, needless to say, carry many things with them, some reviled by those who arrived before them, while others, music and food especially, are embraced - at least until something newer comes along. They also bring their games: cricket and field hockey to the Caribbean sections of Brooklyn, Gaelic football to Inwood, in northern Manhattan. But the games, unlike food and dress and odd bits of language and unlike the children who leave for the assimilated life, remain in the neighbourhood. New Yorkers have been playing soccer for 100 years. Not that anyone would necessarily know it outside the neighbourhoods where the game has spawned some 250 local clubs. Now, with World Cup banners fluttering from midtown light poles and with World Cup traffic alerts posted all over town, this supposedly inclusive city is slowly beginning to discover that the game the rest of the world plays has been here all along. 'They've always played it,' says Frank Vardy, a city demographer and authority on local immigration. 'Now they're being reinforced by people from new countries.' He refers to the present wave of immigration, the greatest the city has seen this century. The earlier tide was mostly European, the new one more from Asia and from central and south America. On any given weekend, the fields of Manhattan's Central and Riverside parks are filled with men in cleats and shorts, most speaking Spanish. Wives and children linger nearby. This ethnic cohesiveness parallels the experience of those who came many years before and formed their own clubs with their own people, says Fritz Marth, administrator of the Cosmopolitan Soccer League. Over the generations, ethnic exclusivity has lessened. But that is a function of time. The more recently established Albanian clubs, for instance, dominated by immigrants from Kosovo, are homogeneous, as are the Latino clubs. While the older clubs, like Gjoa, of Norwegian ancestry - one of whose directors goes by the name of Paddy O'Sullivan - endure as sporting and social clubs, the newer players bring with them the nationalistic and ethnic passions recently left at home. 'I wouldn't like to be the referee,' Marth said of matches between newly-arrived Serbs and the Croats who preceded them to Chicago. Because immigrants have been coming to and through New York for so long, and because so many have written so eloquently about their experiences, a mythology about the city has evolved. Like all myths, it is rooted in a hastily inflated version of the truth: in this case, that all who come here really want to become Americans, leading to (outward appearances aside) rapid and enthusiastic assimilation. In reality, a third of all immigrants have, after some time, gone back. Many are disappointed. Many never intended to stay. And many who remain never quite get used to the sound of America as home. This means that almost any excuse to embrace the past will do. Italian restaurants, which for years hung portraits of the national team above their cash registers, now display hand-printed 'Forza Azzurri' signs in their windows. It is much the same in Irish pubs, where second- and third-generation Americans, often only Irish on St Patrick's Day, reaffirm their kinship with the young men who have recently arrived, looking for work in the building trades. The World Cup also comes to a New York caught in the midst of one of its most frenzied sporting seasons in decades. The ice hockey Rangers have just won their first championship in 54 years and basketball's Knicks have elbowed their way into the championship playoff. It was always tough for soccer to compete, given national ignorance of the game. But that matters little in the city's 'Second Little Italy' on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, or in the Irish pubs of Woodside, in Queens. 'It's your team,' says Vardy. 'It's your country's team.'

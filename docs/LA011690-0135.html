			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HIP CONDITION FORCING LOMAX TO LEAVE FOOTBALL, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> Phoenix Cardinals quarterback Neil Lomax, plagued by a degenerative hip  condition, is retiring after eight years in the National Football League, a  newspaper reported.  </P> <P> The Oregonian said Lomax, 30, planned to make the announcement today in  Phoenix.  </P> <P> Lomax, a two-time Pro Bowl choice, missed the 1989 season because of an  arthritic left hip but had been undergoing therapy with the hope he could make  a comeback next season.  </P> <P> The hip condition improved but not enough to allow him to return to the rigors  of professional football, said Lomax, a native of the Portland suburb of Lake  Oswego.  </P> <P> "I decided in the last three or four months that I can't play and I don't want  to be lying around praying for a miracle," Lomax said Monday afternoon as he  prepared to fly to Phoenix.  </P> <P> "It didn't happen -- but that's not to say it won't," Lomax said. "But I'm done  playing, and I want to get on with my life."  </P></p>

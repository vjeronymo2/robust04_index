			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: STANDARD &amp; POOR'S STUDIES LOWERING NEWHALL LAND RATING  </P> <P> Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co.'s offer to buy back 10% of its equity units has  prompted Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. to reconsider its opinion of the Valencia  company's debt.  </P> <P> Last week, Newhall, a real estate and agricultural concern, launched an offer  to buy back up to 2 million of its units for between $100 million and $112  million. The offer was part of Newhall's settlement of a lawsuit brought last  year by dissident unit holders, in which Newhall agreed to buy back at least  $40 million of its units.  </P> <P> Newhall's units, which are similar to shares of stock, trade on the New York  Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> After the offer was announced, S&amp;P, a credit-rating service in New York,  said it placed Newhall's $50 million of convertible subordinated debentures on  its "CreditWatch" list. That means S&amp;P is thinking about cutting its rating  of the debt, which is currently BB+  </P> <P> S&amp;P's ratings, which range from D (for near-default speculative issues) to  AAA (for top investment-grade debt) help investors determine a borrower's  credit worthiness. If a company's rating is lowered, investors might force the  company to pay a higher interest rate to borrow money in the future.  </P> <P> S&amp;P had expected Newhall to repurchase from $40 million to $80 million  worth of its units. But Newhall said it would actually buy up to $112 million  worth, using $54 million of available cash and a new bank line of credit.  </P> <P> "This partly debt-financed buyback could shrink cash flow protection  dramatically," S&amp;P said, referring to Newhall's ability to consistently  generate enough cash from its business to service all of its bills.  </P> <P> But S&amp;P also said protection "could be restored" if Newhall management  "takes steps to quickly reduce debt" and if some of the bond holders convert  their debt into more units.  </P> <P> Robert Wilke, Newhall's chief financial officer, said Newhall expects many of  the bond holders to convert their holdings into  </P> <P> units to take advantage of its offering. That would substantially cut the  amount of bonds still outstanding and reduce Newhall's overall long-term debt,  which now totals about $75 million, he said.  </P></p>

Veber, Russian Academy of Sciences, </F> Institute of Applied Physics, Nizhnyy Novgorod]    [Abstract] A theoretical analysis was made of the effect of  wind waves on the point scattering function of viewing systems  used in the observation of undersea objects. The author points  out initially that, while in the case of diffused illumination  from a fairly wide light source the optical transmission  function can be described as a Gauss function, in the presence  of directed illumination from a single light source, such as the  sun, the Gauss function no longer applies, and determining the  optical transmission function becomes extremely difficult. In  this case an analysis of the point scattering function is more  useful.    Through a series of formulae the author determines the  integral paramemeters of the point scattering function under  conditions of a rough sea surface illuminated by direct sunlight.    The author concludes that distortions of the point  scattering  function are mainly caused by the effects of the  cross-correlation of light radiation falling on the sea surface  and of that coming from beneath it, and are specific for the  conditions of directed illumination. At the same time the degree  of distortion is dependent on a number of factors, chief of  which are the angle between the direction of illumination and  that of observation, the depth of the undersea object under  observation, and the roughness of the waves, which is determined  by surface wind velocity.</p>

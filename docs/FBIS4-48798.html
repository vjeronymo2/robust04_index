			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Edem Kodjo in Lome on 25 May -- </F> recorded]    [Text] Fellow Togolese and dear countrymen: It is a month  since the head of state entrusted me with the duty of forming  the first government of the Fourth Republic, and thus to outline  and conduct national policy in accordance with the spirit and  letter of the Constitution. First and foremost, I would like to  thank you once again and to pay you tribute for the courage,  determination, and sense of civic duty you have displayed since  the beginning of the process to democratize our country and our  institutions.    After the 6 and 20 February legislative elections, you  entrusted the responsibility of managing national affairs on  your behalf to the parliamentary majority comprising the Action  Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy  [UTD]. It is within the framework of this parliamentary  majority and, therefore, the victory of yesterday's  opposition--your victory--that I was appointed prime minister by  the president of the Republic, by virtue of Article 66 of the  Constitution which stipulates that the head of state shall  appoint the prime minister from within the parliamentary  majority.    My sole concern, in accepting this post, was to save this  parliamentary majority. My concern was also to give all the  chances to the former opposition, together with all the  political forces, to accomplish change, which remains the  primary objective of the battle we have been waging for three  years. We have all realized that beyond our individual  personalities and political structures, there is our country  Togo and all the Togolese people with their numerous everyday  problems and difficulties.    Centering the debate on how to jointly manage the present  situation and to downplay our divisions seem to me, today, to be  a major priority. It is with the interest of the suffering  Togolese people who expect a better tomorrow in mind that I, in  my capacity as prime minister, have just formed a government  under the terms of the Constitution. I shall submit to  parliament the joint government program agreed upon by the CAR  and the UTD and leave it to each of the deputies, as  representatives of the people, to study and decide on it.    The problems which our country has to cope with are many and  urgent. We must ensure that there is genuine national  reconciliation by extending a brotherly hand to all. It is to  this end that the CAR and the UTD accepted the idea of a  government of national union proposed by the head of state.    We must also settle, once and for all, the problem of our  countrymen who are still living as refugees outside the country,  as well as the problem of displaced persons within the country.  We must ensure the regular payment of salaries of workers and  pensions of the retired.    We must stop the continuing deterioration of the economic  situation of the state and enterprises which are faced with very  great difficulties and adopt adequate measures that will help to  keep under control the negative effects of the devaluation of  the CFA franc on our economy and on the purchasing power of  Togolese. We must create conditions that will allow women  traders and the informal sector to recover their former  dynamism. We must find solutions to the specific problems of  our farmers and the rural areas in general. We must find  appropriate measures to end the current malfunctioning of our  schools and university -- the University of Benin -- and to  restore hope in the youth by securing a more promising future  for them.    At the political level, we must rapidly give the democratic  opposition a legal statute to enable it to exist legally, to  fully play its constitutional role, and to work toward the  return of all politicians into politics, regardless of their  political leanings, through fruitful, open, and brotherly  dialogue. We must adopt as early as possible the organic laws  that will govern the institutions that are indispensable for the  setting up of a law-abiding state and adopt measures for the law  to be in the service of all. We must see to the reinforcement  of public security and promote freedom of opinion, meeting, and  association. In this regard, we must lay particular emphasis on  the media code. Last, one of the major concerns of the  government that I will lead will be that of sound and equitable  management of state media in the service of pluralism,  democracy, and development.    Fellow Togolese and dear countrymen, I would like to call  you  to witness and to reaffirm to you my indestructible attachment  to the common objective of change that we have set for  ourselves. I reaffirm before the entire Togolese people my  willingness to base government action on the common  parliamentary majority program with openness and readiness to  cooperate with all. We must avoid every kind of sectarianism by  resolutely putting ourselves at the service of the entire  Togolese people because national interests must override  partisan considerations. I appeal for the union of all  democratic forces and all people of goodwill so that we can  consolidate our efforts in order to respond to the strong desire  for change expressed by all Togolese. The broad-based  government of national union will strive tirelessly for the  attainment of its objectives which are national reconciliation,  economic redress, and social integration.    This government is perhaps not the one we would have wished  to form but the delay in its formation and the suffering of the  people have forced us to form it. It must set down to work and  to try to safeguard the future. With outstretched arms, I hope  that the appeal that I have just launched will be heeded by all  political forces desirous of contributing to the redress of our  country Togo. On my part, I can assure you that I will ensure  that Togo is governed to the best of its interests.    Long live democratic change. Long live Togo.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Small players plug into telecom niches: UK deregulation will result in a lively market Dozens of companies are starting to chip away at profitable niches of the newly-deregulated UK telecommunications market. But those who hoped last year's government white paper would launch a head-on clash between British Telecom, which towers over the market, and new competitors on the lines of Mercury Communications will be disappointed. Instead, the emerging competitors are finding ways to use radio and satellites for individual telecommunications services. The white paper largely abolished the duopoly of BT and Mercury. Mr Peter Lilley, then trade and industry secretary, said then that the new policy would make Britain the most open telecommunications market in the world. The policy has drawn a flurry of new competitors. Six companies have been granted licences by the Department of Trade and Industry, more than 20 companies have lodged applications and another 30 have expressed interest in doing so. But of these, only Sprint, the US long-distance carrier, and National Network, a private UK group, plan to build mainstream national and international networks. Even then, the sums earmarked for investment - between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m in Sprint's case - are small by the standards of this capital intensive industry. More substantial groups such as American Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications giant, British Rail and the regional electricity companies - all of which had shown interest in competing against BT - have so far failed to act. As a result, BT's principal competitor will continue to be Mercury. So far it has invested about Pounds 1.5bn and plans to boost investment by a further Pounds 500m in each of the next three years. This is still relatively small compared with the Pounds 2.5bn BT invests every year. But Mercury is steadily increasing its market share and now has just over 5 per cent of the Pounds 15bn-a-year market, concentrating mainly on large business customers and long-distance traffic. Potential competitors have feared that BT might unleash a price war if it thought its market share were threatened. They have also been deterred by regulatory delays: the UK government has yet to clarify whether carrying international calls - the most lucrative part of the market - will be open to competition beyond BT and Mercury. And companies have been reluctant to commit themselves to heavy investment while the economy is weak. Some of the same factors also affect companies planning to compete in niches. But these are counting on new technologies to win their battles against BT. The ideas include: Radio tails. Ionica, a private UK group, and US-based Millicom want to put telephone aerials on the roofs of homes and use radio signals rather than copper wire to transmit phone calls to and from exchanges. They believe this will be cheaper and faster than digging up the roads to lay cables. Ionica's managing director, Mr Nigel Playford, says he aims to win at least 5 per cent of the residential market - about 1m customers - within 10 years. Millicom plans to provide picture-phone and data communications as well. Roof-to-roof communications by satellite. British Aerospace Communications and Alpha Lyracom, a private US group, have been awarded international satellite licences. They plan to provide businesses with private networks by installing dishes on office roofs and bouncing the signals off satellites. No roads need to be dug up, meaning services can be provided quickly and cheaply. Such services are popular in the US where there are nearly 70,000 dishes installed. They are now expected to develop in Europe as tight regulations are relaxed. BAe has been granted satellite licences in France and Germany and is part of a multinational consortium that plans to build the Dollars 500m Orion satellite system in 1995. Alpha Lyracom owns the Pan American satellite and has licences in the US, France and Germany. Cable television. Large North American telephone companies - US West, Bell Canada, Pacific Telesis, South Western Bell and Nynex - have built up stakes in most of the UK's 133 local cable TV franchises. Costs can be kept down if telephone and TV services are sold together because roads must only be dug up once. So far telephone service is available in six areas and 30,000 telephone lines have been provided. The Cable Television Association expects the number to increase to 100,000 by the end of the year. Mobile communications. Of the two existing cellular services, Vodafone, with 700,000 customers, has been consistently more successful than Cellnet, which is 60 per cent owned by BT and has 550,000 customers. Three groups - Mercury, Hong Kong's Hutchison Telecom and Unitel, a consortium including US West - have been licensed to form personal communications networks, a rival type of service. Both Vodafone and Unitel have asked the government for licences to provide fixed services to customers. Buying capacity on international cables in bulk and using it to provide customers with a phone service. World Communications and ACC, which both act as resellers in North America, want to set up as international resellers in the UK. WorldCom plans to concentrate on UK-US traffic, while ACC would focus on UK-Canada traffic. Resellers are able to make a profit because the price of bulk capacity is relatively low, while charges for individual international calls are high. Analysts estimate that resellers could cut the price of transatlantic calls to 30c a minute from about Dollars 1 today. The impact of any of these new niche players on its own is likely to be small. None will come close to challenging BT's dominance. But, taken together, the overall result of the emerging rivals will be a range of new services, lower prices for some products and a more lively telecommunications market.</p>

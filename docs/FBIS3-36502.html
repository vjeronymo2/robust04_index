"Two hundred years ago Georgia became part of Russia forever  as Tiflis [Tbilisi] Province and had no right to secede. For us  Georgia is a state that does not exist," Zhirinovskiy told  Interfax.    He said Georgia should be allowed to exist on its own,  "without Russian subsidies, without our assistance." "Let  Turkish troops come and show them what Turkish democracy means  if they don't want Russian democracy," he said.</p>

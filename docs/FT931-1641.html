			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (2): Pace is set by the slowest - The regulatory bureaucracy THE JAPANESE financial system seems stuck in a kind of no man's land. During the 1980s there was considerable liberalisation, which made for greater competition and allowed financial institutions to move into new areas of business. But the deregulation did not go so far that financial institutions learned to do without the guiding hand of powerful bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan. As a result, a struggle is going on over who should pay for the consequences of puncturing the speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s - and how it should be paid. Many financial institutions and some regulators seem to believe that the best way to clear up the mess is to revert to the old regime, in which the finance ministry and the Bank of Japan regulated the industry tightly but kept it safe. Others believe the way ahead is to press on with liberalisation and deregulation to make sure that the lesson of the bubble - that financial institutions must bear responsibility for their managerial mistakes - is learned. The Japanese financial system's heavy regulation dates from the second world war. The finance ministry and the Bank of Japan emerged largely unscathed from the initial purge conducted by the occupation forces. The Bank of Japan and the ministry stood at the top of a strictly hierarchical financial system, in which bank lending, interest rates, the expansion of bank operations and the bond market were strictly controlled. The system of wartime controls which helped to funnel investment into Japanese industry during the three decades after the war, began to fragment during the 1970s when the government started running up large budget deficits. This generated a larger, more competitive government bond market, which in turn stimulated money markets. But it was in the 1980s that competition between different types of finance accelerated. For most of the post-war period, banks had been the main source of funds for manufacturing companies. In the 1980s most large companies turned from traditional banking relationships to the equity and bond markets for their long term funds. The banks were forced to compete in unfamiliar areas such as consumer and real estate lending. Much of this was facilitated and encouraged by the economic bureaucracy which had previously kept such a tight reign on the financial system. Now the consequences are an embarrassment for the authorities. The banks are burdened by mounting bad debts from speculative real estate lending which has turned sour. The stock market is in the doldrums. New issues have dried up, trading volumes have dwindled and the Nikkei average hovers unsteadily between 16,000 and 18,000. The aftermath of the bubble is exposing significant differences, partly rooted in their very different cultures, between the Bank of Japan and the finance ministry. The Bank of Japan prides itself on being a national institution, with strong roots in local branches. Even its senior officials are expected to serve long stints in the provinces. The finance ministry, by contrast, is far more Tokyo-bound; its face is turned towards the government - and politics. Most of the time it is a deeply pragmatic institution, seeking solutions to political problems. It has a few fiercely held beliefs - opposition to higher government borrowing, for example. New ministers such as Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the recently appointed finance minster, are expected to defend the institution's corporate line. The finance ministry invariably recruits not just from a single university (Tokyo University) but from a single department (the law faculty). Exceptions are rare. The Bank of Japan, through its daily money market operations, prides itself on being closer to the realities of financial markets. The finance ministry deals in the currency of regulations and administration. It has always been clear which has had the upper hand: the finance ministry. However, under Mr Yasushi Mieno, its governor, the Bank of Japan has become more independent. His speeches are littered with admonishing references to the excesses of the bubble era and the need for discipline and restructuring. The Bank of Japan appears to want a more far-reaching restructuring of the financial system. The finance ministry favours a more gradualist approach, in an attempt to keep most financial institutions afloat. The Bank is urging the commercial banks to take swift action to write off their bad loans. Bank officials are warning the bigger banks that they may only have limited room for manoeuvre to write these off. The banks are making strong operating profits, partly because successive reductions in the Bank of Japan's official interest rate have reduced the cost to the banks of borrowing from the Bank. As these reductions in interest rates have not been fully passed on to customers, the banks have been able to widen their profit margins. However, the Bank is warning the banks that in the next year or two, as economic growth recovers, interest rates may begin to rise, cutting into the banks' profits. This would limit their ability to pay for bad loans out of their profits. Bank officials recognise that this policy would require some banks to declare losses for the first time in their history. In the long run, bank officials believe that smaller, weaker banks will need to be absorbed by larger, stronger competitors, while entire sectors of the industry - such as the housing loan companies - will need to be restructured. They enjoyed strong growth during the real estate boom of the 1980s. However, now that most commercial banks are capable of real estate lending, the case for separate housing loan companies has been almost eliminated. Finance ministry officials in the ministry's commercial banks bureau want to take a much more gradual approach to the write-offs. One official says: 'It is not practical nor possible to write off bad loans in one or two strokes in the near future. It is all very well for Sumitomo to write off bad loans, but it is a very profitable bank. For less profitable banks it is much more difficult.' The model for the finance ministry approach is the recent deal to bail out Nippon Housing Loan, the troubled housing finance arm of several commercial banks. Rather than swiftly write off Nippon Housing's bad loans, its nine banks have agreed to forego interest on outstanding loans worth Y830bn for up to 10 years. The finance ministry is wedded to its traditional approach. This approach is to view the financial system as a convoy, in which no member can be left behind even if the rest have to move forward only at the pace of the slowest.</p>

The "working group"  session on investment is part of the wide-ranging framework  trade talks the two countries have been holding to increase  access and sales of foreign goods and services in Japan.    Officials from the two countries were also meeting  separately  in Washington on the access and sales of auto parts in Japan.    Japanese officials characterized the latest session on  investment issues as preliminary, noting that the investment  sector is not on the "priority list" that must be completed by  the February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and President Bill Clinton.    Discussions were limited primarily to a presentation of  matters of concern both to the U.S. and Japan on investment  issues. Among the issues the U.S. raised were excessive  government regulation on foreign direct investment and problems  foreign investors face in the acquisition of Japanese  corporations.    Washington has charged that Japan deliberately blocks the  entry of foreign capital into Japan, which U.S. officials said  has caused a "substantial loss of potential exports" from  foreign firms to their Japanese subsidiaries.    According to U.S. figures, Japan hosted about 12 billion  dollars in foreign direct investment in 1991, representing only  0.7 percent of the world's stock of inward direct investment.    By contrast, the U.S. hosted 414 billion dollars, or 22  percent, of the stock of inward direct investment. The  corresponding figure for the European Union -- as the former  European Community is now known -- was 714 billion dollars, or  38 percent, U.S. officials said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 8 June, Trade Minister Va Huot  made a surprising outburst toward Economy and Finance Minister  Sam Rangsi after the Economy and Finance Ministry issued Notice  057, dated 28 May 1994, dealing with a new regulation to take  effect on 1 July 1994. According to this notice, a number of  goods will be subjected to testing before they can be imported  into Cambodia. The Economy and Finance Ministry assigned the  ITS and FTS companies to conduct the testing required by this  notice.    Mr. Va Huot considered this action to be rude interference  in  the Trade Ministry's affairs. He and several top officials of  the Trade Ministry's specialized departments called the new  five-point regulation an error in judgment by the Economy and  Finance Ministry. In its five points, the regulation says that  crude oil, natural gas, all types of medicine and medical  equipment, merchandise belonging or relating to the Royal  Government, products categorized as relief or humanitarian aid,  and so forth worth $1,000 or more must be inspected by the FTS  company or another company called "Inchcape Testing Service  International Limited," or ITS for short.    Mr. Va Huot stressed that the Economy and Finance Ministry  should not interfere to this extent in the Trade Ministry's  domain. The Economy and Finance Ministry's notice and regulation  constitute a gross violation by one ministry against another.  He claimed the regulation may have been initiated because the  Economy and Finance Ministry wanted to dissolve some units under  the Trade Ministry's jurisdiction.    Concerning the import and export of goods, the Trade  Ministry  already has all the necessary departments to check and test  merchandise. As for the import of petroleum products, the  testing of crude oil and natural gas has been carried out over  the last dozen years by CAMCONTROL utilizing a laboratory  purchased by the government for $100,000 to test imported  petroleum products.    Currently, CAMCONTROL is coordinating its operations with  France's DGCCRI, a major organization known around the world.  This organization has cooperated with CAMCONTROL on the basis of  an agreement signed in 1991. Up until now, the organization has  assisted us in such tasks as the quality testing of counterfeit  goods and drafting laws to control counterfeit goods.    A Trade Ministry official said: The most interesting thing  is that our cooperation with an important organization  recognized by the government has not even been concluded, but  someone, instead of helping enhance this cooperation, is already  seeking to usurp the rights and tasks of other agencies. What  does this all mean?    Minister Va Huot added: "I have always supported every  specialized department in the Trade Ministry." He went on to  say that the Finance Ministry should have known what work has  already been done in compliance with Royal Government decrees,  meaning that the Finance Ministry should not seek to create new  problems. If the Finance Ministry wishes to carry out any  enterprises it deems beneficial to the national community, it  would be commendable if the two ministries talked with each  another first to bring progress and success to these important  enterprises.    The minister also mentioned the agreement signed between the  Finance Ministry and the French company Total, saying it is  pressuring the CKC company under the auspices of the Trade  Ministry into a joint venture with Total. Such a move can only  create problems, he said. The Finance Ministry should not  intrude in the Trade Ministry's domain. He wondered whether  similar actions taken by the Finance Ministry in the past had  ever born any fruit or seen any success at all.    It is not known yet whether Mr. Va Huot's reaction to Mr.  Sam  Rangsi was officially presented to the Royal Government.  Nonetheless, we hope this disharmony will be settled by the  Royal Government soon.</p>

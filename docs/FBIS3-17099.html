			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 22 (SNARK)--As it has become known to  SNARK from unofficial sources, the former Azerbaijan President  Ayaz Mutalibov, drawn to criminal liability by the present Baku  authorities, is compelled to hide himself in one of the Russian  cities.    A source close to Mutalibov's surrounding told SNARK that  the  ex-president considers Geydar Aliyev as main guilty person in  Karabakh conflict. He claimed that Aliyev, while being the  First Secretary of Azerbaijan Communist Party, pursued a policy  of human rights infringement among the national minorities  living in the republic: of Lezghins, Kurds, Talishes, Tats,  Avars, and of Armenians. This policy resulted in the open  confrontation.    Escape from the crisis is seen by Mutalibov in account of  interests of all national minorities living in Azerbaijan,  namely in federalization of political system in the republic,  with whom he never cut off his relations while living outside.    Speaking about the Karabakh war, Mutalibov observed that it  is lost due to policy of illegal, as he thinks, presidents  Elchibey and Aliyev, who for the sake of their own ambitions had  cast their people into a real slaughter.</p>

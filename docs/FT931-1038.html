			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Redwood seeks council initiatives LOCAL COUNCILS should act as the natural leaders of their communities in directing initiatives and seeking investment, Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, urged yesterday, Alison Smith writes. As part of the government's drive to develop a better partnership between central and local government, Mr Redwood said local authorities should expand on their experience in developing bids for City Challenge funds to show their ability to co-operate with local business and community leaders in other areas. Labour last night suffered its second landslide council by-election defeat in three weeks at London's troubled Lambeth borough. Liberal Democrat Ms Sally Prentice gained a seat at Vauxhall's Bishops ward on a 37 per cent swing from the 1990 polls. In Westminster, the Tories kept their seat in Hyde Park ward in the by-election caused by the resignation of former leader Dame Shirley Porter, but there was a 3.9 per cent swing to Labour.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: DEERFIELD: FOCUS;  </P> <P> TREE-LINED STREETS THROUGHOUT. . .THAT'S DEERFIELD  </P> <P> I think that I shall never see  </P> <P> a poem lovely as a tree. . . .  </P> <P> Poems are made by fools like me,  </P> <P> But only God can make a tree.  </P> <P>  Joyce Kilmer's famous poem, "Trees," first appeared in the early 1900s. And  although Irvine was not created until more than a half-century later, one might  think he had actually strolled through the city's Deerfield neighborhood on a  spring day -- then sat down and wrote the poem. Trees dominate the area,  particularly lavender-blooming jacarandas, which line most of the streets in  this sleepy neighborhood.  </P> <P> Deerfield is just off Culver Drive near Irvine Center Drive, between the Santa  Ana and San Diego freeways. A pair of oversize signs etched with the word  Deerfield and deers' heads mark the district's entrance on Culver Drive.  </P> <P> Deerfield, built in the mid-1970s, is a mixture of townhouses and single-family  homes. The virtual elimination of through streets and long straightaways gives  it an enclave feeling more common to private compounds. And the use of the  zero-lot-line layout, a concept that places the house on its lot line and makes  all surrounding space usable, gives Deerfield's single-family homes a look not  normally associated with developments.  </P> <P> Home appreciation is no stranger to Deerfield, either. Townhouses ranged from  $38,000 to $69,000 when they went on the market in October, 1974. Today they  fetch upward of $175,000. Single-family residences that opened in January,  1975, with prices from $55,000 to $70,000 now bring $300,000. At the center of  the neighborhood is a 10-acre park, offering the amenities that most community  parks have, such as tennis, racquetball and volleyball courts.  </P> <P> Don James, a student at Orange Coast College and community park leader,  believes Deerfield has another asset that complements its arboreal charms. "The  kids here are great; they are very well behaved," he says. "This must be a  direct reflection on their parents and how they're being brought up. I enjoy  working here."  </P> <P> According to David Flint, president of the Deerfield Community Assn., the most  prominent neighborhood issue during the last five years has been whether to  build a new railroad overcrossing at Yale Avenue.  </P> <P> The existing overpass -- a covered, quaint (at least by modern standards)  affair -- has for years served pedestrians crossing the Santa Fe tracks. And  its narrow construction pretty much precludes any kind of wheeled traffic  except bicycles.  </P> <P> A proposal to expand the bridge into a full-blown traffic crossing brought the  matter to grief. Such a bridge would have made Yale an unbroken traffic artery  running from the West Yale Loop, through Deerfield, and all the way to the  northern city limits.  </P> <P> After a prolonged battle between residents and the City Council, and even a  lawsuit filed by three residents, the neighborhood got what it wanted -- sort  of. In lieu of a multilane public traffic overcrossing, the bridge to be built  will be limited to bicycles, walkers and emergency vehicles. Construction is  under way, with completion expected this fall.  </P> <P> One thing Deerfield does not need, neighbors agree, is cross-town traffic fumes  fouling the tree blossoms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1988 est.) 2,839  </P> <P> 1980-88 change: -9%  </P> <P> Median Age: 34.3  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix: White (non-Latino), 84%; Latino, 5%; Black, 1%; Other, 10%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 35.0 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 33.9 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $20,152  </P> <P> Median household: $54,130  </P> <P> Average household: $50,870  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 12%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 40%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 31%  </P> <P> More than $75,000: 17%  </P></p>

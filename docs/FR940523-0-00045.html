The comment agreed with Calgene's documentation that the widespread use of antibiotics has led to an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment, but went on to postulate that this was evidence that introducing antibiotic-resistance genes into plants has human health implications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment further asserted that the ``scientific question is whether the resistance genes in the crops can be transferred by any mechanism [to] organisms that might be human pathogens,'' and that the company should be required experimentally to ``determine the rates of gene transfer to soil bacteria from plant debris, the persistence or selection of organisms containing such genes in soil ecosystems, and other important factors in the assessment of the likelihood of releases compromising the use of antibiotics.'' The comment noted that Calgene analyzed these issues ``in some detail,'' but with ``arm chair calculations, most based on extrapolations from experiments done with other organisms under other circumstances.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second comment noted that Calgene had supplied information that three kinds of bacteria, with and without plasmids <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  carrying antibiotic resistance genes, had little effect on several measures of soil ecosystems, but wrote that the ``relevance of experiments on bacteria to releases of plants is marginal, at best.'' A third comment asserted, without any supporting evidence, that ``genetic resistance to antibiotics in these plants could be transferred by plasmids to microorganisms in the soil and elsewhere in the food chain.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Plasmids are self-replicating units of DNA commonly found in bacteria and are responsible for transfer of antibiotic resistance between bacteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA agrees that increasing the number and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microbes may have serious human health implications if those microbes are themselves pathogens of humans or domesticated animals, or share the same microenvironment as such pathogens. FDA considers the relevant scientific question to be whether there would be a meaningful increase in antibiotic-resistant pathogenic microbes in the human environment due to transfer of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene from plants to microbes. This issue was also the subject of considerable discussion at the April 1994 Food Advisory Committee meeting. As discussed in detail above, FDA has determined, based on the body of evidence presented by Calgene and based on the discussions of the Food Advisory Committee (Ref. 1), that the transfer of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene from plants to microbes will not occur at a detectable frequency and overall will result in no significant increase in the numbers of antibiotic-resistant microbes. Regarding whether Calgene should be required to determine experimentally the rate of transfer, the agency notes that Calgene's calculations represent worst-case scenarios, and the agency believes it would not be useful to do experiments to attempt to measure that which is too small to measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the relevance of experiments on bacterial releases to the environment, FDA finds that information concerning the lack of an environmental effect from the release of microbes with and without antibiotic resistance genes is of limited direct relevance to the environmental effects of plants with antibiotic resistance genes. The agency did not rely on this information in reaching its determination that there will be no significant increase in the antibiotic-resistant microorganism population of the soil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally the claim that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene could be transferred from plants to bacteria by plasmids is without basis because there is no evidence that plasmids exist in plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

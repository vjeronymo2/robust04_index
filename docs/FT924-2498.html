			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Budget row threatens to undermine summit objectives THE EC's north-south divide over a budget for the future financing of the Community was last night threatening to poison efforts to get the Maastricht treaty back on the rails, and start the process of opening up the EC to new members. It was feared the clash over money would result in the downgrading of other Maastricht objectives - from beefed up research and development to the common foreign and security policy - if large fiscal transfers to the EC weaker economies had to come out of a restricted budget. Ratification of the treaty, and agreement on the Delors II finance package, are the two conditions the 12 set at the Lisbon summit for opening negotiations with new applicants to the EC. The poorer countries are likely to insist the EC sticks to these conditions. They are the negotiating aces for Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece who are insisting on a doubling of EC development aid. Both Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, and Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese premier, said yesterday they wanted a significantly improved finance package, and clear dates from Denmark and the UK on when they will ratify the treaty. These were their conditions for starting 'informal' negotiations on enlargement. The four poorer countries led by Spain are rejecting the UK presidency's latest financing proposals. These would raise the annual EC budget from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54bn) this year to Ecu80.3bn by 1999, in today's money. Commission president Jacques Delors' own compromise, scaling back sharply his initial ambitions, is an increase to Ecu86.2bn in 1999. Under the British plan, total regional and development funding would rise from Ecu18.6bn now, to Ecu26.8bn in 1999, as against the Commission target of Ecu30.2bn. 'The proposal of the presidency at this moment is not enough,' said Mr Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister. 'With that proposal we cannot meet the obligations of the treaty.' But the drive for 'cohesion' - meaning increased budget transfers from the north and centre of the Community to the south and periphery - could have as its price the sacrifice of common policies for the EC as a whole, in areas like transport, the environment, research, and pan-European infrastructure. If, as optimistic Irish and German officials reckoned yesterday, a 'split-the-difference' compromise is reached tonight, there will not be much money left over. This is Mr Delors' particular anguish. He pointed out in a letter to EC leaders that whereas funding to the cohesion countries reaches 90m people, a further 130m Europeans are served by structural funds - aid for industrially stricken areas, training the long-term and young unemployed, and rural development. With the US and Japan stepping up their already much larger research effort, the Commission president said his compromise plan to increase EC research spending by an average 4.4 per cent a year had been whittled down in the UK figures to a mere 0.5 per cent a year (Mr Delors' original proposal was for an annual increase of 11.5 per cent). Helping to stimulate jobs and helping people whose jobs are at risk through restructuring is, in the Delors view, part of the essence of a Europe constructed for its citizens. 'You can't continue with the Community in the form it was relaunched in from 1985 with these figures on the table. It's not a question of the Commission having some expensive plaything,' Mr Delors told journalists on the eve of the summit. 'It's a question of enabling each citizen to see what the Community is about, a question of principle.' 'There won't be any common policies left to bring closer to the people,' said one Irish official, alluding to the EC's 'subsidiarity' pledge to make Community decision-making more decentralised and open. Apart from the unyielding demands of the south, there is little or no room to claw back money from the foreign or farm budgets. Increasing external funding is one of the few areas of agreement; foreign policy 'is everybody's hobby,' a German official said yesterday. And France is certain to demand an increase in farm spending, as compensation for not pressing its hostility to last month's farm trade deal with the US.</p>

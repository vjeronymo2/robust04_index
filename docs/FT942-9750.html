			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela continues to be a puzzle / Assessing the outlook for the country's equity market To most foreign investors, Venezuela remains a high-risk puzzle. The economic policies of the administration of 78-year-old President Rafael Caldera, who began a five-year term last February, offer a confusing combination of government intervention and market init-iatives. The outlook in 1994 is for a second straight year of negative economic growth, and investors are not at all sure that the new government's economic policies - aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit, attracting private investment and generating regular economic growth with low inflation - will work. With high inflation (46 per cent last year) and a monetary unit that has declined by 46 per cent, using the parallel market exchange rate, since January 1993, equity investors have to watch movements on the Caracas stock exchange carefully to make real short and medium-term gains. Following an impressive rally in February, after Mr Caldera took office, the stock exchange has been generally weak. This year's peak came on February 21, when the index hit 29,798.33, up 36 per cent from the end of 1993, partly due to the entry of several investment funds from overseas. Since then the market has fallen some 26 per cent. These figures turn out to be even worse when one takes into account the country's inflation rate of 12.7 per cent for the first four months of 1994. Adjusted for currency depreciation, the index is down 37.5 per cent from its February peak, and 20 per cent since the start of this year. Equities fell sharply following the resignation of the president of the central bank, Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, on April 26. Domestic and international investors reacted negatively to her departure - while in office she had maintained real interest rates and protected international reserves in spite of pressure from political and business sectors to change. In the period following Mrs Krivoy's resignation the bolivar lost 9.6 per cent against the dollar in seven business days up to May 5 and, during the same period, the stock index dropped by 4.4 per cent. It is not yet clear if Mrs Krivoy's successor, Mr Antonio Casas, will be able to resist pressure from the government to push down interest rates. Nor is it clear how Venezuela's international monetary reserves will hold up during a year of declining oil revenues. Reserves fell by Dollars 1.7bn (14 per cent) during the first quarter, and are estimated to have slipped some Dollars 1bn in April. In spite of all these problems there was some good news for the stock market earlier this month when the government decided that its new tax on private sector debit transactions at banks would not be applied in full force to the stock exchange. This 0.75 per cent tax which, in amended form, takes effect later this month, would have raised trading costs considerably for both buyers and sellers, since at least four cheques are involved in a normal transaction and each one could have been taxed. However, after lobbying by the stock exchange authorities, the government decided to apply the levy only to the buyer's cheque. Venezuela's external debt bonds have been hit hard this year, following on from the failure of Banco Latino, the country's second-largest bank, last January, which raised concern over the health of other banks, as well as the increase in US interest rates. But even though the government is facing a steep decline in oil export revenues this year - and thus lower taxes from the petroleum sector - there have been no indications so far that it will have trouble servicing its external debt.</p>

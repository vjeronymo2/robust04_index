			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat at the time the species is determined to be endangered. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these taxa. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affecting the Species,'' the taxa face numerous anthropogenic threats. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as required in a designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to these plants from take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to their decline. The listing of these taxa as endangered publicizes the rarity of the plants and, thus, can make these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants. All involved parties and the major landowners have been notified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the general location and importance of protecting the habitat of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxa. Protection of the habitat of the taxa will be addressed through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designation of critical habitat for these taxa is not prudent at this time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because such a designation would increase the potential for vandalism,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collecting, or other human activities and is unlikely to aid in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation of these taxa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions, requirements for Federal recognition, and prohibitions against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  listed plants are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 402. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to insure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with the Service. One or more populations of 10 of the taxa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are located on federally owned and/or managed land: Four taxa are located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii and one taxon in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kalaupapa NHP on Molokai; six taxa are located on military lands, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one species on Makua Military Reservation on Oahu and five taxa on PTA on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the island of Hawaii; two taxa are found in Hakalau Forest National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wildlife Refuge on the island of Hawaii; and a population of one taxon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs at a U.S. Coast Guard lighthouse on Maui. Federal agencies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would become involved if any of their activities may affect these 21 taxa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the National Park Service, Department of Defense, Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17.62, 17.63, 17.71 and 17.72 for endangered and threatened plants set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered or threatened plant species. With respect to the 20 plant taxa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this rule listed as endangered, all of the prohibitions of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. With respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the taxon listed as threatened, the provisions of 50 CFR 17.71, apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal with respect to any endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or theatened plant for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to import or export; transport in interstate or foreign commerce in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any such species from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas under Federal jurisdiction. For plants listed as endangered, the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibits the malicious damage or destruction of any such species on any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area under Federal jurisdiction; or to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criminal trespass law. Section 4(d) of the Act allows for the provision of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such protection to threatened species through regulation. This protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may apply to this species in the future if regulations are promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement ``of cultivated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> origin'' appears on their containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

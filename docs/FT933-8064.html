			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Pension fund manager reprimanded by Imro PYRFORD International, the pension fund manager for Courage, the brewer, has been fined Pounds 30,000 and reprimanded by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the pension fund management industry, it was disclosed yesterday. This follows an official complaint made to Imro in May last year by the TGWU general union over the operation of the Courage brewery employees' pension fund. The fund was forced to write off a Pounds 10m investment in Harlin Holdings  -later called International Brewing Holdings - which owns 38 per cent of Foster's Brewing Group, Courage's Australian owner since 1986. Imro found that Pyrford had committed eight breaches of rules. Two of the findings related to certain investments where the company had given the trustees of the pension fund 'no warning of the fact that it considered the investments to be not readily realisable and that it may not be possible to establish the current value of the investments'. It also found that the company, between May 1990 and March 1993, 'failed to establish and maintain adequate systems for the control of accounting records and for the conduct of permitted business'. It also pointed to omissions of details of management charges in statements to the trustees, and to lack of effective arrangements for ensuring compliance with the regulatory rules. Imro said it could not comment on its judgment. Mr Brian Revell, the union's national official for the food and drink industry, said: 'The Imro decision completely vindicates our complaint. This case shows clearly that workers' pensions are not safe when left totally in the employers' hands.' He went on: 'Employees' pension contributions are not some private investment fund for their bosses. 'The Courage case highlights the need for honest and open dealings with pension funds, which are no more or less than our members' deferred earnings.' Mr Revell said Courage had shown 'misplaced confidence in their fund managers' and this demonstrated 'the need for genuine and powerful worker participation through their unions in the control of pension funds'. Pyrford International was formed by the managers of Elders Investment Management in early 1991 in a buy-out from Foster's, then known as Elders IXL. When the TGWU lodged its complaint with Imro, Courage said that since the write-off in 1990-91 the trustees had decided to invest no further money in companies related to Courage and Foster's. Neither Pyrford nor Courage could be contacted for comment last night.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sears prepares Dollars 1bn offering SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and financial services group, intends to make a preferred stock offering of 25m depository shares, worth around Dollars 1bn. Mr Edward Liddy, Sears' chief financial officer, said the aim was to reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said each share would represent one-fourth of a share of mandatorily exchangeable shares, known as Percs. The announcement came as Sears reported improved results for the fourth quarter and the whole of 1991. In the quarter, net income rose to Dollars 523.1m, or Dollars 1.48 a share, against Dollars 378.8m, or Dollars 1.10, a year ago. Cost-cutting in the Merchandise Group helped boost fourth-quarter performance. The retail group posted income of Dollars 289.1m, against Dollars 95.6m in the year-ago period, which included a restructuring charge of Dollars 155.2m. Without the charge, fourth-quarter 1991 income rose 15 per cent. The profit was, however, squeezed from a small increase in retail revenues in the fourth quarter - Dollars 9.5bn compared with Dollars 9.44bn last year. 'It's too early to say Sears has turned a corner,' said analyst Mr Richard Nelson at Duff &amp; Phelps. 'We'd like to see sustainable sales growth.' Sears' overall net income for 1991 increased by 41.8 per cent to Dollars 1.28bn, or Dollars 3.71 a share, from Dollars 902.2m, or Dollars 2.63, in 1990. The 1991 results reflect a change in US accounting standards that will eliminate deferred tax charges taken by Sears in 1991. The charges totalled Dollars 185.5m for the first three quarters and were reduced by a credit of Dollars 35.5m. Prior to the accounting change, fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 552.6m, or Dollars 1.60 a share, and for the full year Dollars 1.14bn, or Dollars 3.32. Allstate Insurance income increased to Dollars 722.5m, compared with Dollars 551.8m from continuing operations in 1990 before a one-time tax benefit. Sears was also buoyed by a good year at its securities trading and credit card group, Dean Witter, which reported income of Dollars 344.6m, up from Dollars 232.9m in 1990. Even the real estate division, Coldwell Banker, managed a significant improvement in income, which rose to Dollars 60.6m from Dollars 25.5m in 1990.</p>

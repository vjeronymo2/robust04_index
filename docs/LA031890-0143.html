			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DID WOMEN REALLY WIN COURT RULING?  </P> <P> You condemn Johnson Controls Inc. for allowing only non-sterile women to work  in certain areas. You cry, "How dare they deny women high-paying jobs?"  </P> <P> I am sure that their executives and lawyers are all smiling and patting  themselves on the back for being so astute as to create a situation wherein  they were taken to court and lost, but actually came out a winner.  </P> <P> They won! They set a precedent! They can never be involved in a  multimillion-dollar lawsuit by a woman who bears a child with problems.  </P> <P> There are celebrations going on the boardrooms all across the country. How many  other companies are now free from that type of worry? How many women will be  victims of the take-the-job, take-your-chances court decision?  </P> <P> We all know a good company lawyer can create a reasonable-doubt situation and  get a favorable decision even where some abuse of the law is shown.  </P> <P> Did Queen E. Foster really do women a favor?  </P> <P> Think about it.  </P> <P> KENNETH A. GRIMES  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

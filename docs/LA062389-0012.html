			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHRIS JAMES;  </P> <P> BASEBALL DRIVES NEWEST PADRE 'UP THE WALL'  </P> <P> No need to look any further than Chris James' locker to understand the  personality type of the Padres' latest acquisition.  </P> <P> On the top shelf sits a large plastic bottle of antacid tablets. One hundred  and fifty, when full. These days, those bottles do not last so long.  </P> <P> "Nerves," James said, breaking into an easy smile that suggested quite an  opposite temperament.  </P> <P> But such touches of light humor only mask what distinguishes James on the  field. As those who have followed his career readily volunteer: When it comes  to his baseball personality, James is Type A Plus.  </P> <P> Intense, driven, motivated and self-critical, James has pushed himself at each  step. It is little wonder that at 26, he has had a stomach ulcer for six years.  </P> <P> That is why the antacid tablets are never far out of reach.  </P> <P> "Baseball gave it to me," James said. "This game will drive you up the wall."  </P> <P> At times, his intensity has been his downfall. At times, it has been his source  of strength. And in times like these, it has been both.  </P> <P> If, in the grand design of the world, there is a time for each of us to be  tested, James has found his moment. He only wishes he knew when it would end.  </P> <P> From friends to family to baseball, the past month has confronted James with  one crisis after another.  </P> <P> Fans are likely aware only of the bone bruise on his right leg. It has kept him  out of the lineup for the past seven games and could force him to miss a  weekend series with San Francisco that starts tonight.  </P> <P> His odyssey began when Mike Schmidt, his Philadelphia teammate, friend and  mentor, suddenly retired on May 29. A teary-eyed James quickly was annointed to  replace Schmidt at third base. The beginning of a new era, Schmidt told him.  </P> <P> Four days later, the era ended just as abruptly. James was traded to the Padres  for John Kruk and Randy Ready. The trade was announced by the Padres in  Cincinnati while the Phillies were playing an extra-inning game against  Montreal.  </P> <P> James' wife, Natilee, learned of the trade while watching the game on  television in a stadium lounge. That was at about the time her husband  completed his last Philadelphia at-bat to a chorus of boos.  </P> <P> When James was told of the trade, and after it had sunk in that he was leaving  the only organization he had played for, he cried again.  </P> <P> "Having Schmidt retire was like losing part of his family," said Bill Dancy,  his manager for his last three years in the Phillies' minor league system. "And  then to be traded was a blow. Chris is a hard-nosed kid, but he is sentimental,  too."  </P> <P> James reported to the Padres the next afternoon in Cincinnati mired in the  worst slump of his career. He had gone hitless in his previous 31 at-bats. He  would go another seven at-bats before a single in Houston June 5 would break  the streak and start a five-for-nine run.  </P> <P> But whatever temporary boost that might have provided quickly evaporated when  James learned that his father had been hospitalized after collapsing at the  family home in Alto, Tex. He was diagnosed as having a blood clot in his  kidney.  </P> <P> When the Padres played in Houston early this month, James spent much of his  time off driving the 140 miles between Alto and Houston. When the Padres left  Houston for a weekend series in San Francisco, James' father remained in the  hospital.  </P> <P> By the time the Padres left San Francisco three losses later, James was falling  back into his slump. He was started on his way to a zero-for-14 streak. And he  was starting in left field -- his third position in a week with the Padres --  having also played right field and third base.  </P> <P> Then came the latest blow.  </P> <P> Chasing a foul ball down the left-field line in the second inning against  Cincinnati last Wednesday, James slid into the stands and hit his right leg  against a metal support. He left the game on a stretcher, his hands and arms  covering his face as he fought the pain.  </P> <P> James has not played since, and while he remains on the active roster, his  return date is uncertain. He is taking batting and infield practice, but his  leg remains sore and Manager Jack McKeon said James will play this weekend only  if necessary.  </P> <P> The only piece of good news for James has been the improved health of his  father, who was released from the hospital Monday.  </P> <P> When James does return, he will face the difficult task of simultaneously  coming in cold and breaking out of a slump. Before the injury, he had only one  hit in his previous 17 at-bats and had a six-for-64 streak dating back to May  23.  </P> <P> This from a .263 hitter who had totaled 36 home runs and 120 RBIs in his  previous two seasons. This year, James is batting .203 with two home runs and  25 RBIs.  </P> <P> The most puzzling aspect of the current slump to James is that it has followed  the best start of his career. He was hitting .356 entering the last week of  April.  </P> <P> "My first 100 at-bats, you couldn't get me out," James said. "I look at those  games now, and I realize I was confident. I wasn't thinking about anything but  the baseball. I could have walked to the plate blindfolded, stood in there and  'Boom.' But we went down to Houston, and I hit the ball hard all over the place  and didn't get hits. I let it affect me for some time. I started trying too  hard to get hits. Then I went into a complete free fall, and I haven't come out  of it yet."  </P> <P> The Padres had been trying to land James since the end of last season. But  McKeon said the Phillies were not interested in trading him until recently.  Their thinking changed after their slow start and the realization that James  might find the job of replacing Schmidt more than he was ready to handle.  </P> <P> Schmidt's departure affected James deeply. Despite the 13-year difference in  their ages, the two had become friends, almost a big-brother relationship.  Teammates even went to calling them Wally and the Beav.  </P> <P> The friendship with another successful professional athlete was similar to what  James enjoyed growing up with his older brother, Craig, a running back with New  England Patriots.  </P> <P> James said the friendship with Schmidt began in spring training four years ago,  when James was still in the minor leagues.  </P> <P> "He told me he was going to give me little pointers every day that would make  me a better ballplayer," James said. "He and I just got along very well. We  worked a lot on hitting. We knew I wanted to make myself a better baseball  player. He just took me under his wing."  </P> <P> Because of their friendship, James said Schmidt confided in him two weeks  before the announcement that he was going to retire. James said he tried to  convince Schmidt to delay the decision for several weeks, but that Schmidt was  adamant. Even knowing the decision in advance, James could not hide his  emotions. Seeing Schmidt break down and sob brought him to tears. James makes  no apologies for failing to hide his emotion.  </P> <P> "We had a very special emotional attachment to each other," James said. "It was  an emotional period in my life."  </P> <P> Almost four weeks later, James said he still cannot bring himself to watch the  complete tape his wife made of Schmidt's televised announcement, especially the  part when Schmidt breaks down in tears at the end.  </P> <P> "I fast-forwarded through all of that," James said. "I didn't want to see  that."  </P> <P> But his emotional reaction to his friend's retirement helped precipitate the  trade.  </P> <P> "He was very, very close to Mike Schmidt, and we figured that might be a  detriment to someone trying to take over for him," Philadelphia General Manager  Lee Thomas said. "Chris is somewhat nervous and that bothered him. We figured  it might better for a new guy to take over the position."  </P> <P> The Padres, too, figured the change of scenery could serve James well. Getting  away from the aggressive Philadelphia fans, the pressure of replacing Schmidt  and the losing atmosphere around a struggling team might help James snap out of  his slump.  </P> <P> McKeon said he hoped James would bring some power to a lineup that needs some  punch to complement Jack Clark. The Padres still talk about a home run James  hit off Eric Nolte in 1987 that landed in the upper deck of San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium. It was the last upper-deck homer there and made James one of  only six players -- Dick Allen, Dave Kingman, Kevin McReynolds, Ivan Murrell  and Nate Colbert are the others -- to accomplish the feat in 21 seasons.  </P> <P> "I don't consider myself a home-run hitter, but I think I can hit 15 to 25 a  year," James said. "What I feel I can do is drive in runs. That is what I want  to do."  </P> <P> The results, however, have not been instantaneous, but then James has had much  on his mind. Adding to the difficulty of transition is that James found himself  joining the Padres at the start of their worst extended trip since 1980. James  went from a team that had lost 10 games in a row to one that was on its way to  losing nine of 10. But James can see a difference in the teams.  </P> <P> "This team knows it can win," James said. "No one is pushing the panic button.  In Philadelphia, the problem was we dug such a deep hole we tended to think the  season was over. We were already down, we were already out. But these guys know  in their hearts they can still win this thing."  </P> <P> James just wants to do his part, but his hitting troubles have continued with  his new club. He is batting .182 for the Padres with six RBIs.  </P> <P> "I've been worrying about too many things," James said. "I've been trying to  get that perfect mechanical swing every time, but you can't do that. All you  can do is get in the box and let the bat go."  </P> <P> Trying too hard, instead of relaxing, is a common problem for James. He has  always been one of those players who thinks a lot about his performance, maybe  too much, according to some who have managed him.  </P> <P> Sometimes James gets so down on himself he needs a big boost to get him set  straight.  </P> <P> "The best thing you can do with Chris is to keep throwing positive thoughts at  him," said Dancy, who now manages the Phillies' Triple-A team in  Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pa. "He needs that reinforcement."  </P> <P> Roly DeArmas, his manager his first two seasons in the Philadelphia minor  league system, remembers James coming to him early in his first season at  Class-A Spartanburg, S.C., distressed over his slow start.  </P> <P> "He told me, 'Maybe I've reached my peak. Maybe this is it,' " DeArmas  recalled.  </P> <P> James was hitting under .200 at the time. The year before, in his first season  with the Phillies after signing a free-agent contract, James hit .317, led the  rookie Northwest League with 19 doubles, had 12 home runs and drove in 50 runs  for DeArmas at Bend, Ore.  </P> <P> The story seems laughable now. But at the time, it was not.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe Chris was serious, but I realize he probably was," said  DeArmas, who now manages the Phillies' rookie team in Martinsville, Va. "Chris  is a gamer. He will give you all he has. But he is the kind of player who can  get down on himself real easily. You always need to give him that pat on the  back to get him going."  </P> <P> McKeon said he recognized that early with James. But he figures that can be  overcome. He has tried to work James in easily.  </P> <P> Although he envisions James as the Padres' third baseman of the future, McKeon  has played him mainly in the outfield, allowing Luis Salazar and Tim Flannery  (before he was placed on the disabled list last week) to handle third.  </P> <P> "I know they want someone to play third base in the future," James said. "But  with Luis doing such a good job there, they can't pull a guy off of third base  who is playing as well as he is."  </P> <P> McKeon also was experimenting with batting James leadoff, a spot he handled for  the Phillies on occasion. Hitting there might encourage him to be more  selective and take away some of the pressure that has led to the slump.  </P> <P> James said all he needs to do is relax and let the ups and downs wash over him.  </P> <P> "What I have to do is learn to accept the bad streaks and not let it affect me  like this one has," James said. "When I do that, I know I will be a much better  player. I hurt myself when I get down on myself and try to change everything.  </P> <P> "If I just stay within myself, I will be fine. If I get my 500 at-bats a  season, I know I will put some good numbers on the board."  </P></p>

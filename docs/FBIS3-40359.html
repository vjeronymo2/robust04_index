A savings in  time (one hour to do a job that used to take 25 hours), a  25-percent reduction in cost, and quality close to that of the  finished product.    The superplastic forming of titanium sheets is well known,  especially in the fields of aeronautics, aerospace, and  armament. Now the same technology is being applied to the  production of pipes in complex conical shapes with chimneys and  connectors. And all in one operation! Prodem (turnover of 20  million francs, 50 employees), a subsidiary of Bonnans, Inc., is  the company rushing into the breach opened by Aerospatiale and  press manufacturer ABC. The young Toulouse firm has just filled  the slot and is marketing titanium hot-air pipework for the  Airbus A330 and A340. A result of research conducted by  Aerospatiale, pipe forming consists of "inflating" an airtight  titanium pipe. One end of the pipe is blocked shut, after which  a nozzle is attached to the other end to inject argon with a  pressure of about 10 bars. Upon being heated to a temperature of  900 degrees C., the alloy of superplastic titanium (enriched  with six percent aluminum and four percent vanadium) expands as  much as 600 percent in the press, hence its name "superplastic."  The pipe expands to fit the mold in which it has been placed.  The resulting surface smoothness and quality are close to that  of the finished product. So much so that the forming process  eliminates the traditional machining and welding operations--as  well as the string of inspections accompanying them. As a  result, the metallic structure of the titanium does not undergo  change.    Another advantage is that "a piece can be completed in less  than an hour. Compared to traditional boilerwork, which would  require 25 hours," explains Yves Marcel, a development engineer  at Prodem. The result in the case of short runs is to make the  cost of a piece 25 percent less than it would be in traditional  boilermaking. Despite that, the "entry ticket" remains high:  about 150,000 francs for a mold of refractory steel. In  addition, the price of titanium--over 300 francs per  kilogram--does not make the development of applications easy. As  regards the Prodem shop's production capacity, it is limited,  the reason being that "one must allow from 10 to 12 hours for  heating the press to 900 degrees C. And during the rest of the  day, one can form about 10 pieces," says Marcel. That rules out  any mass production. The consequence is that unlike superplastic  aluminum, forming titanium pipe remains limited to the aerospace  industry. Despite everything, Prodem is confident that Russian  titanium will soon arrive on the market. Since the Russian  product costs 30 percent less than titanium from the United  States, which currently has a monopoly, it may be that the  process will spread to other industrial sectors.</p>

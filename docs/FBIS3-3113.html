They were sold for 2.55 million U.S. dollars.    The airliners have flown more than 25,000 hours on average  and were taken out of service in August 1993.    The planes will be overhauled by China Southwest Airlines  and  be sent to the location appointed by the U.S. company before  June 20 this year.    One of them will be dismantled for spare parts and the  others  will be converted for other uses after being repaired in Britain.</p>

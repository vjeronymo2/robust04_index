			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland: "The </F> Security Picture"]    [Text] New generations of Norwegians are growing up to a  more unclear security picture than that of their parents'  generation who had their worldview shaped by the Cold War.  Today it is fortunately not the case that Norway is facing an  obvious threat to its security. At the same time Norwegians are  for the first time taking part in UN operations for peace in  Europe. A few hours' travel from Norway a brutal war is raging  in a country which has been close to the hearts of Norwegians  and which is now being torn to pieces by antagonisms and  violence. The Yugoslavia crisis is a reminder that peace cannot  be taken for granted. And while Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs  approach the festival of Christmas under a tragic sky,  developments in Europe lead one's thoughts in the direction of  past times' harrowing events on our continent. The map of Europe  has changed in the course of just a few years. New states of  which we had scarcely been aware are now striving to take root  in the security policy landscape. For four decades we knew what  we were organized against by virtue of our membership of NATO.  Today the threats have no clear face or thrust.    The elections to the new national assembly in Russia were a  reminder of the difficulties involved in transforming a  totalitarian superpower into a democracy based on sharing and  devolving power, both political and economic. Since the breakup  of the Soviet Union there has been broad agreement in the West  that the danger of an armed Russian attack on West European  territory is now extremely small. The West has no clear  opponent. The threats which terrorized Europe during Berlin  crises, the invasion of Hungary, and the Czechoslovakia crisis  in 1968 are gone. What we are now facing are less defined  dangers and uncertainties. The rise of nationalist movements in  the former Soviet Union has been mentioned most often as a  source of uncertainty which could have repercussions for  security policy.    The sensational election result for the nationalist forces  in  Russia has sent shock waves through the West. Parallels have  been drawn with the Nazis' successes in Germany in the thirties.  There is every indication that the Russian voters were  attracted by a mood and by promises of simple solutions, of a  rapid improvement in their difficult material circumstances.  The nationalists' vociferous foreign policy line has probably  not been of decisive importance for the election result. But  there is a danger that the recreation of Soviet power could be a  political plus and be used as a symbol of a different and  prouder future than that which characterizes everyday life in  Russia today.    The election shows that it is too simple to view  developments  in Russia as a smooth process characterized by progress toward a  society more like our own. We were prepared for the possibility  that there might be setbacks. But in the total picture we must  not overlook the fact that the election itself was carried  through in a way of which Russia can be proud. A new  constitution was adopted which clarifies the power relationships  between the national assembly, the government, and the  president, and from January the president will have to deal with  a national assembly with democratic legitimacy. It will now be  possible to replace the battle we saw between Yeltsin and the  former Supreme Soviet with normal everyday politics in russia.    At the same time as the new Russian State Duma meets for the  first time in January, NATO's heads of state and government will  meet for a summit in Brussels. This will be President Clinton's  first meeting with NATO's heads of state and government and many  people are looking forward to hearing his view of transatlantic  ties and NATO's future mission.    There is every reason to expect that the President will  confirm that the United States will have a military presence in  Europe in the future too, although with a smaller number of  troops than during the Cold War. NATO's contingency planning is  also being reshaped. Whereas in the past NATO was directed  toward preventing a large-scale attack, planning is nowadays  directed more toward crisis and conflict management on a smaller  scale.    There is much interest in how NATO will approach the former  members of the Warsaw Pact and the new states in the former  Soviet Union. Full NATO membership is a desire that several  countries have expressed. As well as representing a security  guarantee, NATO membership would make an important contribution  to the strengthening of the national identity of many countries.  So far the West has been unwilling to rule out NATO membership  for these countries, but there are conflicting views on how  rapidly such membership should come about.    NATO membership has been seen as the end of a process rather  than as a beginning. To underline that the cooperation in the  NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], in which former  dictatorships are now members alongside the NATO nations, ought  now to be able to develop into even closer cooperation, an offer  to these countries of "Partnership for Peace" agreements is  being worked on. Here countries which so wish will be given an  invitation to enter into significant security agreements with  NATO.    In recent years in Europe the EC and the Western European  Union have become increasingly important in the security  context. For 30 years the United States has been arguing that  Europe must shoulder a larger part of the responsibility for its  own security. On the European side this determination is now  being expressed more strongly than previously. While the United  Sates can be counted on as a guarantor against Soviet attack,  the Yugoslavia crisis and the new dangers in other countries are  now showing that NATO's security guarantees are not enough.  When NATO was formed, no one paid any attention at all to the  thought that inside the Soviet-dominated bloc civil wars or  unrest could arise with the concomitant danger that they could  spread to the countries of the West. Developments show that  military cooperation alone -- as in the NATO alliance -- is not  able to predict and prevent the growth of unrest and  hostilities. As a result the nonmilitary sides of security  policy have become more important. In particular, the EC's  economic and political role is constantly growing in security  policy importance.    The year we are leaving behind us shows that we are living  in  a period of transition in which institutions which were created  for a different age must form part of the response to challenges  of the new age. Since Germany and France came together after  the war, the EC has had an effect in the field of security  policy for 35 years without any great fuss being made. In the  years to come, we will see greater demands being made on EC  cooperation from the security policy angle. The new NATO will  always be the guarantee that we will have a defense against  attack. But it will become increasingly clear that NATO cannot  contribute that type of economic cooperation which will make  crises, revolts, and wars things of the past.</p>

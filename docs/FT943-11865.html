			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Milk Marque to levy price rise Milk Marque, the successor to the Milk Marketing Board, is proposing a 5 per cent increase in the price charged to dairy companies after they made bids for nearly 30 per cent more milk than it has to offer. Mr Andrew Dare, Milk Marque chief executive, speaking yesterday at the last annual meeting of the Milk Marketing Board before its demise on October 31, said the initial round of Milk Marque's new selling system had brought bids from dairy customers for 9bn litres. Milk Marque, a voluntary producers' co-operative, has so far signed up dairy farmers representing 7bn litres, or 65 per cent of the milk output in England and Wales. Mr Dare said the co-operative would raise its average price to dairy companies to 25.25p a litre from 24p in an attempt to reduce demand. This is good news for its farmer members, who would see their prices rise from 22.5p now to 24p if demand balances supply. Dairy companies are unlikely to appreciate the price rise, having already expressed concern about a smaller increase in the first round of the selling process a month ago. Mr Bob Steven, chairman of the Milk Marketing Board, acknowledged these concerns. 'It would be madness for Milk Marque to try to push prices to levels that would put its customers out of business,' he said yesterday. At the same time, he said, Milk Marque's purpose was to give dairy farmers - whom he described as 'minnows' compared with the dairy groups - an opportunity to negotiate on equal terms with their customers.</p>

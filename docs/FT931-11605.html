			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): BBC's capital venture These are venturesome times. Prime Minister John Major returns from India and makes a plea for industrialists to become 'merchant venturers' while BBC 2 launches a prime-time series on venture capital entitled The Adventurers. The six-part TV series follows a year in the life of Grosvenor Venture Managers, a medium-sized company which will back most deals apart from start-ups. The series provides an intriguing picture of a little-understood financial sector. A problem is that while the fly-on-the wall technique is good at conveying impressions it falls down on explanations. Why should the BBC be devoting six Sunday evenings to venture capitalists? What is their contribution to the economy and how are they different from bankers - apart from driving smarter cars? This last question is crucial to the debate going on within pensions funds, banks and the venture firms themselves on whether venture capitalists earn their keep. What is the viewer to make of venture capitalists from the first two episodes? They do not appear to lead lives which are obviously more exciting than those of many other City professionals though episode two conveyed the brinkmanship involved in some of their deals. Despite the liberal use of Grand Prix scenes, episode two could only confirm the essentially humdrum nature of the game. The buzz provided by the Troubleshooter series is lacking, presumably because investing money is less visual than making sports cars or brewing beer. The Adventurers was conceived at a time when venture capital still retained something of its buccaneering image for backing start-up, high-technology businesses. It has reached the screen at a time when a growing number of those involved are only too happy to drop the venture tag and settle for the more prosaic title of provider of private equity.</p>

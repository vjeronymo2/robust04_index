			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Italy's growth exceeds forecasts The Italian economy grew at 2.3 per cent during the second quarter, confirming the strength of its broad-based recovery. The figures, published yesterday by Istat, the official statistics institute, compare with a first quarter GDP growth of only 1.5 per cent. The change of pace between the two quarters is the fastest in the EU, and suggests the macroeconomic projections in the document accompanying the 1995 budget are understated. The document forecasts growth will reach 2.7 per cent next year and 2.8 per cent in 1997. It is also counting on 3.5 per cent inflation this year and 2.5 per cent next year, but the trend of August and September prices makes this look unrealistic. The accelerated growth is attributed to the return of domestic demand. Since late last year the recovery has been exclusively export driven. The continued weakness of French inflationary pressures was demonstrated yesterday by the announcement that the annualised rate of inflation in September slipped to 1.6 per cent, compared with 1.7 per cent in August. The figures were based on a 0.3 per cent increase in consumer prices in September, compared with a 0.4 per cent increase in the same month last year. The French government is forecasting an inflation rate of about 1.8 per cent by the end of this year and a rate of 1.9 per cent in 1995.</p>

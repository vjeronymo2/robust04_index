			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (3): Exports prove resilient - Nicholas Denton reviews the economic outlook VIENNA'S economic policymakers, like the well-ordered and bourgeois city they live in, attract one description above all others: smug. Fluent and confident when reciting Austria's catalogue of economic achievement, they have to stop and think hard to come up with any flaws. There is good cause, however, to be satisfied. Austria has remained a charmed island of prosperity and stability. At no time was that clearer than when the European exchange-rate mechanism splintered - and the Austrian schilling actually rose against the German D-mark to which it has been tied for 20 years. The confidence of the foreign exchanges is firmly grounded in economic fundamentals. Austria's combination of economic indicators is arguably the most favourable in the developed world, winning much praise from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in its latest annual report on the Austrian economy. After growth which, over the last three years, has outstripped that of every other OECD member, the economy looks likely to dodge recession altogether. The Austrian Institute of Economic Research (Wifo) has predicted that gross domestic product (GDP) will expand by 2.2 per cent this year and 3.0 per cent in 1993. An expected downward revision in this forecast will still see growth most west European countries would envy. Growth seems well clear of constraints. Although consumer price inflation has risen one percentage point to the 4 per cent level since the end of last year, the rate appears to have peaked. And, despite the fact that Austria is growing faster than its trading partners, the current account remains in rough balance. The budget balance remains under control too, steadied by unexpectedly robust tax revenues. The government forecasts a deficit of 3.0 per cent of GDP this year, falling gradually to 2.5 per cent in 1994. That represents a slippage on earlier plans, earning some rare criticism from the OECD. But the Austrian National Bank stresses that Austria is meeting the European convergence criteria - there are few countries which can boast that. However, it has to be said that there is increasing support for the view that Austria's economic existence cannot remain charmed forever. 'For the first time my feeling is that it cannot go on,' says Mr Johann Fernleiter, deputy secretary general of the Federal Economic Chamber, the employers' organisation which is calling for a zero pay round this year. But the mood remains sanguine. 'If there is a soft landing it will be very soft,' says Mrs Maria Schaumayer, the president of the Austrian National Bank. Even that judgement might be on the pessimistic side. Austria's chief central banker goes on to assert that the economy will altogether avoid collision with the ground. So what gives Austria's economy its buoyancy? On the side of domestic demand, consumer spending and construction investment have given lift. Retail trade, held up by gently rising real incomes and a fall in the household savings rate, grew 3.25 per cent in the first half. Meanwhile the building industry, enjoying a record boom and still working on a backlog of orders, is set to grow by 5.5 per cent this year. But the key to sustained growth has been the resilience of Austria's export growth, albeit at a reduced rate, in the face of global slowdown. First came expansion and infrastructure spending after reunification in Germany, Austria's largest trading partner. Austria rode Germany piggy-back, increasing exports without having to fund reconstruction of the east. Now, as Germany fades, succour is coming from an unexpected source - eastern Europe. Deliveries to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland exploded to 24 per cent in the year to the first half, helping total exports to grow 5 per cent. With an economic formula as winning as Austria's, it is a wonder that anyone should want to tinker. Indeed, Austrian policymakers are very cautious about structural change. But the outside world is forcing a faster pace. Austria's desire to join the European Community dictates that the government removes much of the protection behind which many industries have sheltered. Above all, Austria's system of agricultural subsidies - so overblown that it attracted a special, critical mention in the OECD report - must be reworked. 'Convergence gives us a push to liberalise - and do it more rapidly,' says Mr Peter Henseler of the finance ministry's European integration department. 'It is like a fresh wind which blows into old rooms.' Another impetus for reform is coming from the encroaching globalisation of capital markets. Domestic investors are diversifying into foreign currency holdings but at the same time foreign investors have lost interest in Austrian sluggish markets. The resultant outflow of long-term capital is unbalancing the market and putting upward pressure on interest rates, according to Mr Johann Maurer, economic analyst at Creditanstalt Bankverein. That leads a growing number of policymakers and observers to argue for reform to increase the supply of stocks and attract foreign investors back to the market. One change which is being actively considered is to change wealth taxation so that it does not penalise the owners of private companies when they go public. Looking further ahead, it is perhaps the opening up of eastern Europe which will have the most violent impact on the economy. To date Austria has clearly benefited from growing trade with its eastern neighbours. Exports have risen faster than imports; and estimates of the number of jobs which will be lost in the foreseeable future as a result of eastern competition range from a negligible 20,000 to a manageable 100,000. But already the food, cement, agricultural machinery, textiles and leather industries are suffering from cheap eastern imports. And the challenge is just beginning.</p>

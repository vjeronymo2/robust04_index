			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 May (NA) -- Union sources have  reported that the CGT [General Confederation of Labor] has  decided to criticize, before the International Labor  Organization (ILO), adjustment policies that cause a "strong  deterioration in the living condition of workers," but without  making specific reference to the situation in Argentina.    The decision was made today, during a meeting at which the  CGT analyzed the strategy the labor central will adopt at the  ILO annual assembly, due to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, in  June.    Analysis of the matter will continue tomorrow at 1000 during  a meeting of the CGT national secretariat at the labor central's  headquarters. The agenda will also include a review of the  latest contacts with entrepreneurs and legislators in search for  a consensus on labor laws, in-service accidents, and migration  of foreign workers.    It was leaked that CGT Secretary General Antonio Cascia's  speech to the ILO Assembly will seek to strengthen ILO policy,  and will reiterate the objections the bloc of Latin American  countries has raised before ILO authorities.    Cascia's speech, which has not yet been written, will focus  on objections to neoliberal adjustment policies and their  negative consequences for workers. In this regard, the sources  said Cascia's speech "will maintain a low profile" in dealing  with the Argentine workers' situation.    Latin American countries recently held a seminar in Buenos  Aires on the "role of workers within the ILO," during which the  international organization was asked to promote "the  strengthening of workers' rights and the improvement of their  working conditions."    The CGT will also demand the promotion of tripartite  negotiations "to promote fair, equitable development," in line  with the conclusions of the seminar, which Cascia will reiterate  in his speech to the ILO Assembly.    Cascia will ask the ILO to begin an international campaign  to  approve a World Charter of Workers' Rights, including the rules  referring to human rights." [no opening quotation marks as  received]    The CGT meeting today was also attended by leader Alfredo  Atanasof (municipal workers), Juan Jose Zanola (bank workers),  Ramon Valle (insurance workers), Ramon Baldassini (FOECYT)  [Federation of Postal and Telecommunication Workers], and Carlos  Gdansky (UOM) [Metalworkers Union].</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / BR acts to allay fears over its Eurostar trains British Rail moved swiftly yesterday to counter fears of further delays to its high-profile Eurostar services through the Channel tunnel after disclosing an embarrassing technical problem on the British end of the route. The Eurostar prototype, which is being tested on the 70-mile stretch between London and Folkestone, has been unable to cope with occasional gaps in the third rail, from which trains on Network SouthEast pick up their power. The onboard computer switches off the engine and turns signals to red when it passes over gaps in the third rail at level crossings or points. In a short statement yesterday European Passenger Services, the BR subsidiary that will run services through the tunnel, said: 'The test programme of the Eurostar prototype has revealed an interference phenomenon involving track circuits on parts of the route to the Channel tunnel. 'A programme of modification to the affected track circuit equipment has been developed and the implementation timetable allows completion of the work in time for Eurostar services to start next summer.' Freight services through the Channel tunnel start in March, with 'Le Shuttle' tourist services expected to start two months later, about the time of the official inauguration on May 6. Eurostar services from London to Paris and Brussels had already been delayed to late summer because of delivery delays and previous technical problems with the trains' onboard computer. No date has yet been fixed for services to start, and introduction of Eurostar trains will depend on the results of further testing. Although the latest problem is not expected to cause more delays, it is bound to prompt further criticism of the government for blocking construction of a dedicated high-speed link for Channel tunnel trains in time for the tunnel opening. The controversial link through Kent and east London is due to open in 2001. A consortium led by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, is building 38 Eurostar trains costing Pounds 24m each - 31 for the routes from London and seven for services from Manchester and Edinburgh.</p>

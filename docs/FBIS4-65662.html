			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "Air Force Prepared To Engage F-16's </F> in Operations Abroad"]    [Text] Brussels, 17 May (BELGA) -- The Air Force is  prepared to play a larger part, primarily by deploying its F-16  fighter planes, in Belgian Army missions in Africa or in Bosnia,  said Lieutenant General Guido Vanhecke, Air Force chief of staff.    "For a long time we have been emphasizing combined  operations. Or, more advanced cooperation between the various  services could be envisaged," the general said during a meeting  with journalists from the Aviation Press Club in Brussels.    The Air Force "boss" cited the example of operation "Silver  Back" organized in Rwanda to evacuate foreign nationals after  the resumption of the civil war there. During such  interventions, fighter planes could, according to him, "play an  effective role in deterrence, support, fire support, or the  protection of ground units."    Reiterating that French Jaguar fighter-bombers based in  Bangui (central Africa) carried out flights of "intimidation"  over Rwanda during the evacuation of foreigners, General  Vanhecke wondered about the possibility of deploying units of  Belgian F-16's in such cases. The F-16 has a range of up to  3,500 km, even without in-flight refueling, a technique for  which all pilots are qualified.    The general emphasized that the Air Force has always been in  a position to deploy a complete squadron at a maximum notice of  72 hours within the context of the Allied Mobile Force, as was  the case when 18 Mirage's were rushed to southeastern Turkey, in  early 1991, just before the outbreak of the Gulf War.    "This time period could be reduced for a group of six  airplanes," he added, noting that the decision to engage combat  aircraft had to be made at the "political level," primarily  because of the need to negotiate fly-over rights or parking  rights in the case of armed humanitarian operations.    The defense minister is convinced that these should be joint  operations, the chief of staff added, referring to a recent  meeting with Mr. Leo Delcroix.    Mentioning the possible participation of the Air Force in  NATO's "Deny Flight" operation, which enforces the ban on flight  through Bosnian airspace and provides air support to the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] Blue Helmets, the chief of staff  said "certain allied countries would probably be pleased to be  able to share the burden of this mission with others."    He also acknowledged that the Belgian F-16's were currently  "handicapped" by the lack of certain equipment, such as  electronic countermeasures. However, the French system  "Carapace", which is passive in so far as it only detects the  radar used in antiaircraft defense systems, is scheduled to  arrive in the Belgian Air Force squadrons in early 1995.    "If Belgium were called on to participate in operation `Deny  Flight,' the Air Force would have to decide whether an active  system was essential," the general continued, saying that these  pod-mounted systems could be obtained on loan from allies which  have them, as could certain precision, laser-guided munitions.    According to the chief of staff, the F-16's are "excellent  aircraft," flown by pilots who have an "operational level  comparable" to that of the allied air forces present in the  skies over Bosnia.    "Our F-16's can be deployed for all NATO or UN missions for  which they are  or could be used," he concluded.</p>

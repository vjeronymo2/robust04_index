			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition behind rise to Pounds 1.1m at GBE Intl GBE International, the engineering equipment company formerly known as Downiebrae, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.08m for the half year to June 30, against Pounds 803,000. The results were the first since the acquisition of GBE in June and were prepared on a merger accounting basis. Turnover totalled Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 15m) with acquisitions putting in Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 14.2m). Earnings per share emerged at 1.37p (1.03p). Mr Gerald Edwards, chairman, said the outlook for the remainder of the year was encouraging and he expected further progress to be made. The results of the enlarged group are biased towards the second half. The process engineering companies, which were part of the acquisition, had a good first half and were well ahead of the previous year, the company said. However, the old Downiebrae divisions incurred losses. Mr Edwards said that an improvement in trading had recently been experienced. Operating profits of Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 990,000) were struck after losses from continuing activities of Pounds 93,000 (Pounds 42,000). Interest payable fell to Pounds 131,000 (Pounds 187,000).</p>

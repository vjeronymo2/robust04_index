			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Letter: Assessment of UK beer prices supported by the facts Sir, In response to Robin Simpson's criticism (Letters. May 19) of our report on the European brewing industry ('UK brewers top list for dear beer', April 5), let us point out a few facts. Productivity figures which feature in our report came from data published by Efta/Combined Statistics, a body that receives its information from brewing societies, including the UK Brewers Society. On price, we deliberately focused on list price to aid European comparisons. Is Robin Simpson suggesting the UK brewers give a larger discount to supermarkets than, say, German brewers give to German supermarkets? In summary, the UK Brewers Society seems to suggest that UK beer wholesale prices are not high. It would appear the UK government disagrees - thus, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's supply-of-beer order which resulted in extensive pub disposals by brewers. Foreign brewers disagree - none has made any move to acquire a UK brewer. UK customers disagree - the trade deficit in beer continues to worsen. Finally, the stock market appears to disagree, otherwise the share price of brewers would not be so low. John Wakely, Christopher Wickham, Lehman Brothers International, One Broadgate, London EC2</p>

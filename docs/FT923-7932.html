			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Northrop sees Dollars 152m third-quarter provision NORTHROP, the US defence contractor which is heavily dependent on the B-2 Stealth bomber programme, warned yesterday it expects to make a Dollars 152m provision related to its cruise missile programme in the third quarter. The company said the charge reflected the estimated financial impact of its proposal to extend the schedule to complete the flight test programme of the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile. The provision will cut third-quarter earnings by around Dollars 100m or Dollars 2.13 a share, and is being taken after discussion with the US Air Force this month. Northrop claims the provision should be sufficient to complete the development programme, but added the possibility of future provisions remained until the contract is finished. The missile programme was awarded before Northrop stopped accepting fixed-price development contracts in 1988.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> KIRK DOUGLAS: STILL HOT STUFF  </P> <P> Kirk Douglas was downplaying his movie hero image and talking about his new  book when a fire alarm created some live-action adventure.  </P> <P> Douglas was in the middle of a newspaper interview last week when an intercom  in his 16th-floor hotel suite came alive.  </P> <P> "Remain calm and stay where you are," came the repeated warning over the  intercom.  </P> <P> "Sure," Douglas told his interviewer from the Chicago Tribune. "Remain calm.  The ladders are outside the windows, don't look down."  </P> <P> It turned out to be a false alarm.  </P> <P> "I didn't plan this drama, you know," he said.  </P> <P> Douglas, 73, was in town to plug his first novel, "Dance With the Devil." The  actor's autobiography, "The Ragman's Son," was made into a movie, and Douglas  played himself.  </P></p>

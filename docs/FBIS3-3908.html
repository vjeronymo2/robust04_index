Tax evasion has become rampant in the country with more than  50 percent of all enterprises and individually-owned business  households found guilty of such practices. Some enterprises  were found to have evaded taxes of more than RMB 1 million.  Last year saw the industrial and commercial tax evasion being  put at RMB 6.18 billion, evasion of income tax RMB 1.85 billion  and evasion of payment for key items' construction as well as  for budgetary regulation RMB 1.187 billion, adding up to RMB  9.22 billion and constituting 63.4 percent of all illegal funds.    Another serious problem was the deduction of sums of state  revenue.    Rampant money-collecting by administrative departments and  institutions was also serious. According to experts, there was  an urgent need to establish a supervisory mechanism for handling  such illegal matters in the country.</p>

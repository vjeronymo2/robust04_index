			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: Gregynog comes to London THERE ARE books and then there are beautiful books which combine graceful typography, sumptuous illustration with superlative printing technique. Among the world's greatest publishers of limited edition, hand-crafted books was the Welsh-based Gregynog Press which flourished between 1922 and 1940, producing 42 books in that time. An exhibition currently showing in London offers a rare opportunity to view some of them, as well as those of its successor, Gwasg Gregynog (Gwasg is Welsh for press) established in the late 1970s and still in business. Gregynog, located in Newtown, Powys, was the inspiration of two sisters, Gwendoline and Margaret Davis, who purchased the hall, from which the press takes its name, and 750 acres of land just after the end of the First World War. The family wealth had been accumulated from the south Wales coalfields and the sisters, wishing to be philanthropic, decided to create an arts and crafts centre for Wales. The press was to be an integral part of this enterprise and in 1922 Robert Maynard was appointed the first controller, with Walter Bray as resident artist, who curiously enough knew nothing about wood engraving and had to learn the technique from Maynard. But it wasn't until the 1930s, with the appointment of Blair Hughes-Stanton as resident artist and William MacCance as controller, that Gregynog entered a phase establishing it as one of the finest private presses in the world. In the space of three years some magnificent books were printed, each edition numbering rarely more than a couple of hundred copies, many illustrated with wood engravings by Hughes-Stanton ('The Lamentations of Jeremiah', 'Erewhom' and 'The Revelations of St John the Divine', being among the best) and others by Agnes Miller Parker, MacCance's wife, and Gertrude Hermes, married to Hughes-Stanton. While the artistic quality during this period was superlative human relations were less than harmonious and both Hughes-Stanton and MacCance left the press in 1933. Seven years later Gregynog was wound up. The University of Wales re-opened the press in the late 1970s, reusing the same workshops and some of the original printing equipment, the first book to be published being R. S. Thomas's Laboratories of the Spirit. Since then other notable limited editions have been poems by Dylan Thomas, illustrated by John Piper, and the Mountains of Wales, designed by John Ryder. The early Gregynog Press books are now highly collectable and fetch many thousands of pounds at auction. Those printed by Gwasg Gregynog are more affordable (many of those currently in print can be purchased for under Pounds 100, some for much less) and undoubtedly will become prized by bibliophiles in the future. The exhibition of continues at the Lethaby Gallery, Central St Martins College of Art and Design, Southampton Row, London until May 16.</p>

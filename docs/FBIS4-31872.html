			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak President Michal Kovac by Pavol </F> Minarik; place and date not given: "Former Socialist Countries  Need Coalition Governments in the Transitional Period"]    [Text] [Minarik] The election campaign in Slovakia has  already begun, and you have warned against its confrontational  tone.    [Kovac] People will be able to make decisions much easier in  a quiet atmosphere than under the pressure of psychological  stress. In a calm atmosphere, not only will it be possible to  present programs but also the public will also have a chance to  ponder their content. However, if other elements enter the  preelection atmosphere, the people will logically miss the  essence of what individual parties are pushing for and the way  they want to implement things. Emotions and irrationality could  enter into the forefront when decisions are made. This is why we  need to exert maximum efforts to at least make the preelection  atmosphere as civilized as possible.    [Minarik] What are the chances, in your opinion, that the  coalition government of Prime Minister Moravcik will remain in  power after the elections?    [Kovac] I believe that not only Slovakia, but also other  former socialist countries need coalition governments in this  transitional period. In other words, they need to involve all  of the decisive political entities in the historical changes.  As early as last year, I called for, in no uncertain terms,  precisely this solution to the internal political crisis in  Slovakia. I suppose that, even after the parliamentary  elections in the fall, a situation will arise in the Slovak  Republic that will force the establishment of a coalition  government.    [Minarik] What place do you foresee for the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] after the elections? It follows from  the speeches of its chairman, former Prime Minister V. Meciar,  that he unequivocally assumes that he will return to power....    [Kovac] In my opinion, the HZDS will remain an important  political force even after the elections. I cannot estimate to  what extent he will be able to acquire partners for a possible  coalition government, but it seems at present that the HZDS is  not exerting any special efforts in that respect. Of course,  internal development continues within any party and any  movement, and the HZDS is no exception--the evolution and the  process of shaping continue. I really do not know and dare not  guess what shape it will assume for the election in the fall.    [Minarik] You participated in the celebration of the 50th  anniversary of the Allied forces' invasion in Normandy. Was it  only a commemorative act?    [Kovac] It was, above all, an occasion to commemorate the  Czechs' and Slovaks' active participation in this historical  battle, by which they helped defeat fascism. This also was an  occasion to make Slovakia more visible and not just in the eyes  of the European public. For me, it was a chance to meet  veterans from the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic who  fought for Normandy and thank them for the sacrifices they  endured. Finally, it also was an occasion to speak with supreme  representatives of some states.    [Minarik] What talks were involved?    [Kovac] With French Prime Minister E. Balladur, we spoke,  among other things, not only about certain circumstances  surrounding the CSFR's partition, but also about the Stability  Pact. With President F. Mitterrand, we discussed his planned  visit to Slovakia. He said that he realized that the democratic  forces in the Slovak Republic had to be supported. President  Clinton told me that he had noticed certain positive changes in  Slovakia's development. He spoke with affection and  appreciation about the current efforts. He expressed, as did  others, his hope that we would continue to strengthen our  political stability.    [Minarik] You met with President Havel for the third time in  a short period during the celebrations of the invasion of Allied  troops in Normandy.    [Kovac] I sincerely admit that we did not discuss politics.  We had a personal and friendly conversation. President Havel's  attention, and mine as well, was not concentrated on our mutual  relations.    [Minarik] The 50th anniversary of the Slovak National  Uprising is drawing near. Are you inspired by the meeting on the  French and British seashore?    [Kovac] I watched everything closely because I will be the  main host at our celebrations, and I want everything to turn out  well. Of course, it would be proper to use in our celebrations  part of what we saw in France and Britain. I realize that we  have a unique opportunity to present Slovakia in a favorable  light.</p>

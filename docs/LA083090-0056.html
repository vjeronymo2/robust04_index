			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL ADDS OPENING PRAYER TO AGENDA  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council, after briefly debating religion in government  and the separation of church and state, agreed to begin each council meeting  with a moment of prayer or reflection.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who expressed reservations about mixing government with  religion, asked her colleagues to forgo a roll-call vote because a negative  vote on the issue could expose a council member to criticism from the public.  </P> <P> The council acted late Tuesday night at the urging of Councilman Howard P.  (Buck) McKeon, who noted that many government bodies -- from Congress to state  legislatures -- open their proceedings with prayer.  </P> <P> In addressing McKeon, Heidt said, "I just don't want anybody to be judged if  they disagree with you," Heidt said.  </P> <P> But resident Skip Newhall said the council should not allow prayers in the  council chambers because it could suggest the city was endorsing some religions  over others. "Religion belongs in the churches," Newhall said. "That's why we  have them."  </P> <P> McKeon said a prayer or moment of reflection merely would acknowledge the  spiritual side of the community. "I have no ambition to bring religion in  government," he said.  </P> <P> In an unusual move, the council did not vote on McKeon's request but allowed  Mayor Jo Anne Darcy to declare that each meeting would begin with prayer,  inspirational remarks or a moment of silence. Each council member would take  turns inviting guest clergy or speakers to offer the prayer or remarks.  </P></p>

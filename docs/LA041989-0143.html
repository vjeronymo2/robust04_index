			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LUCILLE BALL ALERT, LOOKING WELL AFTER HEART SURGERY, HUSBAND SAYS  </P> <P> Lucille Ball's "Irish eyes are smiling," husband Gary Morton said after the  comedian awakened today at 9:45 a.m., about 14 hours after surgeons finished an  emergency heart operation. She was alert and looked well, he said.  </P> <P> Surgeons said they were optimistic that Ball will recover fully from surgery in  which her aorta and aortic valve were replaced with organ tissue donated from a  27-year-old man.  </P> <P> Ball, 77, who reigned for decades as Lucy, the zany, rubber-mouthed queen of  comedy, had her heart stopped for two hours during Tuesday's procedure at  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, which kept her in the operating room for about  seven hours.  </P></p>

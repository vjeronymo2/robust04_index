			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac by </F> correspondent Michal Tvarozek in Bratislava on 24 February --  recorded]    [Text] [Tvarozek] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, has the  foreign minister's resignation influenced the decision you are  making?    [Kovac] We discussed this matter with each other and reached  the same conclusion: that it was necessary to make it easier for  the president to make a decision about our dismissal from the  cabinet, because if we do not make it easier for him, the  confrontation between the castle and the cabinet might grow more  serious. We do not see any sense in this. Both of us entered  political life with the intention of seeking a consensus and a  certain moderate attitude. If we continue to insist on our  original stance, we think we would be betraying these principles.    [Tvarozek] Does this mean that you are also submitting your  resignation?    [Kovac] Yes, I am. I am going to see the president tomorrow  to submit my resignation.    [Tvarozek] A short while ago, you said--it was in this  room--  that it would mean that you had admitted your own mistakes if  you resigned.    [Kovac] I insist that I have not made any mistakes great  enough for me to leave the government because of them. This  means that I insist that I have performed my work according to  my abilities, and I am not convinced that I have performed  badly. Despite this, I think that this step is necessary in the  interests of calming down the situation in Slovakia. There is  no point in increasing tension.    [Tvarozek] Is this not, for example, caused by the situation  in the government being such that a new political entity--if we  may call it that--would obstruct the government line and the  program that the government has planned?    [Kovac] I am not altogether convinced that it is because of  this. I truly think that a government in which the prime  minister cannot cooperate with his deputy prime minister because  the former proposed that the latter resign--thereby, in effect,  demonstrating that he cannot cooperate--I would find it very  difficult to work in such a government if I stayed in my post.    If a political entity comes into being, it will be a  political entity that is based on the program principles that  were declared by the Movement [for a Democratic Slovakia], but  which could not be fulfilled.    [Tvarozek] Are your further ambitions of a political or a  professional nature?    [Kovac] It is very difficult to give up responsibility for  political development. I did not enter into top-level politics  but into trade union politics and then transferred to so-called  top-level politics. Because I entered political life, I had the  duty to represent the views of a certain group of people, the  people who elected me, the citizens who believed me. This was  expressed in very beautiful letters, for which I thank the  people who have morally supported me in this situation. I think  that it would be irresponsible toward them to leave the  political scene completely.    [Tvarozek] Let us decipher this: Do you plan to establish a  new political entity?    [Kovac] I am considering this possibility.</p>

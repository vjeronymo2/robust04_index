			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel V. Zhitnikov under rubric </F> "TEKHNIKA I VOORUZHENIYE Catalog": "Tunguska Gun-Missile Air  Defense System"]    [Text] The system is intended for air defense of motorized  rifle (tank) regiment subunits against strikes by tactical and  army aviation, fire support helicopters, cruise missiles and  remotely piloted vehicles, and also for engaging lightly armored  ground targets and personnel. The system is capable of engaging  targets at a range up to 8 km and at an altitude up to 3.5 km.  It includes a self-propelled antiaircraft mount,  loader/transporter, servicing and maintenance equipment, and an  automated monitoring and test station. The self-propelled  antiaircraft mount on a tracked chassis (MT-S) base is the  system's weapon platform. A hydromechanical transmission and  hydropneumatic suspension are used in the chassis construction  and provide high off-road capability, good maneuverability, and  smoothness of movement over rugged terrain, which permits firing  on the move.    Two 2A38M twin-barrel automatic antiaircraft guns covered by  an armored jacket are located on the sides of a turret with  360 traverse. Their principle of action is based on using  the energy of powder gases led off through a special opening of  the barrels into gas cylinders. A liquid evaporation system is  used to cool the barrels. The twin-barrel configuration of the  automatic gun permits an intensive rate of fire of up to 5,000  rounds per minute. The automatic guns have a belt feed. The  ammunition belt is filled with standardized 30-mm rounds with  the help of a ramming machine [nabivochnaya mashinka]. The  loader/transporter loads the unit of fire. Loading time for a  full unit of fire is 16 minutes.    Shipping-launching containers with missiles also are  situated  on the sides of the turret and protected by an armored  enclosure. They perform functions of sealed storage container  and launcher. The system's 9M311 guided missile is bicaliber and  two-stage. It has a separating solid-propellant booster motor  which gives the missile a speed of almost three times that of  sound. The launch weight is half that of single-stage missiles  with similar characteristics. The small-caliber propulsion stage  preserves high speed on the entire flight path. The missile  warhead is continuous-rod/fragmentation. It has impact and  proximity fuzes, which ensures destruction of a target both with  a direct hit as well as when flying by it at a distance of up to  5 meters.    The missile control system is semiautomatic, with a radio  command communications link. The light flux from a light source  installed on the missile hits the optical direction finder and  is converted into an electrical signal proportional to  deflection from line of sight. The signal goes to the central  computer system, which generates control commands. Then they are  transmitted in the form of coded pulses through the tracking  station to the missile, where the gear generates commands for  controlling the steering drive. The missile is moved onto the  line of sight and held there.    The radar system of the air defense system consists of  acquisition and tracking radars as well as a ground  interrogator. The acquisition radar has a high scan rate and  reliable means of suppressing a signal from local objects, which  permits discriminating low-flying targets at ranges up to 18 km  with high probability. The interrogator operates in two radio  wavebands and provides guaranteed target recognition. The  tracking radar accomplishes automatic lock-on and tracking of a  target at a range up to 16 km. Hydraulic drives support precise,  rapid training of weapons in a wide dynamic range when firing  from in place and in movement.    The system's high-speed central computer system was  developed  based on the series-produced Aron-15 computer. It monitors the  status of weapon systems, of the turret horizontal gunlaying  drive, and of the entire system by simulating an aircraft  overflight. It outputs data on target parameters and generates  data for firing missile-gun armament. The majority of operations  for controlling systems of the air defense system are the  responsibility of the computer and automatic equipment unit.  This permits a crew with average skills to perform combat work  successfully. A team consists of four persons: commander,  operator, gunner and driver. The Tunguska is outfitted with  special equipment for protecting the crew against weapons of  mass destruction and for creating normal conditions for its  functioning within the turret.

The surveillance  radar scans air space while in place and in movement. After  acquisition, targets are identified. The system commander, after  determining that there is a target, selects the kind of armament  (gun or missile) and passes target designations to the operator  for lock-on and tracking. The operator monitors automatic  lock-on on the radar screens. If the enemy employs  communications jamming, the target is locked-on in a manual  mode. The tracking radar outputs precise target designations  over synchronous communications to the optical sight and moves  it onto the line of sight. The gunner detects the target in the  sight's field of view, takes it for tracking, and holds the  sight aiming mark on the target in the process of guidance. Data  go from the radar to the central computer system for controlling  successive fire on targets by missiles and gun armament. Based  on results of fire, the commander makes the decision on  transferring fire to another target. System reaction time from  the moment of target acquisition to firing on the target is 8-10  seconds.    COPYRIGHT: "Tekhnika i vooruzheniye", 1994</p>

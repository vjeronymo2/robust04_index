			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Docklands: the year 2000 - Michael Cassell finds himself in Canary Wharf to greet the new millennium Today's spectacular, millennium street party around the dancing fountains of Cabot Square, in the shadow of Canary Wharf's monumental tower, is to be linked live via laserline to the four-nation astronaut team on its way to Mars. For some of those closer to home, like members of SPLASH, the London Docklands tenants' action group, the celebrations will double as an act of exquisite retribution. The festivities take place eight years after Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer which flew too close to the sun, was forced to hand over Europe's largest property development to the administrators. Sir Paul Beresford, the environment secretary, whose offices are a short walk away, will not be there because of 'a longstanding parliamentary commitment'. Canary Wharf's owners - a US-Japanese consortium which is denying renewed rumours it wants to sell - are allowing the party to go ahead in the hope it will attract the sort of crowds which have been all too rare in recent years. Though the Docklands revellers lost their struggle in the 1980s to prevent big business invading the Isle of Dogs, they have derived some bitter-sweet consolation in the 1990s from watching their warnings of disaster materialise. Despite misgivings over the residents' plans to march behind well-preserved banners emblazoned with slogans like 'Don't Destroy our Lives' and 'Capitalists Go Home', many traders on the Wharf have agreed to support an event which should help the tills ring. Following the departure of the Brazilian beauty product boutiques and Belgian chocolate shops, which 10 years ago helped establish the ritzy, upmarket tone for Canary Wharf, most central area shops at least have found new tenants. The photocopying services and supermarkets in particular report lively trade and the Cat and Canary pub on Fisherman's Walk says business is good. It recently stopped selling the more exotic, imported beers office workers first demanded when it opened in 1992. The picture is less rosy on the 50 floors of office space which rise above the Thames in One Canada Square, the Cesar Pelli-designed tower whose flashing beacons have for years been mocked as a warning to entrepreneurs - rather than aircraft - to keep clear. With 30m sq ft of empty office space and every imaginable incentive luring them back to more central locations throughout the mid-1990s, many pioneering tenants returned west long ago. Of those American companies which fulfilled their pledge to move in, few remain; some advertising people and accountants linger on but most investment banks are back in the Square Mile. The tower itself, offering top-quality accommodation at rents firmly stuck at about Pounds 20 a sq ft - less than half the going rate in the City - is comfortably full. Mr Francis Maude's Department of Trade and Industry is still acquiring space in the adjoining Cabot Place while the Audit Commission and the Inland Revenue are across the street. The area is now said to house as much corporate computer power as the City, with companies just as happy to put their back offices in Poplar as in Purley. But many Canary Wharf office buildings still echo only to the footsteps of security men. Beyond the core, little has changed in a decade, with the best part of 1,000 acres of surrounding development land sealed off behind curtains of corrugated iron. Despite projections by the Henley Centre for Forecasting that Canary Wharf would create 57,000 permanent jobs by 1996, the numbers have only recently reached 20,000, largely thanks to Conservative governments. Quiet streets temporarily liven up at lunchtime as workers make their way to sit in the sun alongside huge, sculpted bowls of geraniums, now maintained by the Docklands Urban Council, the somewhat neutered body which replaced the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1996. DUC, which now lives in reasonable harmony alongside the three local authorities, has this week made its own contribution to the millennium celebrations by extending free parking for motorists to seven days a week. Southwark, Newham and Tower Hamlets, enjoying a bigger say in Docklands than at any time since the LDDC was set up nearly 20 years ago, have been concentrating on providing homes for locals in the 21st century. The calls for more low-cost housing are finally being heeded, given that luxury penthouse apartments are still selling for less than half the Pounds 600,000 being asked at the end of the 1980s. Most of the private moorings attached to each home on Clippers Quay are empty. The release in 1995 of capital receipts from council house sales enabled Docklands authorities to undertake a modest building programme for low-cost homes. Their action was boosted by the provision of extra resources won through hard lobbying by London City Council, the capital's fledgling strategic body which itself has just taken more space overlooking West India Quay. But if the towering ambitions for Docklands, first proclaimed by Baroness Thatcher and Sir Michael Heseltine, have failed, the prospect of ultimate success has not yet been extinguished. Critics fond of quoting La Defense in Paris as a prime example of urban redevelopment are being reminded that a project one-tenth the size of Docklands took 35 years to reach fruition. Even so, images of granite and stainless steel temples shimmering on the waterside in testimony to the 1990s have certainly sunk. A less heroic future beckons. With the opening in March this year of the Pounds 3bn Jubilee Underground extension between Canary Wharf and the City - part-funded by Mr Major's second government - the key to Docklands may finally have been unlocked. The biggest single concentration of transport investment in the UK has also seen the completion of the Limehouse Link Road to the Isle of Dogs, further improvements to the light railway system and more upgrading of the Blackwall tunnel. One notable transport success has been to the east, at Docklands Airport, now busier than ever. Looking beyond the capital's immediate millennium celebrations, the LCC and DUC are together stepping up work on proposals to bring the 2008 Olympics to Docklands. But the local councils are wary and the residents are antagonistic. It looks as though Docklands is bracing itself for another battle.</p>

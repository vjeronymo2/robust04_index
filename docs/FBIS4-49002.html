			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political staff] </F>   [Text] The Governor, Chris Patten, made a last-ditch  attempt yesterday to secure a meeting with visiting Hong Kong  affairs chief Lu Ping, as Beijing announced that high-level  talks on airport funding would begin within weeks. Mr Patten  said he was prepared to receive Mr Lu--who arrives in Hong Kong  tonight--in his capacity as a representative of the Preliminary  Working Committee (PWC), despite a government ban on official  contacts with the Beijing- appointed body. "That would create  no difficulties for me," Mr Patten said, in response to a  question from the SUNDAY MORNING POST. "It doesn't matter what  hat he wears, whether it's head of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office or Secretary-General of the PWC, the important  thing is there is a long agenda of issues and the people of Hong  Kong expect us to get on and find solutions."    The comments came as the Chinese Joint Liaison Group team  leader Guo Fengmin revealed that contacts were under way to fix  a date for a meeting of the Airport Committee, which has not  convened since August. Mr Guo was "optimistic" about making  progress. "We are prepared to hold the Airport Committee  meeting in a few weeks' time, but we have to discuss the exact  date with the British," he said. "There is still a gap between  the two sides but there has already been some progress." It  will be the first opportunity for the committee to discuss the  fresh financing package for the Chek Lap Kok project that the  Government put forward in January. The Chinese side has raised  no major objections to the plan.    Mr Patten's offer to meet Mr Lu was last night welcomed by  advisers to Beijing, who warned that China could undermine its  position by continuing to snub Mr Patten. But XINHUA (the NEW  CHINA NEWS AGENCY) insisted a meeting between the two remained  impossible. Until now, the Government has barred all official  contacts with the PWC. Secretary for Economic Services Gordon  Siu Kwing-chue was denied permission to brief a PWC economic  sub-group. A government source insisted Mr Patten's remarks did  not amount to a recognition that the PWC could replace existing  diplomatic channels.    The Governor's offer comes after mainland officials said  that  since Mr Lu's nine-day visit was in the capacity of PWC  Secretary- General, meeting the Governor would be inappropriate.  "Mr Patten has tried his best to create a good environment for  a meeting with Mr Lu and if Mr Lu still resists this, then it  will undermine his image among Hong Kong people," leftist  legislator Tam Yiu-chung said. "Even if he refuses to agree to  a formal meeting, at least Mr Lu could meet and shake hands with  Mr Patten at a public function."    In Guangzhou, newly-appointed Hong Kong Affairs adviser  Anthony Cheung Bing-leung said the Governor's offer showed he  was adopting a more pragmatic approach towards the PWC. But  XINHUA Assistant Director Li Weiting said Mr Patten's remarks  would make no difference: "I don't think this will help. Mr Lu  is terribly busy this week and has to hurry back to Beijing to  attend some meetings." In Hong Kong, XINHUA Deputy Director  Zheng Guoxiong said it was more important for Mr Lu to spend his  time meeting ordinary members of the community. "Mr Lu is  visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of Secretary-General and  Vice-Chairman of the PWC, to take part in meetings of the PWC's  political and economic sub-groups," Mr Zheng said. "His  schedule is really tight and he is unable to meet the Governor.  He will use his very limited time to meet all sectors and  groups in Hong Kong society.</p>

The parties, which have until Saturday to register for the  April elections, emerged after four hours of talks to say that  while some progress had been achieved, a settlement had once  again eluded them.    ANC negotiator Joe Slovo said bluntly that the talks had  reached deadlock. "Unless serious movement on the side on the  Freedom Alliance is forthcoming, I would say there is no hope,"  Mr Slovo said. Even the implementation of a double ballot would  become logistically difficult if the parties stalled for much  longer.    His colleague, Mr Mohammed Valli Moosa, accused the alliance  of shifting the goalposts. He said that while the alliance had  earlier insisted on a double ballot as a precondition for a  breakthrough, it was now principally concerned that regional  constitutions should not be altered by the constitution-making  body that will be elected in April.    Mr Valli Moosa said that the ANC had asked the alliance for  a  commitment to flexibility when the parties last met on Thursday  last week. "Rather than exhibiting flexibility, the alliance  has once again moved the goalposts," he said.    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer struck an  optimistic note when he addressed reporters after the talks. He  produced a "balance sheet" of negotiations.    He said there had been agreement on constitutional  amendments  involving the fiscal competence of regions, the inclusion of the  name kwaZulu alongside that of Natal for the region, a  constitutional principle on self-determination and agreement on  two ballots if the package as a whole was accepted.    He said the alliance had agreed to take part in elections  and  to renounce violence but not to take part in transitional  structures. There was uncertainty on the reincorporation of  Bophuthatswana. "I believe that what we have is a situation  that provides for acceptable solutions. I make a call on the  relevant parties to give final consideration to the proposals,"  he said.    However, alliance spokesmen Rowan Cronje of Bophuthatswana  and Mr Walter Felgate of the Inkatha Freedom Party in particular  quickly dashed any hopes of a breakthrough. Acknowledging  limited progress, Mr Cronje then went on to say the integrity of  regional constitutions was a major issue. He said the ANC would  not give way on the right of a constituent assembly to rewrite  regional constitutions.    And Mr Felgate called Mr Meyer's balance sheet a "gross  misrepresentation of the real issue". He said the ANC was  "totally immovable" on the issue and was asking for a "blank  cheque".    Mr Valli Moosa said the ANC was committed to the  constitutional principles entrenched in the constitution and  that any constitution it devised would be within the limits  prescribed by the principles.    He said that not only were the Afrikaner volkstaat  [homeland]  demanding a mechanism that culminated in a volkstaat, but that  both Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu were insisting on  self-determination.    The negotiators are due to report back to their principals  with a view to meeting again before the Saturday deadline.</p>

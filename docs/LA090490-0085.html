			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE ARMED, THEY'RE DANGEROUS, THEY'RE . . . YOUNG GUNS III  </P> <P> There are two significant numbers to remember when analyzing the South Coast  League and its prospects for the 1990 Division II football playoffs.  </P> <P> Three is the number of outstanding quarterbacks returning for their senior  season. Rob Johnson of El Toro, Tony Solliday of Capistrano Valley and Tim  Snowden of Mission Viejo all rank among the best in Orange County.  </P> <P> Johnson was a backup to all-county quarterback Steve Stenstrom as a junior,  completing 20 of 25 passes for 550 yards. But Johnson was a beneficiary of  Stenstrom's success, earning all-county honors as a wide receiver with 61  receptions for 1,069 yards.  </P> <P> Johnson, the top athlete in the county as a junior, earned all-Southern Section  honors in football, basketball and baseball.  </P> <P> Solliday led Capistrano Valley to an undefeated record and the top ranking in  the county in 10 games, passing for 1,749 yards and 13 touchdowns. He came out  firing in Hawaii last week, passing for 221 yards and three touchdowns against  Honolulu Damien.  </P> <P> Snowden threw for 2,400 yards and 18 touchdowns in 13 games for Mission Viejo,  including a 352-yard performance in the Division III semifinals against El  Toro.  </P> <P> "You won't find a league anywhere in Southern California with three better  quarterbacks," San Clemente Coach Dave Elecciri said. "The defensive backs in  this league are going to have to be on their toes for every play."  </P> <P> Seven is the number of teams competing in the re-aligned Division II that  advanced last year to the semifinals in postseason play and came within an  eyelash of earning a berth in a championship game.  </P> <P> El Toro, Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo played in overtime games in the  Division III semifinals. El Toro beat Mission Viejo, 28-21, and Capistrano  Valley lost to Paramount, 36-35, when eventual champion Paramount scored a  two-point conversion on the last play of the game.  </P> <P> The South Coast League was elevated to Division II this season, and if the  coaches felt reaching the title game was difficult last year, there will be  more competition this season.  </P> <P> Muir, Thousand Oaks and Santa Barbara also played in overtime games in the  semifinals last year. Muir defeated Thousand Oaks, 9-3, and Santa Barbara edged  Canyon Country in a highly controversial game, 28-27.  </P> <P> Canyon Country, a member of the Golden League, is now competing in Division I  and opened its season last week with a 40-0 victory over host Honolulu St.  Louis. The victory ended St. Louis' 55-game winning streak that spanned five  years.  </P> <P> "The division is the toughest in the CIF (Southern Section) and a road trip to  Santa Barbara, Muir or Thousand Oaks will make it just that much tougher," El  Toro Coach Bob Johnson said.  </P> <P> As usual, El Toro, Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo are expected to compete  for the title in the county's strongest league. How strong is it? Last year,  Dana Hills swept past five nonleague opponents and managed to win only two  league games.  </P> <P> "It will be the same three this year," Johnson said. "But Irvine or Dana Hills  is capable of winning on any given night."  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY -- Solliday was named to the underclassman all-state team by  Cal-Hi sports as a junior and looked sharp in the season opener against Damien,  completing seven consecutive passes at one point in the second quarter. Patton,  the coach's youngest son, caught five passes for 98 yards, including touchdowns  of 30 and 35 yards.  </P> <P> Jeremy Brion is unquestionably the most talented player on the team. He  intercepted three passes against Damien and mistimed his leap for another  errant pass or he would have had four. He also led the team with 58 yards  rushing in 10 carries.  </P> <P> "Our passing game will be strong," Patton said. "I think Tony is the top  returning quarterback in the league and he didn't do anything to change my  opinion in Hawaii." Patton gave his team a "B-minus" for its season opener.  </P> <P> DANA HILLS -- Slowly but surely, the Dolphins are inching closer to The Big  Three. Two years ago, Dana Hills beat Capistrano Valley for the first time.  Last year, the Dolphins earned a playoff berth. This year, the school has grown  to 2,489 students.  </P> <P> "I think we have a chance to be in the hunt for the league title," Douglass  said. "We have a big, strong offensive line and some quickness on defense. El  Toro is the favorite, but I think second and third place is up for grabs."  </P> <P> Shaun Coleman was a second-team all-league selection at linebacker as a junior,  and Douglass says he has the potential to become an all-county player.  </P> <P> EL TORO -- The Chargers were the county's most successful team in the '80s,  winning three divisional championships and six league titles. The trend should  continue into the '90s, as El Toro's sophomore team was 9-1 last season.  </P> <P> Johnson, a starting quarterback on the freshman and sophomore teams, returns to  his natural position, leaving a gap at wide receiver. The Chargers have  developed some of the county's top receivers in the past decade, but Bret  Sanders is the only quality receiver on the team, and he moved to tailback when  Danny Maestas suffered a knee injury last week.  </P> <P> El Toro has four down linemen and four linebackers returning. Brian Haas and  Jeremy Hogue are being touted as all-county players, but linebacker Mike Nelson  has been the most impressive defensive player in camp.  </P> <P> IRVINE -- The Vaqueros opened the '89 season with a promising 19-3 victory over  cross-town rival University and then lost four of their next five games and  never recovered. Irvine managed only 32 points in those four defeats, prompting  a quarterback change.  </P> <P> Deron McCoy, last year's starter, moves to safety and Chicago transfer Jason  Minici will start at quarterback. Coach Terry Henigan has discarded the  run-oriented Delaware Wing-T in favor of the passing game.  </P> <P> "We're going to be different this year," Henigan said. "We'll two-platoon with  no player going both ways, which we've never done at Irvine."  </P> <P> But one thing hasn't changed: "The defense is way ahead of the offense,"  Henigan added.  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO -- The Diablos have qualified for the playoffs 13 consecutive  seasons. Mike Rush begins his third year with a 22-4 record and one league  title. But the varsity's mark of 10-3 was only fourth-best on the campus last  year. The freshman team was 10-0, the sophomore team was 10-0 and the junior  varsity team was 5-0.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo's nonleague schedule includes three games against San Diego  Section teams. The Diablos play road games at Rancho Buena Vista, El Camino and  Crawford. Rancho Buena Vista and El Camino won section titles last year.  </P> <P> "I think we'll have an explosive offense with Snowden, a big line and some  talented receivers returning," Rush said. "We're going to have to rebuild the  defense with only two starters returning, but we have some fine talent coming  up."  </P> <P> SAN CLEMENTE -- Ken Dolan is the league's fourth returning quarterback. Dolan,  a top pitching prospect on the Tritons' baseball team, completed 54 of 137  passes for 626 yards in nine games as a junior. San Clemente scored only 26  points in five league games.  </P> <P> "Ken is the first returning quarterback I've had here," Elecciri said. "We'll  be much improved on offense. We have a good group of juniors, but they have no  varsity experience."  </P> <P> Brad Budde, a former All-American at USC and a Pro Bowl selection for the  Kansas City Chiefs, has joined the staff.  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL '90: THE SOUTH COAST LEAGUE  </P> <P> DIVISION II  </P> <P> </P> <P> Capistrano Valley  </P> <P> Coach: Eric Patton (third year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 12-1, 5-0  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 18  </P> <P> Returning starters: Six on offense, six on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Dave Poltl, WR, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Tony Solliday, QB, 6-0, 175, Sr.;  Dan West, OG, 6-2, 195, Jr.; Dan Thompson, C, 6-0, 205, Sr.; Scott Patton,  WR/DB, 6-0, 190, Jr.; Matt Mosebrook, LB, 5-10, 190, Sr.; Bernie Chapman, DB,  6-2, 180, Sr.; Jeremy Brion, DB, 6-2, 205, Sr.; Chris Adams, TB, 6-1, 200, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Charlie Grigas, NG, 5-10, 200, Jr.; Chad Proctor, DT, 5-10, 210,  Sr.; Nate Way, DT, 6-3, 220, Sr.; Matt Call, DB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Blake Spence,  TE, 6-2, 185, Soph.  </P> <P> Outlook: Brion, a two-year all-league safety, will double at tailback,  replacing graduated Paul Shaheen. The Cougars have excellent speed at the  skilled positions and Solliday starts his third year at quarterback. Adams will  miss at least four games with a strained vertebra in his lower back. Mosebrook  will anchor a strong defense but the big question is the offensive line, with  only two starters returning. Capistrano Valley meets El Toro in its league  opener Oct. 12.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dana Hills  </P> <P> Coach: Don Douglass (ninth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 7-4, 2-3  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 14  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three on offense, four on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Shaun Coleman, LB, 5-10, 200, Sr.; Marcus Jenkins, TB, 5-11,  170, Jr.; Josh Moeller, DT, 6-1, 220, Sr.; Albie Suket, QB, 6-0, 175, Sr.; Jeff  Wilkes, TE, 6-1, 210, Sr.; Brian Dooley, OG, 6-0, 190, Sr.; Jeremy Buck, FL,  6-0, 180, Jr.; Vernon Edley, OG, 6-0, 190, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Nick Nosek, LB, 5-11, 190, Jr.; Billy Hollister, TB/LB, 5-8,  165, Sr.; Dave Erickson, DE, 6-1, 210, Jr.; Scott Duster, LB, 6-0, 210, Jr.; Al  Diaz, OT, 6-5, 260, Jr.; Marcell Franklin, FB, 5-10, 185, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Dana Hills won only two league games but earned an at-large berth in  the Division III playoffs last year based on five nonleague victories. It will  be difficult to match the nonleague sweep this year with the addition of  Division I schools Fountain Valley and Long Beach Millikan. "Our goal is to  make the playoffs on our own doing rather than getting an at-large berth,"  Douglass said. The team's strength is the offensive line and overall defensive  quickness, but it will be difficult replacing all-league running back Matt  Carvalho.  </P> <P> </P> <P> El Toro  </P> <P> Coach: Bob Johnson (12th year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 12-2, 4-1  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 29  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three on offense, eight on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Rob Johnson, QB, 6-4, 210, Sr.; Danny Maestas, TB, 5-10, 185,  Sr.; Jason Rojas, FB, 6-0, 195, Sr.; Brian Haas, LB, 6-2, 215, Sr.; Jeremy  Hogue, DT, 6-4, 255, Sr.; Matt Krajec, DG, 6-3, 240, Sr.; Chris Miller, DG,  6-1, 240, Jr.; Mike Nelson, LB, 6-0, 210, Sr.; Jason Brizic, LB, 6-1, 200, Sr.;  Chris Adams, LB, 6-0, 200, Jr.; Chad Hoelker, OG, 6-4, 210, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jason Bailey, DB, 6-1, 170, Jr.; Pat McAdams, DB, 6-0, 175,  Soph.; Jason O'Conner, OT, 6-3, 270, Jr.; Ken Koppleman, WR, 6-3, 200, Sr.;  Jeff Pallone, C, 5-11, 215, Jr.; Chris Wiggins, FB, 6-0, 195, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Maestas, an all-league honorable mention tailback, will be out three  to five weeks with a knee injury suffered in practice a week ago. Bret Sanders,  the team's top wide receiver, has replaced Maestas. Bob Johnson is predicting  that seven or eight players will eventually sign with Division I schools and  three of his starters -- Johnson, Hogue and Haas -- have been listed in most  scouting publications.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> Coach: Terry Henigan (ninth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 3-7, 1-4  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 14  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three on offense, four on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Bill Hargrove, C, 6-0, 210, Sr.; Brad Stammer, LB, 6-3, 215,  Sr.; Dean Wakeham, OT, 6-6, 240, Sr.; Mark Huffman, WR, 5-10, 180, Sr.; Greg  Webb, LB, 6-3, 205, Sr.; Jimmy Bassler, DB, 5-10, 160, Sr.; Deron McCoy, DB,  5-9, 160, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jason Minici, QB, 5-11, 170, Jr.; Aaron Garcia, QB, 5-10, 160,  Soph.; Tim Meehan, DE, 5-10, 170, Sr.; Todd Habermehl, DE, 6-1, 175, Sr.; Chris  Perry, WR, 6-2, 175, Sr.; Tim Thompson, OG, 5-10, 205, Sr.; Sean Olsen, NG,  6-0, 185, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Hargrove, a first-team all-league selection, is the standout on the  offensive line, where he is joined by Wakeham at tackle. McCoy, last year's  starting quarterback, moves to free safety. Sophomore Garcia and Minici, a  transfer from Chicago, are vying for McCoy's quarterback position. Shad  Vickers, the team's top offensive weapon the past two years, transferred to  Tustin. The team's strength is at linebacker, where Stammer and Webb are  Division I prospects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Coach: Mike Rush (third year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 10-3, 3-2  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 31  </P> <P> Returning starters: Five on offense, two on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Bill Denny, SS, 6-1, 195, Sr.; Mark Welker, DT/OT, 6-3, 230,  Sr.; Tim Snowden, QB, 6-1, 180, Sr.; Chris Sulages, OG, 6-3, 240, Sr.; Ted  Hoag, C, 6-2, 220, Sr.; Mike Boucher, WR, 6-4, 195, Sr.; Beau LeBreton, LB,  6-1, 185, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Matt Keneley, LB, 6-5, 240, Jr.; Rob Cullinan, DT/OT, 6-5, 280,  Jr.; Aaron Zeff, OT/DT, 6-5, 270, Sr.; Anthony Cox, OT, 6-3, 250, Sr.; Kyle  Maguire, OT, 6-1, 205, Sr.; Brian Hodson, NG, 6-0, 225, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Mission Viejo has stumbled in the semifinals of the playoffs five  times in the past six years, losing a memorable 28-21 overtime game to El Toro  last year. Mission Viejo got past the semifinals in 1985 but lost to Santa Ana,  32-21, in the title game. "Our goal is to win one more game in the playoffs  than we've done the past six years," Rush said. LeBreton set a school record  with 14 sacks and Denny intercepted two passes for touchdowns in '89.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Clemente  </P> <P> Coach: Dave Elecciri (fourth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 3-7, 0-5  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 10  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three on offense, three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Adrian Soto, OT/DT, 5-10, 260, Sr.; Matt Wimpress, C/DT, 5-11,  212, Sr.; Eddie Diaz, G/DT; 5-10, 210, Sr.; Ken Dolan, QB, 6-2, 185, Sr.;  Russell Johnson, LB, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Marcus Burke, HB, 5-10, 155, Sr.; Mike Ray,  DE, 5-11, 205, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Forrest Lindberg, OT, 6-4, 230, Jr.; Shane Shanafeldt, TE/LB,  5-10, 200, Sr.; Morgan Bannister, FS, 6-3, 185, Jr.; D'Angelo Nightingale, WR,  5-8, 140, Jr.; Adrian Diaz, LB, 5-10, 190, Jr.; Adam Ybarra, DE, 6-2, 205, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: San Clemente has struggled to a 2-24 record in the league over the  past five seasons and hasn't won a league game in three years. The streak  likely will continue this year but relief is in sight. The Tritons' sophomore  team finished 5-5 last year, its best record in 10 seasons. The return of  quarterback Dolan and the addition of Steve Castle as offensive coordinator  will also improve the Tritons' four-points-per-game average in league last  year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for  29 May 1994.    A recent poll conducted in 25 cities nationwide between 22  and 26 April by the National Center shows Liberal Party  presidential candidate Ernesto Samper leading Conservative Party  candidate Andres Pastrana by 7 percent. In the case of a  run-off election, Samper will reportedly beat out Pastrana by 53  percent for Samper to 44 percent for Pastrana. During the  closing of the Governors' Summit, candidate Pastrana stressed  that the state cannot forget its responsibilities for the health  of its citizens, and added that the tax base and revenue sources  for the various departments must be broadened. (Santa Fe de  Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 1 May 94 p 9A)    Pastrana's campaign-coordinator Luis Moreno has indicated  Pastrana has always been willing to hold debates. Conservative  vice presidential candidate Luis Ramirez said the latest polls  indicate Pastrana is on the rise, people are very enthusiastic  about Pastrana's campaign. He adds that, regardless of polls,  they have always welcomed debates. Antonio Navarro Wolff,  candidate for the 19 April Movement, noted that Samper's  indecision regarding his participation in debates is worrisome.

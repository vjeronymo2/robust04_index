			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Beazer Homes to raise Pounds 50m of new money Beazer Homes is to raise Pounds 50m of new money when it is floated by Hanson next month. Before the new money, Beazer will have no debt. The new funds would finance land purchases and working capital to take Beazer Homes a long way towards its target of building 7,000 houses a year by the end of the decade, the group said. In its pathfinder prospectus, issued yesterday, Beazer Homes said that had it been quoted for a full year to June 1994 it would have paid a dividend of 5.4p, a rise of 8 per cent over an indicated 5p pay-out for 1993. The 1993 dividend would have been covered 2.3 times by adjusted earnings of 11.4p, not taking account of the benefit of the Pounds 50m. Mr Victor Benjamin, chairman, said he expected dividend cover to vary between two and three depending on the stage of the housebuilding cycle. The group said that during the first four months of the current financial period, which will be for nine months, reservations were 33 per cent up and completions 28 per cent up. Mr Dennis Webb, chief executive, said the group was currently in late stages of negotiating the purchase of 3,000 plots of land, at an average price of Pounds 11,000. At the end of December the group's land bank was 16,117 plots at an average price of Pounds 8,500. He said he expected average selling prices to rise, partly as the group changed its mix towards the higher end of the market, and also because the levels of sales incentives were falling, from some Pounds 4,000 to Pounds 5,000 a house to about Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 3,000 now. The prospectus warned that because the group was currently developing higher cost sites, gross margins would be reduced in the current year. This would put some pressure on the operating margin which was 13.6 per cent in the year to September, said Mr David Smith, finance director. The group has about 4,000 plots bought between 1989 and 1991 when land costs were higher. These would be used 'in the short term', Mr Webb said. Mr Smith also warned that the tax charge would rise over the next three to four years from 25 to 33 per cent. Analysts said the amount of new money being raised was encouraging as Beazer Homes would come to market with a strong balance sheet. However, the fall in the stock market yesterday was also weighing on forecasts of the group's likely market capitalisation which ranged up to Pounds 450m. Mr Webb said the 'ethos and structure' of the company was based on the belief that a profitable housebuilder needs a good local knowledge of its markets. The group is divided into 14 autonomous companies, and there are few central functions although there were strict central financial controls. The subsidiaries are responsible for buying land, deciding what sort of houses to build, for buying materials and marketing the finished product.</p>

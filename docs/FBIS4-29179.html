			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What is North Korea Thinking Of?"] </F>   [Text] North Korea, which is suspected of developing  nuclear weapons, announced that it will immediately withdraw  from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and issued a  statement rejecting all nuclear inspections. These actions will  deepen suspicions about North Korea's nuclear weapons  development and heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula. The  situation has worsened to the point where we have to really  worry.    North Korea has completed the removal of all the fuel rods  from a five-megawatt experimental atomic reactor in defiance of  the IAEA's demand for halting the action. In reaction, the IAEA  has voted to adopt a resolution imposing "sanctions" against  North Korea that include suspending technological cooperation.  North Korea has reacted to the IAEA's sanctions by announcing  its withdrawal from the IAEA. North Korea's reaction was beyond  our anticipation.    Meanwhile, North Korean President Kim Il-song recently told  an American expert: "If issues, including normalizing relations  between North Korea and the United States, are settled as a  package deal and the United States provides us with assistance  in our effort to shift to light-water atomic reactors, we will  be willing to freeze our nuclear program."    If North Korea quits the IAEA, it will obviously become  impossible for both the United States and North Korea to hold  dialogue and spur debates on a resolution in the UN Security  Council on imposing sanctions against North Korea. We would  like to ask North Korea: "What on Earth are you thinking of?."    We would like to focus on two points of North Korea's recent  statement.    First, North Korea has announced that it will quit the IAEA,  but it has not expressed its intention to withdraw from the  Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT).    North Korea joined the NPT in 1985 and signed a safeguards  agreement with the IAEA in 1992 to accept nuclear inspections.  In March 1993, however, North Korea rejected an IAEA demand for  special nuclear inspections of two undeclared nuclear facilities  in Yongbyon and then announced that it would quit the NPT.  Later, following talks with the United States, North Korea  expressed its intention to temporarily suspend its withdrawal  from the NPT. Since then, North Korea has taken the stand that  it accepts only bona-fide nuclear inspections while maintaining  that it holds a "special status" while it delays withdrawal from  the NPT.    If North Korea quits the IAEA and rejects all nuclear  inspections, this means it remains in the NPT without having  nuclear inspections. This is a flagrant violation of the NPT.  The "special status" theory, which North Korea has expounded,  is no longer convincing.    Second, North Korea's rejection of all nuclear inspections  would make it impossible to determine whether or not it has  developed nuclear weapons in the past or has diverted plutonium  extracted from fuel rods to nuclear weapons development. North  Korea's rejection of all nuclear inspections would also make it  impossible to check that country's nuclear program in the  "future."    How should the international community deal with North  Korea's dangerous actions?    What is important is that the international community should  deal coolly with the North Korean nuclear issue and take a  resolute attitude without overreacting to any of North Korea's  actions.    To that end, the international community needs to find out  what North Korea's real intentions are, and sensibly monitor  North Korean signals. Former U.S. President Carter will be  visiting North Korea. Liberal Democratic Party members will also  be visiting Pyongyang following a visit by Social Democratic  Party of Japan members. They will have a good opportunity to  feel out their real intentions.    Since North Korea wants to resolve the nuclear issue through  dialogue with the United States, the United States should not  close the channel for dialogue. It is important for the United  States to cooperate with the UN Security Council and other  nations.    The role to be played by China, North Korea's most friendly  ally, is increasingly growing important. During his meeting  with Choe Kwang, visiting General Staff chief of the Korean  People's Army, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stressed the  inseparability of China and North Korea, describing Sino-North  Korean relations as "teeth and lips." North Korea cannot  maintain itself for a long period without China's supplies of  oil and spare parts for weapons.    China has frequently advocated "peace and stability" on the  Korean peninsula and the "denuclearization" of the Korean  peninsula. North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA may jeopardize  this. We hope that China will seriously persuade North Korea.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Nordic and Alpine countries may pay less to join EU The four Nordic and Alpine countries now in final talks on entry to the European Union are likely to pay much less than expected for membership. Figures put on the negotiating table by the European Commission for the first time this week show that Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway would together contribute Ecu6.1bn (Pounds 4.62bn) into the EU's Ecu70bn budget, and together take out Ecu4.4bn. Previously, informal Commission calculations had suggested that the four applicant countries - all richer per capita than the EU average - would together make a net contribution two to three times higher than the net contribution now on the table. The Commission's figures show that Finland, against all forecasts, would be a small net beneficiary from the Brussels kitty, partly because it is emerging from a three-year contraction in national output of nearly 15 per cent. It would in its first year of membership receive a net Ecu119m from the EU budget, paying in Ecu982m and receiving Ecu1.1bn. Austria would pay in nearly Ecu2.1bn and receive Ecu1.3bn, contributing a net Ecu752m. Sweden's balance would be an Ecu765m net contribution. Norway would pay about Ecu1.1bn, receiving from Brussels Ecu701m - a net payment of Ecu362m. The Commission's figures are being examined by EU member states, and may alter after talks starting next week on agriculture and regional aid subsidies. The figures could strengthen public support for membership in the applicant countries, but poorer member states, led by Spain, are determined that the northern countries should pay an entry fee to the EU club which reflects their comparative wealth. Sweden accepted it would ultimately be a net contributor to the EU. But the finance ministry said that the EU's calculation for Sweden's gross contribution next year of around Ecu2.2bn amounted to 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product. The finance ministry said it could not afford a net contribution in 1995 because of Sweden's large budget deficit. Sweden would demand that its budget contribution did not exceed receipts from the EU for the first year. Sweden proposed that its contribution would increase over the next four years, ultimately reaching the Commission's figures. Finnish officials were cautious about the Commission's figures. Finland's estimated contributions were similar to the Commission's but Mr Tapio Mutikainen, a senior budget official at the finance ministry, said 'contributions are easier to estimate than our receipts'.</p>

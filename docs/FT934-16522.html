			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Portsmouth Port may be in jeopardy Portsmouth's municipal ferry port says it could be in jeopardy if the government refuses its request to borrow Pounds 7m for expansion. The port needs to reclaim land, improve facilities and increase berths for the new super-ferries if business is not to be lost to other ports and the Channel tunnel. The improvements would cost Pounds 20m by the end of the decade and Pounds 7m in the financial year 1994-95. Because the port is owned by Portsmouth district council it is subject to constraints on local government spending and cannot borrow funds without government approval.</p>

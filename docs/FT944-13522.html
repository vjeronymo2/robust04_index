			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Super unleaded ban no solution Sir, The Commons transport committee's proposal that super unleaded should be banned ('MPs row with oil industry on unleaded petrol safety', October 26) must be considered with the lessons of the past in mind. If the leaded versus unleaded gasoline debate has taught us anything, it is that banning is no solution. Without clear guidelines as to what lead should be replaced with, industry naturally opted for the most cost-effective means: namely the replacement of lead in petrol with aromatics (of which benzene is one). With what high-quality additives could the oil industry replace aromatics if government decided as a result of this proposal that their use should be restricted? In the short run aromatics could be replaced by alcohols or ethers, imported Methyl-Tertiary-Butyl-Ether (MTBE) being the least-cost option. However, studies into the effects of adding MTBE have shown that the benefits of reduced benzene emissions may be counterbalanced by increased emissions of other toxic substances, namely formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. In the long run, the government could introduce incentives for investment in different oil-processing technologies that do not produce aromatics. An alternative for refiners is to increase the level of olefins, another type of hydrocarbon used to boost gasoline quality. Again, research has shown that there is a trade-off in this approach between reduced benzene and increased emissions with ozone-forming potential. Further, little is known as to the toxicity of olefin-related emissions. The proposed banning of super unleaded is not a solution to the problem of benzene and aromatics. It raises the highly emotive issue of benzene without indicating any direction for the future.

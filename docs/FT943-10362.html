			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Routes to the bomb Attempts to curb proliferation of nuclear weapons focus on ways of preventing or discouraging countries from acquiring weapons-grade uranium or plutonium, the key elements needed for nuclear explosions, writes Bronwen Maddox. If a country already has a supply of fissile material, construction of a crude bomb is relatively straightforward. Producing fissile material of weapons-grade, however, is much more difficult. While uranium exists naturally, the form (or 'isotope') needed for a nuclear reaction makes up less than 1 per cent of uranium ore. The concentration of this isotope in the fissile material needs to be raised to about 4 per cent for uranium to be used to fuel a nuclear reactor, a process called 'enrichment', and increased still further to more than 90 per cent for use in weapons. Plutonium, a man-made element, is derived from other fissile material. It is produced by nuclear reactions in, for example, uranium reactor fuel rods, from which it is extracted and purified. There are, at present, four main routes by which countries can obtain material for nuclear weapons. Abuse of civil nuclear programmes: Of the four routes, diversion of material from nuclear power plants is one of the easiest technologically, although it is among the most likely to be detected. In this instance, fissile material is obtained from the core of a nuclear reactor. This is the route believed to be pursued by North Korea, and the one International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of civil reactors are designed to detect. Given the widespread use of nuclear power, particularly in Asia, monitoring the location of civil nuclear material could become increasingly difficult. Enrichment of natural uranium: This route was pursued by the US in the Manhattan Project's race to be first with the bomb during the second world war, and was mimicked by Iraq at hidden desert sites. Countries with large civil or military nuclear programmes are likely already to have invested in technology needed to enrich uranium. Otherwise, developing the technology is laborious and expensive. But clandestine attempts, such as Iraq's, can be hard to detect. It is increasingly difficult to control or monitor trade in components for uranium enrichment plants, which can have a wide range of industrial applications. Trade in plutonium or enriched uranium: Last month's discovery in Germany of 6 grammes of weapons-grade plutonium, believed to have been smuggled from Russia, has increased fears of nuclear material from the former Soviet republics falling into unauthorised hands. A supply of plutonium would be one of the fastest ways of acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, short of actually buying weapons. A leading US nuclear proliferation expert, Dr William Potter, has warned the find could be the 'tip of the iceberg' of illegally traded Soviet nuclear material. But there is no evidence at present that such material can be easily acquired by rogue regimes or organisations. Western intelligence experts, who have investigated thousands of reports of such trades, suggest that - so far - fears of widespread illegal dealings in fissile materials may be unfounded. Many cases investigated have involved people misrepresenting the material for sale to make money. The world's increasing non-military stockpile of plutonium, much of it in Japan, is another cause for concern. But, at present the destinations of this material, produced by reprocessing used reactor fuel rods, are closely monitored under international agreements. Trade in weapons: This is probably the hardest route to a nuclear capability for a rogue regime, given close surveillance by western governments of the former Soviet Union's missiles. Some claim that, whichever route is pursued, countries could gain considerable advantage by hiring nuclear weapons scientists, notably from the former Soviet Union. But others, such as Mr David Kay, a former IAEA inspector, say this risk is exaggerated. 'Everyone makes too much of the idea of Russian scientists. If you dropped 20kg of plutonium into Tripoli, you would have a weapons problem within weeks. I could drop 10 Russian scientists into downtown Tripoli and you would not have a weapons programme for 10 years. What you would have is 10 Russian scientists gone mad.'</p>

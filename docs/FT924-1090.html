			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions THERE ARE still few signs of investors queuing to buy shares in anticipation of the usual post-Christmas rally in the stock market. That said, the list of director purchases this week looks rather healthier than it has for some time. Embassy Property Group is a tiny concern in which the majority of shares are held by Treasure Jade, the company controlled by the Wong family. Roger Holbeche, chief executive has sold 1m shares at 7p while his chairman, Malcolm Stone, sold 750,000 at 7.5p. Macro 4 is one of that select band of UK computer software companies which has weathered the recession extremely well. Final results announced in September revealed further growth in profits and earnings. Nevertheless, Keith Piper, a non-executive director, has sold 25,000 shares at 490p. That still leaves him with over 1m. The sight of Richard Beecham buying a further 350,000 shares in Rhino Group at 28.5p highlights their very strong performance since directors bought in at 12.5p in October when the company was raising cash through a placing and open offer. Beecham now holds more than shares in the fledgling retail group, which aims to tackle the fast growing video games market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                    Sector     Shares   Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES British Telecom            Tele       84,831     334         1* Carlton Comm.

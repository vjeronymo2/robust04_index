			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Estimate of travel group's debt rises THE debts of Land Travel, the Bath-based travel company that collapsed last week, are likely to exceed Pounds 10m, Mr Robert Buller of the liquidators, Grant Thornton, said yesterday, Michael Skapinker writes. That is five times as high as initial estimates. Grant Thornton is still talking to potential purchasers of Land Travel's database, but there is no prospect that people who made bookings with the company will recover their money.</p>

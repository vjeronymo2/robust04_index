			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Close race in NEC ballot THE OUTCOME of elections to Labour's ruling national executive committee will be announced today with Mr Bryan Gould reportedly locked in a close three-horse race with Mr Tony Benn, the veteran leftwinger, and Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary. Unconfirmed reports in Blackpool suggested last night that Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader, and Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, are set to cruise home in the annual ballot. But with only one vacancy - left by the outgoing Mr Gerald Kaufman - that would mean at least one other occupant of the seven-member constituency section must fall out. Speculation on the eve of the conference was that Mr Benn, second to Mr Kaufman, who came last in 1991, is the most vulnerable. But some also believe that a strong challenge from Mr Blair, a newcomer, means that Mr Gould, who came fifth last year, could also lose his seat. Although the outcome of the voting will have little influence on the overall political composition of the national executive - it is firmly supportive of the leadership - it will be closely perused as an indicator of the mood in the constituency parties. If Mr Gould, who suffered a humiliating defeat in the race for the leadership, is knocked off by Mr Blair, it will consolidate the position of the pro-Maastricht loyalists close to Mr Smith's leadership. A defeat for Mr Benn would also be regarded as ending an era for the left wing. In recent years he and Mr Dennis Skinner, the leftwing MP for Bolsover, have formed a two-man 'rejectionist' front, voting or tabling motions opposed to the leadership's policies. Mr Gould's resignation from the shadow cabinet yesterday should have little bearing on the race as constituency delegates are, in theory, bound by ballots completed some time ago. Nonetheless, with European issues now provoking a schism in the party, analysts will be carefully assessing the consequences of the results on policy positions to be taken by the national executive in coming months. The election last year of Mr Kaufman, a well-known rightwinger, was widely seen as a consequence of the introduction of a one-member-one-vote balloting system and the influence of television, both of which are thought to favour those with the most media exposure.</p>

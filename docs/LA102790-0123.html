			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AETNA TO TRIM 2,600 JOBS IN REORGANIZATION  </P> <P> Aetna Life and Casualty Co. Friday reported a 51% fall in its third-quarter  earnings and said it will cut 2,600 of its 45,500 jobs in a reorganization  costing $60 million.  </P> <P> The Hartford-based insurance company said it will disband its three domestic  insurance divisions and form new divisions, which will be put in place in  March.  </P> <P> After deducting for the reorganization, Aetna earned $88.6 million, or 80 cents  a share, in the third quarter.  </P> <P> In last year's period, it earned $182.6 million, or $1.63 per share, including  a gain of $27.2 million on the sale of Federated Investors Inc. and a  $15-million tax credit.  </P> <P> Revenue in the period was $4.84 billion, off slightly from $4.90 billion in the  1989 quarter.  </P> <P> Revenue was hit by a $57.8-million capital loss, against a $166-million gain  last year.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said they were concerned about Aetna's mortgage portfolio and  the profitability of its property and casualty divisions.  </P> <P> "While the numbers are better than expected, I still want to know more about  their mortgage portfolio," said Herbert Goodfriend, first vice president,  Prudential-Bache.  </P> <P> Joyce Culbert, analyst with the Firemark Group, said, "The issue of Aetna's  mortgage portfolio was not addressed."  </P> <P> Aetna said its pretax net additions to reserves for mortgage loans and real  estate writedowns totaled $58 million in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "The real issue, though, is whether there are more mortgage problems  developing," said Tom Sargent, Conning &amp; Co.  </P></p>

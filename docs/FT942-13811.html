			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw begins to recover Polish equities accelerated their recovery yesterday after sharp falls last week, the WIG index rising 1,800, or 15.9 per cent to 13,099. The WIG has gained 31 per cent over the past three sessions, following a drop of more than 50 per cent since it reached a peak in early March. The recovery comes after the Warsaw stock exchange suspended the 10 per cent price limit movements and made investors set a price in their trading orders rather than asking for the 'price of the day.' The order driven market, which is modelled on the French system, is seeing the gradual restoration of price limits: a 20 per cent spread was in force yesterday, 15 per cent on Monday and a return to 10 per cent is set for next Tuesday. Investors can once again ask brokers to sell at the 'price of the day' and, yesterday, this meant that 11 of the 23 traded stocks hit the 20 per cent barrier. Prospective price/earnings ratios for 1994, however, remain high at an average of 21.3. This has encouraged foreign investors, who helped to fuel the spectacular share price rises of last year, to remain absent. Rights issues and flotations of both private sector companies and state sector disposals will continue to divert funds away from the already listed stocks. Mr Leslaw Paga, head of the securities commission, said yesterday that he was examining 26 prospectuses, and a further three companies yesterday received permission to go ahead with public share offers. This year six completed rights and flotations have aggregated around Dollars 94m while the total value of new shares currently on offer amounts to around Dollars 140m. Another Dollars 50m worth goes on sale next week in the Polifarb Cieszyn rights issue and sale of paint producer Polifarb Wroclaw, a state sector disposal. Turnover yesterday was Dollars 36m.</p>

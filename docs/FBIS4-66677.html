			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manmohan Sharma: "Sangh Family Preparing for </F> Movements at Krishna's Birthplace and Vishwanath Temple"]    [Text] After Professor Rajendar Singh, popularly known as  Rajju Bhaiya, was named the fourth director of the RSS  [Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh], the possibilities of the RSS  family forming an aggressive attitude have increased. Rajju  Bhaiya is a politician and his appointment will definitely  influence national politics. In addition to making plans to  build Rama's temple in Ayodhya, the Sangh family is rigorously  preparing for obtaining Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi and  Krishna's birthplace in Mathura. There will be vidhan sabha  elections in 10 states next year. Rajju Bhaiya will have to plan  a strategy in order to improve BJP's [Bharatiya Janata Party]  situation during these elections. It was decided in the BJP's  national working committee meeting held recently in Hyderabad to  emphasize the issue of Hindutva.    Seeing the present situation of various Sangh family  organizations, accepting the position of the RSS director is  analogous to wearing a crown made of thorns. Rajju Bhaiya will  have to take strong action to stop the waywardness which is  increasing in the once-disciplined Sangh family. It is said that  Rajju Bhaiya is very upset at the increasing undiscipline in the  BJP. It was also learned that he had directed BJP leaders to  give up their royal living style and lead simpler lives.    There are also talks about the RSS attitude becoming very  severe towards the present central government. Only a few people  know the fact that former Sangh President M.D. Deoras and Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao were classmates in Nagpur a long time ago  and both talked to each other directly. Perhaps that is why the  BJP had helped Mr. Rao many times when Mr. Rao was in trouble.  Recently, there was a similar occurrence. The government was  having problems in getting the bill asking for the privatization  of banks, insurance companies, and airlines passed. Raja  Maheshwar Singh, a BJP member, had the plan to disobey the  president's directive. However, he did not push it. The BJP  member abstained when the vote was taken. Similarly, the BJP  helped the government in getting a bill passed in the Lok Sabha.  Rajju Bhaiya admitted that Atal Behari Bajpayee had accepted the  leadership of the Indian delegation to Geneva with his  permission. Now the attitude of the Sangh family definitely will  change towards the Rao government. The RSS wants to get other  parties' support against the Dunkel proposals. It is said that  RSS had assured George Fernandes of its cooperation in opposing  the Dunkel proposals, however, Fernandes did not accept the  offer. It was also learned that Rajju Bhaiya met Chandra Shekhar  recently and offered to start a campaign against the Dunkel  proposals, however, Chandra Shekhar suggested that it would be  better for the two parties to run their campaigns separately.  The word is that Rajju Bhaiya had formed this strategy to  separate left-wing parties from other parties. It also appears  that Rajju Bhaiya is very eager to establish contacts with  Janata Dal's V.P. Singh. He was V.P. Singh's professor at  Allahabad University. It is also being said that Rajju Bhaiya  supports the idea of establishing coalitions with the  non-Congress parties in the states where the BJP is weak,  however, the BJP high command does not support this idea. It  wants the BJP to win the next election on its own strength as  forming coalitions with other parties will only hurt the BJP.  Therefore, the possibility of the BJP forming a coalition with a  non-Congress front is very small.    Rajju Bhaiya has announced that the claim on the Gyanvapi  mosque in Varanasi and on the Idgah building in Krishna's  birthplace in Mathura will not be relinquished. The Vishwa Hindu  Parishad (VHP) has selected these three [including Ayodhya]  places from among more than 3,000 sites for return to their  original use. These sites are extremely holy for the Hindus and  are of no importance to the Muslims. Therefore, the Muslims  should hand these over to the Hindus to win their goodwill. This  will help foster friendship between the two groups. He said that  this is the goal, however, the VHP has to decide how it achieves  this goal. The Sangh family will cooperate with the VHP in this  effort.    The VHP has been claiming for the last several years that  other religious groups have taken over 3,000 to 5,000 Hindu  worship places and have changed the structures totally. The  victors had done this to crush the self-respect of the  vanquished community and to destroy the Hindu culture. It is  said that Mogul emperor Aurangzeb had destroyed the Vishwanath  temple in Varanasi and built a mosque on that site. This is  known as Gyanvapi mosque now. Similarly, the temple in Mathura  at Krishna's bithplace was destroyed by Aurangzeb, Mehmood  Gaznavi, and others several times. At present, the Idgah that  Aurangzeb built at Krishna's bithplace stands there.    After destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, security  arrangements around these places in Varanasi and Mathura have  been strengthened. Steel fencing costing over 250 million rupees  has been built around these places, and para-military forces are  protecting them round the clock.    It is important to mention here that the present Vishwanath  temple was built by Indore's queen Ahilya Bai and Sher-i Punjab  Ranjit Singh had mounted about five mounds [about 200 kilograms]  of gold on its roof. At present, this temple is under government  control. Similarly, Varanasi's king Patni Mal had bought  Mathura's site for 5,000 rupees in an auction from the East  India Company. In 1935, Pandit Madan Mohan Maulviya decided to  rebuild it and contacted Seth Ghanshyam Das Birla. Rai Krishna  Das was Raja Patni's successor and did not want to sell this  historical place and Birla did not want to accept it for free.  It was decided in the end to pay 5,000 rupees to Ram Krishna Das  as fee for this land, which he would later donate to the temple  foundation. When the temple foundation dug the land for lying  the foundation, they found many ancient artifacts there. These  prove that Krishna was born at that site. Mr. Maulviya did start  the work of building this temple, however, he could not finish  it. He died during that time. The temple was finished due to the  efforts of the Birla brothers and the editor of KALYAN, Jay  Dayal Goenka, however, the Idgah building still stands on the  original bithplace. The Hindus are not allowed to enter the  Idgah. the same is true about the Gyanvapi masque.    The RSS was founded by a Congress Party member, Dr. Keshav  Baliram Hedgewar in 1925 in Nagpur. The goal was to unite the  Hindus and protect their religion and culture. The RSS slowly  spread in various parts of the country. After Dr. Hedgewar's  demise in 1940, the working committee opened a sealed envelope  left by him and learned that he had appointed M.S. Golwalkar as  his successor. Before working for the RSS, Golwalkar was a  mathematics professor at Benares Hindu University. At the time  he was appointed to the executive director's position, he was  working as its secretary. He was only 34 years old at that time.    The government banned the RSS for four years when Mr. Gandhi  was assassinated. Over 200,000 volunteers took part in a  satyagraha [peaceful demonstration] to help remove this ban.  Guru Golwalkar established several front organizations in order  to expand RSS activities. Golowalkar just before his death in  1973 appointed then general secretary Balasaheb Deoras as his  successor by leaving his name in a sealed envelope.    Three months ago, I informed the nation before anyone else  that Balasaheb Deoras was ready to retire and appoint a capable  person as his successor. Professor Rajendar Singh was one of the  possible successors. When this news was published in the PUNJAB  KESARI many people refused to believe it. Some people were very  critical of it, however, now it has been proven that my  information published in The PUNJAB KESARI was correct. It is  true that Balasaheb Deoras' health was not good for the last two  years. He had a stroke and his body was paralyzed, however, this  news was kept secret from the members. Last year, when his  younger brother, Bhaurao Deoras, died in Delhi, some of the  members saw his serious condition at the Nigambodh cremation  place. At that time, he had expressed his desire to one of his  senior associates that he wanted to appoint an able successor  since he could not do his job because of his illness.    As for Professor Rajendar Singh also known as Rajju Bhaiya,  he is 72 years old. He was born in Bulandshaher in Uttar  Pradesh. His father, Thakur Balbir Singh, was the first Indian  chief engineer of Uttar Pradesh. He was educated at the Modern  School in Delhi and a very good public [private] school in  Nainital. He scored highest points in the high school  examination in the whole nation. He earned M.S.C. in physical  sciences from Allahabad University. Until 1942, he was a  card-carrying Congress Party member. At that time, he met  Bhaurao Deoras, who brought him into the RSS. Between 1952 and  1966, he worked as a professor and also worked for the RSS to  expand its program. He resigned from the university in 1967 and  was appointed the administrator for the northeastern region. He  was also administrator for Uttar Pradesh. In troubled times, he  took responsibility for administration. He was appointed  associate director of the RSS.    He was appointed executive secretary in 1978. The high  command removed him from this position in 1987. At that time, it  was claimed that he had resigned from the position because of  his poor health. His successor was H.V. Sheshadri who was also  the chairman of Dr. Hedgewar's birth centennial celebration.    The first three executive directors of the RSS were  Maharashtrian Brahmans while Rajju Bhaiya is a Rajput from Uttar  Pradesh. Fot the first time in the history of RSS, the executive  director has appointed his successor while he was still alive.  The first three executive directors of the RSS were bachelors  while Rajju Bhaiya is married and has a family.    There are several administrators in the RSS high command who  are senior to Rajju Bhaiya. These include Dattopant Thengari,  the founder of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh [BMS] (Indian Labour  Union), who is considered the greatest thinker in the RSS  family. He also founded another associate organization, the  Bharatiya Kisan Sangh [BKS] (Indian Farmers Union). He is a  Maharasthrian Brahman and has been a Rajya Sabha member for 12  years. In addition to him, Mr. H. V. Sheshadri, the present  executive secretary of the RSS, is the most powerful person in  the RSS. He is from Karnataka and a writer by profession. He has  written dozens of books. Moropant Pingle is also a senior  administrator and has been executive secretary once. He is the  head of the VHP now. He is a skilled organizer and a  Maharashtrian Chitpawan Brahman. Why did Balasaheb Deoras ignore  these senior officials and appoint Prof. Rajender Singh his  successor? There are various conjectures about it. It is not  possible to say anything definite about any of these people.    The new executive director has appointed Mr. Sheshadri the  secretary general. It was the first time in the RSS history that  three joint secretaries were appointed. These include C.K.  Sudarshan who was still in this position when Suresh Katekar was  appointed joint secretary. The third joint secretary is Madan  Das who was the president of the All India Students Federation  until recently. He was appointed secretary general of the  anti-Dunkel awareness campaign.    He has appointed Abha Thite, Guru Golwalkar's personal  secretary, administrator of eastern region, Jitendra Vir as  northern region's administrator, and Subraynam Swami as southern  region's administrator. He also appointed B. Hari central  administrator for India, Bal Apte as head of the All India  Students Federation, and Ashok Singhal as the head of the VHP  [Vishwa Hindu Parishad]. His team is relatively young and most  of them are about 50 years old.    It is important to mention here that the executive  administrators of the RSS are also responsible for taking care  of the other organizations within the Sangh family.    There are about 7,000 administrators. They are not allowed  to  marry. The Sangh has about 35,000 branches and has a membership  between 7 and 9 million. There are 47 organizations in the Sangh  family. The major organizations among these are the BJP, VHP,  Indian Labour Union, Sanskar Bharati, Vidya Bharati, and the  BKS.</p>

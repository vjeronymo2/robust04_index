			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Q&amp;A, Briefcase: Disposing of income As a non-resident of UK domicile, I am aware of the desirability of changing income sources before my return to the UK. What is the position concerning those gilt edged stocks which are tax free to non-residents and on the national savings register (interest paid gross)? The basic reason for disposing of income-sources (and other chargeable assets, such as non-sterling bank balances) before the tax year in which one will become resident in the UK - again or for the first time, is to avoid any prospective Capital Gains Tax charge on gains which have accrued while one was non-resident. There is therefore no need to dispose of gilts, because they are exempt from CGT (under section 115(1)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). For gilts on the national savings register, which are tax free to non residents, the preceding-year basis (under section 64 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, in conjunction with section 47 of that Act) means that there will be no tax liability on the holdings for the first year of ordinary residence in the UK. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

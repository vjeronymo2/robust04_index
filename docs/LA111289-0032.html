			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> MARK HAMPTON ON DECORATING BY MARK HAMPTON (RANDOM HOUSE, INC.; 1989)  </P> <P> A PRIMER FOR NOVICE and professional alike, "Mark Hampton on Decorating" is a  leisurely examination of rooms with a sense of history and personal style --  and a treatise on how to live well. Hampton, perhaps best known as the White  House decorator, shows 40 original watercolors and 60 black-and-white washes to  illustrate the "classic" look he made famous, a blend of modern and traditional  styles.  </P> <P> Arrayed in seven sections, his essays -- taken from his monthly House and  Garden column -- cover all elements of interior design from laying out an  interior to the emotional impact of color. If you've ever wondered why small  rooms appear larger painted in deep colors, Hampton has the answer: "The reason  is that the boundaries of space become lost in shadow, the walls and corners  seem to recede." "The effect," he suggests, "is most noticeable in small  hallways, studies and libraries where their application evokes a hushed,  peaceful quality."  </P> <P> He also counsels on the use of overscale furniture: "Instead of putting a sofa  on the obvious long wall, consider using an imposing piece of real furniture.  And if your room is really huge, anchor the whole thing down with a center  table."  </P> <P> Hampton traces historical origins (the slipper chair is derived from the  18th-Century French chauffeuse), and advises on diverse interior elements:  fireplaces, lamps, mirrors, seating, framing, bed and bedposts. Dressing  windows and setting the table are also grist for the mill. Explored are various  styles, from Victorian -- which has made a comeback in recent years -- to  classicism, which Hampton feels is "always new." Delights of chinoiserie are  extolled: "There isn't a house in the world that wouldn't allow you to indulge  in a little Oriental monkey business." ($24.95) Barbara Thornburg  </P></p>

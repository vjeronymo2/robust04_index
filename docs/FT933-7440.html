			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Housing associations not criticised by audit report Sir, Your headline 'Audit rap for housing associations' (August 18) bore little resemblance either to the article that followed or the contents of the National Audit Office report on which it was based. As the chief executive of one of the 14 associations included in the NAO study, I certainly do not feel 'rapped' over my organisation's stewardship of the public funds made available to us, nor do I believe that the NAO pinpointed any serious shortcomings in the way in which associations handled their development programmes. The growth in the work of associations over the past three years has been significant and, inevitably, we have had to improve financial forecasting and learn the requirements of the money markets to raise private finance. Despite this, our record has been impressive - as the response to the government's 'housing market package' showed. While, like many organisations, improvements can always be made I believe that your headline may lead some readers to have doubts over the work of associations in general and over the good security they continue to offer lenders for the future. David R Hucker, chief executive, Orbit Housing Association, 44/45 Queens Road, Coventry CV1 3EH</p>

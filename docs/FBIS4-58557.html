			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F> delegation to the Cairo negotiations, by Umberto De  Giovannangeli; place and date not given: "Sha'th Is Happy:  `This Sovereignty Will Not Be a Ghetto'" -- first paragraph is  L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] Tired but happy, in spite of the dramatic events  that lent excitement to the signing ceremony: Such is the  impression given by Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian  delegation to the Cairo negotiations. "The Hebron massacre,  followed by those in 'Afula and Hadera, drastically worsened the  situation," Sha'th admits, "but that was just when dialogue  proved the winning option: We and the Israelis realized that the  only way to defeat the enemies of peace was to force the pace of  the negotiations. The agreements are the fruit born of this  shared awareness." "We are at the beginning of a journey to  freedom. There are still a lot of obstacles to be removed,  because 27 years of military occupation have left their mark on  every aspect of the life of our community, but now we can look  forward with greater optimism: A new dawn is breaking for  Palestinians."    [De Giovannangeli] What significance does the PLO attribute  to the agreement reached in Cairo?    [Sha'th] It is the beginning of a journey to freedom that  will lead to the constitution of a Palestinian state. Not now,  of course, but sooner than envisaged even in the Washington  agreement. In this respect, in spite of the issues that it still  leaves open, the Cairo agreement marks a point of no return.    [De Giovannangeli] On what do you base your optimism?    [Sha'th] In the months following the handshake between Rabin  and 'Arafat, the messages coming out of the occupied territories  all had a common denominator: Demonstrate, immediately, that  peace was not only a signature. Well, even though we are  running behind schedule, we can now show that life in the  territories really can change. Thousands of Palestinians  detained for years in Israeli jails can return to their  families, and there will be Palestinian police to ensure peace.  In a nutshell, peace begins to take a visible shape. And this  can only have a positive impact on the attitudes of Palestinians  in the territories.    [De Giovannangeli] You have called it an agreement that  paves  the way for a future Palestinian state. On what do you base  this assessment?    [Sha'th] On a number of factors that, taken together, give  the impression of "sovereignty in the making." We will have our  airline and the right to fish in Mediterranean waters off the  Gaza Strip, where the Israelis have been barring our fishing  boats to date. We will have our stamps, an international  dialing code different from Israel's, and, above all, identity  documents bearing the word "passport." People will begin to see  Palestinian harbors, airports, television channels, and economic  institutions. Two million people will realize that, for the  first time in their lives, they can write the agenda for their  own future. We will have full powers over the legislature, over  our basic laws, we will be able to decide on our own on the  nature of our civic and social life. This is why I refer to a  "new dawn" for the Palestinian people. One thing is certain:  Jericho and Gaza will not be self-governing ghettos.    [De Giovannangeli] Your talk about a "new dawn," but the  Hamas fundamentalists could darken it with further terrorist  attacks.    [Sha'th] Creating peace is the best way to curb extremist  tendencies; we have succeeded in concluding the first stage of  the negotiations in the light of this awareness. Hamas'  strength was enhanced by people's disappointment about the lack  of visible signs of change. But now things will change, of that  I am convinced, and they will change faster and more visibly if  the international community gives our efforts to establish peace  concrete support. Massive economic, technological, and  scientific investment in the territories is essential to  strengthen our autonomy and train a new governing class. This  is what we now need, not just words of encouragement. As far as  Hamas is concerned, I would add that these last few weeks have  seen signs of a new readiness to talk on the part of the  movement's leaders.    [De Giovannangeli] And what is the PLO's reply?    [Sha'th] The unity of the Palestinian people is a valuable  asset and, as such, it must be safeguarded. But from now on,  all our energy must be channeled into building up our autonomy  and achieving prosperity and freedom in the territories. We  have to turn over a new leaf, moving on from fighting against  the occupying troops to creating our state. If Hamas intends to  share in this project, it is welcome. But should it prejudice  the outcome with acts of terrorism, we are ready to use any  means to put a stop to it.    [De Giovannangeli] When may we expect to see 'Arafat in the  "autonomous territories"?    [Sha'th] It is only a question of weeks, now; it all depends  on how long the Israeli withdrawal takes. They are preparing  the premises where 'Arafat will have his offices and residence  in Jericho. He is due in at the beginning of June, and his  arrival will enable us to begin our journey toward our ultimate  goal: the Palestinian state.</p>

For  months there has seemed no question of United Nations troops  forcing aid past roadblocks. Although the arguments for this  feeble approach have been more current among diplomats in  London, Paris and New York than with the infantry grinding  through the Bosnian slush, the result has been a timid  interpretation of the UN mandate for the UN forces delivering  aid.    Amid demoralisation all round, soldiers barred from using  "all available means," as the UN promised, have been reduced to  persuading, or bribing, their way past gunmen, old women or  freelance gangsters. With too much aid being looted, tension  has mounted between the troops and the people they are there to  help. In London and Paris the politicians, prepared to utter  fierce threats at the UN and NATO but unwilling to implement  them, have taken to muttering "a plague on all their houses" and  hinted that they will bring their boys home.    Now Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the new UN  commander  in Bosnia, has begun to inject some soldierly sense into the  morass of political indecision and half-measures. Declaring his  intention to break with the "inconsistent and sometimes  faint-hearted" use of the UN's mandate, he has tried what a  little muscle can do. Earlier this week, he informed all  parties that he would be mounting a "hardline, hardnosed" drive  to deliver relief.    Yesterday, confronted by a Serb roadblock near Sarajevo, he  sent British Warrior combat vehicles to back up negotiations and  announced that they would force a way through if these failed.  Within hours, all UN traffic was moving normally. The Serbs had  been "persuaded" to honour the oft-repeated pledge by all sides  not to block humanitarian operations. On Route Diamond, the  lifeline to central Bosnia, a British armoured escort dispersed  a civilian mob attempting to loot another convoy by firing two  rounds in the air.    This and other small but symbolically important successes  must now be built on. The immediate task is to get through to  the most vulnerable enclaves. NATO should declare Tuzla airport  open and say that any Serb attacks will be met with the force,  including air power, at the UN's disposal. The Mostar-Sarajevo  road could, with determination, be secured. Such steps seem  less politically impossible than they did a few weeks ago. Sir  Michael has said he has no qualms about calling in air power to  protect his troops. The UN secretary-general has at last agreed  to delegate decisions on air power to local level, where they  belong. France is now demanding an end to Western military and  diplomatic paralysis.    Douglas Hurd appears to have returned from the Bosnian front  line a wiser man. British soldiers did not make mass complaints  that humanitarian relief was prolonging the fighting. They  pointed out what should have been obvious: first, that the  military would always eat even when women and children starved;  second, that the big losers would be the Bosnian government  side, the victims of aggression. Unlike the Serbs and Croats,  they were hemmed in, with no external supply lines. British  officers told him that they were confident they could do a  decent job of saving lives, if they were only permitted to set  about it more "robustly."    Sir Michael has made a good start in the field; the  diplomats  must do their part, starting on Monday when the European Union's  [EU] foreign ministers meet. The UN has now officially confirmed  what has been common knowledge for weeks: Croatia's deployment  of regular forces in Bosnia. Britain and France must push  Germany to come off the fence and agree immediately to end  Croatia's trade concessions with the EU. Germany's main  obsession, in an election year, is to stem the flow of Croatian  refugees; but Croatia's escalation of the war will have just  that effect, and deterrence is imperative. The UN Security  Council must go further than the EU, imposing economic sanctions.    This would make it far easier to persuade the Russians that  Serbs as well as Croats must yield more territory. That is the  way to end this war. There has been too much talk about the  Bosnian government's intransigence in refusing to accept  patchwork fragments of territory which nobody dares pretend can  long be viable as a state. So long as the Bosnians have nothing  to lose, it is absurd to expect them to lay down their arms.</p>

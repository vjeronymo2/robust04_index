			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ecclesiastical determines value for St Andrew ECCLESIASTICAL Insurance Office has determined the value of its offer for St Andrew Trust, the investment trust specialising in smaller companies, writes Philip Coggan. The offer was based on 93 per cent of St Andrew's formula asset value. As of January 22, this was 253.75p per share; accordingly the offer should be worth 235.99p. However, EIO has paid 237.65p for shares in the market and has extended this offer (in cash) to all shareholders. The revised offer will be open until February 8. EIO has obtained over 50 per cent of St Andrew and does not wish to obtain more than 75 per cent. Accordingly the insurance group is not seeking further acceptances.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Addressing a press conference  in Islamabad today Ministry for Foreign Affairs Sardar Asif  said: "Iran and China have contacted Pakistan at the "highest  level" requesting it not to put its resolution on Kashmir for  voting and have made some proposals."    "These are our close friends and we can't ignore their  requests," he said. "We don't wish to ignore the suggestions of  our friends who have stood by us altogether," he added.    Minister for Information and Broadcasting Khalid Ahmad  Kharal  was also present at the press conference and answered to number  of questions by journalists.    Asif said Iran and China had asked Pakistan not to press for  voting as of total 53 members of the Commission, about 42 or 43  have decided to abstain from voting but, "almost all of them had  condemned human rights abuses in held Kashmir in their bilateral  talks or at the floor of the commission. He said Iran and China  might broker some sort of way out in this respect.    However, Foreign Minister said, "we have achieved our  objective by tabling this resolution and we have succeeded in  awakening the world opinion," he said.    Substantiating his contention, he said almost all the member  countries had expressed their deep concern on the gross human  rights violations being committed by Indian security forces in  held Kashmir either in their bilateral talks with India or at  the floor of the Commission. He said "we have succeeded" in  compelling India to open up the held Kashmir for fact finding  missions. He said a 11- member delegation was currently  visiting Held Kashmir while one from European Community had  already visited the valley, "though we do not agree with its  report."    Information Minister mentioned the statement of American  President Bill Clinton deploring human rights abuses in held  Kashmir. He said European countries had also deplored the  worsening human rights situation in held valley. "It is more  than sufficient for us, it is great achievement of our foreign  policy," he said adding never such a resolution was tabled by  any government in the past. "We, at least, have the courage to  table it," he maintained.    Quoting Finnish Foreign Secretary, currently visiting  Pakistan, Shaharyar said that though his country would not vote  for or against the resolution but "he told us actually Pakistan  had achieved the objective by bringing this issue at frontline."  "We have crossed a very important barrier, we have succeeded in  making it a frontline international issue, now it is away from  back burner," he added.    Sardar Asif said Pakistan would keep on raising Kashmir  issue  at all available international fora to draw the attention of  world community towards worsening human rights situation in held  Kashmir.    Responding to a question, Foreign Minister said Pakistan had  not amended the resolution as reported in a section of the  press. Elaborating the Foreign Secretary said some of the  friends had suggested for some amendments in para 3 of the  resolution calling for the sending of fact-finding mission to  the held valley which had not been accepted.    Sardar Asif thanked Iran for helping Pakistan "achieve the  breakthrough for Kashmiri people" and China and other countries  who had made efforts either on the florr of the UNHCR Commission  [UN High Commission for Refugees] or behind the scene. He  appreciated that Iran, Australia, Columbia and Mexico emphasised  that solution of Kashmir should be found. He said Australian  representative had said he was fully aware of human rights  violations in occupied Kashmir. He said it was noteworthy that  the countries supporting Pakistan represented al the continents.    "The people of Pakistan can look forward to a successful  Foreign policy of Pakistan run by the able leadership," he said.  He congratulated Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto whose endeavour  had led to the success of Pakistan.  *</p>

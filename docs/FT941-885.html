			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Shanghai's Bund seeks pre-revolution glories: Bidding soon for buildings in former financial hub Shanghai will soon auction the stately buildings lining its waterfront, where international and Chinese financial institutions will be bidding for a piece of the city's glorious past. Dubbed the 'sale of the century' by business people, the Shanghai government expects to raise millions of dollars from selling long-term leases for buildings on the Bund, the centre of Chinese finance before the revolution in 1949. Mr Xu Kuangdi, Shanghai's vice-mayor, said tenders would be invited in May for 37 buildings, including the former headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, now used by the municipal government. Shanghai hopes the Bund will again become the country's 'Finance Street', and Mr Xu said the auction was part of the government's commitment to 'playing a role in the international market'. He said that by early next month, a special authority charged with disposing of buildings on the Bund would begin releasing details of sites for sale, including floor space and the leases. Officials have been talking of 50-year leaseholds. Representatives of international financial institutions have been waiting for Shanghai to say how it would dispose of the Bund properties, their facades little changed since the 1949 Communist takeover. Mr Xu said there was no way of predicting the value of Bund real estate, but judging by soaring rents in less desirable locations, prices should be high and could be astronomical. At the last count, 28 foreign banks had opened branches in Shanghai, with another dozen expected by the end of this year. HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citibank are among foreign banks apparently interested in a Bund location, but bank officials are saying little. A HSBC official said that while the bank's old headquarters were 'very prestigious', the building was 'not exactly suitable for the 20th century'. Proceeds from the sale of leases will be used to relocate government institutions from the Bund, and to refurbish Shanghai's crumbling infrastructure. A municipal headquarters is already being built near People's Park, the Shanghai racecourse of pre-revolution days. Mr Xu would like to see the return of the Bank of China, now the foreign currency bank, which was established in 1905 in Shanghai as the Bank of Great Qing, the imperial bank of the Qing Dynasty. But he assured prospective foreign purchasers that Chinese banks would not receive special treatment in the tender process. 'The successful purchasers will be the ones who can pay the highest price,' Mr Xu said. Foreign securities firms to join Shanghai exchange, Page 4</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Democratic Party Chairman Ludovit </F> Cernak by Martin Krno on 15 June; place not given]    [Text] The lunchtime telephone conversation between Jozef  Moravcik and Ludovit Cernak on 9 June shuffled the cards on the  preelection political scene. That is to say, surprisingly, the  National Democratic Party-New Alternative [NDS-NA] stopped  flirting with the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and  started to pat the shoulders of the Democratic Union [DU] in an  amiable manner. Yesterday, we interviewed NDS Chairman Ludovit  Cernak on the reasons for this change.    [Krno] It seemed just a week ago that your electoral  alliance with Jan Carnogursky was already as good as secured.  What contributed to the decision to abandon your preelection  wooing of the KDH?    [Cernak] Politics is the art of compromise and the art of  bargaining. Despite this, we have proceeded in a clear-cut and  fair manner. We stated publicly again and again that we would  be most happy if all five entities in the political center and  right of center were to go into the elections together. Our  next priority was for a centrist policy and, following up on  this, we were willing to consider the KDH offer. The change in  the DU's point of view was a decisive occurrence. We informed  the Christian Democrats of this immediately. The point of view  that strengthening the center will improve the prospects for the  future broad ruling coalition's electoral success is indeed  pragmatic and sensible. The DU is a priority for us; the  political grouping that the Alternative for Political Realism,  the Alliance of Democrats, and the NDS formed in expressing no  confidence in the former government has, naturally, crystallized  as a movement of the center. The public received it positively  on the whole. Therefore, we are pleased that there has been a  change in the DU's point of view. I have to say, however, that  our approach toward the KDH in the talks was correct.    [Krno] You surely asked the DU's representatives what led  them to change their decision because the Union's Republican  Council adopted a resolution recently that it would enter into  the elections independently...    [Cernak] I did not delve into the essentials of why they  changed their mind. I assume that it was their realization of  their responsibility for the policy of the center. After all,  the existence of lots of tiny little parties is nonsense. The  best thing for them would be to merge--and not only two of  them--into a single entity after the elections and formulate a  professional policy with strong support.    [Krno] Into a single entity? As into one party?    [Cernak] Yes.    [Krno] In what form should you enter into the parliamentary  elections with the DU?    [Cernak] The DU has made us an offer that is in fact  technically the same as the KDH offer--this means, opening its  lists of candidates to members of other political entities.    [Krno] As far as the number of elective places are  concerned, will you be in a better position than you were with  the KDH, which offered you the chance of five seats in the  National Council?    [Cernak] We will be in about the same position.    [Krno] On 13 June, when we asked at a Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Deputies' Club briefing what kind of  conclusions they intended to come to with regard to their  colleague Ivan Luptak for his conduct [giving the Nazi salute to  Cernak] in parliament, they said that this was in reaction to  your improper handling of the National Council meeting. Why did  you handle it undemocratically?    [Cernak] I disagree fundamentally with this claim. These  are the twists and turns and excuses of a movement that is  incapable of adopting a tough point of view on the statements  and conduct of its own deputy. I am convinced that this was a  short circuit on the part of Mr. Luptak. However, one has to  pay for short circuits in life and especially in politics. The  HZDS Deputies' Club should distance itself clearly from such  statements made in parliament. I have read the stenographic  record of the meeting carefully. I definitely proceeded in  accordance with the rules of procedure.</p>

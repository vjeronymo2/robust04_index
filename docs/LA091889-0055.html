			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The incidence of drug abuse during pregnancy among middle- and upper-income  women may be widely underestimated, according to a study released at a national  conference on drug abuse and parenting in Miami. Many reports have suggested  the problem is largely confined to poor, urban minority groups. But a study of  715 women who received prenatal care at various public health clinics and  private practices in Pinellas County, Fla., during the first six months of this  year found no significant difference in the rate of drug use during pregnancy  among women at the public clinics that serve a largely indigent population and  those visiting private doctors who cater to upper-income patients.  </P></p>

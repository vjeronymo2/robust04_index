			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY;  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> Breakdown: The Minnesota Twins lost 11 of 12 games before beating Cleveland,  malfunctioning on all fronts. A defense that last year set a major league  record for fewest errors in a season, 84, made 11 in the 12 games, including  five by third baseman Gary Gaetti, who made seven all last year. The offense,  having produced 89 runs in a 9-5 start, produced 31 in the 1-11 collapse.  Starting pitchers were 1-8 in the 12 games and relievers 0-3.  </P> <P> Payroll: With the acquisition of Jesse Barfield, the New York Yankees are  paying five right fielders $4,576,037, including Dave Winfield, who is on the  disabled list, and Gary Ward, who was released. The ledger: Winfield,  $1,958,652; Barfield, $1,015,385; Mel Hall, $875,000; Ward, $607,000, and Bob  Brower, $120,000.  </P> <P> What's in a Name?: Pete and Zane Smith are a combined 0-8 in 12 starts for the  Atlanta Braves while the rest of the rotation is 10-3 in 16 starts. The Braves  are 1-111 over the last two years in games they've trailed after eight innings.  </P> <P> Revolving Door: Alex Madrid faces the Cincinnati Reds today, becoming the  Philadelphia Phillies' ninth starting pitcher this year. Only five times has a  Philadelphia starter gone more than four innings.  </P> <P> Ink-Stained: Texas Ranger outfielder Pete Incaviglia had such hatred for the  University of Texas when he was at Oklahoma State that he once challenged the  entire Longhorn baseball team to a fight. Inky, however, has been no challenge  to a pair of Texas products. He is 0-7 with seven strikeouts against the Boston  Red Sox's Roger Clemens and 0-15 with nine strikeouts against the Cleveland  Indians' Greg Swindell. Manager Bobby Valentine benched Incaviglia Friday night  against Cleveland.  </P> <P> Productive: Pedro Guerrero has driven in 53 runs in 71 games with the St. Louis  Cardinals.  </P> <P> Mismatch: The Oakland Athletics' Mike Moore has a 3-12 career record against  the Toronto Blue Jays, has lost seven in a row to Toronto and is 1-8 in  Exhibition Stadium, where he will never have to pitch again because the Sky  Dome opens next month.  </P> <P> Depth: Ten different pitchers have victories for the A's in their last 12 wins  through Thursday. On another front: the A's have grounded into 33 double plays  and are on a pace to break Boston's major league record of 171. ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

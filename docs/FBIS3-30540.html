			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Poli Vasileva: "Russian Card"] </F>   [Text] Can the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] overcome  the stagnation in Bulgarian-Russian relations? At first glance  the answer is no. There are several reasons for this. The SDS  coalition is not in power and does have the necessary levers to  directly affect official relations with the Kremlin. The  natural anti-Soviet tendencies among the supporters of the blue  [SDS] coalition are interpreted in Moscow by some "well-wishers"  as hatred for the Russian people. The current government is the  hostage of business groups that rely on the chaotic interstate  relations and the paralysis of the Bulgarian Embassy in Moscow,  in which there has been no ambassador for the last two years, in  order to monopolize trade with the former USSR. The suspicion  that KGB structures played an active role in toppling Filip  Dimitrov's government is well-grounded.    Recently, however, one could also observe different  processes. They provide certain commentators sensitive to  Bulgarian-Russian relations with an opportunity to assume that  we could soon see a sharp change in those relations. It is not  very plausible to assume that the Bulgarian neocommunists will  play a fundamental role in this process. Russian President  Boris Yeltsin clearly implied this last year, when he refused to  receive Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. This was a  diplomatic slap in the face not only for the government of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the Movement for Rights and  Freedoms [DPS], but mainly for President Zhelev, who is Berov's  patron.    It was only the SDS that issued a fundamental position  against the participants in the coup against Yeltsin, when the  Russian Parliament was dissolved. This was done without waiting  for a favorable outcome of the events. A bit later reports  emerged about unofficial contacts between SDS figures and  Yeltsin's advisers. Last week it became clear that the talks on  Filip Dimitrov's visit to Russia have made progress. We also  learned that intelligence chief Brigo Asparukhov visited Moscow  with the purpose of foiling the contacts between the blue  coalition and Russia's liberal circles.    After the failure of this mission (General Asparukhov was  recalled to Bulgaria on 21 January before the end of his visit),  three other persons who are very close to President Zhelev --  Ivan Krustev, Deyan Kyuranov, and Evgeniy Daynov -- departed for  Moscow. It is indicative that on this occasion the president  sent more intelligent advisers who do not hide a certain  sympathy for the SDS and its leader.    Will Dimitrov succeed in making a new beginning in  Bulgarian-Russian relations? One should first answer the main  question: Is the "northern bear" prepared to seek friendship  this time rather than control? For the time being everything is  in the realm of initial positive signals. However, it is clear  that the democrats in both countries already understand that the  stagnation in the two countries' relations serves only the  forces of restoration and organized crime.</p>

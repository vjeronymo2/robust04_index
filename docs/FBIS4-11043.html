			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo by "special </F> correspondent" Jorge Luis Velazquez on 15 April in Boston,  Massachusetts]    [Text] [Velazquez] Is the party over now?    [Cavallo] The point is that the current consumption boom  [preceding word in English] will not be permanent. Later it  will return to more moderate levels. A 4 percent consumption  growth rate in a country with a 1.3 percent population growth  rate represents a 2.6 percent consumption growth rate per capita  per year. This trend remains unchanged, even though it is more  moderate. I have never talked about reducing consumption.    [Velazquez] In this case, what brackets of the population  will have to begin moderating their consumption rate?    [Cavallo] The middle income bracket, and especially the high  income bracket, was the one that has benefited greatly from this  wealth effect. Those who earn 500 or 600 pesos are not included  in this bracket. These people consume all they earn. The  middle and high income brackets of the population went overboard  in recent years. Therefore, these brackets will have to become  more austere.    [Velazquez] Isn't there a risk of this formula being  recessive?    [Cavallo] Not at all. Those who say it is necessary to  devalue are the ones who cause a recession. Nevertheless, they  are mistaken from one end to the other. It would never occur to  us to cause this type of consumption reduction. This formula is  neither necessary nor appropriate. It is a Pyrrhic solution to  increase exports by causing a recession.    [Velazquez] Are you planning to levy new taxes on  consumption goods?    [Cavallo] No. We are duly collecting the existing  consumption taxes like IVA [value added tax], income taxes, and  the independent employers' and employees' contributions. These  revenues are more than enough to finance public spending.    [Velazquez] I wanted to know if you actually are planning to  levy new taxes on consumption goods in order to discourage  consumption...    [Cavallo] Well now, these taxes already are acting as an  encouragement for savings. For example, if you are securing a  loan for consumption [goods] you will be paying IVA on the  interest rate. Nevertheless, if the loan is for investment in a  company, you can include this tax in the IVA on sales. There is  already a number of elements in the tax structure, taxing  consumption and not taxing investments and savings. These  fiscal incentives are becoming increasingly significant in  taxpayers' decisions. They did not have a real impact when  taxes were not paid.    [Velazquez] What other measures are you planning to take to  increase savings and discourage consumption?    [Cavallo] We are not thinking in terms of new packages, but  in improving the implementation of measures we already have  announced.    [Velazquez] What measures?    [Cavallo] Everything concerning the fiscal pact's  implementation. For example, the deregulation of professional  fees; the privatization of the electric system, the fresh water  system, and the sewers; the privatization of provincial banks;  the transfer of pension funds to the federal government; the  final removal of gross income and keeping a single tax for  retailers; and the deregulation of construction standards, among  other measures.    [Velazquez] How will you convince the banks to direct their  loans toward investments?    [Cavallo] We have to make sure there will not be any  instrumental bottlenecks for intermediary services in short- and  long-term loans. Short-term loans actually are very costly for  banks because they have to be assessed and implemented many  times. Mid- and long-term loans are assessed once, have good  guarantees, are collected automatically, and do not have to be  constantly rewritten. The operational costs for long-term loans  are lower than loans for consumption [goods].    [Velazquez] And why are the banks not warning about this  point?    [Cavallo] I believe the "economics" of mid- and long-term  loans still are not duly taken into account by the banks because  they attach great importance to the risk of unbacked loans.  Stability by itself is reducing this risk for the banks. And we  will see if we can do something to further reduce this risk and  facilitate the extension of deadlines for the repayment of loans.    [Velazquez] What are you thinking of to achieve this goal?    [Cavallo] Well now (Cavallo ponders), I cannot name a given  mechanism now, but my people are studying experiences from other  countries to find ways of reducing the risk of unbacked mid- and  long-term loans, especially mortgage loans and similar loans.</p>

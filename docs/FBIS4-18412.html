			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Antje Vollmer, top-ranked Alliance 90/Greens </F> Bundestag candidate for Hesse, by Eva Grosskinsky and Herbert  Weber; place and date not given: "`Armies Are Still Needed'"]    [Text] Antje Vollmer:    1943--Born in Luebbecke, Westphalia.    1973--Earned a doctorate in theology. Minor in adult  education.    1984--Elected as caucus spokesperson for the Greens in the  Bundestag. In 1990 turned down another candidacy for delegate.    1994--Running as top-ranked candidate for the Bundestag on  the Hesse land slate.    [FOCUS] Ms. Vollmer, after four years you are returning to  big politics like Phoenix from the ashes. Why?    [Vollmer] People have always known that I love politics. And  Phoenix from the ashes--it was more precisely the rotation  decisions of the Greens that applied in my case.    [FOCUS] What does the Alliance 90/Greens need that you can  provide?    [Vollmer] In their initial phase, the Greens had an  unbelievably large number of concepts and ideas from artists and  intellectuals, universities and churches. I believe I am  especially able to tie these threads together again, to  remobilize lost confidence.    [FOCUS] What are Antje Vollmer's political requirements?    [Vollmer] A fundamental reform plan that will reach to the  end of the millennium has to have at least three themes: a  peaceful order in Europe linked with a liberal immigration law.  Domestically, the central theme is a "cultural revolution of  labor." We need a reassessment of labor and a just distribution  of jobs. The third is an ecological tax reform.    [FOCUS] That will affect people's wallets: trash taxes,  commercial traffic taxes, an increase in petroleum taxes. Hubert  Kleinert has calculated that that would cost a teacher an  additional 1,000 marks a month. How can you sell that in these  times of crisis?    [Vollmer] The general consensus holds that times of crisis  like these make people feel insecure and that society  instinctively moves to the right. I feel differently: Precisely  in these times of crisis, the middle classes of society trust  those who can offer them a real reform debate. I think the gut  feeling among these classes is that things cannot go on this  way. The question is simply this: Do we put the burden on those  now living or do we put the burden on the next generation?    [FOCUS] The fact is, however, that the Greens, because of  their party congress decision on the dissolution of NATO, for  example, are still considered a threat to security and not  capable of forming a coalition. Shouldn't the party congress  have made some headway?    [Vollmer] In the economic and social policy areas and with  regard to immigration legislation, we have taken a giant step  forward. But not in foreign policy. There we have not found the  argument that will persuade the party in its identity. The  Greens are pacifists. But we are not yet clearly aware that  pacifism has redefined itself following the Cold War. It must be  made clear to the party: A pacifist is someone who does not take  up arms; but pacifist policy is one that ensures that no one  takes up arms. To this end, unfortunately, we still need police  and armies.    [FOCUS] We really cannot blame Rudolf Scharping if he  doesn't  want anything to do with red-green--with maximum demands like  abandoning nuclear power, dissolving the Bundeswehr. Is all this  concessions to the party Left?    [Vollmer] In passionate struggles over the years, we have  learned that we have to build a consensus between the wings of  the party. Everyone made mistakes there in the past, including  me. We would do well not to give up on this compromise any more.  And then there are debates over the pace of changes. Here I  belong to those who would like to see a speedy development. But  that is not a rejection of compromise.    [FOCUS] How do you propose to help the left wing reach  coalition compromises?    [Vollmer] Let's look at this in practical terms: Members of  the left wing took part in the government of Lower Saxony. And  Gerhard Schroeder gave them high marks for constructive  politics--even saying that he was able to get his industrial  policy through. At the same time, there is the example of the  environmental and social policy of the Realos in Hesse. Thus two  instances of participation in government by the Greens. Both are  good examples of reliability and constructiveness.    [FOCUS] Do you think the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] under Scharping is capable of sharing your reform plan?    [Vollmer] I think the SPD is capable of that. But I don't  think it is capable of carrying the debate forward in a  sufficiently decisive manner. As far as Scharping is concerned,  my original assessment has changed somewhat. Precisely because  he is not so conceited, I believe that he needs to consider  himself the ideological mind of the reforms, that he is  dependent upon the dialogical nature of politics. This could  offer us a chance.    [FOCUS] Wouldn't it be more logical to concentrate on  opposition politics?    [Vollmer] We are trying for participation in government  because we, most of all, have the power as the draft horse of  reforms. As far as the role of opposition is concerned, we don't  have to prove any longer that we can do that. But opposition  over the long term is also a dumb thing. Instances of the  Greens' participation in government and administration on all  levels were always growth spurts in the Greens' development  program.    [FOCUS] There was a lot of talk at the election convention  about your program, but not about names. Do you have enough  manpower?    [Vollmer] In contrast to the FDP [Free Democratic Party],  with its lack of manpower, the Greens can fall back on all the  extraparliamentary reform manpower going back 25 years in  Federal Republic, as well as on the civil rights activists in  the east.    [FOCUS] With what team could the Greens move into a  government?    [Vollmer] Something has taken place over the past four years  which gives even me, who had meanwhile become very resigned, the  impression that this is a different party. I can only explain  this as a result of the need to adjust to the new issues coming  out of the east. What is important here is that those who helped  most to bring about this change will not disappear.    [FOCUS] Joschka Fischer has chosen you as the prominent  figurehead for the Greens. That could change following critical  reports concerning your naive attitude toward the SED [Socialist  Unity Party of Germany].    [Vollmer] The Greens always held this position toward the  GDR: Maintain contacts with the opposition above all, but--to  the extent possible and necessary--with the government as well.  I can't imagine what could be wrong with that. I find a bit  naive all those who think that we could have talked, thought,  and acted in 1983 or 1984 like we do now, 10 years later.  Neither Mr. Kohl nor Mr. Schaeuble nor the wise Egon Bahr were  able to do that. How much less, then, the Greens. I readily  admit that this is not sufficiently apparent from today's  viewpoint. But it is simply not true that anything was covered  up here. The SED leadership was greatly interested in  influencing the left-wing organizations, the peace movement, and  thus also the Greens. It didn't succeed, for the Greens'  structures were such that they were not at all predictable for  this kind of long-term influence.</p>

Andrew Arczynski to work with the Los Angeles  County Fire Department in drafting an ordinance banning untreated wood shake  roofs and requiring fire-resistant roofs instead.  </P> <P> The council's direction comes a month after a brush fire gutted three Diamond  Bar homes and scorched three others. All of the homes had untreated wood shake  roofs.  </P> <P> A public hearing on the issue will probably be held Dec. 18, City Manager  Robert Van Nort said.  </P></p>

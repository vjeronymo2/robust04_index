			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Economy Minister Jorge Camet reported that  the salaries of public servants will increase by the second half  of 1994. He also announced that the letter of intent with the  IMF, which will be signed in the next few days, will not be  amended. He made this announcement at the end of a meeting of  the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] Economy and Budget  Committee.    Economy Minister Camet attended the CCD Economy and Budget  Committee meeting with Central Reserve Bank President German  Suarez. During the meeting, Camet briefed the congressional  committee on the letter of intent that will be signed with the  IMF.    [Begin recording] [Camet] I think it will be signed in the  next eight days because although legislators have made some  proposals, no one has proposed any major changes. [passage  indistinct] No one has proposed any major changes.    [First unidentified reporter] No one has proposed any  amendments?    [Second unidentified reporter] Will some issues contained in  the letter of intent agreed upon with the IMF be politicized?    [Camet] Well, [name indistinct] has requested the  elimination  of some taxes. We will obviously not do this with the funds  obtained from the privatization process, as these are assets  that could be sold only once, and we must invest this in  production.    [Third unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] any reform  for the time being?    [Camet] No basic amendment. We have heard important  comments, but none of them compel us to adopt any major changes.    [Second reporter] Teachers are staging a strike to demand  better salaries. Will there be another salary increase?    [Camet] A salary increase is feasible for the second half of  the year, depending on the tax revenue we collect, which I hope  will be positive, as I have already mentioned. Teachers and  health workers have nevertheless received major salary  increases, much higher than [words indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

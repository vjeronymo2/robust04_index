			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany seeks 'green' currency meeting GERMANY HAS called for a moratorium on revaluations of the 'green' currency rate at which European Community support prices are translated into D-Marks to protect its farmers from further cuts in earnings. It also wants an emergency meeting of EC agriculture ministers to be called to discuss the operation of the green currency system in the aftermath of the crisis which undermined the community's exchange rate mechanism at the end of last month. Government spokesman Mr Norbert Schaefer told a news conference in Bonn yesterday that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had asked the European Commission and the Belgian EC presidency to suspend revaluations of the green D-Mark pending the emergency meeting. He said Mr Jochen Borchert, Germany's agriculture minister, had requested the council meeting to discuss ways of averting damage to farmers whose national currencies had effectively been revalued as a result of the widening of fluctuation bands for currencies in the ERM to 15 per cent from August 2. A Belgian government official told the Reuter news agency, however, that there would be no emergency meeting this week. 'For the moment there is no reason to call such a meeting,' he said. 'Next week it is possible, but it all depends on the evolution of exchange rates and both the mark and guilder edged down a bit on Tuesday.' Asked if a meeting would be called if there was a drop in German green rates, the official said it was up to Mr Andre Bourgeois, the Belgian farm minister and current president of the EC farm council. But Mr Bourgeois was out of touch on holiday in Italy and had not yet been informed of the German request. A commission official explained, meanwhile, that green rate changes were automatic and could not be suspended by the commission. 'It's an automatic thing,' he said. 'There's nothing we can do about it even if we want to.' 'The (green rate adjustment) regulation is a council regulation. It's up to the ministers if they want to change the regulation.' However, farming industry officials in Brussels said they thought that only the Dutch were likely to back the Germans in seeking a change in the system. They also suggested that Germany was playing to its farm audience rather than expecting any real change in the system.</p>

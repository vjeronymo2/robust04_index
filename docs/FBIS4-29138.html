			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives votes today on a  controversial charter reform motion submitted by Phalang Tham  [PTP] MPs, a crucial decision that could also decide the fate of  hunger striker Chalat Worachat and the Chuan coalition.    The motion was put on the House agenda after the rebel  Phalang Tham MPs who sponsored it won overwhelming support  yesterday from their party colleagues that rendered the  pro-Chuan Phalang Tham leadership helpless. With promised  support from the opposition, the motion is certain to be moved  up the agenda for deliberation today.    A New Aspiration Party source claimed last night Bunchu had  told Chuan that he would resign as deputy prime minister to show  political responsibility.    The report could not be immediately confirmed, but Chuan  called an urgent meeting of coalition leaders before midnight.    Earlier, Bunchu was reported to have apologized to Chuan for  the problems his party had caused the coalition.    Chalat is expected to end his protest if the motion is  passed. But its passage would be a major snub to Prime Minister  Chuan Likphai, who has strongly opposed the "political  intimidation" directed against his government.    Opposition parties will be a decisive factor in the  tumultuous test of strength between Chuan and political action  groups pushing aggressively for a brand new constitution. The  motion needs simple majority support from MPs attending today's  House meeting.    Chuan's Democrat Party yesterday rejected a face-saving  compromise floated by some of the Phalang Tham MPs who sponsored  the motion. They suggested that since the motion calls for the  formation of a House committee to draft a new constitution, a  committee already set up by Parliament President Marut Bunnak to  study political reform should be entrusted with the job if the  motion is passed.    Democrat Spokesman Akhom Engchuan reiterated yesterday that  the democrats would not vote for the notion. But he said  whatever decision was made today by the House, Chalat "must  respect it". Democrat whip Churin Laksanavisit added that it was  unlikely Democrats MPs would be allowed a free vote.    Government whips will meet today to finalize the coalition  stand on the motion before it is debated.    The opposition bloc has pledged considerable support for the  motion although the second biggest party, Chat Phatthana, said  it would vote for the motion only if the MPs who sponsored it  can justify their action. A faction in the Chat Thai Party  vowed to block the motion, so did the tiny Prachakon Thai Party.    The opposition's announcement yesterday of its own motion  seeking political reform strongly indicated the bloc "doesn't  want to miss the democratic train," observers said.    Social Action Secretary-General Chaloem Yubamrung said  yesterday the opposition would vote for the Phalang Tham motion    Prime Minister Chuan last night emphasized his belief the  current pro-reform campaign was directed at his Democrat Party.  But he was adamant that a House dissolution was not a way out  of the crisis.    Asked if he would dissolve the House if the opposition  joined  with Phalang Tham to pass the motion, Chuan said: "It (House  dissolution) is still very far off."    Chuan yesterday discussed the political situation with the  Phalang Tham leadership, including Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu  Rotchanasathian and Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri,  Communications Minister Winai Somphong, and Deputy Interior  Minister Chamni Sakdiset.    An informed source said Democrat leaders who had been  analysing the political situation believed a House dissolution  was inevitable if the Phalang Tham motion was passed today.    Chuan and other Democrat leaders went into a huddle with  Phalang Tham leaders again at Parliament about 7 o'clock last  night. A source who attended the meeting quoted Bunchu as  expressing deep regret to Chuan for "having let Phalang Tham  cause so many problems."    Bunchu also told Chuan to "wait and see what will happen" if  the Phalang Tham motion was passed by Parliament, according to  the source. It was not known if Bunchu was hinting he would  resign or pull Phalang Tham out of the coalition to allow Chuan  to bring in an opposition party in a Cabinet reshuffle.    Rumours abounded yesterday about the Democrats "approaching"  two major opposition parties -- Chat Thai and Chat Phatthana.  Chat Thai leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha called an urgent meeting  yesterday evening with deputy party leaders, said Chat Tha  spokesman Pratuang Wichanpricha who admitted that he did not  know what the meeting was all about.    Some Democrat MPs compared Phalang Tham with the Democrat  Party six years ago when Democrat rebels doomed the Prem  government by violating a coalition resolution on a copyright  amendment. They said Phalang Tham would "owe the people an  explanation" if the government crumbled as a result of the  controversial motion.    An estimated 10,000 people turned up in front of Parliament  yesterday to join a pro-Chalat rally. Leading reformists have  already declared victory, voicing confidence that the motion  would be surely passed.    But considering Chalat's initial demands, passage of the  motion could be just the beginning of another painstaking  process that might bring the whole episode back to square one,  observers said.    Chalat started his hunger strike after the opposition and  Senate joined hands to kill proposed constitutional amendments  drawn up by an ad hoc House committee. But the emotional  campaign and the Democrats' tough stand against "political  intimidation" soon spiralled into an antigovernment crusade with  opposition MPs joining the fray and supporting the radical  reformists.    The government has pointed out that there is one question  that the pro-Chalat side has tried to avoid: Will Chalat resume  his fast if the Phalang Tham motion fails to produce  satisfactory motion?</p>

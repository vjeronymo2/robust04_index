The motion, a copy of which was made available to KYODO NEWS  SERVICE, appears only days before Hosokawa begins a three-day  visit to Beijing Saturday, his first as Japan's top leader.    The document clearly states the strong dissatisfaction of  the  Chinese victims of Japanese wartime aggression, while demanding  a formal apology and compensation from Hosokawa.    Signed by a 32-member delegation from Hubei Province and led  by Liu Napeng, the motion declares that despite the Chinese  agreement to give up demands for war reparations in the  Japanese-Chinese joint declaration of 1972, Chinese victims  still have the right to be compensated for civilian losses.    The document claims more than 10 million Chinese victims  were  savagely murdered by Japanese forces during the so-called  "Nanjing massacre" alone, causing over 300 billion dollars in  economic losses.    The motion appeared at the NPC in 1992 on the eve of the  "historic" visit of Japanese Emperor Akihito, but authorities  refused to act at the time, due to political considerations.    The drafters of the document say the time is now ripe to  demand payment for war losses, as many Japanese already support  Hosokawa's position on apologizing for Japan's war behavior and  the new government and the Social Democratic Party have taken a  positive attitude toward compensating civilian victims of  Japanese war crimes.    Besides asking Hosokawa to apologize and promise war  compensation to Chinese victims, other demands include the  establishment of a committee for civil compensation from Japan,  which would include Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and overseas  Chinese, the acknowledgement and publication of a legal basis  for demanding payment from Japan, and an open and published  denunciation of Japanese aggression and war crimes.    The document also says the right to formally register the  victims should belong to the Chinese Government and that  Japanese yen loans should also be used to compensate victims.    While visiting Japan in 1992, Chinese party secretary Jiang  Zemin, now also the nation's president, indicated that the  Chinese Government would not interfere with demands for civilian  compensation. This has led to an increase in such demands.</p>

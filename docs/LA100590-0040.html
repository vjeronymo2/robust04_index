			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRESCENTA VALLEY WINS BEHIND RARE PITCH FROM MILLER  </P> <P> Brett Miller spends most of his time catching passes for the Crescenta Valley  High football team. But Thursday night, he found himself throwing one, a  21-yard scoring strike to Ray Grijalva that gave the Falcons a  come-from-behind, 7-6 victory over Burroughs in a nonleague game at Glendale  High.  </P> <P> The scoring play, which came with 56 seconds left in the third quarter, capped  a nine-play, 65-yard drive and followed Burroughs' only score of the game.  Quarterback Aaron Schaefer pitched the ball to running back Jason Schwaiger,  who flipped it to Miller coming around on a reverse. Miller, the Falcons'  leading receiver, then hit Grijalva, who had to come back for the ball on the  one-yard line. Grijalva took it in from there for the score.  </P> <P> Eric Steinlight's point-after was the margin of victory.  </P> <P> "It was a shot in the dark," Crescenta Valley Coach Jim Beckenhauer said.  "Burroughs was playing tough defense and we had to make something happen. We  had to use a gimmick to beat them tonight."  </P> <P> Burroughs (0-5) had taken the lead when Steve Garza scored on a seven-yard run  with 6 minutes 23 seconds left in the third quarter. The touchdown was set up  when Marco Cecena intercepted a Schaefer pass at the Crescenta Valley 32. Eddie  Gavilan missed the conversion kick.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley is 3-2.  </P></p>

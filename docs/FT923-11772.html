			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Arts: Holt and Dillon - London Promenade Concerts NEW works are distributed unevenly through this year's Proms. There are nine premieres promised altogether, and after just five days there have been first performances of works by James Dillon and Simon Holt, while the next week or so offers four more, from Tavener, Casken, Bennett and Goehr. It promises to be a highly varied clutch of novelties, and certainly expectations were bountifully rewarded on Tuesday, when Holt's viola concerto was introduced by the indefatigable Nobuko Imai, with the BBC Philharmonic conducted by Yan Pascal Tortelier. Borrowing its title from an artwork by Richard Long, walking with the river's roar takes Holt's development forward in a giant stride. It contains music of great power and expressive range within a consistently inventive and highly charged 20-minute span. The work has had a protracted history; it began life as a piano concerto, settled down as a piece for viola and orchestra but even then was discarded and begun again. Along the way it was transmuted into a memorial work, a tribute to Holt's father who died while he was a teenager, and coloured also by the death three years ago of Michael Vyner, artistic director of the London Sinfonietta and one of Holt's most fervent champions. That sense of loss permeates the score, though never in an explicitly elegiac way. It emerges more as a scarcely controlled rage in the writing for the solo viola, whose lines are full of fierce multiple stops and harsh repetitions, and in the dark, threatening sonorities that cluster about it from an orchestra which contains no violins or bassoons, as if to leave a space around the viola. As the solo sonority teeters on the brink of extinction, threading its way through the hostile musical landscape, the 'river's roar' perhaps of the title, it creates a powerful central image, with other figures and details flitting in and out of focus through the work. Attention is held unwaveringly by the lines of force between all these elements and by the sharp originality of Holt's inventions. On first acquaintance, walking with the river's roar seems a richly endowed work, which asks searching musical questions of itself, yet answers them all triumphantly. On Monday, the premiere of Dillon's ignis noster had been wedged between the First Symphony of Sibelius and Strauss's Four Last Songs in the BBC Symphony Orchestra's programme, conducted by Alexander Lazarev. Dillon's title is an alchemical one, and the idea of transmutation by fire seems to provide the 20-minute piece with its principal, Skryabin-like metaphor, if not with any detailed programme. The musical argument is essentially abstract, dense and many-layered, full of accumulations of fierce, rhetorical gestures. There are few moments of respite, though towards the close the textures tended to congeal in larger-scale events; ideas are hurled out at a formidable rate, and tended towards a congested effect, far from the lucid planning of some of Dillon's most recent instrumental pieces. Whether a less excitable performance might uncover a clearer structural scheme remains to be heard.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON GETS WELL BY DOWNING MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE, 77-69  </P> <P> By the time Cal State Fullerton made it to Wyoming's wide-open spaces, the  Titans were a sick-and-tired team.  </P> <P> They were sick with all manner of ailments. And they were tired, not only from  their 13-hour trip from Fullerton.  </P> <P> They also were tired of losing, after ruining their 5-0 start with a 29-point  loss to Colorado State and a 12-point loss to UCLA.  </P> <P> Coach John Sneed, still ailing from the flu, was worried.  </P> <P> "They say a team is a reflection of its coach," Sneed said before the Titans  played Middle Tennessee State in the first round of the Cowboy Shootout. "If  they play like I feel, we're in trouble."  </P> <P> Instead, the Titans' 77-69 victory over the Blue Raiders in the Casper Events  Center Friday night proved just the tonic.  </P> <P> "For the moment, a win makes everyone on the team feel better," Sneed said  after the Titans dispatched Middle Tennessee State. Fullerton took a 15-2 lead  at the outset and never trailing, although the Blue Raiders made several runs.  </P> <P> Fullerton's balance had seemed dangerously close to coming undone the night  before, at a practice at which leading scorer Cedric Ceballos took an elbow to  the eye that opened a cut requiring stitches.  </P> <P> At the same practice, reserve Ron Caldwell and Sneed had verbal exchanges that  resulted in Caldwell being on the bench in street clothes Friday. And starting  center John Sykes, who practiced sparingly, realized he wouldn't be able to  start because his eyes remain red, irritated by a reaction to eyedrops.  </P> <P> But Fullerton pulled it together against Middle Tennessee State, a team that  has played in a postseason tournament in each of the past five years, but is  off to a 4-4 start with a young team this season.  </P> <P> "We had been in a rut," Sneed said. "We've had three or four bad practices,  whether it was the flu, injuries or internal things with a couple of players.  There's nothing like a win to get you hugging in the locker room again. It was  a good win on the road, against a good team and a quality coach."  </P> <P> Ceballos is making a habit of strong second-half performances. He had three  points at halftime, making one of only four field goal attempts. But he  finished with 22 points and 16 rebounds, 11 of them in the second half.  </P> <P> Sneed said Ceballos' apparent penchant for the second half is partly a result  of the extra attention other teams pay him.  </P> <P> "Cedric is a marked man," Sneed said. "He's had a lot of national attention,  and probably the most important thing the other coach is talking about is how  to stop Cedric."  </P> <P> Ceballos, who at times has endured very poor halves as he tried to find his  shooting touch, said he was more patient against Middle Tennessee State.  </P> <P> "Usually I just keep putting it up," he said. "But it was time to relax and let  it come slowly. It's just a slump I'm trying to get off my back. When the shots  aren't dropping, I just try to rebound and take my shots closer in to the  basket. You can't really have a slump when you're shooting layups."  </P> <P> Mark Hill, who scored 19 for Fullerton, has been picking up the slack for  Ceballos, averaging 23 points over the past five games and leading the Titans  in scoring in the last four before Friday.  </P> <P> "We're trying basically to complement each other," Hill said. "If one's not  doing the job, the other one tries to bring him out."  </P> <P> Wayne Williams added 13 for Fullerton. Agee Ward scored eight, and senior  center David Moody, playing in place of Sykes and Aaron Wilhite, who had foul  trouble, scored seven points, playing his best game of the season.  </P> <P> Middle Tennessee State never let Fullerton turn the game into a blowout though,  trimming the lead to as few as three points and trailing by just seven with  1:25 left.  </P> <P> Fullerton will meet Wyoming (6-4), a 73-66 winner over Northeast Louisiana, in  the tournament championship game tonight at 8.  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Coach John Sneed says Ron Caldwell will dress for tonight's game and will be  permitted to play. Caldwell was held out Friday for disciplinary reasons. . . .  Cedric Ceballos' 16 rebounds against Middle Tennessee State was the  second-highest total of his college career. He had 20 against San Jose State  last season.  </P></p>

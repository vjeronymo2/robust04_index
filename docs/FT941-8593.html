			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Tame CPI figures spark rally in US Treasuries A tame reading on consumer prices sparked a rally in the US Treasury market early yesterday morning, but bonds gave back most of their gains when a regional report on business activity suggested inflation was on the rise. By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up just  1/32 at 97 1/4 , after climbing as high as 97 7/8 earlier in the session. The yield slipped to 6.455 per cent. At the short end of the yield curve, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/32 , with the yield holding at 4.404 per cent. Prices at the long end of the curve surged after the Labor Department revealed that its consumer price index was unchanged last month, while prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors were up a mere 0.1 per cent. The results were a pleasant surprise for the market, which was expected a 0.3 per cent rise in both statistics. The data was a powerful indication that inflation, which undermines the value of fixed-rate securities, stayed well under control in January. The jubilant mood, however, was short-lived, as contradictory evidence on inflation surfaced during mid-morning. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said the prices paid by manufacturers in the region had increased sharply, with the so-called prices-paid index in its February business outlook survey climbing to 30.4 in February, from 25.7 the previous month. The news caused the long bond to turn in its tracks and retreat to near its opening level. The market apparently took no comfort in a slight decline in overall business activity, nor in the possibility that harsh winter weather could have introduced distortions into the data. The sudden shift was partially explained by the failure of retail accounts to re-enter the market after the favourable CPI data, as they had been expected to do. Trading was confined to dealers and speculative accounts, and the lack of liquidity appeared to have exaggerated the price swings.</p>

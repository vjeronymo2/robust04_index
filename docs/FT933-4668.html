			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Interest in corporate capital increases after publication of Lloyd's business plan AFTER the publication of Lloyd's business plan in April interest in corporate capital appeared to be greatest in the US. There a number of investment banks examined the possibility of private placements of investment funds among institutional investors, venture capitalists and rich individuals. JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers have both been working on schemes to raise corporate capital for nearly a year, for example. Morgan has linked up with Marsh McLennan and Salomon with Johnson &amp; Higgins, two large insurance brokers which place considerable amounts of business at Lloyd's. More recently UK merchant banks have also become involved. Partly because of the relatively small size of the venture-capital market, UK banks have tried to develop investment trusts or companies which would be listed as quoted vehicles on the Stock Exchange and marketed to institutional and retail investors. Barclays de Zoete Wedd is understood to have agreed to underwrite the launch of Corporate Lloyd's Membership, an investment company or trust sponsored by the Sedgwick Group, one of the UK's largest insurance brokers. Samuel Montagu, which together with James Capel, another Hongkong and Shanghai Bank subsidiary, is backing a separate investment company of some Pounds 250m, has received most publicity. Montagu and Capel are supporting a scheme which would channel capital through at least eight managing agents at Lloyd's. Most UK merchant banks are also involved. Rea Brothers has linked with UBS to back a Pounds 35m scheme; SG Warburg, which advised Lloyd's on its plan to attract corporate investors, is involved in a separate plan; while Lazards and Kleinwort Benson are supporting initiatives by two other agents, Octavian and Sturge Holdings respectively. In other deals Phoenix Securities, a London-based 'boutique' securities house, has linked with Anton Members' Agency and the New York securities house Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.</p>

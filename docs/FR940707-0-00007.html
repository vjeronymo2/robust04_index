			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators is estimated to be between $3,245 and $6,490. This total cost impact figure is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of the Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

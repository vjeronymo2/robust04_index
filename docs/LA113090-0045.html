			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GILLESPIE JUDGESHIP  </P> <P> It was insulting, to say the least, to learn that our governor is apparently  embarking on rewarding loyalty with a judgeship for Roxani Gillespie at the end  of his term ("Prospect of Gillespie Judgeship Stirs Fight," Part A, Nov. 15).  It wasn't enough that she was appointed as the insurance commissioner in the  first place, but now we probably will be forced to continue to endure her  ineptness.  </P> <P> Gillespie's demonstrated inability to enforce the law over an extended period  clearly suggests that this lack of performance could only be anticipated on the  bench. At times she appeared to be totally lost in the performance of her job.  </P> <P> The citizens of California deserved better than Gillespie as the insurance  commissioner and most assuredly now as a Superior Court judge. As the insurance  commissioner, we insured had little relief to none as evidenced in the Prop.  103 debacle, which I lay directly at her doorstep. Her decision not to run for  office may well have been orchestrated by the governor. After all, why suffer  an expensive and humiliating defeat when a choice plum would be just handed to  you?  </P> <P> MARWIN H. GONSIOR  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

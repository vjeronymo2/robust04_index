			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: EASY TO GET BUY IN PUERTO VALLARTA  </P> <P> This quaint and popular city is known equally for sun, surf and shopping.  </P> <P> El Centro, however, has the most charming and reasonable shops.  </P> <P> They are clustered along streets that run parallel to the beach, mostly north  of the Rio Cuale that runs through Puerto Vallarta.  </P> <P> On the boardwalk, Paseo Diaz Ordaz, there are dozens of shops with trendy,  casual and beach attire.  </P> <P> Best are ACA JOE (No. 588) and Ruben Torres (No. 590), which have their own  lines of attractive slacks (from $20 U.S.), shirts (from $15), shorts (from  $15) and tank tops (from $8) in lightweight cottons and lively tropical colors.  </P> <P> At No. 880 is a small mall with several handcraft shops. Best of these is La  Otra Galeria, with inexpensive watercolors and oil paintings by Mexican  artists, plus signed prints by Lepe, a popular artist, for about $100.  </P> <P> The next street inland is Morelos. The Designer's Bazaar (No. 500) sells  Vercellino's lovely and lavish cotton jersey clothing.

Based on  traditional Indian attire, Josefa's handwoven cotton caftans, dresses and  separates are beautifully embroidered and trimmed with ribbons of contrasting  colors.  </P> <P> Ever since Josefa was "discovered" by the film crew who came to shoot "Night of  the Iguana" in Puerto Vallarta in 1963, her glorious fashions have been  adorning the rich and famous. Prices about $250 and up per long dress or  caftan.  </P> <P> Gucci (corner of Iturbide) has fashionable shoes, handbags, golf bags,  briefcases, wallets and other accessories. Prices are reasonable, but these are  Mexican-made unauthorized copies or facsimiles of Gucci products.  </P> <P> In the heart of El Centro, Cuale Island (in the middle of Rio Cuale) has dozens  of outdoor selling stalls and the colorful Mercado Municipal. This is the place  to find inexpensive handcrafts of all sorts.  </P> <P> Prices quoted in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of  writing.  </P></p>

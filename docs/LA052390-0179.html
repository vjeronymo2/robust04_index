			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRONCOS' ELWAY NOT SURE IF HE'LL PLAY OUT CONTRACT  </P> <P> John Elway, just a month shy of his 30th birthday, says he doesn't know if he  will fulfill the four years remaining on the six-year, $12.7-million contract  he signed in September, 1987.  </P> <P> "I don't know," Elway told The Denver Post when asked if he planned to play  through the end of his contract with the Denver Broncos. The Post interview was  published in today's editions.  </P> <P> "I'm giving you a serious answer. I'm just taking it year-by-year right now. It  all depends on how everything goes."  </P> <P> Although he does not know how much longer he will play, he said he has not  thought about when he may retire.  </P> <P> "I'm not planning on retiring," Elway said. "If you ask me if I'm thinking  about that, the answer is no."  </P> <P> Elway turns 30 on June 28, and he would be 33 after the 1993 season, when his  contract expires.  </P> <P> When Elway signed the six-year contract, he was the highest-paid player in NFL  history, but he now ranks no higher than seventh in the league.  </P> <P> He said he is not concerned about the situation because of his close  relationship with team owner Pat Bowlen.  </P> <P> "It's not going to hold me out or anything," he said. "I would never do  anything like that to Mr. Bowlen. Yeah, I've thought about Jeff George getting  what he got ($2.5 million per year compared to Elway's $2.12 million). But  that's as far as it's gone. It's not going to be a stumbling block or anything  like that."  </P> <P> Bowlen said earlier this year that he would make sure Elway's contract fell  into line with the highest-paid players in the league sometime in the future.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Bowlen told The Post, "Nothing has changed from what I said a  couple of months ago. John and I know what's going on in the league. John still  has four years left on his contract, but John and I understand each other.  </P> <P> "Maybe 12 to 18 months from now, we'll sit down and talk about it. You can't  always be the highest-paid guy all the time. I think John understands that.  Those things happen. I don't think John is worried about it, and I know I'm not  worried about it."  </P></p>

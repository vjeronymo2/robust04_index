			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (11): Power for the people - The widening quest for energy sources POWER CUTS periodically show that Pakistan cannot meet the energy needs of a rapidly growing consumer market and industry. While the government has given fresh incentives to set up factories, providing investment in transportation and energy is also needed. In energy, Pakistan is seeking private sector investments in new electricity projects and oil and gas production. Industrial entrepreneurs are allowed to set up their own generation plants but that adds to the cost of new projects. Electricity generating capacity is projected to rise to 9,356 megawatts by the middle of next year, but demand is expected to rise to 11,000 MW by 1995. The supply is currently estimated to fall 10 to 15 per cent below demand depending on the output of hydro electric schemes which rely on rainfall. The government has let the private sector set up independent power plants to help meet the shortfall. Fresh measures have also been announced to increase production of petroleum, as the country produces 65,000 barrels of oil per day but needs to import about 170,000 b/d. Last year fresh incentives were introduced to stimulate exploration and refining. The government has promised to process applications for exploration licences within three months of submission. In the past, approvals have taken up to three years. Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, hopes there will be a surge in private power projects given the size of the country's population. 'In this expanding market, efficient generation of power is required. With privatisation, we expect to get the investment. Very few markets are that large and offer opportunities for investment', he says. Pakistan also sees opportunities for importing power, oil and gas from the newly independent central Asian republics and Afghanistan. An agreement has been signed with Tajikistan for the supply of 1,000 MW for which new transmission lines will be built. Imports of gas from Afghanistan and Turkmenistan will also be studied, and recent oil discoveries in Uzbekistan raise the possibility of importing oil from that country. All these proposals are fraught with difficulties, however. Energy investments will be repaid only in the long term. Although the population is rising, prosperity will also have to rise to ensure a bigger energy consumption. In spite of the inducements for oil and gas exploration, some businessmen believe that crime and violence, especially in remote areas of the southern province of Sindh, are a barrier to new exploration projects. The government has said it will set up a special force to protect oil installations, but it remains to be seen if that will reassure potential investors. Prospects for importing energy from central Asia depend on future events in Afghanistan. Pakistani officials who support the country's central Asian initiatives argue that the intra-mujahideen infighting in Kabul is likely to die down in the next two or three years, the time frame needed to begin establishing some of the projects. But no-one knows how long it will take before peace and stability are restored to Afghanistan. A durable peace there may be the key to Pakistan's central Asian strategy and its ability to draw on that region to meet its energy needs.</p>

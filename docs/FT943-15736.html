			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: US sellers of Pru Prudential, the UK's biggest insurance group, was among the FT-SE 100's poorest performers following news that AM Best, the US insurance ratings agency, had lowered its rating for Jackson National, Prudential's US subsidiary. The agency cut the rating because of the interest rate-sensitive and limited nature of Jackson's products. The stock fell 6 to 294p, with much of yesterday's turnover of 9.1m said to have been carried out by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. The weakness was in stark contrast to most of the other life assurance stocks, which responded to a recent buy recommendation from Morgan Stanley. The house said the smaller companies had been left behind and would outperform. Britannic rose 14 to 421p, Refuge 6 to 286p and United Friendly 33 to 523p. Lloyds Abbey held at 342p after an agency cross of 3.2m shares. Dixons, the stores and property group, climbed sharply on the release of full-year figures but some analysts reined in their enthusiasm, arguing that the price move did not reflect a return to the good times. The group profit of Pounds 73.3m was in line with analysts' forecasts and, more significantly, there were no shocks from exceptional costs. The 6.6p dividend was also marginally higher than most forecasts. Analysts lifted current year forecasts by about Pounds 8m to between Pounds 85m and Pounds 100m. But some said there had been significant short selling ahead of the figures and argued that yesterday's jump of 19 to 189p merely reflected traders buying shares back again. J. Sainsbury shed 6 to 396p after the agm statement. Analyst Mr Bill Myers at Yamaichi said there was nothing worrying in the statement and the selling of the shares was possibly a bit overdone. The company said sales were up by 7.1 per cent, in line with City forecasts. Publishing and media stocks held firm, receiving support from the latest advertising figures, which had begun to leak into the market towards the close of trading. The Advertising Association reported that the first quarter of the financial year saw real spending growth spurt ahead by 8 per cent. This prompted the association to raise its growth forecast for the year to 13 per cent, from 10 per cent previously, suggesting total advertising expenditure of Pounds 7.7bn. The upbeat forecasts provided a welcome balm to newspapers suffering a crippling price war. Mirror Group Newspapers, which faces severe competition from a cut-price Sun and also has a 40 per cent stake in the Independent, gained 3 at 131p. The Telegraph, which recently cut its cover price to 30p, bounced 2 to 357p. Among the agencies, which account for about 15 per cent of total spending, Gold Greenlees Trott and Abbott Mead Vickers held at 177p and 664p respectively. Pharmaceuticals issues were supported by the after-effect of continued US buying. Glaxo was 12 higher at best and closed 4 up at 559p. There was further assistance from news that the company had received permission to manufacture and market a nasal drug, Flixonase, in Japan. Taunton Cider sparkled with a rise of 12 to 162p after improved profits of Pounds 20m and stating that since the start of the year it had reversed inroads made into its business by launching aggressive promotions and cost-cutting which had left its own operating margin untouched. British Airways was one of the best performers in the FT-SE 100 as it continued to benefit from better than expected traffic figures reported on Tuesday. The shares added 11 at 403p on 6.5m traded. NatWest Securities urged investors to buy the stock. Morgan Crucible tumbled 16 to 326p on reports that Cazenove was negative. Other statistics, Page 45</p>

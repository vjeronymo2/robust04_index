			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Yesterday, President Itamar Franco  threatened to use the antitrust law, which provides for prison  sentences, to prevent supermarkets from making abusive price  increases. Presidential spokesman Fernando Costa said: "The  government will not permit any incitement to civil disobedience  like that suggested by Levy Nogueira, president of Abram  (Brazilian Supermarkets Association)." Yesterday, Nogueira  reaffirmed his earlier remarks that the prices of 10 percent of  the products sold in supermarkets will have to be marked up due  to the effects of the end of the harvest season. He denied,  however, having called for civil disobedience.    Costa said: "The president has emphasized that supermarkets  will not mark up their prices, as the government will use  existing legal mechanisms to discourage this type of crime  against the public economy." President Franco has called for a  meeting with Justice Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat and legal  adviser Geraldo Magela Quintao to discuss the subject tomorrow.  Last night, Dupeyrat ordered that Nogueira's companies -- the  Epa supermarkets in Belo Horizonte -- be monitored. Commenting  on Nogueira's remarks, a friend of Franco's, who was at Planalto  Palace yesterday, said: "The president was stunned by such a  display of brazenness."    Franco called Costa into his office yesterday morning during  a meeting he was holding with Dupeyrat. Franco said: "The  government will adopt measures that will in no way allow  supermarket prices to be marked up, such as was proposed by Mr.  Levy Nogueira." Late in the morning, before leaving Planalto  Palace to have lunch at Alvorada Palace, Franco asked Costa if  he had released the presidential message to the press.    Nogueira learned about the president's reaction from  reporters in Rio de Janeiro shortly before attending a meeting  between supermarket representatives and Finance Ministry special  adviser Jose Milton Dallari. Showing first surprise and then  tension, Nogueira charged the press with giving a sensationalist  tone to his remarks and denied having called for civil  disobedience. He said: "The reports distorted my remarks, as  there are always price adjustments in any stable economy." He  added: "I have not talked about price markups because 90 percent  of the supermarket prices have already been adjusted."    Mogueira confirmed, however, that nearly 700 products of  medium-sized supermarkets and 1,500 products of large  supermarkets will be adjusted under the real. "Beef and coffee  prices are rising in URV's [real value units]," he said. He  stated, however, that there will be a declining trend for the  prices of manufactured products in July because the current  industrial prices are padded.    Other supermarket representatives who attended the meeting  with Dallari also conveyed surprise at Franco's remarks. Aylton  Fornari, president of the Rio de Janeiro State Association of  Supermarkets (Asserj), said: "The government may not tolerate  price abuses, but supermarkets are being forced to tolerate the  disobedience of government officials who issue currency without  due backing." Upon leaving the meeting, Dallari, who was  recently rebuked by the president for stating his opposition to  the rules for converting school tuition into URV's, said  tersely: "I agree with the president: He is right."</p>

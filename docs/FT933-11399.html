			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cemex slides 11% to Dollars 255m at halfway CEMENTOS Mexicanos (Cemex), the Mexican cement company, reported net profits of 797.3m new pesos (Dollars 255m) in the first half of the current year, an 11.1 per cent fall in real terms compared to the same period last year, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. However, if stock market transactions were excluded, profits would have been 634m pesos - 36 per cent more than last year. Operating profits rose to 1.1bn new pesos, from 888m new pesos in the 1992 first half. Cemex benefited from continued growth in Mexico's construction market, with volumes of cement and concrete sales up 9 and 14 per cent respectively. Total sales reached 4.39bn pesos.</p>

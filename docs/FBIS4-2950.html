			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Cui Weiwei (1508 1550 1550): "The Province </F> Achieves Remarkable Results in Building Highway Networks"]    [Excerpt] After three years of construction, Liaoning  Province has achieved obvious results in building highway  networks. The 3,254 projects concerning highway networks  planned by the province for the past three years have all been  completed, 6,020 km of road surface has been asphalted, 2,296  bridges have been extended by 64,056 meters, and 4,643 km of  roadbeds have been rebuilt. Meanwhile, all province-renowned  mountains, such as Fengchengqujia, Daling, and Xiuyanbeidaling,  that blocked the traffic for a long time in the past, have all  been got through. The province has also put an end to the  history of there being no bridges on 898 rivers. Construction of  the main highway framework has been under way in an all-around  manner. Construction of the Shenyang-Benxi, the  Shenyang-Tieling, the Shenyang Around-the-city expressways will  be completed and open to traffic by 1 October 1995. The  pre-phase work for the construction of Shenyang-Shanhaiguan  Expressway is under full swing.    As demanded by the provincial road traffic situation and by  the economic layout, the province defined the strategic goal of  building highway networks beginning 1991. It is also decided  that at the late stage of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, the  province will complete the building of the Shenyang-Dalian, the  Shenyang-Siping, the Shenyang-Dandong, and the  Shenyang-Shanhaiguan high-class highways as well as the Shenyang  Orbital Expressway and the Shenyang coastal high-class highway.  Meanwhile, on the basis of initially erecting the main highway  framework that links up various cities with high-class highways,  the province will comprehensively build highways in various  counties and townships. All counties and townships will be  linked up with asphalted highways to form a network and then  cars will be able to directly drive from counties and townships  to expressways. Thanks to the construction in the first three  years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, the provincial  highway network has become perfect day by day, and the general  quality of the network has improved remarkably. Comparing the  end of 1993 to the late stage of the Seventh Five-Year Plan  period, the total mileage of highways increased by 1,529 km,  high-class and less-high-class pavement increased by 5,210 km,  bridges extended by 70,000 meters, the highway density rose from  27.5 km for per 100 square km to 28.54 km, and the mileage  available for trafficking despite rainfalls increased from  29,690 km to 34,317 km. Among the 43 land counties, the counties  linked up with others through asphalted highways rose from 6 to  9. Meanwhile, the townships and towns accessible by the  oil-transporting roads increased from 662 to 844, and the  villages accessible by highways increased from 14,620 to 14,909  in number.

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / US World Cup planners await the barbarian hordes: As the fences go up, Jurek Martin prepares for his past to be scrutinised The World Cup is still a month off and the English are not coming, but already the US, a nation not unfamiliar with violence, is battening down the hatches against soccer mayhem. A series of solemn announcements from the organising committee has given the impression that the US fears the worst. Much ridiculed and probably widely to be disobeyed, they include: The erection of riot fences separating the crowd from the field of play at several venues, including the RFK Stadium in Washington, home of the American football Redskins. Tight restrictions on the sale of alcohol before and during matches, with a two-beer limit per customer, no vendors walking through the seats and no sales after half-time. Reporters must sign a waiver permitting background investigations by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, without which they will not get necessary credentials. The intent, apparently, is to root out terrorists with press passes, though the effect may be to reduce media coverage to even lower visibility. The domestic response has ranged between fury and amusement. Several prominent US news organisations have mounted the high civil liberties horse and said they will have no truck with the waiver (your FT correspondent, a known professional agitator, signed the waiver confident that his tracks were well covered). The managers of RFK stadium said they would stick with their standard alcohol sale policy, which is liberal. A Redskins game traditionally features extended parking-lot 'tailgate' parties before kick-off, followed by a mad scramble to beat the traffic jams afterwards. Sporting violence is not unknown in the US, even in baseball, the cerebral sport, but it is mostly confined to players and to fan celebrations which get out of control after a team has won a championship. Comfortable all-seat stadiums, with sometimes decent food and drink, tend not to stir crowd's blood beyond a bit of yelling and Mexican waving. Soccer's bad reputation, however, is not confined to stories from abroad. In California, a schools league this year banned the traditional post-game handshake between players because the ceremony often degenerated into the trading of spitting, insults and fistfights. Only the other day, the Washington Post reported that the coach and most of a local suburban high school team had been suspended after getting into a brawl with a visiting Russian side towards the end of a particularly foul-filled match. But the last word in ridicule on the riot fences was surely provided by the Post's Tony Kornheiser: 'Why not a moat, stocked with piranhas?' he asked. 'Or heads up on spikes?' Of course, he understood that the terrible foreigners due to play in DC were different. With the Dutch 'it's the wooden shoes that cut off the circulation to their brains. . . Van Gogh sliced off his ear at a soccer game'. The Norwegians 'go berserk all the time in the summer' from 'hormonal rush', having spent the rest of the year frozen. The 'phlegmish' Belgians 'will probably sell us poisoned waffles'. When the Saudis riot 'they claim it's a religious experience'. The Italians 'cruise our streets indiscriminately, pinching women and weepily singing opera'. Now the Mexicans have 'got money from Nafta, they'll get here and go crazy'. The fence, Mr Kornheiser concluded, 'is a bad symbol and a bad idea. Dump it.'</p>

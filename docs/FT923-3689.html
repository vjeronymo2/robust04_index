			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: BAe to sell satellite and telecom services arms Correction (published 14 September 1992) appended to this article. BRITISH AEROSPACE is planning to abandon its remaining interests in satellites with the sale of its communications services division as well as its satellite-making business. It has offered both businesses for sale as a package and Matra Marconi Space, the Anglo-French joint venture 51 per cent owned by Matra and 49 per cent by GEC, wants to buy them. If successful, it would dispose of the services side to a third party, said Mr Claude Goumy, chairman, yesterday. Matra Marconi Space has been in talks with BAe for almost a year over the sale of the satellite manufacturing side. But last month the fate of the division was thrown into doubt when Deutche Aerospace said it was also interested. The BAe board is likely to indicate the fate of both businesses when it publishes its interim results on September 23. Turnover of the space and communications services operations was Pounds 121m in 1990, the last time the figure was separated in the company's accounts. Sales two years earlier were Pounds 136m. The communications services division has not previously been acknowledged as being for sale. It includes Bishopsgate Systems, which operates private telecommunications and has clients in the City of London, Starbird Satellite Services, which provides television news gathering via satellite, and Satellite Management International which provides equipment and expertise for ground to satellite links. BAe said yesterday that these areas had been identified as 'non-core businesses'. BAe's satellite manufacturing side has seen orders dry up in the past two years. In June it halved the 1,200 workforce at its Space Systems plant in Stevenage in a move interpreted by senior executives in the space industry as a slimming exercise before disposal. It is a victim of increasing competition on the world stage as more contracts go to open international tender. European manufacturers have reacted to the increased competition by forming two camps in an attempt to cut costs and compete with the market leader, Hughes Aircraft of the US. Dasa is allied with Aerospatiale and Alcatel of France and Alenia of Italy. This group also has 49 per cent of a US company Space Systems/Loral, with the US company Loral, holding the other 51 per cent. The second group is the GEC-Matra joint venture Matra-Marconi, which has ties with ANT, the space arm of Bosch of Germany. CORRECTION British Aerospace sold its 50 per cent stake in Starbird Satellite Services to World Wide Television News on July 30 last year. Due to incorrect information supplied on behalf of the company, Starbird was reported as being part of BAe in a Financial Times report on September 10.</p>

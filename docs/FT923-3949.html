			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Canadian economy 'needs more reform' THE CANADIAN economy requires further structural reforms to reverse the slide in its international competitiveness over the past two decades, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says in its latest report on the country. While the OECD gives credit for some initiatives since the mid-1980s, it concludes that 'improvement of Canadian productivity performance remains elusive'. Greater attention should be given to education and training policies, research and development, and to removal of remaining domestic and external trade barriers. The report notes that recent progress in lowering inflation and maintaining fiscal discipline has set the stage for the next economic recovery. But the upturn will be sluggish. Gross domestic product, which contracted by 1.7 per cent in 1991, is forecast to rise by 2.3 per cent this year, accelerating to 4.3 per cent in 1993. Exports and housing are expected to be the mainsprings of the recovery. Despite the upturn in demand, considerable slack will remain in goods and labour markets. The OECD expects Canada's inflation rate will be about 2 per cent both this year and next, easily beating targets set by the government last year. But it cautions that expectations of lower inflation, in the form of more moderate wage demands, have yet to be firmly established. The organisation notes that the impact of Canada's sliding productivity is evident in the deteriorating trade balance and historically low profit margins. It suggests that improvements in the much-criticised education and R&amp;D effort require a reallocation of existing resources, rather than additional spending.</p>

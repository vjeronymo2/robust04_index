			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHAMINADE HITTERS POUND LOYOLA WITH 17 HITS, 10-RUN 4TH INNING  </P> <P> Chaminade High tallied 17 hits -- nine during a 10-run fourth inning -- as the  Eagles pounded Loyola, 13-5, Monday in the first round of the St. Paul high  school baseball tournament in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Chaminade (4-6), which has collected 33 hits in the past two games, belted four  doubles and a triple. But as powerful as the Eagles were, they failed to hit a  home run in spacious Blair Field.  </P> <P> "It's about 350 down the lines and 400 to center with a 15-foot fence,"  Chaminade Coach Steve Costley said. "(Justin) Stark would have had, maybe,  three home runs in a regular-sized field."  </P> <P> Instead, Justin Stark settled for a double and three runs batted in while going  three for five. Greg Baumgartner (2-2), who struck out five in five innings to  earn the win, was two for five. Colin Havert was two for four with three RBIs.  </P> <P> Every Chaminade player collected at least two hits, except Jeff Burdick and  Pete Miller, who each had one.  </P> <P> In other first-round games:  </P> <P> St. Genevieve 1, Alemany 0 -- Roland De La Maza tossed a two-hitter and Joe  Cascione singled in the winning run in the third inning.  </P> <P> De La Maza had 11 strikeouts and no walks.  </P> <P> "I don't think anyone has had much batting practice with the rain and the long  layoff for Easter," St. Genevieve Coach Kevin Kane said. "You need your timing  to hit Roland, especially when he's hitting spots with his pitches."  </P> <P> Herman Merchan singled to left, advanced to second on Mike Cassidy's bunt  single and scored on Cascione's single to right field.  </P> <P> St. Genevieve (5-3) will play Mater Dei tonight at 7 at Blair Field.  </P> <P> Crespi 4, St. Bernard 3 -- Crespi scored twice in the bottom of the seventh to  come from behind and win.  </P> <P> Chad Nichols and John Dempsey each delivered run-scoring singles with one out.  Dempsey's bases-loaded hit scored Tim Weir to end the game.  </P> <P> Crespi led, 2-1, entering the seventh, but St. Bernard scored twice to take the  lead. Dan Malendez reached base on a fielding error which allowed John Coleman  to score from third. Jeff Richardson later scored on a squeeze bunt by Grant  Hohman.  </P> <P> Pat Bennett (3-0) pitched two innings in relief of starter Chad Nichols to earn  the win.  </P> <P> SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Poly 6, Sylmar 4 -- Jodi Soto (6-0) pitched a six-hitter with two strikeouts as  Poly (9-2, 3-0) avenged last year's 4-3 second-round loss in the City Section  4-A Division playoffs with a Valley Pac-8 Conference win at Poly.  </P> <P> Tracey Bell hit a triple, home run and walked twice.  </P> <P> Reseda 24, Grant 3 -- Michelle Brewer pitched a four-hitter and was four for  five, including a solo home run, as Reseda (7-1, 3-0) breezed to a Valley Pac-8  Conference win at Grant.  </P> <P> Tracy Dockery was five for five to lead the Regents' 22-hit attack. Wendy Yanez  was three for four, including a three-run home run.  </P> <P> Brewer (5-1) struck out nine and walked five.  </P> <P> BOYS' VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Chatsworth d. Taft, 15-6, 15-13, 15-5 -- Greg Weaver had 17 kills, and Chris  Gleason and Jeremy Graham each had seven blocks to lead the Chancellors (6-0,  2-0) in a Northwest Valley Conference match at Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Taft is 4-2, 0-1.  </P> <P> Sylmar d. Cleveland, 15-4, 15-4, 15-3 -- Bobby McMillan recorded 10 kills and  Steve Sapera had 25 assists for Sylmar (5-1, 2-0) in a Valley Pac-8 conference  match at Cleveland.  </P> <P> North Hollywood d. Grant, 15-4, 15-13, 15-11 -- Nestor Marroquin had 14 kills  and Alex Rudinger had 11 for North Hollywood in a Valley Pac-8 Conference match  at North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Reseda d. Monroe, 10-15, 15-10, 15-8, 15-7 -- Scott Kent had seven kills and 13  blocks, and Coley Kyman had seven kills to lead host Reseda (5-1, 2-0) in a  Valley Pac-8 Conference match.  </P></p>

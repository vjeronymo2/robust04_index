			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK-Colombia trade group in prospect BRITAIN and Colombia are to negotiate an agreement on foreign investment and they plan to set up a bilateral trade group, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said in Bogota yesterday. He said revitalisation of UK relations with Colombia and Latin America had got off to a good start. Earlier yesterday, Mr Major, who was en route to Rio de Janeiro for the Earth Summit, visited the Cusiana oilfields with President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia to see British Petroleum's biggest find in 25 years. The premier said he had no doubt that the development of the Cusiana reserves would have a dramatic and beneficial effect on Colombia's economy. Mr Major said Britain planned to 'enhance' its anti-drug effort with Colombia.</p>

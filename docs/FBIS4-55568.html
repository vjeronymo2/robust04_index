			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "rk": "Standing Conference of the Civic </F> Institute: Only the Christian Democratic Movement's Offer Is  Realistic"]    [Text] Bratislava--"Only the offer of the Christian  Democratic Movement [KDH] is realistic for the Standing  Conference of the Civic Institute [SKOI] because it was the  first such offer and because it came from circles closest to  us," [SKOI spokesman] Jan Langos told a news conference  yesterday. He added that an agreement exists between the KDH  and SKOI that the KDH would not interfere with the selection and  placement of SKOI candidates on the slates of candidates.  However, SKOI's candidates will be placed after the KDH's own  candidates who stand a realistic chance of being elected. The  KDH Council is ready to recognize the right of SKOI members to  their own club of deputies in the parliament, Langos said, and  estimated that the joint ticket might gain the support of 10-15  percent of voters. Regarding possible differences of opinion  between the KDH and SKOI, Langos said that these are not  important at present and that the KDH's offer does not entail  any obligation for disciplined voting [by SKOI candidates] in  the future. According to Langos, all parties to whom the KDH  offer has been addressed must decide autonomously. He warned,  however, that it is urgent that they make their decision soon.</p>

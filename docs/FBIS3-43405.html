Raul Domingos said Renamo's withdrawal from the  Chiramba and Magunde assembly points was an indication that food  supplies are not being taken into account by the international  community. He noted that Renamo soldiers could go without basic  facilities at their bases, but not in assembly points. Domingos  urged the international community to take into account the  question of food and clothing for Renamo forces. He said the  situation is serious and demanded that the international  community should intervene immediately to prevent situations  likely to endanger the peace process. He added that everything  will be done to see to it that those who abandon the assembly  points will return as soon as possible, though this depends on  better logistical conditions.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: PSBR in perspective It would be a comfort if May's Pounds 3.1bn PSBR was a sign that worries over government finances had been overdone. The figure is significantly lower than the market expected. Unfortunately, it has been compressed by distortions relating particularly to the timing of transfer payments to local government. The underlying picture remains depressing. Income tax and social security contributions are barely changed on a year ago, while corporation tax receipts have fallen by two thirds to Pounds 150m. If that trend continues, the government could well be on course to exceed its full-year target of Pounds 28bn. The only consolation is that this prospect is now largely accepted by the gilts market, especially after its correction following Denmark's Maastricht referendum. Indeed, the slippage in prices since then probably owes as much to the end of post-election euphoria as to concern about currency union. During that time gilts have out-performed French Treasury issues, but, unlike the UK, France is to hold a referendum on Maastricht. Certainly the market took yesterday's Bank of England auction announcement in its stride. At Pounds 2.75bn, the total on offer is slightly above expectations, which in turn suggests the Bank believes that demand has returned at the longer end of the maturity spectrum. All the same, there will be some nail-biting in Threadneedle Street until the Irish vote is counted.</p>

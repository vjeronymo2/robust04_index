			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / CBOT yields to pressure on Globex LIFFE is to resume talks on joining Globex, the round-the-clock futures trading system, after the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) yielded to pressure from its Globex partners to give up its claim to a key Liffe product. Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which developed the project with the CBOT, urged it to relinquish its right to trade bund futures, the most heavily-traded contract on Liffe. Globex, developed by Reuters, the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, urgently needs to attract other exchanges to list their futures contracts on the electronic system, to boost trading volume. Reuters, the international information and communications group which contributed the bulk of the estimated Dollars 80m development cost, stands no chance of recouping its investment unless volume rises. The system is designed to allow futures trading to continue outside normal exchange hours, but volume has consistently fallen short of targets since its launch more than a year ago. Liffe, the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange, pulled out of negotiations last month, when the CBOT laid claim to bund futures. Reuters has played a pivotal role in getting the negotiations going again. While publicly declaring its long-term commitment to the project, Reuters has been dissatisfied with the CBOT's handling of its talks with Liffe. 'We believe the position on bund contracts you have taken with Liffe is inconsistent with the Globex agreement,' a Reuters executive wrote in a letter to CBOT chairman Mr Pat Arbor a week before Liffe discussions ended. The contract between Reuters and the two Chicago exchanges is due for renewal in April, but the CME and CBOT have already conceded that they are unlikely to meet targets of 500 Globex screens in the US and 50,000 contracts traded daily. Currently, the exchanges are recording 5,000 contracts a day on Globex. Failure to meet targets could result in a radical restructuring of Globex, which is currently run by the two Chicago exchanges. Other exchanges have been deterred from joining Globex, as they are loath to surrender control over their products to rivals. Like other exchanges, Liffe thinks that a solution could be to allow Reuters to run the system, rather than the exchanges. Liffe has said if the issue of control of the system is not resolved, it will sign only a short-term deal with Globex.</p>

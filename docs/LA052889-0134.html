			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REYES TWITCHES QUICKEST, WINS A PAIR OF SPRINT TITLES  </P> <P> Orange Glen's Glen Reyes was talking about "quick-twitch muscles" after his  performances in the 100 and 200 meters during Saturday's San Diego Section  track and field finals at Poway High.  </P> <P> But it was more than a twitch that helped him make up three strides on  front-runner Kiyoshi Moody of Castle Park in the final 30 meters of the 100 to  win in 10.79. Moody was clocked at 10.81.  </P> <P> And it was more than a twitch that gave Reyes the lead in the 200 coming out of  the turn and allowed him to cruise to the finish in 21.47, a 1989 section best.  </P> <P> "I stopped training with weights a couple weeks ago because my muscles were  getting heavy and strong, but not quick," Reyes said. "Now I'm starting to do  drills to work on my quick-twitch muscles." The drills, Reyes explained, have  been designed by Dr. Michael Yessis, a bio-mechanical expert who is fluent in  Russian and has studied and translated Soviet training manuals.  </P> <P> "I've got calls from Knoxville, Tenn., from USA Today; reporters doing stories  on Dr. Yessis asking me if he's done anything for me," Reyes said.  </P> <P> The answer is evident, especially considering that Moody was the favorite in  the 100.  </P> <P> Reyes also finished third in the long jump at 22-feet-7 1/4 behind Jerome Price  of University City (24-6 1/4, season best) and Tom Brown of Castle Park (23-5  3/4).  </P> <P> Three events, two firsts. Not bad, unless of course one compares that against  the accomplishments of San Pasqual's Francis O'Neill. O'Neill also entered  three events -- the 800, 1,600 and 3,200 meters -- and won each.  </P> <P> Other big winners included Brent Noon, the top finisher in both the discus and  shotput; sophomore Eric Bell, who came from behind to edge Mario O'Conner of  Escondido and Poway's Jeff Haines in the 110 high hurdles, and Granite Hills  pole vaulter Brian Chase.  </P> <P> The boys' team champion was Fallbrook with 51 points. Orange Glen was right  behind with 50.  </P> <P> O'Neill, who ran 5,600 meters and claimed his three titles in the span of two  hours, finished the 800 in 1:52.40, the 1,600 in 4:14.09 and the 3,200 in  9:19.72.  </P> <P> As expected, Noon set another personal best. Unexpectedly, however, it did not  come in the shotput. Noon's discus throw of 185-4 was 4-9 better than his  previous county best. In the shot, Noon's top effort traveled 66-7, well below  his national best of 69-8 1/4.  </P> <P> Afterward, Noon was pestered as to whether he is placing too much pressure on  himself to reach 70-0; he got his 69-8 1/4 on May 5, Fallbrook's last dual  meet.  </P> <P> "No," he answered, "because I feel I'm on track for next week (at the state  meet in Cerritos)."  </P> <P> Bell was a surprise in 110 high hurdles. Besides being a sophomore, he was the  second-to-last qualifier at last week's preliminaries with a time of 15.33.  Saturday he ran a county season best 14.55 into a slight head wind.  </P> <P> "The coaches and I, we all knew I could do it," Bell said. "It was just a  matter of concentrating and just getting over the hurdles."  </P> <P> Chase's new county best in the vault is 15-5. "I had a good, tall takeoff and  made it pretty easy," said Chase, who also spoke of difficulties at lower  heights. "I had three attempts before I made 14-4. I was getting a little  nervous there."  </P></p>

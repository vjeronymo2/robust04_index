			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received a report from the spokesman  of the Albanian Foreign Ministry:    Deputy Foreign Minister Arian Starova, at a meeting today,  informed Greek Ambassador in Tirana Tsalikis that the Albanian  side welcomes the Greek proposal for a meeting at the foreign  minister level in Zurich, Switzerland on 3 May.    By responding in this way, Albania is showing that it  respects the choice of dialogue and is committed to finding ways  to normalize relations with Greece.    While this meeting was held in Tirana, it has been learned  that the Greek Foreign Ministry summoned Albanian Ambassador  Hysen Cabej to an urgent meeting at the Greek Foreign Ministry  and notified him that the diplomatic staff should be reduced  from five diplomats to four.    Such a fact, which runs counter to statements by Greek  Government officials on finding a way to dialogue and  cooperation, cannot but surprise anyone. After this, it is  somewhat difficult to understand the messages coming from Athens.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 52  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrule 52(2) has been amended to provide that where a Disclosure Order or Protective Order is amended, modified or revoked, the competent investigating authority shall provide the responsible Secretariat with a copy of the amendment, modification or Notice of Revocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 53  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 53 has been removed because it was redundant and did not accurately reflect current practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 55  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrules 55(3) and 55(5) have been amended to ensure that, where the competent investigating authority files with the responsible Secretary a document under seal, the two panelists delegated to examine the document have an obligation to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 56  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrule 56(a) has been amended to make clear that members of the Secretariat staff and others are eligible to receive access to documents disclosed pursuant to rule 55 and to provide that members of any future Extraordinary Challenge Committee and their assistants may have access to these documents, if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The substance of subrule (b) has been removed to subrule (c). New subrule (b) has been added to specify the procedure by which a panel identifies who is entitled to access to a document containing privileged information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 59  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrules 59 (1)(b) and (2)(b) have been amended to allow the filing of pleadings containing non-proprietary and non-privileged information no later than one day after the filing of pleadings containing the proprietary or privileged information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cross-referencing in subrule 60(1) has been revised to account for the merging of time lines in joint panel reviews under subrule 38(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 62  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrule 62(1) has been restructured to distinguish between a table of contents and a table of authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 62A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrule 62A(1) has been amended to clarify the contents and organization of materials contained in an appendix. It now provides, among other things, that the appendix should include copies of all treaty and statutory references as well as copies of those cases primarily relied on in the briefs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 64  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 64 has been amended to add a cross-reference to subrule 77(5), which provides for no right of response to a motion for re-examination of a panel order or decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 65  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 65 incorporates the substance of old rule 66. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 66  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New rule 66 incorporates the substance of old rule 65 and has been amended to provide that a panel may hear oral argument in person as well as by telephone conference call. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 69  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrule 69(4) has been added to clarify that oral argument shall be conducted by counsel of record or, where a participant is an individual who has not retained counsel, by the participant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 75  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrule 75(4) has been amended by adding the phrase ``after the later of'' to clarify the time period for the issuance of an order by the panel. In addition, subrule 75(4) has been amended to delete the cross-reference to rule 74 because rule 74 requires that a panel decision include reasons, which an order affirming uncontested remand results does not require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 77  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrules 77 (5), (6) and (7) have been added as a result of the addition of rule 79A, which provides for the issuance of a Notice of Final Panel Action. Under former subrule 77(5), issuance of a Notice of Completion could effectively deny a motion under subrule 77(1). Because rule 79A could have the effect of denying a motion under subrule 77(1), new subrule 77(5) has been added to clarify that there is no right of response to a motion for re-examination of a panel order or decision except at the discretion of the panel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

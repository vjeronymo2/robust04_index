			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold market bulls undismayed GOLD MARKET bulls were not ready to throw in the towel this week as the metal's price retreated further following the dramatic sell-off that ended the recent upsurge. But there was less talk of the Dollars 40 plunge from last week's post-Gulf war high being nothing more than 'a healthy correction' to an overdone rise. As the London bullion market price clambered back above Dollars 370 a troy ounce yesterday morning, after Thursday's after-hours fall below Dollars 365, GNI, the London trade house, suggested that a close above Dollars 370 an ounce for the October position in New York would signal that the latest fall, which resulted from a heavy bout of US investment fund selling, had been a 'bear trap'. 'We would therefore be cautious buyers at current levels,' GNI said in its daily Commodity Report. 'The long-term position is still good.' Less confident was the trader who told the Reuter news agency he thought a fall through Dollars 365 an ounce in London would mean 'the rally's all over'. But others believed that even in the event of a fall to Dollars 360, fundamental factors would underpin the price and provide a solid base for a slow climb back. The week had started with a Dollars 5.75 bounce in the London market to Dollars 382.25 an ounce, largely in response to the return of Swiss and Far Eastern buyers. But concerted efforts on Tuesday to consolidate the market above the Dollars 380 mark had to be abandoned and from mid-week investment fund liquidation began to add to the downward pressure in an unstable market that dealers said was still suffering the 'aftershock' of last week's late plunge. The subsequent recovery appeared to have run out of steam by yesterday lunch-time and the London price closed at Dollars 368.75 an ounce, up Dollars 3.90 from the low but still Dollars 7.75 down on the week. In late trading at the New York Commodity Exchange, however, the October futures position was trading at Dollars 370 an ounce, the target level identified by GNI. If GNI is cautiously bullish about gold, there is nothing cautious about its view of prospects for the cocoa market. In the latest issue of its Cocoa Outlook report, published yesterday, it said that declining stocks, continuing consumption growth and doubts about future output pointed to the development of 'the most exciting bull market for some time' over the next few seasons. It suggested a rerun of the 'massive' bull market of the 1970s was not out of the question, with the average cocoa price surging from Pounds 745 a tonne this year to Pounds 1,600 in 1994 and Pounds 2,700 in 1995. 'Ultimately the rally should peter out close to the July 1977 second (futures) position high of Pounds 3,512 a tonne,' GNI said. The report included a forecast of a world cocoa supply deficit of 241,000 tonnes in 1993-94 and that tended to encourage buyers. But the resulting early upward move in the London futures market was wiped out in response to a strengthening of sterling and there was little sign that the market was yet in the mood for a bull run on the scale envisaged by GNI. The December futures price ended at Pounds 761 a tonne, down Pounds 1 on the day and up Pounds 7 on the week. The London robusta coffee market has been much more volatile than the cocoa market of late, and this week was no exception. As the market sought a new trading level following the violent fluctuations caused in recent weeks by the ebb and flow of Brazilian frost fears the November futures price see-sawed between Dollars 1,100 and Dollars 1,150 a tonne, before closing yesterday at Dollars 1,121 a tonne, up just Dollars 7 on the week. With the Brazilian frost scare season almost over most attention is focusing again on the Latin American coffee producers export retention scheme. The growing credibility of this effort to bring the world market into better balance by withholding 20 per cent of scheduled exports from the market brought the London coffee price close to the Dollars 1,000-a-tonne mark before the Brazilian weather took up the baton several weeks ago. Some doubts about the likely effectiveness of the scheme resurfaced this week but in general coffee dealers still held the view that, rather than face a renewed price collapse, leading producers would not stint in their efforts to make export restrictions stick. Talks are to be held in Kampala next week on extending the scheme to African producing countries, and this was offered as an explanation for the relative steadiness of the London market, which trades the robusta coffee grown mostly in Africa, compared with the weakness of the New York market, which trades Latin American-type arabicas. At the London Metal Exchange technical tightness continued to obscure the fundamental weakness of the copper market, despite the exchange management's warning two weeks ago that it would take draconian action to prevent serious distortion of the market by operators attempting to manipulate prices. The cash premium over three months delivery copper, which ended last week at Dollars 17 a tonne, stood at Dollars 40 as at yesterday's close. The aluminium market passed another unwelcome milestone this week when the stocks total in LME warehouse moved above the 2m tonne mark. But there was no noticeable market reaction and the three months price rallied by Dollars 12.50 from Wednesday's low to end at Dollars 1,207.25 a tonne, down Dollars 15.25 on the week.  ------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------ Aluminium   +25,375 to 2,001,050 Copper       +8,025 to   479,925 Lead           +100 to   276,725 Nickel         +522 to   103,692 Zinc         +7,725 to   731,600 Tin             -10 to    21,390  ------------------------------------</p>

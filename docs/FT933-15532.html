			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Germans advise Budgens on trial discount stores BUDGENS, the small food retailing chain, will open four trial discount stores next month in a format it devised with Rewe, one of Germany's largest food retailers. Rewe is a private company which operates 8,000 stores and has 15 per cent of the German food market. In April it stepped up the continental European assault on the discount end of British retailing through buying a 26 per cent stake in Budgens. Budgens is converting four of its existing 100 stores in the south-east of England to the new format, named Penny Market. Rewe currently operates more than 1,400 discount grocery outlets, as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets. Several continental European discounters, attracted by the high profit margins available in UK food retailing, have opened stores in the past three years, making discounting the fastest-growing area of the market. Budgens will decide whether to expand the new format after two months. Mr John von Spreckelsen, chief executive, said that if more Penny Market stores were opened, they would be in addition to the Budgens chain. No decision had been made on how any expansion would be funded. Mr von Spreckelsen, a German who was installed as chief executive of the struggling chain in 1991, meanwhile confirmed that the recovery in Budgens' profitability was continuing, in spite of what he described as 'continuing attrition' from retail competitors. Last year 800,000 sq ft of competitive space was opened close to Budgens' outlets in the south-east, which themselves total only 600,000 sq ft, and another 700,000 sq ft of competitive space will be opened in the current year. Pre-tax profits rose by 33 per cent to Pounds 6.2m in the year to April 25, although turnover fell marginally from Pounds 291m to Pounds 285m. The board is recommending a return to the dividend list with a payment of 1p. Earnings per share dipped from 3.5p to 3.4p, partly because non-trading items incurred a cost of Pounds 250,000 from the closure of unprofitable outlets, compared with profits of Pounds 842,000 in the previous year.

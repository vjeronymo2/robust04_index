			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEDERLANDER TO HEAD YANKEES  </P> <P> Robert Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organization of theatrical  producers, was named today to succeed George Steinbrenner as general partner of  the New York Yankees.  </P> <P> The limited partners met this morning with Steinbrenner, who must resign by  Monday under his agreement with Commissioner Fay Vincent.  </P> <P> "I have great confidence in Robert," Steinbrenner said. "As far as I'm  concerned, I couldn't have got a better man."  </P> <P> The Nederlander organization's Los Angeles-area holdings include the Pacific  Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, the Pantages in Hollywood, the Wilshire Theatre in  Beverly Hills and the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood. The Nederlander  Organization also manages Los Angeles' Greek Theatre in Griffith Park. He is  also chief executive officer of Milwaukee-based Allis-Chalmers, a manufacturing  firm.  </P> <P> Nederlander, one of the limited partners, was Steinbrenner's third choice as  successor. Steinbrenner's first pick, his 33-year-old son, Hank, turned down  the job.  </P> <P> "He's his own man," Steinbrenner said. "He didn't feel he even was interested  in it. My son was the first choice."  </P> <P> The second choice, Yankees Executive Vice President Leonard L. Kleinman, was  blocked by Commissioner Fay Vincent. Kleinman has been asked to appear at a  hearing before Vincent on Sept. 6 because of his possible involvement with  gambler Howard Spira.  </P> <P> Nederlander must be approved by three-quarters of the American League's 14  owners and a majority of the National League's 12 owners. Deputy Commissioner  Steve Greenberg said he expected the approval process to take about 30 days.  </P> <P> "The Nederlander family and the Steinbrenner family have been friends for many  years," Nederlander said. "We continue and will value that kind of friendship.  The New York Yankees are the greatest franchise in all of sports. We want to  continue that kind of tradition."  </P> <P> As the partners emerged from their meeting, Vincent was watching the Cincinnati  Reds play the Cardinals in St. Louis.  </P> <P> "I'll wait and have to learn more before I have a comment," Vincent said. "I  don't know anything about the gentleman. I assume everything will be fine, but  I don't know anything about him."  </P> <P> Fifteen of the 18 limited partners attended the two-hour, 15-minute meeting.  Lester Crown and his sons, Daniel and James, were not there because of a death  in the family.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner said Nederlander would be in charge of the team on an interim  basis pending formal approval by the major league clubs.  </P> <P> "I have great confidence in Robert. He was my selection," Steinbrenner said.  "He comes from a family that's been associated with mine for 25 years in the  show business end. I have been a partner in very many of his productions. As  far as I'm concerned, I couldn't have had a better man."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner, who headed the group that bought the club from CBS Inc. on Jan.  3, 1973, was forced to quit because of his relationship with Spira, a gambler  who gave him information on former Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield.  Steinbrenner also made a $40,000 payment to Spira.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner owns 55% of the Yankees. Vincent has ordered him to reduce that to  less than 50% by Aug. 20, 1991.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Kleinman threatened a lawsuit because he was blocked from becoming  general partner.  </P></p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Markets Report: US dollar holds firm Central bank intervention to support the dollar appeared to have worked yesterday as the US currency traded in a fairly stable range against the D-Mark and the yen, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar closed yesterday in London at DM1.6682 against the D-Mark from DM1.6620 on Wednesday. Against the yen it finished at Y102.695 from Y102.205. It ended in New York at DM1.6665 and Y102.835. There was no sign of central bank intervention, with the market seemingly taking a breather ahead of the release of important US non-farm payroll data today. Few observers believe the dollar's woes are behind it. The focus of attention now is on what sort of follow-up activity can be expected. Options include further intervention, US or German interest rate changes supportive of the dollar, or market-access measures in the case of Japan. Elsewhere, the French franc was firm after the Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 10 basis points to 5.60 per cent. The peseta and the escudo were weak after the overnight arrest of the former Bank of Spain governor for tax fraud. Swedish and Austrian interest rates were also cut. Analysts said the sight of up to 17 central banks operating in concert on Wednesday appeared to have 'frightened off' the market. Mr Akis Karayiannis, head of foreign exchange at Lehman Brothers, commented: 'Markets will perhaps take on a central bank if its on its own. But if more than three banks do something in the market, the market will respect that.' Fresh impetus for the markets could come today with the release of labour market statistics. The market is anticipating a 200,000 increase in jobs. If the figure is less than anticipated, this would aggravate the dollar's woes by undermining the consensus view that another Fed tightening is imminent. The market yesterday was concerned with trying to understand why the intervention had taken place, what it sought to achieve, and what more can be anticipated. Mr Karayiannis disputed the view that a change of trend was taking place. 'Central banks are concerned about volatility. They do not change trends. I think they want to smooth the process, not to change the direction.' Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, commented: 'The intervention by itself is helpful, but not a sufficient condition to arrest the dollar's downward move.' He sugg-ested that it needed to be supported by shifts in interest rates, with US rates rising and German rates falling. Attention will be on the Bundesbank council when it meets next Wednesday to see whether it reduces the discount rate. One possible complication for the Bundesbank in supporting the dollar is that this inflates the money supply, already well beyond its target range. The German central bank will hardly welcome further complications in an area that has already caused embarrassment. If the bank chooses to counteract this effect by draining money from the system, it will put upward pressure on money market rates at a time when it is hoping to ease policy. If the intervention is left unsterilised, this will put downward pressure on money market rates. The fact that intervention would then be working with the grain of money market trends - supporting lower rates in Germany and higher rates in the US  -leads some analysts to argue that the intervention has a good chance of succeeding. The D-Mark was firmer against most European currencies yesterday. It closed at FFr3.428 against the French franc from FFr3.424. The Portuguese escudo continues to suffer from the fall-out of the political scandal in Spain. It finished at Es103 from Es102.8 per D-Mark. But the Spanish peseta recovered some ground after Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said he had no intention of resigning and would continue as head of government. The after-effects of Wednesday's intervention was seen in German money markets yesterday, with call money easing to 5.35/5.45 per cent from 5.45/5.55 per cent. Analysts said this reflected the anticipation of rate cuts, sparked by comments earlier this week from Bundesbank council members, as well as the expectation of a large inflow of cash from the currency intervention. This bullish sentiment was also evident in the futures market, with the June Euromark contract settling at 95.05, up 13 basis points. Volumes were good, with more than 47,000 lots traded. Sterling futures also finished higher. The June contract closed at 94.59, up from 94.56. Volumes were fairly light, with 9,482 lots traded. In the UK money market, the Bank of England provided Pounds 320m of late assistance. Earlier the Bank had put in Pounds 373m of assistance, after forecasting an Pounds 850m shortage. The pound had a steady day, tracking the dollar, and finished at DM2.4969 from DM2.491. Against the dollar it was barely changed at Dollars 1.4968 from Dollars 1.4988.</p>

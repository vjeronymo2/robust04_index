			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Podlipskiy, under the rubric </F> "Privatization of the Space Sector": "More Than Half of  `Energiya' Will Remain With the State"; first paragraph is  source introduction]    [Text] The privatization of the enterprises of the  military-industrial complex and especially of Russian  rocket-and-space firms has long been the arena for the most  heated discussions between supporters of the activation of the  process and opponents. The almost legendary technological  dissociation of those production areas from the rest of the  national machine-building complex has already stirred increased  interest toward the sector among outside investors. That same  attractiveness, however, is serving as sufficient justification  for sector officials to shield the enterprises from voucher  privatization, i.e., privatization that is actually free. In  that vein, the presidential ukase that was issued this past  weekend on the privatization of NPO Energiya was, in essence, an  ultima ratio denationalization of the  military-industrial complex -- the inability to totally block  the process of privatization is compensated for by reserving as  federal property the controlling bloc of shares.    One could say that the scientific-production association  [NPO] Energiya is the best-known space firm in the world --  before the other "mailboxes" of the sector were declassified, it  was that enterprise that was synonymous with the Soviet space  program overall. In addition, all the contracts for the flights  of Western specialists to the Soviet (now Russian) orbital  stations Salyut and Mir were concluded with that NPO. The  special status held by Energiya in the Russian space industry  enabled enterprise officials to have a relationship special to  them -- in November 1992, a draft of a governmental decree on  the privatization of the NPO was sent to Goskomimushchestvo, and  in January of last year, Viktor Chernomyrdin signed that decree.  The document called for the organization of a new joint-stock  company in the form of a holding company that would be made up  of the head design bureau (in Kaliningrad), the experimental  machine-building plant (in Kaliningrad), and the Volga and  Primorsk affiliates (in Samara and the city of Primorsk,  Leningrad Oblast). Preliminary estimates put the authorized  capital for the holding company at about 1 billion rubles [R].    But it's obvious that the government couldn't set the  leading  enterprise of the sector "free" completely -- Energiya plays a  key role in the manned space program. Ironically enough,  complete denationalization of the enterprise wouldn't suit  Russia's Western partners, either -- especially NASA. In the  fall of last year, at a meeting between the first vice-premier  Oleg Soskovets and the leadership of that organization, the  representatives of the American side complained about the lack  of coordination between the positions of the government and the  NPO in terms of collaboration on the development of the orbital  station Alpha. Oleg Soskovets promised to "settle" that problem.    Thus, the presidential ukase that came out yesterday buried,  once and for all, the initial hopes of NPO officials that they  would be able to "buy back" from the government 26 percent of  the shares of the mother company -- for three years, secured as  federal property are 51 percent of the shares of the S. P.  Korolev Russian Space Corporation Energiya (that's the full  official name of the enterprise). But privatization of Energiya  (which is due exclusively to the persistence of its leadership)  could be virtually the only exception in the entire trend  associated with the setting up of Russia's rocket-and-space  complex -- a more popular idea in the government is to create,  at the leading enterprises of the sector, federal space centers  that would be completely under the control of the state and  could not be privatized (at least, for vouchers).  [Box]  <H5>  Sphere of Activity of the Russian Space Corporation Energiya: </H5>    -    -  Creation and operation of an orbital complex consisting  of the permanently manned Mir station and the transport craft  Soyuz-TM and Progress M    -  Creation of the reusable space transportation system  Energiya-Buran (operation of the system has been mothballed)    -  Creation of "orbital towcraft" -- upper stages for launchers  (units D and DM)    -  Production of household goods, plus prostheses for the  disabled</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Operation Against Drug Smugglers"] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that the federal government has  started to implement a strong policy to totally eradicate the  curse of drug abuse by 2000 AD. Under this policy, not only laws  related to the drug trade and smuggling will be made stricter,  but also the administrative units responsible for stopping the  drug trade will be made more effective. There is a question  about the destructive nature of drugs, however, the involved  people manage to avoid arrest using their wealth and legal  loopholes. The present government has taken a bold step in  deciding to have death sentences for drug smugglers in order to  end this curse. However, it is important to catch the major  criminals involved in this trade in order to abolish this cursed  trade fully. All this cannot be achieved without the cooperation  of the army. During the last government's efforts in this  direction, some of them had gone underground and some had even  established their own gangs. In this situation, a major  operation with the cooperation of the army can be successful to  wipe out the drug smugglers. The government should not hesitate  in implementing such a plan.</p>

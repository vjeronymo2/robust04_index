			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: THE PLEASURES OF BEING A FRUMP  </P> <P> Usually I am quite modest about all the awards (two) I have received  professionally. Recently, however, I was given an honor that is long overdue. I  was made an honorary celebrity FRUMP (Frugal, Responsible, Unpretentious,  Mature People). Keeping me illustrious company are First Lady Barbara Bush,  Willard Scott, Roseanne Barr and Andy Rooney.  </P> <P> The founding mother of FRUMP is "Auntie" Barbara Hovanetz of Winter Park, Fla.,  who also edits the monthly newsletter. ("It's fall . . . the start of the  annual Purge Your Expired Coupons Season!")  </P> <P> There are 2,000 card-carrying FRUMPS out there -- women who wear polyester in  midsummer, crochet poodles to cover bottles of booze and, in order to prevent  the smoke alarm from going off while they're cooking, cover it with a shower  cap.  </P> <P> I suspect there are a lot more women who aren't organized enough to know  there's an organization organized just for them.  </P> <P> Some of us are destined for lackluster. We go through life carrying the same  handbag in winter and summer. We buy a skirt for 50 cents at a garage sale and  ask if they do alterations. If we have a season where our slips aren't too long  for our dresses, then our coats are too short.  </P> <P> You can dress us up, put us at a head table and make us feel important, but let  us sneeze and we quickly unfold from our handbag a half-roll of toilet tissue.  </P> <P> In a country that has a support group for everything, including dogs who have  had hysterectomies, it is comforting to know there are other women out there  who make dresses from curtain panels and hold bras together with safety pins  and fallen hems with staples. Every day I see a world becoming more serious  about itself.  </P> <P> Women are driven to "have it all," from bathrooms that sparkle to kids who  carry color-coordinated food in their Batman lunch boxes. It's not an invention  of the baby boomers. We've always been that way. At birth, every baby girl is  given a Stepford booster shot. Somewhere between laundering plastic bags and  hanging them out to dry and ripping off stamps on envelopes that I never  returned, I learned to lighten up. I don't know when the First Lady decided to  bare her roots or Willard decided to bare his skull, but it has probably made  life a lot easier for them. Or as one FRUMP put it, "Don't take life so  seriously. You'll never get out alive!"  </P> <P> I don't owe anyone for this award -- not my family, my editors or members of  the academy. I did it all myself. I thank you for the honor and the white FRUMP  T-shirt. Well, it used to be white. It is now pink, but then you probably  anticipated that.  </P></p>

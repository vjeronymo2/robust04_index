			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tokyo breathes again - But will the market revival continue? THE TOKYO stock market, which seemed only last year to have nowhere to go but down, has revived. The Nikkei 225, which in August reached a low for the decade of 14,929, peaked briefly above 20,000 this week. For non-Japanese investors, the strength of the yen has given an extra boost to returns. The Japanese market was up 18.6 per cent in dollar terms in the first quarter of 1993, making it the best-performing major market bar South Africa. Over the year to April 6, the rise in dollar terms was 42.3 per cent. For UK investors, the effect of September's devaluation, makes the rebound even more dramatic. Since the Nikkei's low in August, the index is up around 89 per cent in sterling terms. The average Japanese unit trust rose 38.2 per cent (offer to offer with income re-invested) over the six months to April 1, according to Finstat. But the market continues to trade at only half its level at the start of January 1990. So, private investors should be asking: is the rally set to continue, or have those who buy now missed the boat? Ian Burden, who manages the James Capel Japan Growth fund - second in the sector over 10 years, with a rise of 483.9 per cent - says the rebound 'feels completely different from any of the bear market rallies we have had over the past few years. The authorities are moving to a much more pro-active and aggressive policy stance.' He points to the speed with which the 1993 Budget was passed. 'The Japanese economy is in severe recession, but fiscal policy is being used quite aggressively and there has been a gradual improvement in liquidity.' Burden adds: 'The stock market will be an initial beneficiary of any short-term growth in liquidity, just as in the US when interest rates fell sharply and investors moved out of cash and into equities. There has been encouraging anecdotal evidence that the domestic individual is coming back into the market.' That move could be echoed by foreign institutions, Burden feels. 'Since Japan has been something of a one-way bet for the past three years, many US and European investors have been underweight in the area.' Burden warns, however: 'The news on the economy and earnings is still poor and I am not expecting any really good news on earnings until the period September 1993-March 1994. What the market is doing now is anticipating that 1994 recovery.' John Wright manages the Stewart Ivory Japan fund which, Finstat shows, is top of the sector over 10 years with a return of almost 500 per cent (offer-to-bid with net income re-invested). 'The general expectation was that the Japanese government would help the market ahead of the March year-end when banks have to value their equity holdings,' he says. 'Nevertheless, the fundamentals of the market are not that lousy. The country can take stimulative measures without putting the Budget into deep deficit, and inflation is very low.' One factor that always puzzles the overseas investor is that Japanese shares tend to trade on very high price-earnings ratios. In the mid-1980s, Japan bulls argued that these were irrelevant to Japan, where accounting standards are different. The cynical saw that as the kind of argument that can be self-deluding, and the 1990 decline as a come-uppance for those who choose to ignore fundamentals. Early in the 1990s, the problem has not been that share prices are high but that earnings have fallen dramatically. According to Datastream, the p/e ratio on the Japanese market is 49 now. If UK shares ever reached that rating, most sane investors would be heading for the exits. Wright says Japanese companies are often 'not run for bottom line earnings per share, but for market share and volume.' He points out, though, that there are important valuation measures other than the p/e ratio: 'Japan is cheaper than the UK and the US on a price to cashflow basis.' A further important factor is that the very low interest rates of the 1980s encouraged Japanese companies to splurge on capital spending. This hits earnings by increasing the depreciation charge. But capital spending now is dropping sharply. This will reduce the depreciation charge and allow earnings to recover. P/e ratios may start to fall. So, will the market move ahead once more? Wright fears there could be a correction once the Nikkei 225 moves into the early 20,000s. He thinks a more major move could depend on confirmation that corporate earnings are improving; like Burden, he believes this might not happen until late this year. Ken Inglis, group investment director at Allied Dunbar, says: 'It is reasonable to assume there has been some sort of sea change in attitude towards Japan. The market has reached the end of a long dark tunnel, and it is encouraging for western investors to see that the banks are not leading this rally.' He feels that, though the rise will not be continuous; the market has further to climb.</p>

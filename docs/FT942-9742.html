			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk expects gains despite setback Novo Nordisk, the Danish healthcare and industrial enzymes group, reported a fall in first-quarter net profits to DKr270m (Dollars 40.3m) from DKr304m in the same period last year. The group said the result was in line with expectations. For the full year, the group maintained its forecast that profits would increase relatively faster than the 11 per cent advance in 1993. First-quarter sales were up by 14 per cent to DKr3.13bn from DKr2.75bn. The increase was due partly to higher volume, with about 5 per cent due to currency changes. Sales by the healthcare group rose by 13 per cent to DKr2.06bn, including an increase of 8 per cent in sales by the diabetics care division to DKr1.49bn. Sales by the bio-industrial group, chiefly of industrial enzymes, increased by 11 per cent to DKr901m. The merger of two of the bio-industrial group's unit in the US would carry a DKr80m non-recurring charge which would be booked in the second quarter, the group said. LKAB, the mining group, has completed the sale of a 13 per cent stake in SSAB, Scandinavia's biggest steel group, for SKr1.3bn (Dollars 165m). A total of 2.5m B shares and 1.625m A shares were placed with domestic and international institutions. The placing was led by BZW in conjunction with Handelsbanken Investment Banking and Cazenove.</p>

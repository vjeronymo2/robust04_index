			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Observer: Private pasta Pietro Barilla, Italy's pasta and confectionery king, who died yesterday at the age of 80, was better known to sweet-toothed continental Europeans and South Americans than to Anglo-Saxons. Business-hungry City of London bankers had long given up trying to gain access to Barilla's top-security Parma headquarters, more akin to a defence plant than a biscuit factory. Even the toughest food industry multinationals despaired of ever taking over the family-owned business, which now sells more than L3,300bn worth of biscuits, foods and cakes a year. Barilla, set up in 1877 by Pietro's grandparents, is a prime example of the sort of private company which would add lustre to the pint-sized Milan bourse, were it quoted. But having once sold a majority stake to a multinational - America's W R Grace in 1968 - only to buy it back 11 years later, Barilla was determined never to lose control again. Whether matters change now that a new generation is taking over is an open question.

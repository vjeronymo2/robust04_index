			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Turkey has said that the resolution adopted by the  European Parliament in connection with lifting the immunity of  certain deputies in Turkey is prejudiced and full of grave  mistakes.    A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry says: The mere  fact that the resolution was adopted without waiting for (Gali),  cochairman of the Turkish-European joint parliamentary committee  and member of the European Union, to return from Turkey is  enough to show the extent to which the resolution is prejudiced.  The fact that the resolution criticizes the Turkish Government  shows how little those who drew up the resolution understand and  respect the principles of a state of law: The decision to lift  the immunity is a decision of the legislative body. The  subsequent steps will be taken by the judiciary. The government  has no authority to intervene in either of these stages.    The fact that the resolution talks about a Kurdish minority  or autonomy is incompatible both with the realities in Turkey  and with international law.    The resolution talks about lifting the immunity of eight  Kurdish deputies, six of whom are DEP [Democracy Party] members.  In other words, former Prosperity Party member Hasan Mezarci  has also been placed in the same category. This basic material  mistake can also give us an idea about the seriousness of the  resolution.    A resolution that is full of such grave mistakes is bound to  be just another European Parliament resolution.</p>

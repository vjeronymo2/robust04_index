			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Peace hopes rise in Karabakh conflict: Moscow brings together Armenia and Azerbaijan A breakthrough in the five-year-old conflict over Nagorno Karabakh, the Armenian-dominated enclave in Azerbaijan, may be in sight. This follows a Russian-arranged ceasefire agreed at the weekend and a proposal for a meeting of leaders of the two warring neighbours early next month. The Azeri leadership said in the capital, Baku, yesterday that defence ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia had agreed in Moscow with General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, on an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of the forces of both sides to predetermined positions. A complete withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijan would depend on further negotiations. The agreement came after further fierce fighting between Armenian and Azeri forces in the region of Kelbadjar on the borders of Nagorno Karabakh. Armenian forces now occupy 25 per cent of Azeri territory on both sides of the Karabakh enclave and more than 1m Azeris have been made refugees, most of them living in tents around Baku. In an interview yesterday Azeri President Haydar Aliev was cautious, saying that 'there have been many ceasefires - the important question is the total withdrawal of the Armenians from our territory and then we can talk about Nagorno Karabakh.' Mr Aliev, the former Communist party leader of Azerbaijan who returned to power last year in a bloodless coup, said that Nagorno Karabakh, which has declared its independence, must be recognised as part of Azerbaijan. 'After that, discussions on its status are open,' he said. 'We can agree to many kinds of status and as president I guarantee all rights to the Armenians living there.' Mr Vafa Gulizade, the presidential adviser on foreign affairs, said that 'the most important thing about this agreement is that it is guaranteed by the Russians. The Russians can force the Armenians to withdraw if they want, because Armenia is entirely dependent on Russia for its survival.' The two neighbouring countries, whose hostilities have escalated since the Armenian parliament declared Nagorno Karabakh part of Armenia four years ago, are now both members of the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States. Both, especially Armenia, remain closely tied to the Russian economy. However, Azerbaijan possesses very large oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. A contract with a western consortium of oil companies, led by British Petroleum, but with the probable participation of the Russian state oil company Lukoil, is expected to be signed shortly. Mr Aliev is due to arrive in London tomorrow for talks with Mr John Major, the prime minister. He said the talks aimed at 'bringing about a better understanding in the west of Azerbaijan's position, especially on Nagorno Karabakh.'</p>

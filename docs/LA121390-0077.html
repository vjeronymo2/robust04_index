			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW MISCHA;  </P> <P> VINTAGE CUISINE;  </P> <P> A MONTECITO WINE STORE HAS GIVEN WAY TO AN ATTRACTIVE, VERY GOOD RESTAURANT.  </P> <P> Once upon a time there was a wine store in Montecito. It was called Wine  Festival -- and it was not selling as much wine as its owners thought it  should.  </P> <P> But the owners had the imagination, and the resources, to turn the store  around. These days there are two signs in front. The old one says "Wine  Festival" (the store); the new one says "Mischa" (the restaurant). The  combination produces a very good restaurant with a very good selection of wines  that can be consumed on or off the premises.  </P> <P> In order to make room for tables while continuing to stock wine, owners Alan  and Mary Jane Matoza had to make the wine shelves a lot higher; it's not  unusual to walk into Mischa and see Alan up on a ladder, searching for a  bottle. While they were condensing the wine display, the Matozas painted the  walls white, laid gray carpet, put in a wine bar, added some vivid paintings on  the walls and a mixture of sophisticated jazz and subdued classical music on  the sound system. The result is one of the area's more relaxed and attractive  rooms.  </P> <P> To complete the metamorphosis, the Matozas hired Michael Ingertson to set up  the menu and the kitchen. On paper, this would not seem an especially astute  move, because Ingertson had no professional restaurant experience. But  Ingertson's meals have turned out to be very professional.  </P> <P> I'd go back any time just for the grilled pork chop, which is cooked with  apples and red onions sauteed with Calvados. On the side is warm red cabbage,  cooked in the German style but not too sweet, and an inventive sweet potato  gratin. The real plus in this dish? The chef's ability to send it out moist and  dripping with juices.  </P> <P> The swordfish is about three quarters of an inch thick, served in what at least  a couple of us call a "fabulous" rosemary aioli sauce. On the side are roasted  red potatoes and a salad of raw zucchini and sweet red peppers, which  beautifully offsets the strong flavors of the aioli.  </P> <P> When we ordered the fish we were told that the chef cooks it medium rare, and  if we wanted it another way we should say so. We didn't say so. It was just  right.  </P> <P> Ingertson's sauces and broths, especially those on the appetizers, are full of  character. I was especially fond of the broth he makes with Chardonnay, cream,  tomato, salt, white pepper and saffron, with mussels, prawns and scallops added  at the last minute. The texture of the fish is attractive, and the saffron is  an inspired touch.  </P> <P> There was a wonderful sauce on an appetizer I ordered one night -- capellini  pasta with mussels and asparagus in a saffron cream. My companion liked it so  much I kept catching her reaching across the table to dip her bread into my  sauce. It had more character, she said, than her own fettuccine with tomatoes  and asparagus in roasted garlic cream. She was right.  </P> <P> I'd also pass on the Hama Hama oysters. The oysters themselves were quite good,  but they were not improved by the champagne sauce with black pepper. And  although a tart of roasted fennel, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, olives and basil  sounded as if it would have some real flavor excitement, it was just too  subtle. The oyster and fennel soup, however, managed to be subtle, subdued and  flavorful, all at the same time.  </P> <P> If you're there for lunch, there are a couple of variations on Mischa's dinner  menu. One is a sandwich of grilled filet steak served on a baguette with  sauteed peppers and onions. The meat is spectacular -- tender and tasty. The  other lunch item of note is also a sandwich -- grilled Gruyere and Monterey  Jack cheeses served with zinfandel-sauteed mushrooms and watercress on  sourdough bread.  </P> <P> The report on Mischa's desserts is mixed. The bread pudding in a cognac sauce  is a winner; it's so good, in fact, you can't help wishing there were more of  it. And it would be hard to beat the homemade ice creams. But as good as they  sound, neither the bourbon-pecan tart with Chantilly cream nor the raspberry  and dark chocolate cream tart lived up to the rest of the menu.  </P> <P> Wine Festival may not have sold a lot of wine, but I hope Mischa is destined to  sell a lot of food.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> Mischa, 1151 Coast Village Road, Montecito, (805) 969-4295.

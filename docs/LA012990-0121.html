			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ATTENTION SHOPPERS: Look for a familiar face smiling out from boxes of Kashi's  "Brittles," a sesame-maple chip snack. . . . It'll be Supervisor Harriett M.  Wieder (above, left), along with husband Irv, daughter Gayle and son-in-law  Phil Tauber (right) and assorted friends, family and pets. . . . The Taubers  own the La Jolla-based Kashi Co. The idea for the box came from their Newport  Beach advertising company, The Richard Holmes organization, several of whose  employees also appear. . . . No word whether the package will be considered  political advertising for Wieder, up for reelection. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve  Emmons  </P></p>

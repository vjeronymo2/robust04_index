			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price not to pay quarterly dividend ABITIBI-PRICE, one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, has suspended its quarterly dividend, blaming sluggish newsprint prices and a need for capital to modernise its mills. Abitibi has been controlled for the past three months by a group of international banks, which have taken over in all but name the 82 per cent stake owned by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property developer. The banks are working towards a decision on whether and how to sell their stake. An Abitibi official said the decision to omit the dividend was unrelated to the change in control, but was entirely dictated by business factors. The last dividend of 12.5 Canadian cents a share was paid in March. The payout was cut from 25 cents in 1989. Mr Ronald Oberlander, chief executive, said the dividend halt was 'in the best long-term interests of our shareholders'. The North American newsprint market bounced earlier this year as customers lifted inventories to protect themselves from a price increase and the possibility of a strike during labour negotiations at mills in eastern Canada. Abitibi suffered a CDollars 148m operating loss last year, and another CDollars 24m (USDollars 18.7m) in the first three months of 1993. Last year's losses were offset by proceeds of CDollars 353m from asset sales, but no similar disposals have taken place so far this year. The company is still seeking buyers for three paper-converting and office products units.</p>

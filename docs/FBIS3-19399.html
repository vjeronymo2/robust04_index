The Tuebing professor of political economy  thought then that the CDU had made serious economic mistakes at  the time of German unification and many of its visionary  thinkers had "steered expectations in the wrong direction." The  chancellor's party, according to Starbatty, had "gone into  neutral in the area of regulatory policy."    Many of his colleagues saw it the same way as well. But  Starbatty, who has been upholding liberal principles as chairman  of the Action League for a Social Free Market Economy since  1991, is now acting accordingly. Since January, the professor,  to whom friends ascribe a "crusading temperament," has been  deputy chairman of the Federation of Free Citizens, on whose  executive committee two other economists of the neoliberal  school also serve: Franz-Ulrich Willeke, a retired economics  professor from Heidelberg, and Bernd Thomas Ramb, an active  businessman with a second job as an nontenured professor in  Siegen. Roland Vaubel, professor of political economy in  Mannheim, collaborated on the new party's platform and wants "to  continue to advise" Brunner's forces "on social and economic  policy issues." He is not even disturbed by the party founder's  closeness to right-wing extremist politicians such as Joerg  Haider, head of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPOe). Vaubel:  "That is only an image that some people want to foist on him."    While other protest parties come to the fore as programmatic  no-names, Brunner's economists are attempting to revive a  brandname item: "Social free-market economics along the lines of  Ludwig Erhard" is the recipe of Starbatty, who himself was  trained in the academic school of Alfred Mueller-Armack, a  fellow traveler of Erhard. The economist is calling for an  all-round renewal through market forces and competition. The  welfare state is allegedly "facing an imminent collapse" and a  "rigid wage system" is supposedly "robbing the unemployed of  opportunity." Individual responsibility must once again "be  granted and be expected." The highly touted social peace,  Starbatty believes, has long been far too costly in this country  and overvalued as an advantage for the location of industry: "It  exists in Great Britain today as well."    The regulatory policy fundamentalists see themselves  agreeing  with prominent colleagues in the matter of their hit election  campaign issue: `no' to a European Monetary Union. In a  sensational manifesto back in 1992, 60 economics professors  declared their opposition to bidding farewell to the German  mark. Integration by agreements from above "will paralyze  competition and centralize risks," warns monetary expert  Franz-Ulrich Willeke, who is particularly rankled by the fact  that "justified reservations" are constantly being dismissed as  "heavy-handed fear-mongering." It is finally time now to shuffle  up the old parties' cartel. Professor Willeke is delighted: "We  are, after all, a social experiment."</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Solicitors face setback in fight for wider rights THE issue of whether solicitors will get wider rights to appear as advocates in the higher courts was thrown into doubt yesterday after the committee set up to advise the Lord Chancellor announced that it wanted to consult as widely as possible before making recommendations. Although the principle of wider rights of audience for solicitors is enshrined in the Courts and Legal Services Act, Lord Griffiths - the Law Lord who heads the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee - said the formal application by the Law Society for extended rights of audience for solicitors represented such a radical change in the present position that the committee felt it was right to consult further. The committee wants to hear from anyone who has an interest in the issue, but will formally seek the views of judges, both branches of the legal profession, government departments, advice agencies, consumer organisations and professional bodies. The Law Society said yesterday that it could not comment on the procedures adopted by the advisory committee. In private, senior solicitors were expressing dismay that the committee seemed intent on reopening the issue instead of accepting the principle of extended rights of audience for solicitors and concentrating on the merits of the society's application. The Bar and the Law Society have been at loggerheads over rights of audience for more than 10 years. In 1986 in an attempt to resolve matters they set up a joint committee of barristers and solicitors under Lady Marre. The Marre committee's report proved inconclusive, and in 1989 the government stepped in to end the dispute. Lord Griffiths hoped the consultation exercise would be completed by the end of July. The process was extremely complex, he said. Even after the committee had considered the society's application, it still had to be approved by the Lord Chancellor, the director general of fair trading and the four designated judges. A veto from any one of them would 'scupper it'. When the society submitted its formal application to the committee at the beginning of this month, it said it hoped solicitors would be able to play a full part in all Crown Court and High Court cases from January next year. That now looks extremely unlikely.</p>

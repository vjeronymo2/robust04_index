			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER FAN IS TIRED OF DICKERSON'S SLAMS  </P> <P> I think Eric Dickerson is out of line in knocking the Rams.  </P> <P> Didn't he sign a contract and then try to deny his signature?  </P> <P> What if he had a bad year? Does that mean the Rams could have said to  Dickerson, "We didn't mean it . . . You're going to make less next year?"  </P> <P> GREG MURPHY  </P> <P> Pacoima  </P></p>

Now the guild is giving producers new  financial incentives to hire its assistant director trainees by offering a 20%  discount on many of their salaries. "It's a way to increase training  opportunities," says the program's administrator, Elizabeth Stanley. Graduates  of the program include such directors as Walter Hill ("48 Hours"), Alan Rudolph  ("The Moderns") and producer Art Levinson ("The Money Pit").  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDERS OF LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> The city that nobody loves?  </P> <P> Balderdash.  </P> <P> L.A. has no defenders?  </P> <P> Nonsense.  </P> <P> What is wrong with Los Angeles?  </P> <P> Not much.  </P> <P> I am here as one defender. I will stand up for L.A. pimples, carbuncles and  all.  </P> <P> I have a feeling Robert A. Jones has been living in and writing about some  other city ("The City That Nobody Loves to Love," Part A, March 20).  </P> <P> I have been here since 1934, so I have seen the changes, some bad, many of the  absolutely fine.  </P> <P> But first off, let me ask Mr. Jones, has he been to Detroit, Chicago or New  York lately? Has he taken a taxi from Kennedy airport through the ghettos on  the way to downtown Manhattan? Has he seen the Third World in Philadelphia?  What about Washington, D.C., an island of pure white marble surrounded by  dumps?  </P> <P> Our slums are Disneyland by comparison.  </P> <P> Not that we don't have much to do. Hollywood needs to be razed and rebuilt.  Little Tokyo has to be integrated by a bright pathway of small shops and lights  to Olvera Street and Chinatown; let's do it! The freeways, one of our biggest  problems, need to be red-and blue-license plated. Red licensed cars to drive  Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, blue licenses Tuesdays, Thursdays and  Saturdays. Sundays? Let everyone. The red and blue license scheme would force  loners to take one extra passenger per trip, every other day. If we are going  to put with this Attractive Nuisance, which is what a freeway is, let's run it  better than Mussolini's railroads.  </P> <P> Transportation? If we reduced all bus fares to a quarter or 50 cents, as we did  10 years ago, we would have 500,000 more riders per day. How many cars would  that take off the streets? When the Long Beach light rail rolls toward L.A. the  fare they will be asking is a buck-twenty-five. Too much. They predict 20,000  riders a day. Not enough. Keep the fare down to 50 cents and you'd get 40,000  or 50,000 riders. Either way, you make roughly the same amount at the fare box.  </P> <P> While we're waiting for the subway to turn north at Fairfax and die in bagel  territory, how about all those monorail lines we spoke of 28 years ago? For the  price of one dim-bulb subway, we could build 12 monorail lines and have them up  in a few years rather than 10 or 12 or 15.  </P> <P> Those are most of our problems. Those are the solutions.  </P> <P> As for feeling alienated by L.A. Everyone knows that cities are people. Paris  is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but if you're there alone,  forget it. Rome, London, New York, are desolate without friends. When our best  friends die, part of the city they lived in dies with them. New friends in far  places relight the lamps, redecorate the tables and improve the wine.  </P> <P> I can only suggest to Mr. Jones and anyone who feels as he does, he has not  made a proper, gentle and loving search for the amiable conversation, the  garden decorated with one or two men or women, which is all we need in any one  town to shift the weather from eternal twilight to our own always summertime  noon.  </P> <P> And along the way, remember, when I got here in Los Angeles in 1934 there was  no Music Center, no theater, no art. Since then, more than 9 theaters have  proliferated, and our musical and dramatic Athens is on the hill. Art  galleries? What's the count as of this year? 100? 150? Some one tell me the  figures. They're there.  </P> <P> So you see, I do not make a mindless defense of my beloved L.A. I am ready with  the criticism, the spot-remover, the transportation, freeway, and city plans.  </P> <P> L.A. is superb. I was allowed to grow and create here without being mobbed and  beaten up by the New York, Paris or London hierarchies of snobs and pedants.  </P> <P> And as I have said often before, L.A.? Is 80 oranges (towns) in search of a  navel. I hope we never find it.  </P> <P> Hey, Bobby Jones, meet me at Farmer's Market some noon. I'll be your friend.  L.A. might not improve right off. But it'll give you hope.  </P> <P> RAY BRADBURY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

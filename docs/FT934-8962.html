			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Three 'interested' in Body Shop Singapore franchise INCHCAPE, Littlewoods and Jusco were all interested in buying the franchise of Body Shop International's Singapore business and head franchises in a number of other Asian countries, Ms Anne Downer, the former head franchisee, claims in the writ she issued against Body Shop. Ms Downer claims Body Shop turned down the three companies as potential purchasers. Body Shop said it could not comment on the three companies, but said it disputed all Ms Downer's claims. It is thought Body Shop did not receive formal offers from the three, which were dealing with Ms Downer. The writ was issued in response to Body Shop's closure of the 11 shops in Singapore. Ms Downer's franchise to operate the Singapore business originally expired in October 1991. After some negotiation she agreed with Body Shop to continue with the franchise until October 29 1993, while trying to sell the business. Any buyer would have to be acceptable to Body Shop. Body Shop said yesterday it had adhered to this agreement at all times. Ms Downer appointed Schroders Asia to handle the sale and it approached a number of possible buyers with an information memorandum. She claimed the three companies had indicated a strong interest in buying the business, but that Body Shop rejected them. Inchcape has international marketing activities, handling the import, distribution and marketing of a number of leading brands in East Asia and occasionally operates retail outlets. Littlewoods is a large chain store operator in the UK. Jusco is an important Japanese retailer, which operates the Body Shop business in Japan. When she had not sold the business by the expiry date, Body Shop was awarded an interim injunction against Ms Downer in Singapore. However, Ms Downer is claiming she was entitled to a further eight week extension of the franchise. The Singapore business accounts for less than 1 per cent of Body Shop's worldwide retail sales. The businesses in other territories where Ms Downer was the head franchisee - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan - are being operated by sub-franchisees.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Ticket test case on Gatwick line RAIL TRAVELLERS to and from Gatwick airport will be allowed to transfer tickets between Gatwick Express and Network SouthEast services, in a test case for the implications of rail privatisation. As a first step towards privatisation, from this weekend the London to Gatwick service is to be split into two separate operations. One management team, acting as a shadow company, will operate the Victoria-Gatwick express service, while Network SouthEast will introduce a cheaper fare to attract customers to its slower services on the same route.</p>

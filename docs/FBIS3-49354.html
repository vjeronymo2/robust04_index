			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, January 8 (BTA) -- The dailies frontpage  comments on the reaction of different officials and institutions  to yesterday's reports in some newspapers, according to which  President Zhelyu Zhelev issued an express decree and a letter,  allegedly intending to take over direct command of the Bulgarian  Army. The Socialists' DUMA writes that Chief of General Staff  Army General Lyuben Petrov took a "sharp and firm" stand against  the powers vested under the letter to the Ministry of Defence  and the General Staff in the chief of the president's military  office and his advisors to supervise the General Staff and have  access to operational information even over the head of the  General Staff. According to unnamed former military, the  document suggested an attempt to shape the military office as a  supervisory body with respect to the Defence Ministry, the  General Staff and the Army as a whole, the newspaper adds. ,    OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes a "well-informed source in the  office of the president" as alleging that the media attack  against Dr. Zhelev is the latest in a series of machinations by  General Stoyan Andreev, Dr. Zhelev's former national security  advisor. The fuss may have originated from the BSP [Bulgarian  Socialist Party] headquarters and was intended as a blow at the  president, according to "knowledgeable" sources quoted in the  trade union daily PODKREPA.    "Socialists, Zhelev conspired in gaffe of  president-requested  powers for military office. General Lyuben Petrov knew about  bid to parallel General Staff, but denies it. Presidential  advisors expected to resign," reads the heading of the story in  DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS).  24 CHASA headlines its coverage "Parliament at War With  Zhelev." "The (anti- communist) SDS will probably side with the  (ex-communist) Bulgarian Socialist Party against Zhelev," the  daily writes editorially.    The president's decree and letter occasioned the meeting  between SDS leader Filip Dimitrov and BSP Chairman Zhan Videnov  a couple of days ago, Mr. Videnov admits in an interview for  KONTINENT. "Politicians, experts say documents on president's  military office are unconstitutional," runs the headline of  another story in the same daily. "This is the latest attempt to  destabilize the situation in the country," says the chief of the  president's military office General Stefan Dimitrov, interviewed  for 24 CHASA. He denied that the military office is assigned  directive functions with respect to the Army. "The legislative  vacuum in the laws on the Armed Forces gives rise to a confusion  as to who is subordinated to whom," STANDART NEWS observes. "I  admit that I was over- credulous and, together with General  Petrov, I signed a directive to the commanders to assist the  implementation of the president's letter," Defence Minister  Valentin Aleksandrov is quoted as saying in TRUD. "How will the  president of the republic get out of the mess in which he was  involved by his military advisors?" asks TRUD in an editorial  commentary.</p>

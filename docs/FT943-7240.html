			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: First National BS dips 16% First National Building Society, the second largest in the Irish Republic, announced a 16 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to IPounds 7.6m (Pounds 7.5m) for the six months to June 30. The society blamed the fall on a reduction in investment income because of bearish sentiment in the bond market. It refused to comment on its bid for Mortgage Trust, SE Banken's UK mortgage operation, which is at the due diligence stage and is expected to be completed within the next four weeks. First National is thought to have offered Pounds 150m for the specialised lender which has mortgage assets of Pounds 760m and about 10,000 borrowers. However, First National could spend more than this, having raised Pounds 225m through a syndicated loan and revolving credit facility last June. The society reported an increase in home mortgage lending from IPounds 90m to IPounds 107m and a reduction in arrears as a percentage of loans from 0.67 per cent at the end of last year to 0.61 per cent at June 30. Overall lending in the first six months was IPounds 121m. Operating profits, excluding gilts trading, were up 25 per cent to IPounds 7.28m but after-tax income rose by just 1 per cent to IPounds 5.1m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Blagov] </F>   [Text] Hanoi April 15 TASS -- The third session of the  Russo-Vietnamese intergovernmental commission for commercial,  economic, scientific and technological cooperation was rounded  off here today by the signing of an agreement on cooperation in  the sphere of communications and of a bilateral protocol.    Taking part in the work of the session was a Russian  delegation led by Vice-Premier Yuriy Yarov. The sides noted  during the final plenary meeting that it was necessary to  promote bilateral economic relations on the basis of a new  mechanism. They agreed to hold the fourth session of the  intergovernmental commission in Moscow in the first quarter of  1995.    Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, Yarov highly assessed the Hanoi  negotiations which focused particularly on problems linked with  the forthcoming visit of Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet to  Russia. "We hope," the Russian vice-premier noted, "that the  visit of the head of the Vietnamese Government to Moscow,  scheduled for June, will be fruitful and will contribute to the  development of mutually advantageous economic cooperation. We  do not intend to give up our positions on the Vietnamese market,  particularly as regards the supply of machinery and equipment,"  Yarov said.    Commenting on the results of the talks, the head of the  Russian delegation told a press conference here today that  Russia and Vietnam were now exerting joint efforts to do away  with the pause that had appeared in their bilateral relations.  "We have devoted special attention to concrete areas of  cooperation, for instance, in the sphere of energetics, oil  extraction and agriculture," he stressed.    The Russian side attaches great importance to the  establishment of direct contacts between the regions of Russia  and the Vietnamese partners. This is why the Russian delegation  included Bashkortostan President Rakhimov and head of the  Krasnoyarsk territorial administration Zubov.    The Russian Government delegation today flew to the city of  Da Nang in central Vietnam.</p>

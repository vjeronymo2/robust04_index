			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: HIDDEN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> A GARDEN OF HISTORY  </P> <P> AS ITS NAME INDICATES, the major attraction of the Los Angeles State and County  Arboretum is the plant and garden displays. But set off on the edge of a pond  in a lush, wooded section of the grounds is a collection of romantic structures  rich with the area's architectural and social history.  </P> <P> It includes a fanciful Queen Anne cottage that "Lucky " Baldwin built for his  14-year-old bride in 1875 (if it looks familar it is because it has served as  the setting for television's "Fantasy Island"). There are also a coach barn and  a traditionally styled adobe, doors open and inviting, evoking Old California.  </P> <P>  The Arboretum, located at 301 N. Baldwin Ave., Arcadia, (818) 446-8251, is  open daily 9 to 4:30. Admission charges vary.  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN  </P></p>

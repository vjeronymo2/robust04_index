			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Sarajevo shelled as aid returns SERBIAN tanks yesterday fired shells on Sarajevo just after the relief supply route to the besieged Bosnian capital was reopened. At least 17 people died and 150 wounded were taken to city hospitals after the artillery and tank attack yesterday morning, which Bosnian military leaders said was started by Serbs in retaliation for a breakdown in negotiations over exchanging bodies of those killed in earlier battles. Hundreds of tonnes of food and medicine yesterday were awaiting delivery to Sarajevo after a four-day dispute between Bosnian and United Nations commanders over control of the road from the airport to the city was ended. Citing a planned Serbian advance, Bosnian forces on Thursday had blocked the road, used to bring international aid from the airport to the 380,000 inhabitants trapped by a Serbian siege for nearly seven months. Commanders yesterday said they were lifting their blockade out of concern for the people of Sarajevo, whose lives depended on the vital supply route. The city for weeks has been without electricity and water. While the airport road was reopened, United Nations officials said the shipment of aid along the overland route from Mostar, southern Bosnia-Hercegovina, at the weekend was suspended after two convoys of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees were shelled. In addition to food and medicines, relief workers plan to distribute plastic sheeting for roofs and windows. Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, yesterday appealed for the Serbian siege round Sarajevo to be lifted and for the demilitarisation of the city. Before flying from Belgrade to Geneva for talks with Croatian and Bosnian leaders, Mr Cosic said: 'It is not to fulfil international demands and get the sanctions lifted but because of a moral and humane need to end the suffering.' Mr Cosic, a well-known writer who has wielded great influence in Serbian politics, called on Friday for the resignation of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, seen by the international community as the chief instigator of the violence in Bosnia. Reuter adds from Belgrade: UN human rights investigator Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former Polish prime minister, said yesterday that rights in Serbia's volatile Kosovo province were being seriously abused. Speaking a day after his return from the province, which has an ethnic Albanian majority, he warned of civil unrest there.</p>

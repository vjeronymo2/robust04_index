			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, RSPA informed industry that the following items would be open for discussion at the March public meeting:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Application of the ASME Code to DOT 400-series specification cargo tank motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The feasibility of citing all sections of the ASME Code that must be met in construction of DOT specification cargo tank motor vehicles as opposed to citing only those sections that do not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The development of a consensus standard containing procedures for quality control, welding and design as an alternative to the procedures contained in the ASME Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The progress of the industry on development and testing of dual function vents, reclosing pressure relief devices capable of reseating with the loss of less than one gallon of lading, and self-closing systems for vacuum-loaded hazardous waste tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The regulatory proposals contained in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most commenters supported application of the ASME Code. One commenter stated that his company, which had initially opposed becoming ASME certified, has benefited from the expertise of the National Board inspector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ASME Code is an internationally recognized consensus standard for the design and construction of pressure vessels. It is also the only proven quality control standard for pressure vessels and cargo tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Cargo Tank Manufacturing Association (CTMA) submitted a draft quality control manual for review. CTMA recommended that RSPA recognize the manual, which includes quality control procedures, as an alternative to requiring manufacturers to have an ASME ``U'' stamp or National Board ``R'' stamp. The use of the alternative standard recommended by CTMA is not equivalent in scope and detail to the ASME Code and is not included in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has also been brought to RSPA's attention that some ``U'' stamp and ``R'' stamp holders may believe they are not required to apply all provisions of the ASME or National Board quality control program for work on non-ASME DOT specification cargo tanks. When the regulations requiring cargo tank manufacturers and repair facilities to hold ``U'' and ``R'' stamps were promulgated, RSPA stated in the preamble discussions of the final rules and at public meetings that major provisions of the ASME or National Board quality control programs would apply to all work on DOT specification cargo tanks. Such provisions include welder qualifications, welding techniques, and quality control procedures. For instance, refer to the preamble discussions in the following final rules: ``B. Cargo Tank: Manufacturer Qualification, Registration, Quality Control, and Certification,'' (June 12, 1989, 54 FR 24984); ``Section 180.413 (Repair, Modification, Stretching, and Rebarrelling),'' (September 7, 1990, 55 FR 37044).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems touch nerve over rail privatisation OFF-PEAK rail services to Christchurch are to be cut by half from this autumn, the Liberal Democrats claimed yesterday as rail privatisation and law and order dominated opening exchanges in the first week of by-election campaigning. Mr Nick Harvey, MP for Devon North and the party's transport spokesman, said off-peak services from London to the Dorset seaside town would be 'slashed' from two trains per hour to one from October as part of a 'slim-down' to pave the way for privatisation. As the party sought to exploit discontent at the government's sell-off plans, Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat candidate, released the results of a survey showing an overwhelming majority of local people wanted through ticketing and discount cards to continue after privatisation. 'It is all too apparent that rail privatisation has become one of the most unpopular policies of an already unpopular government,' Mrs Maddock said. As Network SouthEast said its winter timetable plans had yet to be finalised, Mr Robert Hayward, the Tory candidate, described the predictions of impending service cuts as 'speculation'. Mr Hayward - the former MP for Kingswood and a strong supporter of rail privatisation - has made no bones about his views on the subject being very different from those of rail enthusiast Mr Robert Adley, the maverick Tory MP whose death prompted the by-election. The Conservatives, who are defending a majority of 23,000 in what promises to be a crucial test of Mr John Major's battered authority, used a visit by Mr David Maclean, a home office minister, to attack the Liberal Democrats' record on law and order, described by Mr Maclean as the 'key issue' of the July 29 by-election. But with no member of the cabinet having yet set foot in Christchurch, there is an impression the Tory campaign has got off to a slow start. Law and order was also touched on by Labour during a visit by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader. Mr Nigel Lickley, the Labour candidate, said Labour had recently tabled proposals in the Commons that would aid crime prevention, reduce crime and curb offending while on bail.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dear listeners of the Voice of the Islamic  Republic of Iran. As you know, ceremonies were held today, on  the orders of the exalted leader of the Islamic Revolution, His  Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, for the martyrs of the immaculate  shrine of Imam Reza on the day of Ashura at Shahid Motahhari  College.    Dr. Hasan Ruhani, deputy speaker of the Islamic Consultative  Assembly, delivered an address at the gathering, which we will  hear together.    [Begin Ruhani recording] In the name of God, the  compassionate, the merciful. [passage omitted]    Since the beginning of the glorious victory of the Islamic  revolution of Iran, our honorable nation has been faced with  various incidents. Our people have witnessed numerous crimes by  the arrogant powers and their mercenaries. But possibly no  disaster or incident has been as tragic as the incident on the  evening of the day of Ashura at the immaculate shrine of the  eighth imam. That is so not because a group of our pilgrims  were cut to pieces and bathed in blood while worshipping and  praying, since from the beginning of the revolution until now  our honorable and loyal nation has offered many martyrs to our  revolution. The tragedy is important from another point of  view, and that is the violation of the sanctity of the shrine  and the sacredness of the shrine of the innocent eighth imam --  greetings and blessings be upon him -- in the evening of the day  of Ashura at the time when the people's sentiments and emotions  toward the leader of martyrs are at their zenith. And that  great tragedy occurred by the side of the shrine of the eighth  Imam and the mosque, by his head.    That tragedy does not merely concern the world Shiites and  the people of Iran. That tragedy concerns all Muslims and all  the freedom-loving people of the world. From the point of view  of any Muslim the household of honor and purity enjoys a  particular and special respect.    All Islamic sects respect the family of the Prophet and the  family of purity and innocence. [passage omitted] In the case  of this bombing, as far as all Muslims are concerned, the  sanctity of the Prophet's family, the mosque, and prayer have  been violated. Innocent Muslims were killed at prayer. [passage  omitted]    Why did the enemy plan this great tragedy? Why is this  calamity unbearable for the brave Muslim people of Iran?  Regarding the first question, let us start the discussion from  this point: Who has not benefitted from Islam, Shiism, genuine  Islam, the Ashura of Aba Abdullah, the shrine of the eighth  imam, and the school of the family of the prophet? The faces of  which powers have been slapped? If today, Iran's Islamic  revolution stands as a strong dam against the moves of  arrogance, and if today the power of the Islamic Republic of  Iran as the center of all Islamic movements which resist  arrogance and oppression...[unfinished sentence as heard]  [passage omitted]    It is clear to us why the world arrogance designed and  implemented the explosion at the shrine of the eighth imam, and  at the time of Ashura. The bomb attack was carried out by the  mercenaries who consider 20 June 1981 to be important. Their  masters, who are the real plotters, the arrogant powers -- these  mercenary grouplets have been nurtured in their laps, and  continue their shameful life today under their protection. The  arrogant powers themselves know very well from where the  principal blow against them has come; it comes from the Ashura  front [howze-ye Ashura], the family of the Prophet's front and  by the honorable and brave Iranian nation, which moves along the  path of the Prophet's family. The world arrogance seeks to take  its revenge on the Iranian nation. The world arrogance seeks to  deal its heaviest blow against the immaculate sentiments of the  Muslim people of this land. [passage omitted] They have  committed crimes which do not seem rational by any logic. If a  grouplet has the slightest hope of coming to power in a place it  does not commit actions which result in general hatred toward  it. But a grouplet can reach a point where its only task is to  be the mercenary of the world arrogance and nothing else. I ask  you: Has any grouplet acted in such way -- to go toward and  become part of the enemy while the nation was fighting a  defensive war; to fight, and even worse, to spy for the enemy in  order to kill one's own people? When Iraqi pilots were captured  during the war they would be asked in their debriefings: Why  did you have to bomb residential centers and not the city  outskirts? You would have carried out your mission and would not  have killed so many people. The pilots would say: Our problem  is the Mojahedin-e Khalq [MKO]; we would have bombed the  outskirts, but as soon as we bombed, the MKO informed Baghdad of  the whereabouts of the attack. If we did not attack residential  areas our lives would be in danger.    Is there a comparison to this in history? Which mercenary  has ever spied in such manner against its own people and against  innocent women and children in cities and villages? Do you know  of a similar case? This grouplet has reached a dead end. It  has to accept the truth, which it will not do. It never did.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Saddam's killing field In justifying the US reluctance to become involved in the internal affairs of Iraq, American commentators have tended to draw parallels with Lebanon. But a more appropriate analogy for understanding Iraq's internal situation in the wake of the Gulf war would be Cambodia. The whole of Iraq, excluding the areas zoned off by the allied forces, has been turned into a giant killing field by the ruling Ba'ath party. The primary purpose of this carnage is to extinguish hope in any alternative to the present system. To fulfil this intention the Ba'ath has to eliminate many more people than ever rose up in arms against it. Given the scale of the destruction of the war, and the onerous terms of the ceasefire resolution, the only way that the regime can now survive is through genocide on a scale similar to that practised by the Khmer Rouge. The Iraqis who remain will then agree to live in near 'apocalyptic conditions' just as the Cambodians did. True, there was an uprising and it was crushed by what remains of the state's machinery of repression. But an uprising is not a civil war, although it may eventually turn into one. Iraqis rose principally because they placed responsibility for the catastrophe that had befallen their country upon their own government. They rose as Iraqis, not as Kurds or Shias. Nor were they suppressed just by a minority Sunni regime, but by troops from all sects who over the years had become bound up with the Ba'ath through complicity in acts of violence. Some sections of largely Sunni Baghdad did not revolt, for instance, while the Sunni town of Zubayr in the south did. In its origins, therefore, the uprising in Iraq was not about sectarian or ethnic hatreds. But the regime, as the orders it gave its forces in the north to conduct mass shootings of demonstrators show, is now trying to create a new internal constituency held together by the notion that what is at stake is a war to the finish between Arabs and Kurds. Similarly in the south the uprising was suppressed by indiscriminate killing (which is still going on) and the deliberate inculcation of Sunni-Shia sectarianism. The Republican Guard began by targeting civilian areas. Residential neighbourhoods were shelled from city outskirts using tanks and artillery. Tanks rolled into Shia neighbourhoods with the phrase 'no more Shias after today' painted on their armour. People were hunted down from house to house and killed. Whole families were found in Kerbala knifed to death. Women and children were hung from the turrets of tanks as human shields. Bodies were stripped, mutilated and piled on pavements. Each member of the Republican Guard was awarded 200 dinars for the killing of a Shia and instructed to shoot males over the age of 15 on sight. It is measures like these, and 22 years of knowing what the Iraqi Ba'ath are capable of, that have led people to flee their cities and towns in an exodus of almost Biblical proportions. As it grapples reluctantly with what is happening in Iraq, the outside world should realise this simple fact: there is no way of avoiding both interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and mass murder. The UN Security Council has called the refugee problem in Iraqi Kurdistan a 'threat to international peace and security' - indirectly recognising that the regime in Baghdad represents a grave threat to the very existence of the people of Iraq. Similarly the ceasefire agreement which preceded it is itself all about the world's long-term and indefinite involvement in internal Iraqi affairs - through, for example, the establishment of elaborate procedures for the elimination of nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry. The problem with the ceasefire agreement is not that it interferes but that it does not interfere enough. By stressing non-intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq, the document penalises an entire population for the murderous crimes of its regime. In this sense it is modelled after the Versailles Treaty at the end of the First World War which so overburdened Germany as to give rise to the politics of extremism which ultimately culminated in the Second World War. The right and proper approach to the termination of such an enormous event as the Gulf war is the one pioneered by the US at the end of the Second World War. Then, the victors reached out to help those they had defeated. But that kind of political imagination is sorely lacking in the world today. In its absence the march of events by itself is making the argument for non-intervention in Iraq's internal affairs slip even in the minds of some of its hardest advocates. The idea of protected enclaves is an illustration of this. It needs to be immediately and more boldly implemented by the UN both in the north and the south of Iraq to ease the terrible suffering of the refugees. The Iraqi army and all repressive agencies of the government must vacate these zones fully and adequate UN forces must be provided to protect the areas. These UN protected zones are of course only necessary pending the establishment of civilised government in Iraq. But to establish such a government will almost certainly require direct action by allied or UN forces.

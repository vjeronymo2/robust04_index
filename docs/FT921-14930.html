			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Yeltsin pressed to yield post of PM: Head of Russian parliament warns it may sack cabinet in protest at soaring prices PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday came under strong pressure to resign from his post as prime minister amid increasingly fierce criticism of the Russian government's decision to free prices. Mr Yeltsin's press secretary denied rumours that he was quitting as head of the cabinet of ministers, but government advisers said he was under mounting pressure to do so. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, said during a discussion with Italian senators that now was the time for Mr Yeltsin to replace the 'incompetent' cabinet - or else the parliament would vote it out of office. He added that Mr Yeltsin should 'distance himself' from the government, since 'a president is a person standing, as it were, above the state'. The cold blast of public distaste for price rises which in some cases have increased by as much as 30 times is now blowing through the corridors of power, as deputies and officials hear from furious constituents, and as demonstrations, the largest organised by hard-line Communists, begin to gather force. Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, was hauled over the coals by the presidium of the Russian parliament, the forum in which Mr Khasbulatov made a speech calling for the government to go. Mr Khasbulatov's remarks, following a trip to provincial cities over the weekend to see the level of dissatisfaction at first hand, were followed by a report by the Interfax news agency that several people were being canvassed as prime ministerial material. These included Mr Khasbulatov himself, Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg, and Mr Svyatoslav Feodorov, an eye surgeon, and formerly a candidate for the post. Mr Alexei Trepekhalin, an aide to Mr Khasbulatov, said last night that 'the chairman has no intention of becoming prime minister, and will stay as chairman'. However, his defection to the ranks of the government's critics means that two highly placed critics - he and Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, - are in open revolt against the government. The high prices are also stimulating calls for the government's resignation in Ukraine.</p>

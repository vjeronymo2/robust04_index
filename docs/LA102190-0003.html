			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I watched with growing dismay the CBS movie debut of "E.A.R.T.H. Force" (not  presently on CBS' schedule).  </P> <P> Plutonium bandits? Assault rifles? Paramilitary operations? The producers of  this farce are clueless to the meaning and practice of "environmentalism."  </P> <P> If the hours of Environmental Impact Statement reading, public hearings and  conferences supportive to a legitimate program of "Ecodefense" are insufficient  to enrapture television viewers nationwide, so be it. Should the program  survive I propose a name change to "G.R.E.E.N. Scam" -- a term applied to the  prostitution of "environmentalism" for personal or political gain.  </P> <P> Patraic Kelly, Vice Chairperson  </P> <P> Sierra Club, San Gorgonio Chapter  </P></p>

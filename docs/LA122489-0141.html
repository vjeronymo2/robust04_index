			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BOXING;  </P> <P> IN AND OUT OF RING, '89 WAS A BUST  </P> <P> Ring out the old, ring in the new. Some people like to look back at messy auto  accidents and natural disasters. We here at Newsday settle for a look at the  recent pugilistic past. In that spirit, here is a look at 1989, a year that  will live in ennui, if not infamy, in the annals of boxing.  </P> <P> January: The year starts with a thud. No major bouts except for Tyson-King  &amp; attorneys vs. Cayton &amp; attorneys in Las Vegas. On Jan. 10, Tyson  knocks out six packs of peppermint tic tacs and a couple of rolls of Lifesavers  while giving a deposition. The next day, however, he is stopped cold by a young  female attorney whom he propositions during a break in the testimony.  </P> <P> February: The fighting returns to the ring Feb. 24 when Roberto Duran, ol'  Hands of Stone, trims down his belly of mush and out-hustles Iran Barkley to  win the World Boxing Council middleweight crown, Duran's fourth world title.  Duran rocks Barkley early, survives a hook that spins him around in the eighth  and drops The Blade in the 11th to edge out a split decision. The Fight of the  Year -- sorry, it doesn't get any better than this.  </P> <P> The next day, Tyson returns to the ring after an eight-month absence, against  Frank Bruno, an opponent considered an even-money bet not to last the first  round. But last he does. Despite being floored in the first 15 seconds, Bruno  gets up to shake Tyson with a left hook but then raises the white flag. The  bout ends in the fifth with Bruno's back to the ropes and his eyes on the  referee as Tyson pounds away.  </P> <P> Out of this sloppy mess comes the line of the year, from Tyson: "How dare they  challenge me with their primitive skills." Indeed.  </P> <P> March: A big month that goes out like a lion -- Michael Nunn-Sumbu Kalambay --  and starts with a sham -- Hector Camacho-Ray Mancini. On March 6, Boom Boom and  The Macho Man do boxing's version of the Road Runner vs. the Coyote in a bout  appropriately promoted by Warner Bros., the cartoon factory. Camacho dances  rings around Mancini to win a dull and unpopular split decision in Reno, Nev.  </P> <P> Five days later comes a real fight -- Evander Holyfield-Michael Dokes at  Caesars Palace. The two heavyweights go toe-to-toe for 10 rounds until Dokes,  depleted by years of drug abuse and inactivity, finally runs out of gas. By far  Holyfield's toughest test, and a game enough effort by Dokes that it earned  him, for a time, consideration as a Tyson opponent. That is, until Don King  found he could get other, easier opponents for Tyson a lot cheaper.  </P> <P> The month ends with the punch of the year -- the roundhouse left landed by Nunn  on the jaw of Kalambay, ending their March 25 International Boxing Federation  middleweight title bout after only 88 seconds. The cry goes up -- Nunn's not a  runner, he's a puncher. Mirage of the year.  </P> <P> April: Busy month of mostly bad fights. WBC featherweight champ Jeff Fenech  beats Marcos Villasana in a 12-round war but retires after the bout. The  reason? Chronic bad hands, which break at the pre-fight handshake. World Boxing  Association welterweight champ Mark Breland stops Rafael Pineda but tears up  his knee and undergoes surgery. Orlin Norris sleepwalks past Greg Page. IBF  welter champ Simon Brown swats Al "Bumblebee" Long in seven.  </P> <P> IBF lightweight champ Pernell Whitaker blasts out Louie Lomeli in three.  </P> <P> May: By WBA decree, Mike McCallum and Herol Graham, two fighters who were  beaten by Kalambay, somehow are picked to fight for his title, which was lifted  when Kalambay signed to fight Nunn. McCallum wins a decision. WBC-WBA  lightweight champ Julio Cesar Chavez wins Roger Mayweather's WBC junior  welterweight title by TKO when Mayweather quits after round 10.  </P> <P> June: Sugar Ray Leonard kisses the canvas twice, Thomas Hearns kisses his  sister and promoter Bob Arum kisses Mike Trainer's aspirations in the wake of  another closed-circuit blockbuster. "The War" is a draw as Leonard and Hearns  fight 12 stirring rounds at Caesars Palace. Hearns deserves better but settles  for the satisfaction of sprinkling Sugar on the canvas in Rounds 3 and 11 and  surviving a furious Round 12. He also gets paid well -- $11 million to  Leonard's $12.5 million -- but there seems little left for him in boxing.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Leonard, Arum and Trainer are plotting to do Leonard-Duran III  -- Uno Mas -- for mucho mas dinero.  </P> <P> July: Holyfield tries to upstage Tyson with a second-round KO of Brazil's  Adilson "Maguila" Rodrigues in Tahoe, but Tyson makes a monkey out of both of  them a week later. Tyson needs 93 seconds to stretch "The Truth," Carl  Williams, in his second title defense of the year. That's two full seconds  longer than it took him to ice Michael Spinks in 1988, and the outcome thrusts  referee Randy Neumann into the spotlight for stopping the bout with Williams on  his feet, seemingly ready to continue. So what if he was answering Neumann's  questions in Latin?  </P> <P> August: The Flying Nunn returns. Nunn flees like a butterfly and stings like a  flea against Barkley in winning a decision on the 14th in Reno. Afterward,  promoter Bob Arum castigates Nunn and releases him from a promotional contract.  Sally Field sues to regain her nickname.  </P> <P> September: Mismatch month: IBF junior welterweight champ Meldrick Taylor, in  his first start after undergoing knee surgery in March, outpoints Courtney  Hooper on the 11th in Atlantic City, N.J., and WBC welterweight champ Marlon  Starling paints Young-Kil Chung for 12 one-sided rounds in Hartford, Conn., on  the 15th.  </P> <P> On the 20th, IBF welterweight champ Simon Brown blasts out used-up Bobby Joe  Young in two in Rochester, N.Y.  </P> <P> October: The return of Terrible Tim as former heavyweight champ Witherspoon,  now aligned with Dennis "The Menace" Rappaport, knocks out Sweden's Anders  Eklund in one round and immediately calls for Tyson, Holyfield, George Foreman  and a room-service menu -- not necessarily in that order.  </P> <P> November: Holyfield struggles to an eighth-round KO over Alex Stewart, who  before the bout is given as much chance as Foreman in the Miss America Pageant.  Tyson is KO'd again, this time by a "rib inflammation" that causes his  scheduled Nov. 18 defense against Razor Ruddock to be postponed, and then  canceled. Tyson, who fought 32 times in his first three years as a pro,  finishes 1989 with just two fights -- the same as Leonard and Duran, who are 10  and 15 years his senior, respectively.  </P> <P> December: The year -- and the decade -- are supposed to end with a bang when  Duran and Leonard meet for the third time, on Pearl Harbor Day, at a new Las  Vegas hotel called the Mirage. But the only mirage is the fight, which is a  boring 12-round waltz won easily by Leonard, who comes into the ring wearing a  ski cap but would be more at home in top hat, white tie and tails. Duran messes  up Leonard's dance party with a right hand and a head butt that open two cuts  in the 11th, but it is too late. Duran ($8 million) and Leonard ($15 million)  cry all the way to the cashier's cage as the crowd boos. Bust of the year.  </P> <P> Assessment: A poor year overall. One great fight: Duran-Barkley, some good ones  (Holyfield-Dokes, Leonard-Hearns, Holyfield-Stewart) and no standout  performers. A shaky Fighter of the Year vote to Holyfield, who won three fights  but lost support among people who thought he might test Tyson. Holyfield's  trainer, Professor George Benton, deserves Trainer of the Year for his work  with Evander and Meldrick Taylor. Manager of the Year is John Reetz, the madman  behind Barkley, who raised the purses of the former clubfighter to world-class  status. Promoter of the Year goes to Camacho, for continuing to make the public  care about him despite declining performances.  </P></p>

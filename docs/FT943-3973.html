			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Swedish PM hopes for swing to right Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's reformist prime minister, urgently needs voters to swing to the right if he is not to lose power to the tenacious Social Democratic party in next Sunday's general election. The Social Democrats, under the leadership of former prime minister Ingvar Carlsson, are expected to perform strongly enough to form a government, probably seeking an unusual alliance with the Liberal party, a member of Mr Bildt's minority right-centre coalition, to reach a majority. In the absence of any single party or Bildt-led majority government, such a coalition would almost certainly be welcomed by the financial markets as the best prospect for producing a credible fiscal policy to attack Sweden's big budget deficit and spiralling public debt. An opinion poll in yesterday's Svenska Dagbladet newspaper offered Mr Bildt some hope, showing his government gaining some ground over the past week. However, it still trailed the Social Democrats by 46.7 per cent to 41.1 per cent. A good showing for the Social Democrats would represent a significant rebound from the slump to 37.7 per cent 1991. The strongest trend in recent polls has been to the left, with the former communists of the Left party and the Environment party gaining sharply following a Social Democratic commitment to cut some welfare spending. But Mr Carlsson and Mr Goran Persson, the shadow finance minister, have made it clear they prefer co-operation on economic policy across the traditional political blocs - perhaps including the Centre party as well as the Liberals  -rather than relying on their erstwhile allies on the left for a parliamentary majority. This, they believe, would convince the markets the deficit can be tackled and bring an early fall in interest rates which, at around 11 per cent on five-year government bonds, have already begun to erode recovery from a deep three-year recession. Mr Bengt Westerberg, the leader of the Liberal party, has clearly signalled his willingness to work with the Social Democrats if the present coalition cannot form a new government and the Social Democrats accept his party's emphasis on creating favourable conditions for private sector companies.</p>

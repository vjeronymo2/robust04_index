			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bavaria to sell 8% stake in Deutsche Aerospace THE GERMAN state of Bavaria yesterday confirmed it will sell its 8.58 per cent stake in Deutsche Aerospace by the end of the year. The sale is expected to raise DM400m (Dollars 233m). The stake, which will be sold to Daimler-Benz, the parent company of Dasa, follows Bavaria's announcement on Friday of plans to sell its 58.3 per cent stake in Bayerwerk, the country's third largest utility, to Viag, the large energy-based conglomerate. The announcement coincides with plans by Dasa to axe 8,000 workers by the end of 1994 in response to recent budget cuts and the economic downturn in Germany. Last year, Dasa recorded a loss of Dollars 217m on a turnover of Dollars 11bn. The speed in which Mr Edmund Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria, has pressed ahead with privatisation appears to point to a two-pronged strategy by the Bavarian government. On the one hand, by reducing state interference in the economy, it hopes to attract large conglomerates to Bavaria. On the other, the Bavarian government intends to promote an indigenous high-tech industry in the state.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems revise policy on spending cuts - Defence LIBERAL DEMOCRATS yesterday diluted the party's most radical policies for long-term UK defence spending cuts as Labour sought to turn job losses in defence-related industries into an election issue. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, launched a revised policy paper which no longer sets an aspiration of a 50 per cent cut in UK defence spending by 2000. It calls instead for a comprehensive review of security needs. In the short term, defence cuts or orders for new weapons systems already announced should be halted until after the review, the paper says, but it still hopes for eventual, 'significant reductions'. The party suggests, however, that technological advances mean fewer nuclear warheads are needed on the four new Trident submarines than on the existing Polaris system. The introduction of tactical air-to-surface missiles (Tasm) is also rejected. The party has been vulnerable on defence before, in spite of Mr Ashdown's widely respected authority built during the Gulf war, because of its commitment to cuts. The latest document reflects his belief that, although not top of the election agenda, a sound defence policy is a prerequisite for a successful campaign. Meanwhile, Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said Labour had no plans for cutting defence spending and promised that a Labour government would stop job losses from defence-related companies. Labour would set up a defence diversification agency jointly between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence. The agency would have a small budget from within existing defence expenditure to help companies with re-training and finding new markets. Labour would use the UK's presidency of the European Community from June to press for a European defence conversion fund. Mr Kaufman said: 'The choice is between a Tory party which is responsible for a quarter of a million and upward job losses in defence industries and a Labour government which will take positive action, in co-operation with the defence industries, to deal with this problem and ensure that those skills are not lost to the nation.' The prime minister yesterday expressed his admiration for Britain's armed forces one year after the end of the Gulf war. But he warned: 'The way in which Saddam Hussein still behaves is unacceptable to us, unacceptable to the United Nations, unacceptable to the international community, and we will continue to put pressure on him.'</p>

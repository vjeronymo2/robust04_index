			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: An English patriot takes on Welsh role A SUCCESSFUL Tory rightwinger, an able and astute politician and, at heart, a patriotic Englishman, Mr John Redwood's promotion yesterday to the cabinet was unsurprising. But his appointment as Welsh secretary was, to say the least, controversial. Mr Redwood's elevation from local government minister - after just four years in ministerial office - helps balance left and right in Mr John Major's cabinet. Yet in the principality it threatens to reverse a decade of government interventionism quite unlike the Tories' economic management elsewhere. Mr David Hunt, the departing Welsh secretary who was born in Wales and whose Wirral constituency is at least nearby, was proud of his near-Keynesian attempts at employment creation. His three years in the job were punctuated almost daily by press notices on jobs created by Welsh Office initiatives. But Mr Redwood, 41, is Conservative MP for Wokingham, a town linked to Wales only by the M4 motorway. He is a crusader for populist capitalism, a former head of the Number 10 policy unit under Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher, and a member of the Thatcherite No Turning Back Group. Mr Dafydd Wigley, MP for Caernarfon and president of Plaid Cymru, said Mr Redwood's appointment was 'ominous and ill-considered'. Mr Redwood is not a believer in the paraphernalia of regional economic development. His relationship with the Welsh Development Agency will be an early marker of his style of stewardship. He will also preside over reorganisation of Welsh local government. Nor is Mr Redwood a natural European. Privately, he has described himself as an English nationalist. Last night Mr Redwood admitted he had no Welsh connections but said on BBC radio: 'I have been a regular visitor to Wales.' He denied Labour protests that he was a 'hatchet man' brought in to slash public spending in Wales. Mr Hunt moves to the Department of Employment, where his presentational skills will be tested as the government faces relentlessly high levels of unemployment. He will be eager to develop the plethora of government schemes for the jobless, although as a one-nation Tory he is unlikely to be keen on the workfare schemes being floated by rightwing Tories. Mrs Gillian Shephard moves from the employment department to agriculture. To some at Westminster the step represented a demotion, but with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other trade issues on the political agenda, her profile will remain high. Three ministers were sacked by Mr Major after failing to impress government business managers. Mr Edward Leigh, the Thatcherite junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Kenneth Carlisle, junior transport minister, and Mr Robert Jackson, junior minister at the Office of Public Service and Science. Among those promoted were Mr William Hague, who was parliamentary private secretary to Mr Lamont. He becomes a junior social security minister. Rightwinger Miss Anne Widdecombe switches from the Department of Social Security to the employment department where she may take responsibility for womens' issues.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Charles Love - bank chief: Obituary Mr Charles Love, the chief executive of Clydesdale Bank and a prominent figure in the Scottish business community, died suddenly on Tuesday while on holiday in France. Mr Love, aged 48, had been chief executive of Clydesdale for little over a year. He was appointed in succession to Mr Richard Cole-Hamilton, after joining the bank earlier in 1992. Sir David Nickson, the bank's chairman, said it was 'particularly tragic to lose someone who, nearing the peak of a brilliant and successful career, still had much more to give both to the bank and to the community at large'. Mr Love was a popular and influential figure, whose death would have implications that would be widely felt, he said. Mr Love was born in Midlothian and educated at Musselburgh Grammar School. He spent much of his career at the TSB, where he became chairman of TSB Asset Finance in 1989 and branch banking director of TSB Bank in 1991. He was chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland between 1990 and 1992. Mr Love held a number of senior positions in public life. He was appointed deputy chairman of the Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers in 1991 and was a member of the CBI Scottish Council between 1990 and 1992. He also served with the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland and the Scottish Council Development and Industry. He is survived by his wife June and by a son and daughter.</p>

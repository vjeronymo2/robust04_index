			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Georg Fischer back in black at SFr31m Georg Fischer, the foundries and engineering group, returned to the black in the first half with a SFr31m (Dollars 23.4m) consolidated net income compared with a SFr33m loss in the same period last year. The directors attributed the swing to the elimination of loss making activities and 'the friendlier economic environment in Europe'. They forecast a profit of more than SFr50m for the full year. 'The turnround was achieved', Mr Ulrich Bremi, chairman, said in a letter to shareholders. The group, which is heavily dependent on sales of components to the motor industry, slumped to a nominal SFr11m profit in 1992 and then into a SFr34m loss last year. It closed down or sold several lossmaking businesses and improved productivity of core operations. Value added per employee was 16 per cent higher in the first half of 1994 than the same period of 1993. Sales in the first half were up 2 per cent to SFr1.1bn, but billings rose 9 per cent to SFr1.06bn. Fischer said the increase was 14 per cent in local currencies. New orders were up 8 per cent to SFr1.1bn. The automotive products division, with billings up 2 per cent to SFr364m, improved its earnings. The piping systems division also recorded a higher profit on a modest 2 per cent rise in billings to SFr280m.</p>

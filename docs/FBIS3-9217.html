On March 4, 91 state radio employees were dismissed and  38 sent to retirement, including several leading editors and  reporters.    Opposition parties accuse the government of having given  their tacit support for the firings, which also affected a  number of journalists known for their oppositional views. The  ruling parties have repeatedly stressed the independence of  radio leadership in the dismissals, and the government's lack of  influence in the decision.    Hungarian Radio presently has a workforce of about 2,000.  Radio leaders explained the sackings in terms of budgetary  constraints.    IFJ's fact-finding committee, including first IFJ  Vice-President Gustl Glattfelder, British Journalist Trade Union  Secretary-General Jacob Ecclestone and Austrian Journalist  Federation Vice-President Paul Vecsey, examined the situation at  Hungarian Radio.    Glattfelder said they have not yet finished the inquiry and  will present their report to the IFJ directorate at a later date.    However, they summed up recommendations in four points after  meeting with Hungarian Radio Vice-President Laszlo Csucs, Prime  Minister's Cabinet Chief Endre Marinovich and Prime Minister's  Office State Secretary Jozsef Kajdi.    The IFJ delegation recommends that the dismissed be returned  to their posts; that an ethical code be drawn up and published  for the election campaign (the first round of Hungary's  parliamentary elections will be held on May 8); that an  independent parliamentary committee look into the radio's  economic situation; and the new parliament give preference to  the drafting of a media law after the elections.    Answering questions, Glattfelder said, "It is our belief  that  the radio employees were dismissed for political reasons."</p>

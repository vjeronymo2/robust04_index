			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> PIETSCH'S PREDICTION TURNS OUT TO BE A WINNING ONE  </P> <P> Robbie Pietsch tried to tell everybody that things were going to be different  on the basketball court this season, but few believed him.  </P> <P> Pietsch, a senior forward for El Modena High School, went around telling his  friends that the Vanguards were going to win the Century League title.  </P> <P> It was a tough sell.  </P> <P> After all, El Modena was coming off a 10-12 season and a fourth-place finish in  league play. And then there was the fact that Santa Ana had won four of the  past five titles, including the last three in a row.  </P> <P> "No one thought we could beat Santa Ana, or Foothill even," Pietsch said.  "That's all I heard from my friends."  </P> <P> Pietsch, The Times' athlete of the week, has plenty to talk about with his  friends now.  </P> <P> Last week, the Vanguards clinched at least a co-championship by beating --  that's right -- Santa Ana and Foothill. The victories left El Modena with a  two-game lead with two games remaining.  </P> <P> Pietsch, for his part, did more than just talk. He had 32 points and 15  rebounds against Santa Ana and 24 points and 21 rebounds against Foothill.  </P> <P> The title is the Vanguards' first in basketball since 1978 and only the second  in the school's 22-year history.  </P> <P> "I never had a doubt," Pietsch said. "We had three starters coming back and  some good players up from the junior varsity."  </P> <P> One of those newcomers, John Darrow, has given Pietsch more freedom on the  court.  </P> <P> Last season Pietsch, who has a lean 6-foot-4, 170-pound frame, played on the  inside, where he got pushed around some. He averaged 14 points and eight  rebounds per game.  </P> <P> "Robbie was a good scorer last season, but he wasn't a very good rebounder," El  Modena Coach Tim Tivenan said.  </P> <P> This year, with the 6-3, 210-pound Darrow inside, Pietsch is out on the wing --  and loving it.  </P> <P> He is averaging 22 points and 12.2 rebounds per game this season. He had 25  rebounds against Santa Ana Valley this season to break Steve Trumbo's  single-game school record.  </P> <P> "Playing outside has made me a better rebounder," Pietsch said. "I can get  better angles to the basket and it's harder to block me out."  </P> <P> Playing outside also allows Pietsch to run the court, which he has done quite  well this season.  </P> <P> "There was one sequence in the Santa Ana Valley game where he scored on a layup  on one end, then blocked a shot at the other end, then ran down court and  scored on a layup," Tivenan said. "He can really cover the court."  </P> <P> And the Vanguards are winning on the court, as promised.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Rob Johnson of El Toro had 51 points and 15 assists in two games as the  Chargers split their two South Coast League games last week. Johnson had 32  points and 9 assists against Capistrano Valley Saturday.  </P> <P> Chris Lee of Newport Harbor scored 32 points in two games, helping the Sailors  won their first two Sea View League games of the season.  </P> <P> Gary Lira of Rancho Alamitos scored 40 points in two games and the Vaqueros  moved to within one game of third place in the Garden Grove League.  </P> <P> Matt Luke of El Dorado had 29 points and 38 rebounds as the Golden Hawks won  two games to clinch a tie for the Empire League championship.  </P> <P> Greg (Moose) Pope of Esperanza scored 45 points in two games and the Aztecs won  their first two Empire League games of the season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Robbie Pietsch  </P> <P> El Modena High School  </P> <P> Position: Forward  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 6-4, 170, Senior  </P> <P> Last Week: The Vanguards won two games to clinch a tie for the Century League  title with Pietsch contributing 56 points and 36 rebounds.  </P> <P> Season: Pietsch is averaging 22 points and 12.2 rebounds per game.  </P></p>

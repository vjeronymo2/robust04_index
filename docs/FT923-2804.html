			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Arts: A fair cop - in moral shades of grey - Television Given the brain deadening preponderance of television drama series about crime in the past 10 or 20 years - series about English lawyers, Scottish lawyers, American lawyers, private eyes, male uniformed police, female uniformed police, male criminals, female criminals, English detectives, French detectives, Dutch detectives, American detectives, police in cars, police in boats, police on motorbikes, even as a last resort police on foot  -it seemed unlikely that we would welcome yet another police series. But quality will out, and if you come up with good ideas, good writing, good direction and good acting the milieu hardly matters. Between The Lines is yet another series about the Met, and very good it is. When Tony Garnett last produced a series which dared to question the integrity of the British legal system (Law And Order in 1978) there was pandemonium: the BBC was banned from prisons for a year, the police demanded written undertakings before they would offer any more co-operation, and right-wingers roared about destruction of the fabric of British society. How things change. Today, with what we know about Stalker and the Guildford Four, the Midlands Crime Squad and the Birmingham Six, Garnett looks more like a prophet than a rebel. The most impressive aspect of Between The Lines is that, although it inevitably shows British police forces as harbouring freemasons and racists, thieves and boot boys ('inevitably' because it is about an internal investigation unit) none of this is seen in black and white. Not only are we shown police arguing convincingly that breaking the rules may sometimes be the only way of defeating the crooks, but the central character, our hero, Tony Clark, is a married man and a womaniser and therefore an habitual liar. Indeed this is precisely why he has the job. Few television police series have the strength and intelligence to work consistently within realistic moral shades of grey as this one does, and even fewer then manage the vivid drama which is being achieved here. Those not watching yet can start on Friday with a typically ambivalent episode about a woman constable complaining of sexual harassment - by a black sergeant. C4's Terry And Julian looks like the nearest that television has ever come (whoops, sorry about the rude verb) to its own Carry On series. It appears to have been created as a vehicle for Julian Clary whose wrists are so limp they could serve as hammocks for gerbils. His last series, a soppy gameshow, was undisciplined and quickly became boring, but this one is scripted - 'I want to see the back of you'/'You won't be the first'. It should amuse those with a taste for English seaside innuendo of the unsubtle Max Miller variety. There are still people, including media correspondents from national newspapers who should know better, claiming that television is experiencing a 'slide' and even a 'slump' in viewing. What are they talking about? The most recent BARB figures are for the last week in August. They show average weekly viewing per person as 24 hours 43 minutes. That is seven hours up on the same week in 1983, six hours up on 1984, one hour up on 1985, two hours up on 1987, '88 and '89, three hours up on 1990 and one hour up on 1991. The only year in the past decade to record a higher figure than this year was 1986 when the last week in August was an anomaly: for some reason it is credited with 26 hours 27 minutes which is four hours more than any other week that summer. Some slump. People interpret figures any way that suits them. After hearing a top Channel 4 executive gleefully deriding the supposedly 'disastrous' ratings for the BBC soap opera Eldorado it was interesting to discover that those same BARB figures record audiences of 6.9m and 6.7m for Eldorado's two episodes that week, a million more than any programme shown on C4. But to be fair, what was C4's top-rated programme? Some worthy effort for black viewers or feminists which could hardly expect a big audience? Not at all, such programmes do not even struggle into the bottom of C4's Top 30; for all we are allowed to know those series, which C4 makes such a song and dance about, may be getting no measurable audience at all. The top three slots on C4 are filled by the soap opera Brookside which manages about 5.5m viewers, and the rest of their Top 10 comprises three American comedies, two gameshows and two American movies. So much for being different and serving specialist tastes. In the same week BBC2's Top 10 included British programmes on travel, sport, natural history, gardening and cookery and Alan Bennett's splendid drama A Woman Of No Importance. That week BBC2 attracted 10.1 per cent of total viewing to C4's 10.3 per cent. It might be as well to keep this in mind next time C4 is held up as a shining example of what can be achieved out there in the market place. No one in the industry believes that C4 will be able to avoid competing even more fiercely for audiences, becoming even more populist, once it has to start selling its own airtime in competition with ITV next year. But the mind boggles at what could be more populist than its present Top 10. British programme makers have often expressed pride in a system of public service broadcasting which permits 'the right to fail', a pre-requisite if genuinely new ideas are to be tried. The question is, should viewers be subjected to these failures? Last week's 75-minute drama on C4, Gummed Labels, was, like so much 'experimental' material, a triumph of style over content. There were venetian blinds and bright blue back-lighting, lots of supposedly clever lines ('I'll tell you nothing]' 'I already know nothing, nothing and I are close friends') bass sax on the soundtrack and, at the centre, where there should have been a plot or at least some thought, only a vacuum. As a student showreel indicating mastery of technique this could be useful. As public entertainment it was deeply irritating. Worse still was a BBC1 natural history programme called The Velvet Claw which, astoundingly, we were told was the first of a seven part series concerning ancient animals. The nastiest sort of modern animation was accompanied by a an embarrassingly pretentious script, favouring phrases such as 'in a very real sense'. The producers have made the famous old mistake of hiring a plummy voiced actor to read the words with the result that the voice-over sounds like Donald Wolfit showing off in a Victorian melodrama. After proving over so many years the superiority of having non-actors such as David Attenborough read their own scripts in conversational tones, what on earth does the BBC's Natural History Unit think it is up to producing stuff such as this? And having produced it, why didn't anyone spot it before the poor old viewers were subjected to it? A preview in a London cinema of Ridley Scott's 2 1/2 -hour Columbus movie 1492 on Sunday morning showed it to be visually striking, powerfully atmospheric, strong on the minutiae of the 15th century, weak on character, and quite often boring. BBC1's 95-minute 'Screen One' drama Disaster At Valdez on Sunday night, another piece of dramatised history, showed how superior television can be these days to even such 'prestige' cinema projects. No doubt some of those involved in the notorious Alaskan oil spill will pick nits out of this television account of how the clean-up became a fiasco, but history will decide whether, as it seems, it is a broadly accurate account. It is certainly a compelling piece of television.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> 2 DIE IN SCOTTISH RAIL CRASH  </P> <P> Two people were killed and 44 injured when two commuter trains collided head-on  in Britain's second fatal rail crash in three days. Scotrail, a branch of the  state-owned British Rail, said the trains were traveling at less than 30 m.p.h.  in opposite directions when they collided outside Bellgrove Station in Glasgow.  At least two cars of the trains, carrying about 70 passengers, derailed. The  cause of the accident was not immediately known. A crash Saturday on the  outskirts of London killed five people and injured 94. Last Dec. 12, three  trains crashed near a busy south London junction during rush hour, killing 35  people. That accident was blamed on a signal failure.  </P></p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / People: Declan Kelly - hoping to rebuild career Declan Kelly, whose privately owned housebuilding business went into liquidation 2 1/2 years ago with debts of Pounds 200m, has resurfaced as chief executive of Durkan Partnership, The company, a subsidiary of privately owned developers Durkan Holdings, specialises in building homes for housing associations. Kelly's appointment marks a return to his roots; in the 1970s he was among the pioneers of building low-cost homes for housing associations in partnership with building societies. A cheerful and enthusiastic Irishman, Kelly ran into trouble after expanding into speculative private housing development. He says: 'Like many others I was caught out when interest rates soared and property values fell.' Since the business failed he has been keeping his hand in by building about half a dozen homes a year in the west country in partnership with David Smith, a former director of Declan Kelly Holdings. He has also spent a lot of time advising the appointed receivers; they are still trying to raise cash from the failed business which was involved in a string of joint venture developments. 'Some of the sites have been mothballed by creditor banks which are waiting for the market to improve. Others were sold almost immediately, but I am conscious of all the people who are owed money and have been working as hard as I can to assist,' says Kelly, now 49. 'It has been a horrid two years, but I like to think I still have more friends than enemies in the industry.' Building for housing associations, which since the 1989 Housing Act, are encouraged to raise an increasing proportion of their finance from private investors, is one of the few growth areas in the housing market. Durkan Partnerships, which currently builds about 250 homes a year, plans to double over the next few years, says Kelly. ***** Steve Monnington, previously UK commercial director of BLENHEIM GROUP, has been appointed group company secretary. He replaces Heather Land, who is leaving to spend a year sailing round the world. Executive chairman Neville Buch says that Monnington has an assistant who deals with much of the routine work, leaving him time to continue with implementation of the group's management information systems, as well as scouting for potential acquisitions - both jobs he was already doing as UK commercial director. ***** Harvey Samson has been appointed group finance director of GARDINER GROUP. ***** Stephen Muirhead, previously senior vice-president international at Hanna-Barbera Productions, has been appointed senior vice-president Europe of TECHNICOLOR, part of Carlton Communications. ***** Nigel Howard (above left), chairman of the thermal ceramics division, has been appointed to the main MORGAN CRUCIBLE board. ***** Nigel Randall (above right) has been appointed md of BRITISH AEROSPACE (Systems and Equipment); he succeeds Len Milsom who is moving within the group. ***** John Taylor, director of HEWLETT-PACKARD's European Research Laboratories in Bristol, has been appointed to the board. ***** Peter Byers has joined HOMEPRIDE FOODS as finance and administration director. ***** Clive Boast has been promoted to group financial director and Brian Gibbon a director of DOWDING &amp; MILLS. ***** Tony Herod has been appointed md of RHP Precision Bearings, a division of UNITED PRECISION INDUSTRIES. ***** Barry Whitford, previously md of European Plastic Moulders, has been appointed md of Link Plastics, a subsidiary of WAGON INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS. ***** Nicholas Stagg, formerly finance director of British &amp; Commonwealth Properties, has been appointed group finance director of LAMBERT SMITH HAMPTON. ***** David Hyams has been appointed company secretary of AMSTRAD.</p>

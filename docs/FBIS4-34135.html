			<p>BFN     [Text] The heads of state and government from the 21  nations of Ibero-America began the second and last day of their  fourth summit behind closed doors in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia. The leaders all arrived this morning at the convention  center by bus, except for Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez, who  arrived in his own car, and posed together for the official  summit picture.    Cuban President Fidel Castro, who this morning held a  meeting  with his Honduran counterpart, Carlos Reina, again appeared with  a white guayabera and dark blue slacks, after surprising  everyone yesterday, since it had been the first time he was seen  without his uniform since the armed struggle began in Cuba in  1956.    Yesterday, the Cuban leader met with Felipe Gonzalez and  tomorrow, he is scheduled to meet with Eduardo Frei. He had  already met with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in  Havana.    During today's meeting, the last of the Fourth  Ibero-American  Summit, the presidents expressed their opinions in complete  privacy on the central issues of the meeting, trade and  integration, and will be able to freely discuss any other issues  they wish.    It is expected that an important part of the discussion will  center on Cuba, after Cuban President Fidel Castro lamented the  fact that there had been no declarations against the blockade  during yesterday's meeting.    On the other hand, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  denied that our country was disappointed by the developments of  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Robaina was interviewed by the  media this morning and questioned on the lack of pronouncements  on the U.S. blockade on Cuba, to which Robaina replied: We have  no reason to be disappointed [words indistinct] on the debates  regarding the blockade.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: JAKOBSON BALLETS: A COPYRIGHT TEST CASE  </P> <P> The San Diego-based California Ballet and the heirs of Soviet choreographer  Leonid Jakobson are entangled in a complex legal case that may become a model  for others grappling with new Soviet copyright laws.  </P> <P> The heirs contend that they own the Jakobson works that California Ballet plans  to present with members of the State Ballet of Leningrad U.S.S.R. (also known  as Choreographic Miniatures, the name Leonid Jakobson gave his company in  1970).  </P> <P> A May 12 performance is scheduled in the San Diego Civic Theatre.  </P> <P> The widow and son of Jakobson are seeking to block California Ballet's plans to  acquire Jakobson's works from the Soviet company during its visit here. At  issue is who owns the more than 100 ballets Jakobson created.  </P> <P> There is more than a little irony in this situation. For the 40 years of his  creative lifetime, Jakobson suffered artistic ignominy at the hands of Soviet  cultural authorities, who repeatedly repressed his ballets as degenerate  examples of anti-socialist realist art.  </P> <P> Within the last year, however, in the wake of Soviet reforms, Jakobson has come  to be celebrated as a great cultural hero, the Soviet equivalent of his  Vaganova Institute classmate, George Balanchine.  </P> <P> Since Jakobson's death in 1975, his company has been directed by Askold  Makarov, a former leading dancer with the Kirov Ballet in the 1950s, and the  man who negotiated with California Ballet director Maxine Mahon in 1988 to  bring Choreographic Miniatures to America.  </P> <P> Makarov for a time reportedly stopped crediting Jakobson as the choreographer  of the company's ballets, and for several years he has actively prevented  Jakobson's widow from staging her husband's work anywhere in the Soviet Union  despite her claimed legal ownership of them.  </P> <P> Currently holding the title of "master teacher" at San Francisco Ballet, Irina  Jakobson has long contended that Makarov is not maintaining her husband's work  properly. She cites this as the reason she and her son don't want California  Ballet learning the works from Makarov and his dancers.  </P> <P> "I am sure that it is better not to show my husband's work than to show them at  all in this condition," Irina Jakobson said last week. "It would be as if I  copied a Rembrandt painting only I put the nose on the cheek and rearranged the  rest of the features.  </P> <P> "We left the U.S.S.R. to escape this kind of lawlessness," Jakobson said. "And  now it has followed us here."  </P> <P> Mahon, however, is sticking by her original plan to present Makarov and his  company in May. "I have an arrangement with the Leningrad State Ballet to do a  residency here and teach," Mahon said in an interview. "It had nothing to do  with Mrs. Jakobson. . . . I think the Leningrad State Ballet can do what it  wants."  </P> <P> Paul Epstein, a lawyer with the New York firm of Proskauer, Rose Goetz &amp;  Mendelsohn, the same firm that represents the estate of George Balanchine and  the man the Jakobsons have retained as their legal counsel, says there is no  question that Mrs. Jakobson is the legal owner of the works.  </P> <P> "The rights issue is very clear. The Russian government has confirmed that the  rights for these ballets passed to Mrs. Jakobson at the death of her husband,"  he said. "California Ballet simply has to find out that their best source for  Jakobson ballets is right here, and everything will go ahead OK."  </P> <P> No matter what happens between California Ballet and the Jakobsons, however,  California will see the premiere next month of a Leonid Jakobson ballet: the  full five duets of "Rodin," when San Francisco Ballet becomes the first  American troupe authorized to perform this ballet.  </P> <P> PIANISTS: Wendy Chen, a 17-year-old student at the R.D. Colburn School of  Performing Arts in Los Angeles, won the $12,000 first prize -- plus a 10-city  concert tour and a Lincoln Center recital debut in April -- in the National  Chopin Competition held in Florida last month.

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals conceal growth at Lex Service Lex Service, the UK's largest car distribution and leasing group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 101.5m for 1993 compared with Pounds 107m the previous year. The figures for the past year were boosted by a Pounds 60.1m profit on the sale of Arrow Electronics shares and by a 'fifth' quarter of profits amounting to Pounds 2.6m from the leasing associates which changed their year ends from October to December. Excluding distorting exceptional items in both years profits increased by 36 per cent to Pounds 38.5m (Pounds 28.3m). Turnover grew by 29 per cent to Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds 910.7m). Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman and chief executive, said this underlying profit improvement reflected the encouraging growth in the UK car and track markets. 'Our businesses improved their profits substantially through increased market shares and continued tight control of costs,' he said. Earnings per share slipped to 88.5p (96.7p) but an increased final dividend of 7.8p (6.6p) is recommended, making a 12.5p (10.6p) total. The shares closed down 6p at 524p yesterday. The group's expanded 127 car and truck dealerships, representing over 30 manufacturers, sold 64,000 new and 30,000 used vehicles last year, increases of 30 per cent and 22 per respectively. Trading profit, including an Pounds 800,000 contribution from the Arlington dealerships acquired in July, was Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 11.4m) reflecting the increased market share, improved operations and the full year contribution of the Swan dealerships acquired in 1992. Lex Vehicle Leasing, Transfleet and Harvey, which are jointly owned with Lombard North Central, all increased their fleet sizes. This, combined with the benefits of the operational improvement implemented over the past two years, led all to all three achieving record profits. Together the three companies and Lex Systems Leasing contributed Pounds 19m to Lex for the 12 months to December 1993, compared with Pounds 9.8m for the corresponding period in 1992. Net interest costs were reduced from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 2.2m and year end net borrowings stood at Pounds 14m (Pounds 9m). The group also announced the appointment of Mr Peter Harris as finance director. COMMENT Over the past three years Lex has made considerable progress towards its twin goals of expanding the scale of the company and improving its operational performance. The group's strong balance sheet provides the flexibility for further acquisitions, and developing existing operations like the Lucas Autocentres. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 48m are expected this year - excluding Pounds 7m from the sale of the final tranche of Arrow shares in January. Earnings, before exceptionals, should be around 32p and the shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 16.4.</p>

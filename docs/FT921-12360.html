			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Observer: Japanese admirer Did you know that the works of Robert Burns, pronounced correctly in guttural 18th century Scots, sound very like Japanese? Burns' scholars have Japan's new consul-general in Edinburgh, Seiichiro Otsuka, to thank for this remarkable discovery. Ichi - as Scottish friends call him - proved his point beyond doubt when he replied admirably to the Speech to the Immortal Memory, at a Burns Night Supper in Edinburgh last week. After convincingly declaiming a rasping piece of abuse from Burns' poem Tam O'Shanter, he said: 'To be honest that sounds very close to what my wife says to me the whole time.' The diplomat says he practises Burns' Address to a Haggis - 'Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face, great chieftain o' the puddin-race etc' - while bathing his three-year-old son. The boy now runs round the house shouting the last line: 'Gie her a Haggis.' He also revealed another trade secret. The dead poet is helping Japan's pedestrians walk more briskly through life's traffic jams. The tune of Burns' poem 'Comin thro' the rye', is played at Japan's pedestrian crossings whenever the lights turn to green.</p>

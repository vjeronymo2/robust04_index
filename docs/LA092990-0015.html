			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> INEPT NEWS COVERAGE  </P> <P> I finally cooled down enough to write concerning your ineptitude in covering  the news for Ventura County.  </P> <P> I seriously do not believe you even know where to secure most of it; e.g., when  was the last time you listed a Ventura County bankruptcy in the business  section? You always list San Diego County or San Bernardino County, but never  Ventura.  </P> <P> When was the last time you published a stamp collector's column? Or a genealogy  column such as "Climbing Your Family's Tree."  </P> <P> And where are all the events going on in Simi Valley and at the general east  end of the county? Is it too far for your reporters to drive or telephone?  </P> <P> DAVE BOESHAAR  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

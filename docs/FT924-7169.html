			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / China pushes market reforms China is pushing through a package of reforms for its state-owned commercial companies which will allow them to introduce shareholding, determine their own marketing strategies and deal in foreign trade, Reuter reports from Beijing. He Jihai, vice minister of commerce, told the official China Daily the reform measures would boost the state commercial sector, which has lagged far behind private entrepreneurs in exploiting China's emerging consumer market. Under the reforms, state commercial companies will be allowed to determine their own product mix, introduce shareholding systems to bring in new capital and lease subsidiary operations to other companies.</p>

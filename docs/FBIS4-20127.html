			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>   [Text] The armed forces are not a luxury and excessive cuts  will damage Britain's security and reputation, Defence Secretary  Malcolm Rifkind told the Treasury today. His warning came as  ministers and senior officials prepared to draw up final  recommendations for spending reductions in a bid to find 2.3  billion pounds savings in line with Treasury demands.    Mr. Rifkind set out his stall in the annual defence white  paper, which officials admitted was necessarily "bland" because  the Front Line First review would not be completed until July.  However, it revealed significant new cuts in the manpower  strengths of the Royal Navy and RAF [Royal Air Force].    By April 1, 1995, the Navy will fall by an extra 1,500 to  51,000, while the RAF will lose a further 3,000 men and drop to  70,000. However, the Front Line First review is expected to  recommend that manpower plummets to around 45,000 in the Navy  and around 60,000 in the RAF by the turn of the century.    The first meeting of ministers and the so-called executive  group scheduled for Thursday was today postponed until next week.    Mr. Rifkind repeatedly emphasised that the "fighting  capabilities" of the armed forces were sacrosanct. "We have no  intention of making any further reductions in the fighting  capabilities of our armed forces," he said. And, in a thinly  veiled warning to the Treasury, the white paper said: "Our armed  forces are widely regarded -- and rightly -- as a valuable and  prestigious national asset. The possession of such an asset is  not a luxury; and it is not something we could surrender without  grave injury to the security and reputation of this country."    Strong armed forces were essential so long as Britain wanted  to play an active part in international affairs. Although the  end of the Cold War was welcomed, nationalism and extremism were  "sadly" on the march. It would be many years before it became  clear whether Russia -- with its huge arsenal of weapons --  would be able to develop into a permanent friend of the West and  a stable democracy.    The white paper warned that Britain will face increasing  challenges and that there could be even greater calls on the  armed forces if hopes for greater stability fail to materialise.  "We do not intend to take risks with our security," said the  white paper. "The penalties for misjudgment would be too severe."    At a London briefing, Mr. Rifkind said it was the  Government's intention that Britain should remain one of the  world's most formidable military powers.    The review, details of which will be announced in late July,  had gone better than predicted. The Defence Secretary said he  was "pretty confident" of not only meeting the requirements but  of having savings to "enhance the fighting capabilities of our  armed forces."    Asked about proposals to slash around 20,000 civilian and  military jobs, he stressed: "The crucial question is not overall  manpower but how you use your manpower and whether they are  being used in the most productive form."    But Labour immediately denounced the white paper as a  charade  and a whitewash. David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said:  "It is a transparent attempt to try to get the Tories out of a  short-term political problem at the expense of the long-term  security of Britain. Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind does not  want to jeopardise Tory chances in the local and European  elections by revealing the full extent of his cuts."    Since December, 33 studies have been carried out into the  entire support sector in a bid to find the necessary savings.  These studies -- apart from two -- are now complete and will be  discussed by the ministerial/executive group, which includes the  financial director of Marks &amp; Spencer Christopher Littmoden  and  senior officials from the Treasury and the Downing Street policy  unit. A final package of recommendations will be put together  from the various studies and presented to Mr. Rifkind in the  middle of next month.    Among the proposals are 20 percent cuts in senior officers  and officials, a similar cut in the 11,000-strong Procurement  Executive, the closure of hundreds of buildings including  military colleges, and widespread privatisation of fleets of  non-fighting aircraft and vehicles.    One of the most politically contentious issues is the naval  base at Rosyth in Fife, which the Royal Navy has recommended for  closure with warships moved to Portsmouth.    Mr. Rifkind insisted that if any recommendation could be  shown to jeopardise the fighting capabilities of the armed  forces, it would not be accepted.</p>

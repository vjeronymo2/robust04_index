			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Todoseychuk: "The New Party Is Centrist"] </F>   [Text] A press conference of representatives of the leading  organs of the Democratic Party of Independence of Azerbaijan  (DPNA) has been held.    The DPNA is the 40th political party in Azerbaijan. The  statute and program of the party were approved earlier, at the  constituent conference on 26 March, and the Politburo and Ali  Mejlis (Supreme Assembly) were elected. Gabil Guseynli, Vagif  Kerimov, and Mubariz Gurbanly are cochairmen of the party.    The party ranks number about 10,000; chapters have been  opened in 61 regions of the republic.    During the press conference, representatives of the DPNA  answered numerous questions put by journalists. In particular,  it was stated that the party occupies a centrist position and  advocates holding parliamentary elections, which are a guarantee  of successful democratic transformations, as soon as possible.  The views of the DPNA are largely similar to the policy of the  current leadership of the republic.    The main objective of the DPNA is to achieve Azerbaijan's  real independence. The party proceeds in its operations from the  principles of its popular character, justice, and democracy. The  DPNA comes out against the interference of the army in politics;  it advocates implementation of the positive principles of  Turkism, Islamism, and national-patriotism.    As far as the economic sphere is concerned, a team of  experts  is at work within the DPNA. A privatization program has already  been developed; it has been submitted to the leadership of the  republic.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Charterhall disposal costs leave Seafield Pounds 24m in loss Losses at Seafield, the transport and distribution company where the board is under fire from dissident shareholders, doubled from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 24.2m pre-tax for 1993. Turnover fell to Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 45.2m). Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, said the results marked the end of 'the disaster created by the acquisition of Charterhall Properties in 1989'. Charterhall was sold last October resulting in a loss of Pounds 21.7m, including Pounds 17.5m of goodwill written off. Competition in the European freight business helped push profits from continuing operations down from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 804,000 on turnover of Pounds 17m (Pounds 18.7m). Losses per share emerged at 35.4p (15.4p). Shareholders speaking for 25.4 per cent want to replace Mr Chilver and another director with Mr Robert Cosby and Mr Tony Wilson, a former executive chairman, because of the 'dismal' trading record. Mr Cosby described the latest loss as 'an appalling indictment' of the present management. It was much worse than the dissidents had feared. Mr Chilver, who is writing to shareholders this week, expected 'significant progress' this year after 'three years of dealing with the errors of the previous management, led by Mr Wilson, which threatened the very existence of Seafield'. The group, which withdrew from merger talks with private company Imari last week, was considering the acquisition of two other transport companies, Mr Chilver added.</p>

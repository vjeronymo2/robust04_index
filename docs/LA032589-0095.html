			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ACTOR TODD BRIDGES PLEADS INNOCENT  </P> <P> Actor Todd Bridges pleaded innocent Friday to charges that he tried to kill a  narcotics dealer by shooting him eight times in a drug-induced fit of violence  in a cocaine rock house.  </P> <P> Bridges, 23, of Sun Valley, the former child star of the now-canceled NBC-TV  sitcom "Diff'rent Strokes," denied a single count of premeditated attempted  murder at his Superior Court arraignment.  </P> <P> If convicted, Bridges could be sentenced to life in state prison. Judge David  Horowitz ordered Bridges to remain in custody in lieu of $2-million bail but  agreed to consider a defense motion April 14 to lower that bail.  </P> <P> Bridges was ordered earlier this week to stand trial on the charge after  convicted narcotics dealer Kenneth Clay testified at a preliminary hearing that  the actor shot him eight times inside a South-Central Los Angeles cocaine rock  house Feb. 2.  </P></p>

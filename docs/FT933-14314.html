			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Gainsborough sells for Pounds 1m ONE OF Gainsborough's earliest and most charming portraits, of friends in his native Suffolk, has been acquired by the Tate Gallery in partnership with Gainsborough's House in Sudbury. The London dealer Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox, bidding on behalf of the museums, paid Pounds 1,079,500, at the bottom of the estimate, at Sotheby's yesterday. The National Heritage Fund and the National Arts Collections Fund contributed most of the funding for the painting, which will be shared between the two museums. The Tate has no comparable painting by Gainsborough of this period - the mid-1750s - when the artist was in his early twenties. The Gainsborough was the highlight of an auction of British paintings which brought in Pounds 2.8m. More than a third of the lots on offer were unsold. A portrait of Sir Charles Watson, painted in Rome by Pompeo Batoni when the young English aristocrat was on the Grand Tour, comfortably beat its estimate at Pounds 463,500. Christie's held a successful auction of early English silver which totalled Pounds 1.4m and was 89 per cent sold by value. An Elizabeth I silver gilt cup and cover with an ostrich-egg base sold for Pounds 353,500 to the London dealer Tessiers. Its upper estimate had been Pounds 250,000. An even earlier item, the Malmesbury Cup, dated to 1529, just made its low estimate, selling for Pounds 254,500.</p>

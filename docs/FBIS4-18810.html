			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that the  government prepared the economic stability program to ensure the  prosperity of the citizens and to prevent blocking economic  progress for the country.    Tansu Ciller visited Democratic Left Party leader Bulent  Ecevit in the latter's office in parliament in order to hear his  views and proposals regarding the economic stability program.  She pointed out that the country has serious problems that  piled up over the years. We were forced to take certain measures  to overcome them, she said, adding that similar problems emerge  in other countries as well.    [Begin Ciller recording] There might be people who think  that the type of measures we are taking could be different.  However, we all have the same basic aims and desires: the  prosperity of our people, to open the way for this prosperity,  to prevent blocking economic progress before the country, to  create more jobs for our youths in the future, to enable  investments, to prevent the stopping of growth, to prevent a  three-digit and eventually a four-digit inflation. [end  recording]    Ciller said that she will hear Ecevit's views on the  economic  stability program and on the installations in Zonguldak. We  will benefit from these views most extensively, she said.    Ecevit said that the economy is going through the most  difficult period in the history of the republic. He stressed  that the burden must be shared justly. He said he will explain  his views specifically and as positively as possible to the  prime minister, and that he will posit his criticism and  proposals.    [Begin Ecevit recording] Turkey is growing fast as far as  its population growth and social dynamism are concerned. We are  concerned, however, that the economic measures being taken might  cause problems in the economy in the future. Specifically  slowing down production, preventing new investments, and  restricting current investments might cause certain problems for  a country whose population growth is about 2.17 percent. [end  recording]    Ecevit pointed out that the Karabuk Iron and Steel Works can  be made much more productive by means of certain additional  investments, and that it would not be right to completely close  the Zonguldak Coal Works.    After the 90-minute meeting, Ciller said that she got what  she hoped for from her search for a social consensus for the  economic stability package. She said that she is briefing all  the sectors of the society on the package and continuing to  carry it out without changing the aims of the program. She  pointed out that she listened to Ecevit's views who also posited  some good proposals. We will study these proposals, she said.    Replying to a question on the workers' reaction, Ciller  stressed that she is open to dialogue. We will eliminate all  misunderstandings, she said.    [Begin Ciller recording] As I said, before, the aim is the  prosperity of the Turkish people. We were forced to take  certain measures. We took them. While implementing them, we  will discuss them with everyone. [end recording]    In a statement after the meeting, Ecevit said that by making  promises left, right, and center before the elections, the  parties put both themselves and the country in a difficult  positions. The people are now being asked to pay the price for  this negative process, he said.    Ecevit stressed that the coal mines and the iron and steel  industry are of strategic importance for Turkey's independence.  He added that he told the prime minister that it would be very  wrong to entirely close the Zonguldak Coal Mines and the Karabuk  Iron and Steel Works.</p>

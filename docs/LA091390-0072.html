			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AD MAKES CASE FOR AN ELECTED CITY ATTORNEY, SEEKS CANDIDATES FOR JOB;  </P> <P> BALLOT: SANTA MONICA VOTERS HAVEN'T DECIDED YET ON AN INITIATIVE TO MAKE THE  OFFICE ELECTIVE RATHER THAN APPOINTIVE.  </P> <P> Santa Monica voters have not yet had the chance to decide whether they want to  make the city attorney an elected position, but a residents group behind the  ballot measure has begun advertising for candidates.  </P> <P> Santa Monicans for the Citizens Protection Act, the group that through an  initiative drive placed the question of an elected city attorney on the Nov. 6  city ballot, ran a quarter-page ad last week in the Los Angeles Daily Journal,  a legal newspaper.  </P> <P> In the corner of the ad, which cost the group $495, is a picture of the goddess  of justice, with "City Attorney, City of Santa Monica" in bold letters.  </P> <P> The ad says candidates must be registered Santa Monica voters at the time of  nomination, November, 1990, for an election in February, 1991.  </P> <P> In a box, the ad emphasizes that "the candidate should have a personal and  professional commitment to upholding and obeying all laws of the land and must  not have prior criminal record."  </P> <P> The ad calls for candidates to send resumes and a photo to the campaign  headquarters of Santa Monicans for the Citizens Protection Act.  </P> <P> Supporters of the measure, listed as Proposition Y on the ballot, are  attempting to oust City Atty. Robert M. Myers because of his policy not to  prosecute homeless people for such misdemeanors as sleeping in parks and public  inebriation. They have also made an issue of the several times that Myers was  arrested in connection with his participation in protests against nuclear  testing.  </P> <P> They say Myers' tolerant attitude toward the homeless is to blame for a growing  homeless population in the city and aggressive panhandling and attacks by some  transients.  </P> <P> Leslie Dutton, an organizing member of the group, was one of three people  filing a complaint against Myers last week with the State Bar of California,  the regulating agency for attorneys.  </P> <P> The complaint charges Myers with violating the State Bar's Act and Rules of  Professional Conduct for not prosecuting those certain misdemeanors and claims  that his misdemeanor arrests for trespassing in protest of nuclear testing in  Nevada constitute an act of moral turpitude.  </P> <P> Susan Scott, a State Bar spokeswoman, said state law prohibits comment or  characterization of complaints filed against attorneys.  </P> <P> Myers said complaints have been filed against him in the past for his actions  without any disciplinary action being taken. He said Dutton filed the complaint  to get media attention.  </P> <P> "Leslie Dutton's consistent tactic has been to file complaints even though she  knows they go nowhere," said Myers, who was appointed city attorney in 1981.  </P> <P> Myers said other complaints in connection with his arrests were filed against  him in June, 1987, and a year ago. In both cases, he said, the State Bar  determined that there was insufficient grounds for disciplinary action.  </P> <P> Myers also criticized the ad placed by Dutton's group, saying it gave a false  impression that the city is looking for a city attorney.  </P> <P> "It is an attempt to prescreen candidates for the office of city attorney," he  said. "She wants to pick people who share her right-wing philosophy if the  measure passes."  </P> <P> The homeless issue and the ballot measure to make the city attorney an elected  office are expected to be key issues in the race for three seats on the City  Council.  </P> <P> Incumbent Councilwoman Christine Reed has been a vocal opponent of Myers and  has given her support to the ballot measure. Of the nine candidates for City  Council, five oppose Proposition Y. In addition, Santa Monicans for Renters  Rights, a powerful tenants group, opposes the measure.  </P></p>

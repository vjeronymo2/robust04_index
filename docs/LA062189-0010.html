			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO PARENT IS SAFE FROM HEADLINE JUSTICE  </P> <P> Being a parent in Los Angeles has become a dangerous occupation.  </P> <P> Under the state's 1988 Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, parents  run the risk of facing arrest and criminal prosecution if their child becomes a  suspect in a crime. The law states that parents can be charged criminally if  they are believed to have either encouraged their child's criminal activity, or  if they are found to have not done enough to keep their child on the straight  path. It says that parents will be held criminally accountable if they do not  exercise reasonable care, but does not define in any way just what "reasonable  care" is.  </P> <P> The law is so vague and subjective that no parent is safe from its reach. This  legislation is simply another in a series of high-gloss, ineffective law  enforcement solutions to the very real and serious problem of gang violence.  </P> <P> A few weeks ago the Los Angeles city attorney's office, using the Street  Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, filed criminal charges against Gloria  Williams, a Los Angeles mother, claiming she had encouraged and participated in  her teen-age son's alleged gang activities.  </P> <P> Armed with photos seized from the family's album and a litany of accusations  about her fitness as a parent, law enforcement officials took their evidence to  the nation's press. There Williams became the subject of public scorn and  ridicule. Without a trial and with, as it now turns out, a faulty investigation  into her background, Williams was branded in the national media as a "gang  mother" and an unfit parent.  </P> <P> It seemed as if law enforcement, using this case for a publicity stunt, was  enforcing a constitutionally suspect law to gain media attention. Now it  appears that the city attorney and others in law enforcement have come to agree  with those who criticized the arrest of Williams. Earlier this month all of the  charges against her were dismissed. What still remains, however, is a highly  charged political climate, fed by public officials who persistently seek  "headline" solutions to serious social problems.  </P> <P> Urban violence in Los Angeles will not be eliminated by prosecuting mothers who  are unable to prevent their children from being caught up in the cycle of gang  activity. The so-called "gang mother" law is just one example of politicians  applying cosmetics to a critical problem at the expense of constitutional  rights. Clearly, the frustration over an inability to control the spiraling  syndrome of gangs, drugs and crime has driven public officials to desperate,  often ill-conceived measures.  </P> <P> Most parents -- just like Gloria Williams -- are hard-working people, trying  their best to raise children in the face of often overwhelming social and  economic pressures. What none of us needs is a law that imposes a duty to  prevent youngsters from becoming criminals, but doesn't tell parents what to do  or how to do it. Those who commit the crimes should be prosecuted, not others  innocent of any wrong-doing.  </P> <P> Strong law-enforcement measures are required to restore the safety of our  communities. But to put parents at risk under a law such as the Street  Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, which is applied arbitrarily against  those who are poor or powerless, is unfair and ineffective.  </P> <P> In an effort to promote the law as the long-awaited solution to urban crime,  public officials admitted it was aimed directly at inner city parents -- many  of them females supporting a household alone. Sadly, such logic flies in the  faces of what we now know to be true -- that crime and drugs are problems in  every community across the country, large and small, rural and urban alike.  </P> <P> Los Angeles doesn't need more headline justice to whitewash ineffective and  constitutionally indefensible laws. The city needs serious and reasoned  solutions to problems that threaten the very fabric of society. The public must  demand -- and deserves nothing less than -- a commitment from all of its  leaders to find rational answers to the epidemic of gangs, drugs and crime that  is now sweeping the country. To accomplish this, adequate resources must be  allocated, instead of the investment of precious tax dollars in a  public-relations campaign.  </P></p>

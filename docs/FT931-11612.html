			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory pit rebel warns ministers POTENTIAL Tory rebels over the 31 threatened coal pits sought to increase pressure on the government yesterday as ministers began the final stage of discussions on the forthcoming energy white paper. Mr Winston Churchill, chairman of the Conservative coal group, used a speech to the Coal Industry Society to spell out the political risks to ministers of failing to accept fully the recent Commons trade and industry committee report on pit closures. 'Michael Heseltine cannot afford to court defeat on this issue, which would be deeply damaging to the government and almost certainly fatal for his own political prospects,' he said. In broad terms, he added, adoption of the committee's recommendations would save about 25 pits immediately and some 20 in the longer term. This assessment contrasts with the judgment of some committee members that the proposals would save 13 to 17 pits. Mr Churchill said that the proposals would save the taxpayer almost Pounds 1bn in the first two years - taking into account the cost of the redundancy and retraining packages proposed in October. He added that recent movements in exchange rates had offered a timely reminder to people in the power generation industry that if they wanted security of supply without the volatility of exchange rates then they would do well to sign up for long-term contracts with British Coal. Senior ministers are in intensive discussions about the white paper with a wide range of interests in the energy industries. The complexity of the deal that needs to be struck means that final government decisions will not be taken this week and ministers will have to work hard to meet the planned deadline of the end of the month.</p>

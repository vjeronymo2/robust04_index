			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gantry lifts Bridge Oil stake The battle for Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based energy group, threatened to reach stalemate last night. Gantry Acquisition, one of the two rival US-based bidders, raised its stake in the target company to just under 10 per cent by buying shares at prices ranging up to 95 cents. Gantry said it wished to proceed with a full takeover offer at 95 cents a share, but required further information before it would do so. In particular, it wanted to know whether its Texan rival, Parker &amp; Parsley, would accept a higher Gantry offer in respect of its own 21 per cent stake in Bridge. It asked for elaboration on reported comments from P&amp;P, about 'having different plans for different levels of acceptance'. Until yesterday, Gantry had been offering 85 cents a share for Bridge, while P&amp;P was offering 90 cents a share. An offer of 95 cents a share would value Bridge at about ADollars 399m (USDollars 285m). P&amp;P described Gantry's 'alleged wish to make a 95 cent a share highly-conditional offer' as 'a mirage'. It said it would not accept such an offer in respect of its own Bridge shares, and dismissed its rival's initiative as an effort to confuse Bridge shareholders. However, Gantry insisted it had no intention of accepting P&amp;P's 90 cents a share offer, and accused P&amp;P of using delaying tactics to prevent shareholders from obtaining a higher offer. Gantry is the bid vehicle being used by an investment partnership owned jointly by the California Public Employees' Retirement System and Enron, the US natural gas company. Unlike P&amp;P, which has said it is interested in developing Bridge's US and Australian assets, Gantry has said it is primarily interest in the US properties. Bridge shares closed 2 cents higher at ADollars 0.92 yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul May 4 -- South Korean President Kim Yong-sam  will come to the Russian Federation on a four-day official visit  between June 1 and 4 at the invitation of President Boris  Yeltsin as well as to Uzbekistan on a three-day visit at the  invitation of President Islam Karimov, the spokesman of the  president's office said at a briefing in Seoul on Wednesday.    According to the spokesman, the South Korean president will  visit the Russian port city of Vladivostok on his way back home.    Kim plans to hold talks with Yeltsin during the visit, at  which the sides will exchange opinions on the situation on the  Korean peninsula and the situation in the world as a whole.  They will also discuss ways of strengthening bilateral  relations.    "The visit by President Kim Yong-sam to Russia will help to  strengthen further relations between the two countries for the  sake of preserving peace on the Korean peninsula and will step  up bilateral cooperation in joint development of natural  resources and technological development for the sake of mutual  prosperity of the two countries," stressed the spokesman.    He added that "the coming visit will have great importance  for building the foundations of foreign policy by which the  Korean civil government abides, focusing on the development of  relations with the four neighbouring powers".    In accordance with this diplomacy, Kim visited the United  States last November as well as Japan and China last March. He  will go to Russia this time.    In June 1989, Kim was in Moscow as the leader of the  opposition Democratic Party for Reunification. He met Yeltsin  in Seoul in the capacity of a candidate for the highest state  post from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party during the Russian  president's visit to South Korea in November 1992.    Presidents Kim and Karimov will discuss chances for  developing relations between the two countries. Incidentally,  the largest community of Koreans in the countries of the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) lives in Uzbekistan.    The South Korean-Uzbek summit "will help to establish  relations in the economic and other spheres also with other CIS  members which recently gained independence", the spokesman noted.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELER'S DIARY: HAVING A BALL AND COLLECTING CALORIES IN VIENNA  </P> <P> Annamarie Victory, a tour guide, can have you eating bear's paw if you follow  her to China on a gourmet tour of Cathay, or have you waltzing at the Imperial  Ball if you follow her to Vienna for New Year's Eve.  </P> <P> The cost of the Vienna tour is $5,800 for six days, flying Air France's  Concorde both ways.  </P> <P> As a warm-up to the Imperial Ball, the evening of Dec. 30, 1989 includes a  string quartet concert in the crystal and marble fantasy of Pallavicini Palace,  normally used for diplomatic functions.  </P> <P> The palace has been in the family for 150 years. Hostess at cocktails and the  dinner afterward will be the Countess Pallavicini, accompanied by American  Ambassador and Mrs. Henry Grunwald. Grunwald is the former editor of Time  magazine.  </P> <P> In preparation for the next evening at the Imperial Palace, waltz lessons are  given in the morning.  </P> <P> Those who already know how to waltz will be taken on a walking tour of old  Vienna. Some tickets will be available for the performance of "Die Fledermaus,"  with opera-goers proceeding to the ball after the last curtain call.  </P> <P> Victory's other tours include calorie-collecting jaunts to  </P> <P> Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and, in the fall, China,  Hong Kong and Bangkok.  </P> <P> In France, Victory stops at the Le Bristol Hotel, at 112 Faubourg St. Honore,  and takes tour participants dining at Taillevent. Then they catch the train for  Vezelay and dine at L'Esperance, the 19th-Century villa of Marc Meneau. Both  restaurants have been awarded Michelin's three stars.  </P> <P> Afterward, in Lyon, they will dine with Paul Bocuse. Then onward to Mionnay to  eat with Alain Chapel, said to be the originator of nouvelle cuisine.  </P> <P> Next is L'Oustau de Baumaniere, whose 88-year-old owner is still overseeing  this restaurant in Provence. Afterward, there is a cooking lesson from the  master, Roger Verge, at Mougins.  </P> <P> Lunch the next day is served among the pigeons and paintings of La Colombe d'Or  at St. Paul de Vence, high in the hills above the Riviera.  </P> <P> If Victory visits Italy, she will cap a Tuscan tour (seven nights, $2,950 per  person, $300 extra if you want a room to yourself) with an evening prepared by  Ambroglio Folonari Ruffino, who helped Chianti wines to a classico designation.  </P> <P> In Switzerland, tours get to Freddy Girardet's temple of gastronomy at  Crissier.  </P> <P> A trip to the Orient in the spring and another in the fall cost about $5,000  per person, plus another $1,000 if you want a room of your own.  </P> <P> Don't forget to add air fare. But tips for chambermaids and room tax are  included.  </P> <P> Victory takes her group to Hong Kong on Singapore Airlines, and registers them  in the Regent Hotel that hangs over Hong Kong Harbor at Kowloon. A master eater  named T. C. Lei, who wrote "Chinese Food for Thought," will lead the  participants through goose hearts, duck webs, duck's tongue and the right paw  (you don't eat the left one) of a Chinese bear. All this takes place at Fuk Lam  Moon on Hong Kong Island.  </P> <P> The next day it's off to Beijing and the Ching Juang hotel. At a dumpling bash,  25 kinds are offered -- fried, steamed and baked -- an indulgence that requires  three hours at the table.  </P> <P> For more information, you can contact Annamarie Victory at 136 East 64th St.,  New York 10021, (212) 486-0353.  </P></p>

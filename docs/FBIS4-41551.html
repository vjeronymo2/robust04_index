			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- The consultative Foreign  Investment Council attached to the Russian Government is  entrusted with working out the strategy for investing foreign  capital to Russia, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in a  conversation with Western businessmen who have arrived in Moscow  to participate in the council meeting which opens today.    Judging by all appearances, the consultative council will  mark another phase in rapprochement between the Russian and  world economies hot on the heels of the Russian president's  recent successful trip to Corfu and of the prime minister's  visit to the United States.    The council meeting today is to be addressed by Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin, First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets,  Central Bank Governor Viktor Gershchenko and Acting Finance  Minister Sergey Dubinin. The leaders of Russian key ministries  and the departments are taking part in the council meeting.    Representatives of transnational corporations of North  America, Europe and Asia are taking part in the meeting.  Western businessmen said in the conversation with the Russian  prime minister that they would like to see a better organisation  of the consultative council's work. They called for setting up  panels and deciding on the specific directions of work.</p>

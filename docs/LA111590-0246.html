			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH SIGNS CLEAN AIR ACT, SAYS IT'S START OF 'NEW ERA'  </P> <P> President Bush proclaimed a "new era for clean air" today as he signed  far-reaching legislation placing new curbs on air pollution from automobiles,  factories and businesses.  </P> <P> "Every American expects and deserves to breathe clean air," Bush said, signing  the Clean Air Act of 1990.  </P> <P> He called the measure "the centerpiece of our environmental agenda" and the  "most significant air pollution legislation in our nation's history."  </P> <P> Bush signed the measure at an East Room ceremony, standing with key lawmakers  involved in the long and contentious fight over the measure.  </P> <P> "This is a true red-letter day for all Americans," Bush declared. "We begin a  new era for clean air."  </P> <P> "No American should have to drive out of town to have to breathe clean air.  Every city in America should have clean air. And with this legislation, I  firmly believe we will," he said.  </P> <P> "Mission defined, mission accomplished," he added.  </P> <P> The bill, 748 pages long, will affect virtually every American. It was approved  by Congress easily last month, belying 16 months of debate and long hours of  behind-the-scenes negotiations on a myriad of provisions.  </P> <P> In advance of today's bill-signing, environmental groups hailed the bill's  enactment. "The Clean Air Act of 1990 is like a breath of fresh air after a  10-year smog alert," said Sierra Club President Susan Merrow.  </P></p>

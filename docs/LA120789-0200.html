			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURT PAPERS ACCUSE IACOCCA OF IMPROPER AUTO PROFITS  </P> <P> In documents filed in support of a lawsuit, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca  has been accused of using his position to improperly profit on sales of  Lamborghini cars sold through an Orange County dealership.  </P> <P> Jasjit Singh Rarewala alleges that Iacocca and another Chrysler executive, H.F.  Carlini, channeled a number of specially built Lamborghini Countachs to a  Newport Beach dealership co-owned by Carlini's nephew, Anthony Carlini.  </P> <P> Rarewala filed a $50-million suit against Chrysler in Los Angeles Superior  Court in April, alleging that Chrysler breached a contract to sell him  franchise rights by granting an exclusive Orange County dealer franchise to  Newport Auto Center. Chrysler bought the Italian car maker in 1987.  </P> <P> Rarewala added the allegations against Iacocca and Carlini in October after  discovering that Carlini owned 50% of that dealership, which is partly owned by  Steven Bren, son of Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren.  </P> <P> Iacocca and Carlini have not been named as defendants in the suit. The  allegations against them were made in response to a motion by Chrylser to move  the trial to Italy.  </P> <P> Rarewala's attorney successfully argued that the case should remain in Los  Angeles because of related litigation.  </P> <P> The new filing contends that "Lee Iacocca . . . is personally involved in  Newport Auto Center through at least the attempted sale at an enormous profit  of at least $100,000 of a 1989 25th Anniversary Edition Lamborghini Countach."  </P> <P> Those cars are part of a limited run of about 30 units available for U.S. sale  that are said to be commanding more than three times their $156,000 price in  the California market.  </P> <P> Chrysler spokesman Tom Kowaleski said he could not comment on the suit because  it is pending litigation.  </P> <P> However Ward's Auto Dealer, a monthly trade publication, on Wednesday quoted  White &amp; Case, Chrysler's legal counsel, as saying in court documents that  any suggestion Iacocca would try to profit on a run-up in Countach prices is  "slanderous" and "rank hearsay."  </P> <P> The manager of Newport Auto Center could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Michael Flagg contributed to this story.  </P></p>

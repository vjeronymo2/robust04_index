			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARENBOIM CONFIRMED FOR CHICAGO PODIUM  </P> <P> Daniel Barenboim, the 46-year-old conductor/pianist fired from Opera de la  Bastille in Paris two weeks ago, has been named the next music director of the  Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Barenboim, who will immediately assume the title of  music director designate, takes up the directorship for the 1991-92 season.  </P> <P> Sir Georg Solti, the highly acclaimed music director of the Chicago Symphony  for the past 20 seasons, will become music director laureate. Solti, 76, told  orchestra officials in 1986 that he wished to step down after the orchestra's  1990-91 centennial season, according to the orchestra's announcement. Barenboim  almost immediately became the rumored front-runner for the position, but  official announcement of it was delayed because of Solti's desire not to spend  too many years as a lame-duck director with a publicly named successor.  </P> <P> "This is the most difficult decision of my life . . . I was in tears," Solti  said Monday at a press conference in Chicago. "Still, it is the only right  thing to do. You must not stay too long."  </P> <P> Barenboim is no stranger to the Chicago Symphony. He first conducted it in  1970, and has made more than 30 recordings with the orchestra, including the  Bruckner and Schumann symphony cycles. He comes to the CSO from 13 years as  music director of L'Orchestre de Paris, another position where he succeeded  Solti.  </P> <P> "I have known him (Barenboim) and have been closely involved in his development  as a conductor for many years, and he is my first choice," Solti said in the  Chicago announcement.  </P> <P> Solti has also supported Barenboim in his dispute with Pierre Berge, who fired  the conductor from the new Opera Bastille, scheduled to open on the 200th  anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, July 14. Solti was one of the  world-class musicians signing a petition to Culture Minister Jack Lang,  suggesting they might cancel their performances with the company.  </P> <P> Among the issues in the affair are Berge's charges that Barenboim was paid too  much, and was turning opera-for-Everyman into a high-priced, elitist endeavor.  </P> <P> The conductor may become open to similar controversy in Chicago. According to  published reports of his response to the appointment, Barenboim said: "If it  doesn't sound too arrogant, I really would like to take culture out of the  entertainment world in Chicago. It has all the conditions for being a great  cultural center."  </P> <P> Barenboim's Paris wages were $1.1 million. Chicago officials have declined to  specify what he will earn on his three-year contract.  </P></p>

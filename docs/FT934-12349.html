			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / No news is bad news: In the absence of TV cameras, victims of aggression can be left to suffer Mr Douglas Hurd should be pleased. For months the British foreign secretary has been trying to persuade the world to forget about Bosnia. While brilliantly exploiting the presence of British troops 'on the ground' to dissuade anyone else from trying to help the Bosnian government defend itself and its people, he has made it clear that in his view sending troops there at all was a rash policy, forced on the government by the media. Visibly irritated by pressure to take a less neutral line, Mr Hurd has repeatedly mused aloud on the arbitrary spotlight that the media shine on some conflicts while neglecting others. He seems to take a morbid pleasure in enumerating all the other places in the world where wars are going on. 'Why bother me with Bosnia,' is his implicit message, 'when this sort of unpleasantness is really quite normal? Tell us more about Tajikistan, or Georgia, or Angola, where things just as horrible are happening.' Mr Hurd should be pleased now because, in terms of media attention, the war in Bosnia is almost over. We hear about it mainly in the past tense, as an episode which poisoned relations between Europe and the US during the summer, and which both sides are now trying to put behind them. But it is not over. It is as bad as ever. Sarajevo is still being remorselessly pounded by Serb shells. Its people are down to two or three hundred grammes of food a day (less than half what the UN considers a minimum). Winter is nearly here, but they have no fuel left and precious little shelter. The situation in other supposedly UN-protected 'safe areas' is even worse. Thousands will freeze to death before they starve, though in many cases it may be a moot point. In early August, Nato threatened air strikes if the 'strangulation' and shelling of Sarajevo and other 'safe areas' continued. But last week Nato defence ministers met, and air strikes were not even on the agenda. At least they had the honesty not to utter any more empty threats. They did not have to, because Bosnia is no longer headline news. The precedent for Bosnia was Kurdistan. Television pictures of the exodus from northern Iraq triggered western military intervention in April 1991, just as film of Bosnian Moslems in Serb concentration camps triggered the 'humanitarian' UN operation in Bosnia last year. But the latter has been a feeble affair compared with the former. Saddam Hussein has by and large left the Kurds alone, because military action has taught him to take western warnings seriously. The Serbs and Croats in Bosnia have learnt the exact opposite. Even the Kurdish 'safe haven' is still subjected, absurdly, to UN sanctions directed against Saddam's regime. But the Kurds are not Saddam's only victims. What he has done to the Shia population in the south, especially since the abortive uprising that immediately followed the Gulf war, is just as bad. But Hurd's Law applied. There were no TV cameras in southern Iraq during the uprising, and therefore no serious pressure on western governments to intervene. Very late in the day, that omission was partially rectified last night, with the screening on British independent television of a documentary, Saddam's Killing Fields, made by historian Michael Wood. It included amateur video of the holy city of Kerbala, as Saddam's tanks moved in on it, and showed the more recent draining of the marshes into which the refugees fled. This has destroyed hundreds of villages and the entire way of life of the Marsh Arabs. Saddam used all his usual methods, including, it now appears, chemical weapons. Mr Hurd is right. Atrocities are not unique to Bosnia, or even Iraq. But what makes Bosnia and Iraq unique is the specific, undischarged responsibility of western powers, including the UK in both cases. The Shia uprising in Iraq was a direct consequence of the Gulf war. It happened virtually within sight of the victorious coalition forces, but they did not lift a finger, nor did their political leaders utter a word, to deter Saddam's forces from suppressing it. Much later, a 'no fly zone' was proclaimed in southern Iraq, but Saddam has been able to continue his ruthless work without using air power. Only the threat of allied action against his ground forces could create a 'safe haven' in the south comparable with that in the north. Then a provisional government for both north and south could be established and recognised, which would be a big step towards the liberation of the whole country. As for Bosnia, it was virtually obliged to declare independence by the EC's recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. But the EC - with Britain in the lead organising peace conferences and supplying their chairmen - has prevented it from obtaining weapons to defend itself and has extracted concession after concession from its leaders as the supposed price of an imaginary peace. Now there is talk of reconvening the London conference, which last year reached 'agreement' on various principles. None have been acted upon. No doubt a peace conference will be needed eventually, but right now the Bosnians need a massive airlift of food, fuel and shelter materials to Sarajevo, and convoys that get through to the smaller enclaves. That in turn means that those who want to help must be prepared to use force, from the air or on the ground, against those who themselves use force to prevent supplies getting through. But the west, including Britain, now seems resigned to leaving southern Iraq in the grip of Saddam Hussein, while Bosnia freezes and starves to death. No wonder Mr Hurd is relieved when the media turn their attention elsewhere.</p>

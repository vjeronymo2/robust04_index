According to Mr. Liu, Jiangxi is a big province for grain  production in the country with some 2 billion kilograms of grain  being exported to other provinces, autonomous regions and cities  every year. Mr. Liu said that the wave of a rise in grain  prices started in mid-November last year and swept across the  country from south to north with the grain price growth reaching  50 percent in a matter of a mere two or three days in some  places, creating much trouble in the country. The grain  official attributed the chaos to three reasons: First,  misguidance by the media, leading to panic purchasing of grain.  Second, imperfections in the macro-control mechanism and the  non-standardized grain market. Third, the drop in grain  resources last year, the most basic of the three reasons.    Mr. Liu proposed a proper raising of the price of grain and  an effective curbing of the rise of production means in order to  protect farmers' enthusiasm for grain production. Failing this,  even if the price of grain rises continuously, farmers will  still not benefit from it. He said that the state should in the  future strengthen its macro-control and regulation in two ways:  first, funds for risks in grain production should be established  so that when there is a risk in this sector, the government can  allocate capital from the funds to protect farmers' interests  and second, a special grain reserve system should be set up with  the aim of controlling grain prices while at the same time, the  grain markets must be standardized, grain prices streamlined,  control over grain wholesale tightened and grain retailing  vitalized.</p>

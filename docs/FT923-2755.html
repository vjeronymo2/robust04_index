			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Richard Lines sets up in business again - Ex-MTM chairman returns to his beginnings at Stockton-on-Tees MR RICHARD LINES, who resigned as chairman of MTM in March after controversy over the specialist chemicals manufacturer's accounts, has set up in business again - from the same Stockton-on-Tees offices where MTM was created. In an uncanny reworking of history, Mr Lines is now operating as a consultant to fledgling entrepreneurs from Marlborough House, after which MTM - Marlborough Technical Management - was named in 1978. He has leased the first floor offices from Hexcel Corporation which bought MTM's first venture, Seal Sands Chemical Company. Mr Lines, an ex-ICI man, was running his own chemical consultancy from Marlborough House when he met MTM co-founder Brian Wiggins in 1978. Mr Lines was forced to resign after misleading the City about 1991 profits. Binder Hamlyn, MTM's auditors until last week, subsequently compiled a report that revealed 'incorrectly recorded' transactions in 1991 and gave rise to questions about previous years' accounts. The Stock Exchange conducted an insider trading investigation into MTM. On his return to Marlborough House, Mr Lines even found the same decor; 'I thought what appalling taste I had 14 years ago.' Symbolically perhaps, it has now been changed from black and white to pale green. First credited with creating, by sheer personal dynamism, one of the fastest growing glamour stocks of the 1980s, and subsequently obliged to resign by its dramatic nosedive, he says he emerged two months ago 'from the misery zone' and set up Stronach Investments. He regularly telephones Mr Ken Schofield, the new chief executive who turned around the fortunes of Hickson International, the chemicals group, offering a torrent of free advice. Mr Lines owns 75 per cent of the new company and his business partner, Ian Lawson, an ex-Price Waterhouse accountant, owns 25 per cent. Mr Lines says he is advising would-be manufacturers on start-up techniques and finance 'using all the experience one has gained over the years in creating MTM'. Stronach Investments may invest in projects 'if the opportunity looks good'. Those he is advising include ex-MTM European operations director and ex-board member Neville Newson, who left MTM in the summer. Mr Newson, whose new company - Fine and Performance Chemicals - is next door to Mr Lines, is acting as a chemical companies adviser, though further development is planned. MTM's market capitalisation was Pounds 256m before its shares plunged in March from 286p to 26p; yesterday they closed at 30p. It showed a Pounds 20m pre-tax loss in 1991. The company, now being restructured, last week reported a Pounds 28m interim loss. Net assets are Pounds 15m and net debt Pounds 100.6m. Mr Lines said MTM's problems had not deterred clients. 'I've looked at numerous pretty good ideas and some pretty awful ideas.' With hindsight, he said, MTM should have taken more balanced advice; he also now believes a 'projects person' like him should hand over day-to-day running of his creation. Mr Lines, who last year sold 1.25m shares in MTM at 247p each, said he needed both to earn a living and to satisfy his desire to work. He retains a 6 per cent stake in MTM, where Mr Schofield is seeking about Pounds 40m in a new capital injection from shareholders. So far he had helped create 36 jobs, four at Stronach and 32 in two Teesside start-ups, making furniture and household equipment. MTM's setback was 'a bit sad', he said, but he was confident for its future. And his ambition for Stronach Investments? 'It's got to move in the right direction.'</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Intermediaries warned of tough challenges - FT Conference (European Securities Markets in the 1990s MANY intermediaries operating in the European securities markets face significant challenges if they are to survive to the end of the decade, industry executives warned yesterday. Speaking on the second day of a Financial Times conference on the development of the European securities markets, Mr Herschel Post, chief operating officer of Lehman Brothers International, warned that the process of disintermediation that swept the commercial banking world during the 1980s could come to bear on many securities intermediaries in the coming years. This included stock exchanges themselves as well as brokers, he said. Partly as a result of the shifting boundaries in the securities business, large institutions have already moved to integrate a range of intermediary functions, from acting as investment managers to being brokers and principals in securities trades. This vertical integration would allow them to move resources most effectively between the different functions to meet opportunities, he said. Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, member of the board of managing directors of Dresdner Bank, listed this vertical integration as one of the indispensable components of any financial intermediary's strategy in the coming years. Others, he said, were a clear, earnings-related focus on the segments and geographical areas in which an intermediary plans to operate; a focus on earnings rather than turnover; and a modern, customer- oriented distribution system. Mr Eberstadt added that universal banks, similar to those in Germany, were best placed to take advantage of deregulation in Europe. Universal banks do not suffer the same pressures as investment or commercial banks to constantly try to overcome regulatory hurdles by developing new financial products, he said. 'These (products) do not necessarily suggest a greater emphasis of a more rigorous approach to risk management, as is often stated. 'They tie up important resources to circumvent artificially created hurdles, which are then not available for other, more productive purposes of financial intermediation.' Universal banks do not suffer these pressures, since they can switch resources between commercial and investment banking, he said. 'It is not difficult to forecast a global trend toward universal banking for the coming years,' he added. Responding to a question later, Mr Post said he did not believe investment business in Europe would concentrate into the hands of a few, large universal banks. As had already happened in the US, investors in Europe would come to understand the benefits of selecting intermediaries on the basis of performance, and this would lead to more varied choice. Mr Howard Coates, deputy chairman of BZW equities, said that the challenges facing intermediaries in Europe were greater than those they faced elsewhere in the world. This is because, in addition to the challenges posed by deregulation, intermediaries had to cope with the problems of dealing in many, often small local markets, with the same securities often being traded on more than one market. In addition, cultural and historic differences meant that different types of investor and issuer demanded a different approach from intermediaries. BZW's response to the higher costs and lower income in securities markets had been in part to focus on higher value products, and in part to pare each business so that it could survive even in difficult periods. Different equities, such as French equities, are treated as different products and given their own profit and loss account, he said. In addition, BZW now reviews its customers by the profits that the firm generates from business it does with them.</p>

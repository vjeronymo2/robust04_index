			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: SelecTV chief ousted MR MICHAEL Buckley has been replaced as chairman of SelecTV, the independent television production, writes Raymond Snoddy. The move came after the Sunday Times reported that SelecTV had issued a writ against Mr Allan McKeown, the managing director who runs the Los Angeles office. Mr Peter Laister, a non-executive director who has taken over the chair with immediate effect, said last night: 'This is a situation in which a writ was issued without the knowledge of the full board.' The writ issued in the High Court alleged a breach of fiduciary duty and using company funds without proper approval. Mr Laister said it looked as if the issues involved would turn out to be 'as much administrative and technical problems as anything else.' However, Richards Butler, the company solicitor, has been asked to carry out a full review as quickly as possible and report back this week. 'I am determined to get to the bottom of this and clear it up as quickly as possible and get back to concentrating on programme making. I don't see any difficulty in doing that,' said Mr Laister. All the signs are that Mr Buckley was removed from office more because the affair became public than because of the issuing of the writ. The writ was never served and Mr Laister said last night it was the board's intention to have it withdrawn.</p>

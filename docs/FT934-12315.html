			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Recession in France curbs Le Creuset Le Creuset, the France-based but London-listed maker of cast iron cookware, announced almost static pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.16m for the six months to June 30. Mr Paul van Zuydam, chairman, said progress had been held back by depressed conditions in France allied to high French interest rates and a relatively strong franc. Although turnover advanced to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 17.8m), volumes on cast iron products were down, particularly in France. However, volumes of Screwpull wine accessories continued to increase. Le Creuset recently acquired Germany-based Wolo, which will distribute Le Creuset and Screwpull products as well as Weber Kettle barbecue grills and Zyliss kitchen helpers in Germany. Earnings per share improved to 4.8p (4.6p).</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STEALTH CUTS SHORT ITS SECOND FLIGHT;  </P> <P> LOW OIL PRESSURE READING FORCES IT TO LAND AFTER HOUR  </P> <P> The B-2 Stealth bomber's second flight came to a premature halt today when a  low oil pressure reading forced pilots to land the $530-million plane an hour  after takeoff.  </P> <P> "We don't even know if it's a problem yet. We're concerned with it and will  have to check it out," said 1st Lt. Anu Sjaardema, an Air Force spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The radar-evading aircraft lifted off over the Mojave Desert at 7:29 a.m. for a  three- to four-hour flight but returned at 8:36 a.m. because "there were some  minor concerns with the oil pressure indicators," she said.  </P> <P> "It was decided to land, which is a normal procedure during any type of  flight," she said.  </P> <P> Air Force Col. Richard S. Couch and Northrop Corp. chief test pilot Bruce J.  Hinds "were never in any danger" but they "obviously would have liked to  accomplish more," she said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, "we did achieve some of the things we set out to do, so we can't  say it wasn't a successful flight," Sjaardema said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Faster' and 'Higher'  </P> <P> The B-2, a tailless flying wing, flew with its landing gear retracted for the  first time and flew "a little bit faster and a little bit higher" than on the  first flight in July, although the Air Force won't specify the speed and  altitude, she said.  </P> <P> The four-engine bomber, the world's most expensive plane, is intended to carry  nuclear bombs and, along with the conventional B-1, to replace the Air Force's  aging B-52 fleet. It is under fire in Congress because of its cost.  </P> <P> Each of the B-2's four engines "has an accessory drive. One out of the four  drives indicated low oil pressure," Sjaardema said.  </P> <P> Each accessory drive is like a transmission, connected to each engine by a  shaft. The drives power air turbine starters and hydraulic systems, Sjaardema  said.  </P> <P> Air turbine starters are used to restart engines if they halt during flight.  The B-2's hydraulics apparently control its landing gear, but it isn't known if  they are used to move flaps and other control surfaces, as is the case on many  planes. Tech. Sgt. Donn Clarius said there was no failure of the hydraulic  system.  </P></p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (12): Wool mill's well-knit descendants A parable for industrial change can be found at Nailsworth, in a deep wooded valley in the south Cotswolds. Once, there was a woollen mill, part of the local textiles industry which faded. In 1879, when the mill closed, it became a fibreboard factory, employing at one time 500 people. But that market declined in the 1960s and 1970s, and this, too, closed in 1981. Then, the site became an industrial estate. EA Chamberlain (Holdings), the property development company which owns and manages the Nailsworth Mills Estate, as it is now called, is run by the same family that owned the board mill. Today, there are as many people as in the mill's heyday on the 20-acre site. The estate includes a Somerfield supermarket, a planned garden centre, and an extraordinary range of other enterprises. There is Phoenix Walking Stalks, which employs five people and makes umbrella handles and no fewer than 120,000 walking sticks a year, most of them for the National Health Service. About four times a year, Mr John Faulkner, its managing director, visits sweet chestnut coppices to buy the wood. The most modern piece of technology is a microwave oven used in the drying process. A bigger employer, with 25 people, is QS (Enamellers &amp; Polishers), which coats and polishes metals. It has a 90ft. powder-coating oven big enough to walk through, if it weren't for the fact that the temperature is 200 degrees celsius. The company handles everything from balustrading and steel-mesh partitioning to car chassis and roof racks. Before the recession, it employed 45 people, but it was particularly hard-hit by the loss of its biggest customer. Then there is Fluid Transfer, an engineering company which employs nearly 100 people making the vehicles which refuel aircraft. Another, Vaccar, makes milking equipment, employing 12 on the estate. A recent arrival is Plastics Engineering, set up 19 months ago by just three people. 'From the moment we opened our doors it has gone off like a rocket,' says director Mr David Stallon. Another successful newcomer is Selsey Herbs, run by Gillian and Peter Wimperis, who supply packed herbs, spices and pot-pourri to stores and have started exporting. They say turnover doubled in 1992, compared with the previous year. When they advertised last month for someone with the esoteric skills of calligraphy to letter gift-boxes, they expected one or two applications but had no fewer than 13. EA Chamberlain is headed by Mr John Chamberlain, grandson of the board company's founder. The vice-chairman is his son James, who is also director of a small Gloucestershire company recently set up to sell its own invention, the Rako Miniveyor, a portable conveyor for the building trade. EA Chamberlain is seeking a tenant for the estate's largest industrial unit. A 30,000 sq ft purpose-built factory, it will be alongside one reminder of past days: a still well-patronised bowling green.</p>

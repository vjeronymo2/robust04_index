			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMISSIONERS CITE FIRE, TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN REJECTION OF CHEVY CHASE CANYON  PROJECT  </P> <P> The Glendale Planning Commission, citing concerns about potential environmental  damage, increased traffic and the risk of fires, this week narrowly rejected a  plan to build a 12-house subdivision on a Chevy Chase Canyon hillside.  </P> <P> The commissioners voted 3 to 2 Monday against the proposal by developer Vahan  Bezdikian to build the Somerset Estates housing tract on five acres of  chaparral- and oak-covered land off Somerset Road. Bezdikian had agreed to  dedicate the remaining six acres of his property as open space.  </P> <P> "I'm in no way trying to deny some development" on the site, said Ted Osborn,  who with Commissioners Don Pearson and Claudia Rizzo Culling rejected the  project. But Osborn said he would prefer "something that is smaller and more  sensitive to the area, that accommodates improving . . . traffic and fire  control, rather than adding to the problems that exist now."  </P> <P> Commissioners Gary Tobian and Robert McCormick voted in favor of the plan.  </P> <P> City planners recommended approval of the proposed subdivision as long as the  developer met 46 conditions, ranging from standard grades for driveways to the  widening and improving of Somerset and other roads.  </P> <P> Bezdikian will not revise his proposal before he presents it to the City  Council in January, but at that time may consider scaling it down if city  planners remove some of the more costly conditions they imposed, said Marlene  Roth, a consultant to the developer.  </P> <P> Roth, who called Monday's decision disappointing, said the proposed subdivision  could have been much larger, but the developer was attempting to compromise  with concerned Chevy Chase Canyon homeowners.  </P> <P> But the decision was welcomed by a handful of canyon homeowners, who before the  vote told commissioners that the subdivision would add too much traffic to  their narrow and winding streets. They also argued that it could harm the  canyon area adjacent to Somerset Road, which has been designated for "scenic  area preservation" under the city's general plan.  </P> <P> Glendale Fire Capt. Chris Gray told the commissioners that the canyon's narrow  streets make it difficult for fire trucks and equipment to protect houses now  in the area. He recommended that the project be approved only if the developer  agreed to widen and improve certain roads for Fire Department access.  </P></p>

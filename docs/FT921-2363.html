			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Classic Conservatism in post-Thatcher era - The substance behind the changes in rhetoric IT IS not Thatcherism. Nor is there a distinctive enough political philosophy in the Conservative manifesto to warrant the label Majorism. So Mr John Major chose yesterday to call it classic Conservatism. A senior Cabinet colleague described it as a prospectus for the post-socialist era; a few seconds later he offered the afterthought that it was also one for a post-Thatcherite world. Over the coming days and weeks there will be many other labels applied to the manifesto for the first election campaign since 1979 that the Conservatives have fought without Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Some in the party will describe it as One-Nation. Some will insist that Mr Major has been true to the principles of his predecessor. Others will see in the document the outlines of the Conservatives' version of European Christian Democracy. They will all be right. After just 16 months in Downing Street Mr Major did not want to abandon the core of his party's agenda for the previous 11 years; nor could he have. He wanted to signal that there was substance behind the changes in style and rhetoric since November 1990. The result, in the words of one Cabinet minister, is a manifesto which represents 'much more a shift of 45 degrees than a U-turn'. The first objective of the 29,000-word document (6,000 words longer than in 1987) is straightforward. The Conservatives want to demonstrate that 13 years in power has not left them bereft of imagination or energy: that a new prime minister has brought with him new and exciting ideas. For all their public scorn at Labour's recycling of the 'time for a change' theme, senior ministers believe the popular perception that they held power for too long rivals the economic recession as the greatest threat on April 9. The second aim is to persuade the electorate that the central economic truths of the 1980s have been obscured rather than discredited by the recession. That low taxes, low inflation, deregulation and enterprise, and curbs on trades union power remain the precondition for prosperity. So there is much of which Mrs Thatcher would approve. The manifesto acknowledges the impracticalities of a 'big-bang' sale of British Rail's passenger services but the plans to lease services on a regional basis is a statement of future intent. British Coal is to be sold and 'contractorisation' to the private sector of local authority and Whitehall services is to be accelerated. The goal of stable prices is firmly restated. Those close to Mr Major say that he will be more serious about achieving it than his predecessor. Ownership will be just as central to the Conservative agenda for the 1990s as it was in the 1980s. The manifesto promises further tax incentives to encourage savings and another drive to increase home-ownership through rents-into-mortgages schemes. Tax cuts are there. Mr Major will not give a date for the achievement of 20p basic rate of tax. Nor will there be moves to drive down spending and borrowing: the document talks of a return 'towards' rather than 'to' budget balance. But the commitment to leaving people with more of their incomes remains central. In some areas the approach is evolutionary. For much of the 1980s the attitude was that public services should either be privatised or left alone. The substantive proposals in the Citizen's Charter are an attempt to break down the dividing line  - to inject private-sector skills into the areas where the state will maintain overall responsibility. Health and education will remain part of a welfare state but the disciplines of the market are to be harnessed in a drive for efficiency. A sheaf of proposals on housing, ranging from rents-into-mortgages to the break up of local authority estates, represents a similar shift towards diversity: to offer more than a simple choice between ownership and a council tenancy. If part of Mr Major's pitch is that he is incorporating the successes of the past, there are signposts to a different future. On one level they are a matter of tone. The sheer detail in the document reveals a prime minister who prefers the nuts-and-bolts of practical policy to the grand philosophical sweep of his predecessor. In other areas the change of tone becomes one of substance. Mr Michael Heseltine's interventionism is stamped on the plans to regenerate the inner cities and the acknowledgement that policy for London must be centrally co-ordinated. Mr Major's own instincts are reflected in the commitment to child benefit. There is an attentiveness to the underclass of the 1980s not seen before. Some of these shifts are hidden between the lines. But the message to the voters is there: if they want change they do not have to vote Labour. Mr Major is offering it.</p>

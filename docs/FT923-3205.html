			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / EC ministers warn of crisis if French reject Maastricht EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday stepped up warnings about a financial and political crisis if the Maastricht treaty on European union is rejected in next Sunday's referendum. The warning came at the end of two days of informal talks at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, between the ministers but before the announcement of a realignment in the European exchange rate mechanism late yesterday. In France, politicians began a frenzy of campaigning to try to swing a finely divided electorate in the run-up to the referendum. The slim majority for Maastricht yesterday appeared fragile, according to the last of the public opinion surveys before pre-election polling closed at midnight on Saturday. The final five surveys before the deadline showed an average 52.4 per cent majority for the pro-Maastricht camp. One poll, by BVA for Liberation, showed an even split. EC officials cautioned, however, that the warnings of a potential political crisis in western Europe could be aimed at galvanising undecided voters in France. They also pointed out that French approval for the treaty would not remove the problem of the Danish vote against Maastricht last June. At the foreign ministers' meetings, Mr Roland Dumas of France raised the possibility of an 'earthquake' in the event of a No vote. 'You can't tell where the buildings will fall down,' he said. Britain, which holds the EC presidency, is prepared to call an emergency session of EC foreign ministers in New York next Monday whatever the outcome of the referendum. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said: 'There will have to be very close co-ordination whether there is a French Yes or No.' Mr Hurd left open the possibility of EC foreign ministers  - who are due to be in New York for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly  - holding talks with EC finance ministers gathered in Washington under the auspices of the Group of Seven industrialised countries.

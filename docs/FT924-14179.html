			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Turkey, Arab nations in electricity link TURKEY and four Arab countries yesterday approved a plan to link their electricity networks by 1997, Reuter reports from Damascus. Electricity and industry ministers of Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt signed an agreement after two days of talks in Damascus. The first stage of the project costing Dollars 185m (Pounds 103.9m) will be financed by the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, whose director-general, Mr Abdullatif al-Hamad, attended the talks. The project was first endorsed by the five states in 1989. The meeting also approved a feasibility study prepared by a consortium of Canadian companies. Turkey's energy minister, Mr Ersin Faralyali, said the linked grid would serve 150m people. Syria's electricity minister, Mr Kamel al-Baba, said the project should be a first stage towards connecting the five states with Gulf Arab countries and linking these with Europe through Turkey. Maghreb Arab countries should be linked with the five through Egypt, and other African states could also join the network, he added. Egypt's electricity minister, Mr Maher Abaza, said work was under way on a project to link the electricity networks of Egypt and Jordan, expected to be completed in 1995.</p>

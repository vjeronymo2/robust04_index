			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: Bringing wizardry to book: The arrival of a new generation of consumer electronics products What do you get when you blend the latest in communications, computer and consumer electronics technologies into a single pocket-sized device? The answer, US electronics industry executives are predicting, is a potentially huge market for a broad new class of electronic gadgetry. Examples may include an electronic calendar and phone book with a built-in telephone or an electronic reference book or service manual that displays text and graphics, an electronic notebook you can write on, or a pocket facsimile machine. The key elements of these futuristic products are miniature computers with built-in communications capabilities. Speech recognition, handwriting recognition and interactive video will play an important role in making this new generation of electronics products far easier to use than today's personal computers or even conventional consumer electronics products such as video tape recorders. Silicon Valley is abuzz with excitement about the potential for a new market that might consume vast quantities of semiconductor chips and provide new opportunities for computer manufacturers and software developers. 'We think there are going to be billions of these devices out there, and at some point sales of these new devices will surpass those of personal computers. We are guessing what is going to happen before the end of the century,' says John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer. Firing the imagination of Apple and many other companies is the prospect of a 'fusion' of the computer, communications, information services, publishing and office equipment industries, driven by the emergence of common digital technologies, to form a Dollars 3 trillion (million million) 'information industry' by 2000. Apple plans to launch its first 'personal digital assistant' to address this nascent market next year. 'Newton', according to industry insiders, will be a notepad-sized tablet with a pen, instead of a keyboard. It is expected to incorporate a diary, phone book and other 'personal organiser programs'. Although Apple is the most visible contender for a share of the emerging personal electronics market, it is not alone. IBM, AT&amp;T and Hewlett-Packard also have their eyes on the prize, and Japan's consumer electronics companies are not ignoring developments. Sharp Electronics, of Japan, has partnered with Apple to manufacture its first personal electronics product. Sony is also expected to be involved in Apple's future consumer electronics efforts. Hewlett-Packard is planning to build a family of 'information appliances' following the success of its first hand-held computer, the 95LX, with sales of more than 100,000 units over the past year. 'I think you can imagine whole classes of products that allow computer users to go everywhere with sophisticated networks,' says John Young, HP chief executive. HP will not reveal details of its product plans but the company says that it aims to address needs that have not been met by its first hand-held computer such as a larger screen and keyboard, for word processing applications, and a pen interface with handwriting recognition. And then there are the start-up companies, each aiming to become 'the next Apple Computer', by conquering the market for carry-along computers. General Magic, an Apple spin-off, is said to be developing a 'personal communicator', but is keeping details of its product plans quiet. Eo Computer, a potential competitor, is using a pen interface for a similar product. Poqet Computer, a pioneer in the hand-held computer market, has also launched a pen-computer that it is aiming at 'walking workers' such as delivery services and policemen, who must fill in forms or record customer's signatures. Poqet is sceptical about the more ambitious plans of other pen computer manufacturers and maintains that the broader market will not develop until handwriting recognition technology is improved. Other technical factors that could retard market growth of personal electronics devices include the difficulties associated with incorporating cellular or radio communications in a battery-powered computer. 'Power consumption remains an issue for wireless communications,' says John Vermes, vice-president of market development at Vadem, a company that has designed notebook and laptop computers for several leading manufacturers. Current colour flat panel displays are also power hungry, making it difficult to incorporate them in battery-powered computers. Price will also be an important factor in the development of a mass market. It is generally agreed that the first generation of information appliances must be offered at no more than Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 565). To reach a broader market, however, they will have to sell for less than half of that price. Another problem is that nobody has yet been able to come up with a suitable name for these products. 'Pocket computers' is as good as any, but computer makers are shying away from it because they believe that computers are intimidating and ultimately many of these products will be aimed at consumers. Industry consultants sometimes refer to the new class of products as 'sub-notebook' computers because they are smaller than the standard notebook computer and in some cases may be larger than a pocket computer. 'Companion computer' is another suggestion. Apple Computer calls them 'personal digital assistants', while Hewlett-Packard favours 'information appliances'. Whatever they are called, they are surely to become ubiquitous if the amount of money and energy that is being applied to bringing them to market is any indication. Nevertheless, several important marketing questions remain. The big issue is whether information appliances should be dedicated to a range of related tasks, or whether that should be general-purpose computers which, like desktop personal computers, can be reprogrammed to perform new tasks. Apple sees digital personal assistants as dedicated devices. 'Unlike PCs which are general-purpose products, personal digital assistants will focus on specific functional capabilities,' says Sculley. But according to Microsoft, the leading personal computer software developer, that is a mistake. 'Focusing on a dedicated device is an example of applying old thinking to a new problem,' says Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft product planning executive. 'Anything that you can do in a dedicated device today you will end up being able to do better in a more general-purpose device very soon,' he maintains. Microsoft regards hand-held computers as another platform for its system and applications software and recently announced an extension of its popular 'Windows' program for pen computers. Yet compatibility with desktop computers is not necessarily important in the emerging market for carry-along computerised tools. If sales meet expectations, many users of personal electronics devices will not be personal computer users. The promise of a huge new market is buoying the spirits of recession-weary American electronics companies. Despite their enthusiasm some fear that the 'personal digital assistant' may turn out to be another short-term wonder like the digital watch. There is also an underlying fear among US companies that, like the video game and the video tape recorder, the market for this new generation of consumer electronics products may ultimately be dominated by foreign manufacturers.</p>

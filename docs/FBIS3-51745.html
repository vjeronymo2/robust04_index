			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Jan (PL) -- The TRABAJADORES weekly,  official organ of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), in today's  edition urges an objective analysis of the problems in each  center, instead of extrapolating attention to the national  problems.    The current financial imbalances must be solved by acting on  the offer-demand principle, states an editorial in the weekly  paper which also points out the need for eliminating its causes.    The Cuban economy is burdened by an excess of circulating  currency of approximately 10 billion pesos (the same amount of  dollars as per the official exchange rate) and annual subsidies  in excess of 4 billion pesos to profitless enterprises,  according to official data.    Since a few weeks ago, and after the last convocation of the  National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament), the  CTC called on its affiliates to analyze the internal causes of  the economic crisis in the country and propose measures to  reverse it.    The editorial points out that at the first such meetings  there has been a tendency in some work centers to "think little  about the problems, weaknesses, and errors that undermine their  own daily work."    In this regard it proposes that the administrations present  to those assemblies an economic analysis of their management and  proposals for improving them, drafted by the main administrative  official of each unit and in understandable terms.    After admitting that there are production plans which are  "tainted by paternalism" which include "large components of the  inefficiency (...) we mean to fight," the editorial expresses  the need to reduce the costs of production and create, in places  where it does not yet exist, an instrument for determining them.</p>

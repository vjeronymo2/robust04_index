			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Emile Jonassaint at his installation ceremony as </F> "provisional president" at the Legislative Palace in  Port-au-Prince on 11 May -- live; passages within quotation  marks in Creole]    [Text] Mr. President of the Senate of the Republic,  Gentlemen Deputies, Honorable parliamentarians including both  senators and deputies, dear colleagues of the Court of Cassation  of the Republic and members of the judicial power, Mr. Commander  in Chief of the Haitian Armed Forces, distinguished members of  the High Command, Officers, Noncommissioned Officers, Soldiers,  Ladies and Gentlemen Dignitaries of the State, Reverend  representatives of the Episcopal Conference and the Protestant  Church, Rosicrucian and Freemason brothers, dear Voodoo friends,  citizens:    "Today, Haiti says it will not die. [applause] It must live  so all its sons can suck at its breast. Courageous men and women  have decided to administer a serum to the country until it  leaves the hospital bed of total and complete embargo, which  tries to weigh it down. We do not promise miracles because the  sickness is serious and the medicine is very expensive.    But we call on all fellow citizens to be patient. We ask  them  for a chance so the doctor can work on them to bring recovery,  but the sick person must want to be treated. The sick person  needs the important surgical operation of elections. The sick  person needs the vitamins of unity. Let us hold hands to save  our country. Haiti is ours, it is mine, it belongs to all of us.  All of us together must save it." [applause]    It has been said with good reason that roses and lilies do  not have a future, but that the fate of mankind places itself  above that of the bird that sings and dies. [applause] I had the  distinguished honor of speaking in Arcahaie on behalf of the  Senate of the Republic 41 years ago on the occasion of the 150th  anniversary of the creation of our bi-colored flag. After  briefly recalling the terrible sufferings endured by our  ancestors in Africa, in the holds of slave ships, and in the  land of Saint-Domingue, I spoke of our soul, thirsty for  justice, peace, and love, with a sincerity that seems to have  moved a great number of my fellow citizens.    Today, there is only one remedy that can cure all the  diseases of Haiti. It is love. [applause]    As has always been said by a great radio station director,  we must bury every hatchet. We can no longer continue to kill  one another. It is no longer possible. In the current state of  affairs, we must all, together, look at ourselves and say our  mea culpas because the responsibilities are shared. There is not  just one guilty person. We are all guilty to one extent or  another. [applause]    It is time that we got rid of the mortal certainty that any  solution for our country will come from elsewhere, that any  progress will necessarily be imported. We alone know our  realities, our real needs, our objectives. Those who pretend to  want to help us must take that into account. Still, it is  necessary that we ourselves know these needs, that we listen in  our land to our people, to ourselves. God helps those who help  themselves.    It is through this contempt for our deep realities, this  misunderstanding of our problems, this lack of knowledge of our  objectives that we are sinking under the weight of injustice by  our foreign partners. If the painful situation that we are  facing today has any merit, it is to make the majority of  Haitians aware that the solution lies within themselves. It is  because of this search for a Haitian solution that the  parliament has decided to call on the president of the Court of  Cassation to temporarily fill the function as head of state,  following the duly observed defection of the executive power. It  is my duty to answer history's call positively. [applause] In  fact, for you and with you, I accept this challenge. I am  calling on the patriotism of all the nation's sectors to help me  bear up under the challenge.    The national context and the current international context  are extremely difficult -- internally, an impoverished and  hungry nation, destroyed and nonexistent infrastructures, a weak  and still weakening economy, uncontrolled commerce, stalled  industry, an underequipped Army, a fragmented society, shaken  institutions, a devastated ecology, a country to which  everything seems to be lost. Everything remains to be won,  however. Externally, a desorientated New World Order, a  misinformed foreign opinion, a delinquent humanitarian policy,  corrupt international law, [applause] a disjointed planetary  system deprived of a global strategy in which a double standard  is mercilessly applied, according to special interests or media  surveys. The man of good faith observes, frustrated. To quote  Charles (?Melon), president of the French parliamentary group,  French Democratic Union: The triumph of illusion and trickery,  seduction over reason, humbug over argument.    At a time when it is appropriate to criticize the elite and  the established order, they are accused of all sins, relying on  the ineffectiveness of denial and abusing the credulousness of  the crowds. The real reasons for the problems are then  displaced. The people, blinded, swoop down on the designated  fall guy. This facet of demagoguery is handled brilliantly by  several modern leaders under the standard of democracy and human  rights. It is an imposture.    I earnestly implore the international community to grant  this country the deadline needed for restoration of truth. May  it pause to observe, allowing the provisional government to make  emergency decisions and take measures on the local level for the  protection of the fundamental rights of its citizens, especially  in the case of the clandestine departures of refugees, risking  the lives of men, women, and children at sea. In addition,  despite the abuses the Republic of Haiti suffers through the  blind ambition and self-importance of some of its sons, today, I  make the solemn commitment to respect the sacred principles of  the law and the clauses of our international commitments.  [applause]    A little more than 50 years ago, in the magazin LE TEMPS of  Port-au-Prince, Doctor of Philosophy Abbot (Gingrat) asked this  question: Where is the truth about social problems, about moral  problems, and about religious problems? He answered by saying:  The man, the demigod who could answer these questions and answer  peremptorily by invoking universal persuasion and the death of  all doubt would resolve the enigma and cure the diseases of this  world. [applause]    This is the reason, this is the reason [repeats himself] we  ask all our fellow citizens to unite because one single man  cannot solve the problem of Haiti. I take this opportunity to  offer my keen congratulations to our valorous officers and  soldiers who intervened, who said no at a moment [words  indistinct] was reigning in the country. [applause]    To the honorable members of the parliament, I can say only  one word because in order to thank them, as I have said many  times before, I would have to use the language of the gods, or  at least the one of [word indistinct] or of what St. Jean  (Chrysostome) called the golden mouth. I will just tell them  thank you.    Tomorrow, history will remember their gesture, and all those  who, today, pillory and hold them up for public condemnation  will bow before their courage and their patriotism. [applause]    A final, parting word, because we must be brief. May we all  fulfill our duties with love, truth, and justice so that  fellowship and peace finally prevail in our unfortunate country.  [applause] May the God of our hearts, of the universal church,  of the eternal religion bless us and help us! [applause] May the  protective gods of the homeland and all our [word indistinct]  surround us with their protection as an impenetrable rampart,  now and forever. [applause]</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Cambodia poll row raises tension: Khmer Rouge guerrillas renew killings amid election wrangling TENSION increased in Cambodia yesterday, after the government urged the United Nations to stop announcing results of last week's election because of 'irregularities' and after Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked UN forces. With nearly half the ballot papers counted, the communist government's Cambodian People's Party and Funcinpec, the royalist opposition party, each had about 40 per cent of the vote, according to the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac). A balance between the CPP and Funcinpec is regarded as an ideal outcome by most countries behind the 1991 Paris peace accord, which paved the way for the UN-organised election. Neither would be able to dictate the constitution because it must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the new 120-member assembly, and the two parties might even have to form a coalition government after the constitution is set up. 'Cambodians have voted for national reconciliation,' said a European diplomat. But the CPP is unhappy about its failure to make a stronger showing in the election. Mr Sok An, CPP spokesman, announced that the party and the government had asked Untac to postpone the proclamation of results - to which many Cambodians are listening avidly on Untac radio. Mr Sok An and another government official who raised the matter yesterday with Mr Reginald Austin, Untac election chief, were said by one Untac official to be looking 'very worried and jumpy'. Mr Sok An said there had been a number of irregularities, including Untac polling officers trying to influence voting and reports of broken ballot-box seals. Some seals have been broken in transit on Cambodia's rough roads, but Untac insists no one has interfered with the ballot-boxes. Untac last night rejected the CPP's request and said the announcement of results would continue. Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who signed and then rejected the 1991 peace accord and made vain attempts to dissuade Cambodians from voting, appear to be stepping up their military operations, Untac officials say. A Uruguayan UN soldier was killed and three Uruguayan and Polish peacekeepers were injured yesterday when suspected Khmer Rouge gunmen ambushed two Untac vehicles in Kompong Cham province. On Sunday night, 60 Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked and ransacked a market in Kampot province and twice directed their fire at a French UN military position, Untac said. Two Cambodians were reported killed. Both the French in Kampot and the ambushed peackeepers in Kompong Cham fired back at their attackers. Untac announced at the weekend that Bangladeshi UN positions in northern Cambodia had been shelled and that four civilians had been killed in Kampot province in a grenade attack directed at ethnic Vietnamese playing cards in a marketplace. UN forces are due to remain in Cambodia for another three months. By then a new government should be in place. In the meantime, Untac is on the alert and its armoured cars patrol the streets of Phnom Penh at night. A philosophical Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of Untac, responded to a question about the future by quoting Mr Yogi Berra, the US baseball great. 'It ain't over till it's over,' he said.</p>

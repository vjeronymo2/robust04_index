			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / The Personal Pensions Time Bomb: Slow response by regulators is exposed The study exposing widespread disregard of rules in the sale of pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes poses as big a problem for the financial services watchdogs as it does for the industry they regulate. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, is adamant that the standards used for the pilot study it commissioned from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick should have been in force from the first sale of a pension transfer in 1988. The question must be why the regulators did not spot at the time such routine failures to comply with the standards they demanded - why the watchdogs did not bark sooner. It was not until summer 1992 that Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry, and Fimbra, the self-regulating body for independent financial advisers, followed by SIB itself, published guidance to members stating the information that sales staff needed to carry out pension transfer business properly. Even allowing some months to prepare and agree the guidance, that suggests that no serious and widespread failure to meet regulators' requirements became apparent until late 1991. Among the main factors regulators cite to explain the time-lag is that this new area of business was opened while the regulatory framework was still being developed. While the Financial Services Act system of regulation was intended to be tougher than what had preceded it, the new regulators were not at their most effective from the start. One regulator involved in the process said that although the numbers pensions sold in 1988 and 1989 were relatively low 'there was far less compliance in the early years'. Another said: 'Regulators were not well equipped for the speed of growth in this business.' Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, recalled the early tone of regulation. He said: 'When I joined, the brief I got from the then chief executive was that the industry consisted of good guys with a great deal of integrity - all we need to do is to produce a set of rules.' As important, say regulators, was the political climate of the late 1980s. Driven by the government, this encouraged the growth of personal pensions. The complexity of pension transfers meant problems were often difficult to reveal in routine inspections. According to one of those involved, SIB realised the extent of non-compliance only last year, after it started sending a pensions expert out on inspection visits. The long-term nature of pensions business meant that it did not attract many early complaints from customers who felt that they had not had a good deal. Mr Richard Cockcroft, Fimbra practice director, said one of the first signals of the extent of the problem was a cluster of letters from leading pension-scheme administrators in early 1992, saying individuals appeared to be transferring on what seemed to be bad advice. As one senior regulator admits: 'You could say that the regulators were slow to get to grips with it.'</p>

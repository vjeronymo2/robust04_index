			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a further comment, CREDA objected to all Integrated Projects customers paying costs of the Water Users since these constitute repayment of municipal and industrial water development costs. CREDA had no objection to marketing the PRP resource to ICPA and UMPA under separate contracts from the Integrated Projects. In fact, ICPA and UMPA are both members of CREDA. Western has determined that it can still meet its objectives of beneficially marketing the PRP through separate contractual arrangements and has revised its proposal to do so. This will require development of power sales contracts with potential contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the PRP has only been sold to Western's CRSP, a rate for the capacity and energy produced has never been developed. A power repayment study (PRS) has been prepared each year to determine the revenues needed to meet project repayment, including operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses. The CRSP purchased the energy produced by the PRP for this amount. Western now proposes that the PRS still be used to identify the annual revenue requirements of the PRP. Potential contractors would pay their proportional share of one-twelfth of the annual amount each month to Western. In addition, the potential contractors would pay a total of $102,243.80 each year to Reclamation to be applied toward the Water Users' payment obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two other Integrated Projects customers in Utah, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District (Weber Basin) and Bountiful City Light and Power (Bountiful), operate generating plants on the Weber River. Both claimed when water is diverted from the Weber River into the Provo River under existing agreements, they incur losses in generation and asked to be compensated for these losses. Western has determined that the water diversions from the Weber River into the Provo River were established before Weber Basin or Bountiful constructed generation on the Weber River. Neither entity had a power right to the waters of the Weber River. PacifiCorp, which is compensated for generating losses, owned an operating generating plant on the Weber River and held power rights to the flows of the river prior to the Provo River diversion. Discussions with Reclamation and examination of Weber Basin and Bountiful contracts have confirmed this position. Weber Basin and Bountiful are not entitled to an allocation of PRP power to compensate them for harm caused by reduced flows in the Weber River because their plants have never been entitled to, or used, the diverted water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commentor, Reclamation, stated that the marketing criteria should consider arrangements for providing assistance to the Water Users. Also, the amount of assistance should be included in the PRP power marketing contracts, and arrangements made so that payment could be made directly to Reclamation on behalf of the Water Users during the contract period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These issues are still subject to further discussions with the Water Users and Reclamation. However, Western has committed to provide a means for annual payment to be made toward project repayment on behalf of the Water Users by the power purchasers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reclamation also noted that the amount of winter season surplus energy is affected by several factors, including the agreement dated May 16, 1986, known as the Interim Operating Agreement of Deer Creek and Strawberry Exchange of Bonneville Unit Water (Interim Operating Agreement), and future agreements on the operation of Deer Creek and Jordanelle Reservoirs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reclamation has made it clear that the Interim Operating Agreement and future agreements may severely impact the amount of generation available from the PRP during the winter season. The Interim Operating Agreement anticipated that compensation to PacifiCorp, for energy lost when water is diverted from the Weber River into the Provo River, would be affected and it provided a remedy. However, the Interim Operating Agreement does not address compensation to the Water Users by Central Utah Water Conservancy District (Central Utah) for other winter season generation which would be lost. Draft language on an agreement for joint operation of Deer Creek and Jordanelle Reservoirs provides a means for Central Utah to compensate the Water Users for this reduction. Drafts of this agreement stipulate that a separate agreement among Central Utah, the Water Users, Western, PacifiCorp, and Reclamation will be developed to provide for this compensation. It is anticipated that this agreement will be completed prior to initial service under Western's proposed marketing plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Water Users commented that Western's criteria for marketing the surplus power and energy of the Deer Creek Powerplant must fairly compensate the Water Users for the value of the surplus electric power and energy in the form of assistance on its repayment obligation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western's criteria specify that the annual revenue requirements, including Western's commitment to the Water Users, will be recovered from the potential contractors in return for all of the marketable power and energy produced by the PRP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Water Users further commented that the rate for nonfirm energy should be the same as the blended rate of firm energy. Western's revised proposal would eliminate any distinction between firm and nonfirm energy. All energy produced by the PRP would be delivered in return for the potential contractors paying all of the PRP's annual powerplant expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 14 (YONHAP) -- Russia is willing to  help South Korea resettle North Korean loggers in Siberia  seeking refuge and the governments of the two countries will  soon hold working-level discussions on the matter, Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Thursday.    Han, who arrived in Russia Wednesday for a three-day visit,  told Korean reporters that Moscow had expressed its willingness  to cooperate with Seoul in helping North Korean escapees from  Siberian logging camps wishing to resettle in South Korea after  a meeting with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev. Some 170  escapees, out of an estimated 25,000 loggers at Pyongyang-run  camps in Siberia whose human rights are allegedly violated, are  said to be seeking asylum in the South.    Seoul pledged on Wednesday to help them resettle either in  the South or in a third country in accordance with international  law. The two foreign ministers are reportedly near agreement on  the issue.    Han urged Moscow not to repatriate the loggers to North  Korea  and instead offer them residential rights, and Kozyrev gave his  word that no forcible repatriation would occur. Han told  reporters he had the impression that Moscow would back Seoul in  future action on the matter.    Expressing sympathy for Seoul's interest in the North Korean  escapees, Kozyrev said their future lies in their desire to seek  freedom, adding that they can live where they like.    Han said he understood Kozyrev's remarks as reflecting a  willingness to give the loggers residential rights: Once they  had the legal right to stay in Russia, they could make their way  to South Korea because foreigners with such rights can travel  freely abroad. Han asked that the North Korean loggers be given  the status of international refugees by involving the U.N. High  Commissioner [UNHC] on refugees while Moscow proposed bilateral  discussions to settle the problem, offering to cooperate "If  they want to go to South Korea and if the South will accept  them". Han said he explained that in order to confirm the wishes  of the escapees and refute North Korea's claims of "kidnapping,"  UNHCR involvement was necessary.    Kozyrev said consideration could be given to regarding the  loggers as refugees, but it was not needed. The Russian minister  said that no heed should be paid to Pyongyang's threats and that  Seoul-Moscow cooperation was sufficient to solve the problem.    Han said that since Moscow was being very cooperative, the  U.N. body's involvement may be unnecessary and that the loggers'  fate should soon be addressed at the working level.    Russian Foreign Ministry officials said Pyongyang had  strongly protested to Moscow for not repatriating the loggers  until recently, but nowadays makes no complaints.    Kozyrev said Moscow will continue its logging cooperation  with Pyongyang, but promised to include human rights provisions  in the renewed contract. North Korea and Russia are currently  negotiating renewal of their logging contract that expired at  the end of last year, but are making little progress due to  Pyongyang's opposition to human rights provisions.    Han and Kozyrev also discussed the North Korean nuclear  issue, the Korean seeking Moscow's continued support and the  Russian reiterating his country's preference for a nuclear-free  Korean peninsula.    Kozyrev, at a joint press conference after the talks, said  it  was too early to talk about economic sanctions against North  Korea and that Russia's involvement was vital.    The two ministers also discussed President Kim Yong-sam's  official visit to Russia in early June and agreed to sign  various agreements to improve bilateral relations during his  stay.</p>

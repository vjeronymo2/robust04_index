			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil falls back Shares in Sao Paulo fell from the day's peaks to stand a net 0.5 per cent down at the close in the wake of a new batch of bearish inflation indicators released yesterday, which prompted profit-taking after the 7.3 per cent rally seen in the previous two sessions. Trading was concentrated in short term deals as players remained mostly sidelined, wondering how the government would keep inflation down until president-elect Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso is sworn in on January 1. The Bovespa index lost 267 at 47,821. Traders, who reported slow foreign activity, said prices tested the 49,000-point resistance barrier earlier. Brazil's national consumer price index (INPC) for October jumped by 2.82 per cent, after a 1.4 per cent September rise.</p>

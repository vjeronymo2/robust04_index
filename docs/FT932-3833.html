			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (12): Farmers on the warpath - The government's approach to agricultural reform has been unimaginative LAST MONTH Tobie Meyer, the deputy minister of agriculture, had to suffer the ignominy of being booed off the stage by a group of angry white farmers in the conservative town of Potchefstroom. The meeting had been called to protest against the government's plan to extend employment legislation to cover farm workers. It says something for the mood of white agriculture, however, that the meeting should have been hijacked into the launch of a right wing political movement. The farmers' sentiments were aptly captured by a banner which read 'Kraai het ons verraai met sy ANC mielie prys' (literally - Kraai (Van Niekerk, the minister of agriculture) betrayed us with his ANC maize price). The banner is a reference to maize producers' anger at the government setting a lower producer price than that suggested by producer representatives. To describe a lower than desired price as an 'ANC price' captures perfectly the fears and frustrations of farmers, many under severe financial stress following years of drought - though the 1992/3 season represented a return to fairly normal rainfall patterns - high interest rates and deteriorating terms of trade. Their bloody-mindedness has not been improved by an upsurge in politically motivated attacks on remote farms and by provocative slogans, from the radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) in particular, about killing farmers. The government's difficulties on the agricultural front are undoubtedly a result of the proposed political changes. Many white farmers disagree with the changes, and feel reform of the country's marketing structures, which have traditionally offered protection to poorer farmers, constitutes a further act of treachery. In fact, the government's approach to agricultural reform has been cautious and unimaginative. It is not that it does not know the issues. In a policy speech in February, Mr van Niekerk acknowledged that the most difficult issue in future would be accommodating the expectations 'of the various individuals who are interested in agriculture but not yet part of it'. He added that questions about land, the state of commercial farmers, starter farmers and how the position of subsistence farmers might be improved were important issues on which 'clear answers were necessary'. Sadly, these clear answers are nowhere to be found. Mr Van Niekerk has admitted that the 1984 white paper on agricultural policy is out of date, and that a new policy is necessary to deal with issues such as possession of land, finance, new entrants to agriculture, marketing and food security. With the exception of marketing, however,the government has given little indication of how it thinks these issues might be addressed. Other parties have not done any better, with the result that there is little sense of a national dialogue under way. This is surprising, for although agriculture contributes only 5 per cent to GDP, it has important multiplier effects, and is a critical source of employment and stability in rural areas. A good place to start in the search for a new policy would be the recently released Kassier report into the Marketing Act, the most important contribution to agricultural debate for a number of years, and pregnant with insight into the problems of, and possible solutions for, agriculture. It constitutes a devastating indictment of government policy which, Professor Kassier argues, has produced 'a largely unsustainable commercial and poorly developed subsistence agriculture'. In other words, near total failure - not only in homeland areas, which it neglected, but even in the commercial sector, so long the beneficiary of government largesse. It has also bred an agricultural bureaucracy to rank with the worst. Kassier discerned among this group a 'disconcerting level of arrogance, self-righteousness and self-imposed omniscience'. Individuals behave in a 'very authoritarian, domineering and dictatorial manner'. Professor Kassier highlights the extent to which commercial agriculture is a socialist construct when he concludes his report: 'What is needed in this country is a system where bureaucrats and politicians no longer have the power to make one rich or poor, but rather where this depends on the ability to compete in the market place where one is judged by the consumer on merit.' Though the government professes to speak the same language, its actions tell a different story. It will probably only reply to the Kassier report in September, seven months after its publication, and its comments so far suggest considerable discomfort with Professor Kassier's bracing analysis. There can be little doubt, however, that the future will see further liberalisation, especially on the marketing side. Farmers will be asked to take greater responsibility for marketing their product. This process will have to be linked to overall tariff liberalisation since tariff protection means many farming input costs are exorbitant. On the other hand, prices are distorted by the marketing boards. The net result, says one observer, is that farmers are accustomed to buying retail and selling wholesale. Normal political relations will also require a future government to look hard at whether South Africa would not do better to import some of its food needs from its neighbours. The government has already conceded that the correct policy focus is not food self-sufficiency, as in the past, but food security.</p>

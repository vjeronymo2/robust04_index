			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Sudan's State Council, the African nation's collective presidency, formally  accepted the week-old resignation of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's Cabinet,  paving the way for a new government. Mahdi, bowing to pressure from military  and labor union leaders who three weeks ago gave him an ultimatum to end the  six-year civil war in the south, said he will name a new government as soon as  possible. The main issue is whether the militant National Islamic Front, which  wants a military solution to the war, will figure in a new administration.  Mahdi has accepted a U.N. proposal for a month's truce, but the rebel  leadership in the south has not made a decision.  </P></p>

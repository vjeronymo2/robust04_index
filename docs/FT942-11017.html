			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Strong sales growth at Spandex Shares in Spandex jumped 43p to 643p, after the annual meeting was told that the first four months of 1994 had shown strong sales growth, with turnover of the USM-quoted distributor of sign-making equipment being some 13.6 per cent ahead of the same period last year. Mr Charles Dobson, chairman, said the UK side continued to recover strongly and the initial performance of the new French subsidiary, Spandex France, was very encouraging. Net debt had risen during the first four months of this year, as a result of the French acquisition. Mr Dobson said Spandex would continue to introduce new product developments into its markets. It would also endeavour to further penetrate existing markets, he added.</p>

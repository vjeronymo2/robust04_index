			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>   [Text] At the beginning of the week, Police Minister Moshe  Shahal invited Faysal al-Husayni and Ziyad Abu-Zayyad to a  meeting at the home of his assistant Moshe Sason in Rehavya,  Jerusalem. Seemingly another encounter of the  Israeli-Palestinian committee on Jerusalem affairs. This time,  however, Shahal was not planning to hold a discussion, but  rather to convey a clear-cut message. "The agreement stipulates  that the Palestinian administration's institutions will be  located in Jericho. That is where you belong. I warn you on  behalf of the prime minister," Shahal stressed, "that if Orient  House turns into a governing institution serving the autonomy,  we will be forced to take action against it. Israel will not  tolerate any independent Palestinian policing activities in  Jerusalem. We will not hesitate to take punitive action."    Al-Husayni tried to defend himself. "We have no intention of  establishing a governing institution, we plan to provide the  residents with services and to maintain ties with consuls. And  why should you have problems with our guards?" al-Husayni asked  innocently, "Did we not refuse your offer of guns?"    The next day both sides flexed their muscles. Shahal  dispatched four Border Police jeeps and placed them  demonstratively at the Orient House gates, while al-Husayni, in  an attempt to highlight the Orient House aims, invited all  consuls based in East Jerusalem to a special briefing. On  Monday night, al-Husayni organized a rally of solidarity with  Jerusalem at Orient House, and on Tuesday afternoon, acting in  perfect sync with the media, he invited East Jerusalem  homeowners who had received house demolition notices, to lodge  complaints against the Israeli orders.    On Wednesday morning, totally ignoring the political storm  around Peres' letter on the issue of Jerusalem -- and perhaps  for spite -- Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi announced the establishment of  the Palestinian Citizens Rights Society in Jerusalem. The  committee's headquarters are, of course, in Orient House.    Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine, the Palestinians  announced even before negotiations on the city's future were  launched. The PLO started investing efforts in strengthening  the city's Arab-Islamic status as well as its political status  as early as in mid-1970's. In early 1980's, dozens of  institutions, organizations, and research bodies were ordered to  launch operations inside Jerusalem; they were even granted  appropriate financial backing. In parallel, the PLO invested  ample funds to establish an alternative to the Israeli rule in  the city.    The Israeli defense establishment was aware of the process  even before the intifadah. Reports were written, warnings  relayed, declarations made. In practice, almost nothing was  done to block this political development.    When the Israeli public representatives woke up this week,  it  was too late. The facts that had been established in East  Jerusalem made the city a Palestinian political center.    Faysal al-Husayni said this week that the battle for  Jerusalem has been launched. "Al-Husayni is right," prime  minister's bureau sources said, "it is a war for the city. The  Palestinians will have no choice, they will have to honor the  agreement and move all autonomy-serving Jerusalem institutions  to Jericho."    Rabin did declare war on these institutions, but the  publication of Peres' letter to Jorgen Holst, the late Norwegian  foreign minister, bungled the issue. The Palestinians flaunted  the letter, which legitimized the activities of East Jerusalem  institutions established prior to the Oslo agreement. (By the  way, no new institutions were established last year because of  the PLO's empty coffers, not because of the agreement.)  Moreover, the letter promised to encourage the development of  these institutions.    The opposition -- most notably Beni Begin -- raged and  fumed.  Ari'el Sharon failed to understand the brouhaha. All these  institutions were established in the Likud era, he said. The  Orient House building acquired the status of the "nascent  Palestinian government house" during the Likud era.    The building, owned by the al-Husayni family, was built at  the end of the previous century. It was a lodge and a hotel for  many years. In early 1980's, al-Husayni used it to house the  Center for Arab Studies. On a Shin Bet recommendation, the  Central Command commander used a special warrant to close the  building at the beginning of the intifadah. In August 1990, the  warrant expired. Those were the pre-Gulf-war days. The defense  chiefs were so preoccupied with their fear of Iraqi Scud  missiles that they forgot to renew the warrant.    In the wake of Baker's shuttle tour and the start of  negotiations that were to lead to the Madrid Conference, Orient  House assumed a patently political character. The "territories  PLO" established its command in the building, which became the  Palestinian delegation's official residence. It was used for  working sessions and news conferences. It was -- and still is  -- used for fax and telephone communication with the PLO.    The technical teams -- working groups, each of which was  assigned a topic -- that were established as quasi-ministries of  the incipient Palestinian government, were also stationed in the  building. Computer and telephone systems were installed.  Secretaries, clerks, and economic, administrative, and legal  experts filled the rooms. The Palestinian diplomatic section,  headed by Faysal al-Husayni, was also stationed in the building.  Consuls based in East Jerusalem began making pilgrimages to the  house. They were followed by Tel-Aviv-based ambassadors,  foreign ministers, and foreign delegations.    About two years ago, after Faysal al-Husayni declared the  establishment of the Palestinian shadow government, its members  dispersed throughout the building. Since they now required  security arrangements, a security officer was appointed. A  fence was put up, an electric fence was installed. Fatah youths  were hired as guards, becoming the first nucleus of the  Palestinian police in the territories. On al-Husayni's  recommendation, they were sent for special training with the  Jordanian police, where they learned weapons handling. Nowadays  the building is guarded 24 hours a day. All visitors, including  reporters, are inspected by security guards. A large antenna for  the Jerusalem-PLO wireless communication system was installed on  the roof.    On 13 September 1993, the day the Oslo agreement was  signed, the Palestinian flag was flown from the Orient House  flagpole in a festive ceremony. It has been there ever since.  After the Hebron massacre, it was lowered to half mast. When  the Japanese foreign minister visited the building three weeks  ago, the Japanese and Palestinian flags were flown side by side,  in accordance with the rules of diplomatic etiquette. A  parliamentary delegation from Turkey visited Orient House a few  days ago and a joint cooperation agreement between Palestine and  France was signed there 10 days ago.    This week, Prime Minister Rabin finally decided to put an  end  to this PLO enclave inside Jerusalem. He asked the attorney  general to examine legal steps to stop the activities at Orient  House. Rabin did not rule out the possibility of asking the  Knesset to enact legislation barring any non-governmental bodies  from conducting foreign relations from territory within the  State of Israel. Rabin would encounter no problem in trying to  pass such legislation. The Likud would give him its full  support.    Defense establishment officials this week said: "It is true  that this building was in operation before the Oslo agreement.  The problem, however, is that its activities have been imbued  with new content." The officials explained that "an attempt is  being made, also as part of the internal Palestinian power  struggles waged by Faysal al-Husayni, to strengthen the status  of Jerusalem vis a vis Gaza and Jericho. Al-Husayni is also  trying to set up a private police force." The officials  cautioned: "One must be alert to these developments before it  is too late."    Al-Hakawati theater -- the Palestinian national stage -- is  a  short walk away from Orient House. Although the hall was  originally built for theatrical companies, it has mainly served  as a national conference hall, sort of like a Palestinian  version of Jerusalem's Binyeney Ha'uma hall. The Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement], women's and student organizations from all  over the territories, as well as Fatah all hold conventions  there. The theater blossomed during the Likud's tenure. Even  then, the theater building, much like Orient House, attained a  special status: the police never burst into the hall when the  Palestinian flag was flown there, or when the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] held its conventions. The  policemen always stayed in the courtyard.    The offices of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation  [PBC]  are on an adjacent street. PBC Chairman Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, and  his team of advisers are currently preparing Palestinian radio  and television broadcasts. These broadcasts, of course, will  not be restricted to the residents of Jericho and the Gaza  Strip. This office also serves as the Palestinian government  press office. For example, it is responsible for issuing  special press cards to journalists, Israelis as well, who want  to enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The office provides  information services, and whenever necessary, transportation,  translation services, and escorts.    The Palestinian economic office, PECDAR [Palestinian  Economic  Council for Development and Reconstruction], which is in charge  of economic development and building the Palestinian economic  infrastructure, is located in north Jerusalem, in the Dahiyat  al-Barid neighborhood. This office is currently preparing the  autonomy's budget and is already allocating sums that have yet  to arrive from European countries and the United States. PECDAR  is formulating plans, at this stage, for economic projects in  the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    The Palestinian medical infrastructure has also been set up  in Jerusalem. It includes the Higher Palestinian Council for  Health in East Jerusalem, the national al-Maqasid Hospital on  the Mount of Olives, and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society,  which is located not far from Orient House. The General  Federation of Palestinian Charity Organizations, one of the most  important institutions in Palestinian society in the  territories, operates similar to the Israeli National Insurance  Institute and channels contributions from abroad to the  residents of the territories. The monies are transferred from  the federation's offices in Jerusalem to local charity  organizations throughout the territories, including in the Gaza  Strip and Jericho. Bayt Hanina is home to the General  Federation of Trade Unions -- the Palestinians' own Histadrut  labor federation.    Palestinian housing affairs are handled by the higher  Palestinian council on housing, which is located near the  Israeli construction and housing minister's bureau. This office  will soon receive a large budget for building in the Gaza Strip  and Jericho. Recently, it has begun construction on a housing  project near Jabalyah, using funds contributed by the EC before  the Oslo agreement. In Jericho, land has already been allocated  for the construction of a housing complex.    Jerusalem is also home to "al-Quds University," which, at  this stage, only comprises several buildings scattered around  the city. However, plans for the national campus have already  been made. The higher education council also has offices in  Jerusalem. Even Gaza's Islamic University has a liaison office  in the eastern part of the city. The higher Palestinian  councils on tourism, industry, culture, and information are all  located in East Jerusalem. These constitute, for all practical  intents and purposes, the ministries of the incipient  Palestinian state.    Jerusalem also houses the Palestinian organizations which  wage the political and public relations battles: the various  research institutes, newspaper offices, the associations of  Palestinian students and writers, the Palestinian Council on  Foreign Relations, and a large computerized translation  institute.    The United States and six European countries maintain  consulates in East Jerusalem, which serve as conduits for the  marketing of the political struggle. Naturally, it is easy for  the Palestinians to maintain political activity in Jerusalem.  Israeli law, which applies to Jerusalem, is far more flexible  than the military orders in the territories. There are no  curfews in Jerusalem. There is no army. The telecommunications  systems are more developed. No restrictions are put on  conventions and rallies as in the territories.    When Palestinian functionaries from Hebron, Nabulus, or even  Gaza decide to launch a political struggle, not only against  Israel but also within the domestic Palestinian arena, they  prefer to do it in Jerusalem or conduct their battles through  the offices in East Jerusalem. That is why Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi,  seeking a prominent platform from which to attack 'Arafat, was  provided with a stage in Jerusalem.    Not only the PLO is firmly established in the city. The  PFLP's political headquarters, and its magazine offices are also  in Jerusalem. The DFLP also has offices in town. The  Association of Muslim Sages, which guides Hamas and grants  religious legitimacy to its activities is also located in  Jerusalem. The main office of QUDS PRESS, the London-based  Hamas news agency, is quite near al-Husayni's house.    Each of these dozens of offices could be housed in a single  room, but their combined presence is what gives them power.  This state of affairs began a long time before Oslo; however,  the continuation of the peace process, with the issue of  Jerusalem at its center, has increased the level of Palestinian  awareness with regard to the city.    For all this, one must also add Jerusalem's holy status in  the eyes of all Muslims. Temple Mount serves as the focus for  religious feelings which quickly turn to nationalistic  sentiments on the ground. At the same time, there is the  surrounding infrastructure of religious institutions -- the  religious courts in the territories, the Waqf, and the Supreme  Islamic Council -- which also transform the city into something  approaching a Palestinian capital.    Defense establishment officials recently prepared a list of  all the Palestinian offices and bodies. "If they wish to honor  the agreement, they have to remove all the institutions which  are not directly related to the Palestinian residents of  Jerusalem," the officials said. "We are not asking them to  vacate al-Maqasid Hospital or liquidate any local soccer clubs.  However, the bureau of statistics, the economic office, the  post office, and the offices for water and development must be  located in Jericho."    Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, who also has an office in Jerusalem,  claims  that the Israeli policy is an attempt to alter the city's status  quo. "These institutions are not new," he says, "they were  there all the time, even before Madrid. One must remember that  the agreement stipulates that the central institutions will be  in Gaza and Jericho. As for the other institutions, which serve  the general Palestinian populace and have nothing to do with the  Gaza-Jericho First agreement, these can be in Jerusalem."  Abu-Zayyad explains: "I am not talking about political matters  but about institutions that serve a community." Abu-Zayyad goes  on to firmly assert: "East Jerusalem will be the capital of  Palestine. I am not saying that this will happen now, but it  will become our capital in the framework of a peace agreement."</p>

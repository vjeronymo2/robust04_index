[Begin recording of Omar Bahman in unidentified language  with  superimposed correspondent's report in Persian] Referring to  recent NATO decisions for air operations in Bosnia, he said:  This decision should have been made a long time ago. The  situation in Bosnia has now reached such a stage that such  temporary steps--even though positive--cannot solve the Bosnian  people's problem.    Criticizing UN actions in Sarajevo and referring to the  general disarmament in the city, Omar Bahman said: If this  decision is carried out justly, it can be useful. But past  experience shows that this step by the United Nations also  serves the objectives of the Serbs and that in the long run only  the Muslims will be disarmed since the Serbs can re-arm  themselves with the support that they have.    The Bosnian ambassador in Tehran also described the West's  political pressure to accept the peace plan as futile, and said:  The Bosnian people are no longer fooled by the West's false  slogans.    Continuing, Omar Bahman strongly criticized France and  Russia  and accused them of conveying the secret decisions adopted by  NATO and the Security Council to the Serbs. [end recording]</p>

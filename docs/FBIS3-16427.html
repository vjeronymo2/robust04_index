			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, March 15 (TASS) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat  will visit Moscow on April 19 and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin will make a Moscow visit on April 24-26 at the invitation  of President Yeltsin and under an agreement reached during the  recent Tunisian and Israeli visits of Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, deputy director of the Russian Foreign  Ministry's department for Middle East and Northern Africa Viktor  Gogitidze told a briefing here today.    Estimating Kozyrev's trip, Gogitidze said that major tasks  were fulfilled: An essential agreement of both sides was  reached and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is ready to resume the  negotiations. The Russian side is convinced both the Israelis  and the Palestinians are adherent to the peace process and would  like further talks.    "The Russian side stressed that in case of resumed dialogue  the main attention should be given to the soonest completion of  negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho project. Measures to implement  the project should immediately follow," said the diplomat. In  his opinion, "this would help to cool passions and guarantee, to  a certain degree, security on the occupied lands".    Russia will take more efforts to achieve the soonest  completion of negotiations on Gaza-Jericho and help the  implementation of agreements, said Gogitidze. "Today's priority  is the adoption of a Security Council resolution on Hebron. If  the resolution is adopted there will be no obstacles for the  resumption of Israeli-PLO negotiations," he stressed.    The settlers' problem that has grown most acute may be  discussed "parallelly with the resumption of Israeli-PLO  negotiations. A form of its solution can be found with the  assistance of Russian diplomats, the co-sponsors and in direct  contacts between Israel and the PLO," said Gogitidze.</p>

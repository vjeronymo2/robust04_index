			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (1): Mixed signs for future - Will Indonesia's progress towards prosperity continue unabated? Will a political vacuum emerge after Suharto goes? The giant of south-east Asia faces a test both of its nationhood and its economic resilience PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia, in power since 1965 and one of the world's longest-serving leaders, must decide whether to stand for a sixth term of office in elections next March. His achievements in bringing political stability and economic growth have been immense. Whether or not he decides to carry on, he will be aware that the country's next great challenge will be the transition from his rule. Doubts are emerging about whether progress towards prosperity can continue unabated and whether a political vacuum will emerge when Mr Suharto goes. There are fears that Mr Suharto's departure will remove the lid on simmering ethnic and religious tensions. Indonesia has about 300 ethnic groups and, though 90 per cent of the population is Moslem, there are significent Christian, Buddhist and Hindu minorities. The time of reckoning is likely to be delayed for a further five years if, as expected, Mr Suharto stands for re-election. When it does come, much will depend on the groundwork being laid by the president. Indonesia's size, as an archipelago of more than 13,000 islands stretching 3,200 miles east to west, makes it the giant of south-east Asia. The economy has grown rapidly, attracting considerable foreign investment in manufacturing industry. A steady programme of deregulation has brought the economy to a watershed: a World Bank report published last month described Indonesia as ready 'to become a solid middle-income country. . . by the end of the decade'. When Mr Suharto came to power following a failed communist coup, more than 70 per cent of the population lived in absolute poverty and the economy was hamstrung by 600 per cent inflation. Born in central Java in 1921, he began his career as a police officer before rising through the army to the rank of general. His critics say he has run an authoritarian government, is unreceptive to criticism and ruthless to those he considers endanger national unity. They argue that the parliamentary elections, held on June 9, were simply the affirmation of a de facto one-party state. The ruling Golkar party retained control with an estimated 67.5 per cent of the vote. However, when questioned on Mr Suharto's economic legacy, even some ardent critics acknowledge the scale of his achievement. His deft political skill was exemplified by his handling of the aftermath of last November's killing of at least 50 civilians in East Timor, the former Portuguese territory forcibly annexed by Indonesia in 1976. He appeased the international community by criticising the army for its part in the atrocity. Then, in March, he pacified his domestic constituency by rejecting all aid from the Netherlands, the former colonial power which had been most outspoken over the East Timor incident and which chaired the long-standing donor forum. Mr Suharto, asserting that Indonesia would not accept the linkage of aid to human rights, asked the World Bank to create a new donor consultative group without the Dutch. Donors meet in Paris next month and are expected to pledge more than Dollars 4bn in aid for the year ahead. With up to Dollars 85bn of infrastructural development planned before the turn of the century - overstretched electric power and telephone networks are probably the greatest limitation to further economic expansion - Indonesia will require foreign aid flows for many years to come. Before reaching into their wallets, however, donors will look closely at the economy. Indonesia has moved a long way from the centrally controlled model of former President Sukarno but old economic distortions remain and some new ones have appeared. Rules on foreign investment have been relaxed and export-oriented industries have multiplied. Indonesia has benefited from investment from the group of more industrialised countries which it endeavours to join: Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. But some sectors of the domestic economy, particularly agriculture, remain highly regulated. Appeals for the government to ease controls have largely fallen on deaf ears. Political barriers to change appear to have blocked the gifted western-educated technocrats within the government who champion reform. Since the beginning of 1991 the situation has worsened with trade monopolies in cloves and oranges granted to two private companies led by sons of Mr Suharto. The monopolies have highlighted the business interests of Mr Suharto's six children and have provided fuel to opponents who accuse the government of nepotism. 'The president and his wife are proud of their children's contribution to the economy,' says one western ambassador, who notes that the president's children have helped to break the hold on the economy of the ethnic Chinese community, which numbers about 4m out of a total population of 183m. Critics say Mr Suharto should restrain his children's commercial ambitions and withdraw the trade monopolies they enjoy. This has been accompanied by calls for greater government transparency and concern among economists that contracts for large public sector-related projects have sometimes gone to the highest bidder. However, the record shows 20 consecutive years of economic growth of more than 6 per cent. Exports excluding oil and gas have increased 171 per cent in the last five years to Dollars 17.6bn in 1991. Foreign investment approvals of Dollars 26.2bn in 1988-91 were twice the sum approved in the period 1969-87. Even though there has been a concomitant rise in external debt and a worsening current account deficit forecast at Dollars 4.8bn this year, the economic gains have been impressive. A surge in the Jakarta stock market following the election indicated that foreign investors find Indonesia increasingly attractive. The lack of government accountability, however, cannot be so easily discounted. In the longer term it acts to heighten the political risk and raises the question of what dangers may await Indonesia in the post-Suharto era. The signs for the future are mixed. Mr Suharto is slowly relinquishing some control - a 1966 decree granting him effective absolute power is to be revoked at his instigation - and parliament, which has neither initiated, nor blocked, a single piece of legislation under his rule, is becoming more critical of government. Most important, some senior officers of the armed forces say they accept that greater wealth and better education are irresistible forces for political change. When Mr Suharto goes, a unified and flexible military will be essential to a smooth transfer of power. There is no guarantee, however, that those business people currently benefiting from the regime, and who would have most to lose after Suharto leaves office, will be so far-sighted. Some have queried the right of the ruling Golkar party to question their business affairs. For them the prospect of political reform, bringing with it greater public scrutiny, must seem an anathema. The government has a team of technocrats with a proven ability to manage the economy through times of boom and bust. Their success, however, has been grounded in the political stability which Mr Suharto has brought to bear on the country. Indonesia's test of nationhood and economic resilience still lies ahead.</p>

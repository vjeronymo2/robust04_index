			<p>BFN     [Text] Answering a VNA correspondent's question on the  outcome of the recent visit to the Russian Federation, Ukraine,  and Kazakhstan by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his Vietnamese  Government delegation, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said:    It should be pointed out first that Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet's visit was a fine success. Various documents were signed  laying down the principles for relations between Vietnam and  each of these countries in the new era. In the Ukraine, the two  sides signed a treaty on the fundamental principles for  relations between Vietnam and Ukraine. In Russia, the two prime  ministers signed a treaty on the fundamental principles for  friendly relations between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and  the Russian Federation. In Kazakhstan, although no treaty was  signed, the two prime ministers issued a joint statement laying  down various principles for relations between Vietnam and  Kazakhstan. Apart from holding discussions and signing various  documents, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet exchanged views with the  leaders of these countries and achieved a strong consensus on  guidelines for broadening relations between Vietnam and each of  these countries.    It should be further noted that all three countries Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet visited highly appreciated Vietnam's  heartfelt sentiments stemming from the age-old friendship dating  back to the time of the former Soviet Union. They expressed  their hope that the two sides will jointly contribute to  consolidating this friendship and use it as a basis for mutually  beneficial cooperation both now and in the long term.    As for the two issues that are receiving public attention --  namely the liquidation of Vietnamese debts and the presence of  the Vietnamese community in the Russian Federation -- Foreign  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said:    With regard to the debt issue, our prime minister exchanged  views on this issue with the leaders of the Russian Federation  and an agreement was reached with the Russian Government to  consider rescheduling Vietnamese debts. The Russian Federation  Government will have its responsible agencies look into this  issue. Regarding the issue of the Vietnamese community in the  Russian Federation, we unanimously agreed with our friends that  their responsible agencies should exchange views and come up  with appropriate measures to settle this issue in conformity  with the friendly relations between the two countries.</p>

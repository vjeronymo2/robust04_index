			<p>BFN     [Text] Varadero, Cuba, 18 May (PL) -- Osmany Cienfuegos  Gorriaran, the recently appointed tourism minister, warned that  in this dynamic sector of the Cuban economy "there will not be  any parasols to cover up inefficiency because quality must  prevail above everything else."    Actions must be taken to encourage healthy and necessary  competition because orderly competition will prevail without  paternalism nor undeserved support, he said during the official  welcome speech at the 15th Annual Cuban Tourism Convention.  This convention will run through Friday [20 May] at this beach  resort, approximately 140 km east of Havana.    After recalling that this traditional encounter coincides  with important organizational changes in the local tourism  sector, Cienfuegos stressed that the rules (to obtain sustained  development) will be efficiency in the economy, excellence in  the quality of the services, and the professionalism of all  workers and executives.    Cinefuegos noted that the Tourism Ministry will be  streamlined and that it will not issue mandates nor dictate.  Instead, it will concentrate on development policies and oversee  their implementation.    He stressed that the ministry will manage Cuban tourist  services which, at times, have been the victim of bad  administration. This, he noted, has created a distorted image  of the industry, and he called on tour operators to comply with  what has been agreed upon contractually to avoid  misunderstandings.    "In addition to sun and beaches, in general our outdoors,  our  history, our culture, and our traditions are fundamental  elements of the Cuban tourist product," he stressed.    He affirmed that the conservation of cities and the  environment will shape the design of tourist facilities. The  extended use of the land will not take precedence over its  rational use and it will not take precedence over nature. He  noted that a culture of cement will not be created.    When referring to job opportunities in the industry, he said  all the forms of specialized tourism will be explored. The  development of aquatic sports and golf will quickly open new  opportunities to fill the void in current inducements to  vacationers.    He also commented on the fact that tourism is not only the  obligation of the so-called tourist organizations, but it also  should be the obligation of society as a whole and its  institutions.    In this regard, and without giving any more details, he  announced the utilization of a tourism council that will include  participation from various organizations, and he also mentioned  the enactment of a government law that will regulate this  sector. In addition, Cienfuegos concluded, a law on the already  charted coastlines and a code of ethics will be promulgated.</p>

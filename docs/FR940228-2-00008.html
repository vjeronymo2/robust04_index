			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Intent to Revoke <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The following firms have submitted requests, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(b), to revoke the orders covering the indicated merchandise: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=2 --> Spherical plain bearings from France_SKF <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ball bearings from Germany_NTN Kugellagerfabrik and GMN <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cylindrical roller bearings from Italy_SKF <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spherical plain bearings from Japan_NTN and Honda <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ball bearings from Japan_Honda <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cylindrical roller bearings from Japan_Honda <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(a)(2)(iii), these requests were accompanied by certifications from the firms that they had not sold the relevant class or kind of merchandise at less than fair value for a three-year period including this review period, and will not do so in the future. Each of these firms also agreed to its immediate reinstatement in the relevant antidumping orders, as long as it is subject to those orders, if the Department concludes under 19 CFR 353.22(f) that, subsequent to revocation, it sold the subject merchandise at less than fair value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the two prior reviews of these orders, we determined that SPBs from France sold by SKF, BBs from Germany sold by NTN Kugellagerfabrik and GMN, CRBs from Italy sold by SKF, and BBs, CRBs, and SPBs from Japan sold by Honda were not sold at less than fair value. In this review, we preliminarily determine that these firms, with the exception of NTN Germany and GMN, have not sold these products at less than fair value, which will satisfy the three-year period of no sales at less than fair value, if these preliminary findings are affirmed in our final results. Therefore, we intend to revoke the orders with respect to the following firms and merchandise: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=2 --> Spherical plain bearings from France_SKF <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cylindrical roller bearings from Italy_SKF <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spherical plain bearings from Japan_Honda <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ball bearings from Japan_Honda <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cylindrical roller bearings from Japan_Honda <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> With respect to SPBs from Japan sold by NTN and BBs from Germany sold by NTN and GMN, we have not established that there has been a three-year period of sales at not less than fair value. The final results of the previous administrative review indicated the existence of dumping margins on NTN's sales of SPBs from Japan (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order, 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993). In addition, we preliminarily determine in this review that there are dumping margins on NTN's sales of BBs from Germany. Therefore, we do not intend to revoke the orders on SPBs from Japan with respect to NTN or on BBs from Germany with respect to NTN. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerning GMN, as BIA, (see ``Best Information Available'' section above), we have preliminarily determined that dumping margins exist on GMN's sales of BBs from Germany during the 1992&hyph;93 review period. Furthermore, on February 10, 1994, the company withdrew its request for revocation. Therefore, we do not intend to revoke the order on BBs from Germany with respect to GMN. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Scope of Reviews <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The products covered by these reviews are antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings), and parts thereof (AFBs), and constitute the following ``class or kinds'' of merchandise: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These products include all antifriction bearings that employ balls as the rolling element.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Imports of these products are classified under the following categories: antifriction balls, ball bearings with integral shafts, ball bearings (including radial ball bearings) and parts thereof, and housed or mounted ball bearing units and parts thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Imports of these products are classified under the following Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) subheadings: 4016.93.10, 4016.9350, 8482.99.05, 8482.99.35, 8708.70.6060, 8708.93.6000, 8708.99.3100, 8708.99.4000, 8708.99.4960, 8708.5800, 8708.99.8015, 8708.99.8080. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cylindrical Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These products include all AFBs that employ cylindrical rollers as the rolling element.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] New York, 1 Jun (INA) -- Yemen has officially  accused the Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, of interfering in  the internal affairs of the Republic of Yemen.    This is contained in an official message addressed to the  Security Council by Yemeni UN Ambassador 'Abdallah al-Ashtal.    In the message, Yemen said it considers the call for  convening a Security Council meeting to be interference in its  internal affairs, which conflicts with Paragraph 7 of Article 2  of the UN Charter that says nothing in the charter justifies UN  interference in affairs that are purely part of the sovereignty  of any country, and that nothing in the charter stipulates that  member states can call for a discussion of such issues.

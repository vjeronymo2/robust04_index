			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Jan (NA) -- Argentine Vice Foreign  Minister [title as received] Fernando Petrella stated that the  ratification of the Tlatelolco Treaty by Argentina, Brazil, and  Chile "will bring tranquillity not only to these countries but  to the rest of the hemisphere, and to the international  community as well."    Petrella stressed the system "of verification and  transparency" signed by the three countries, and added that the  opposite would have been "submitting Argentina to a system of  separation and isolation that would have led it to lose the  train of development in the nuclear area."    In remarks to a radio station, Petrella said the document  ratifying the Tlatelolco Treaty by Argentina was submitted today  in Mexico City by Foreign Policy Under Secretary Rogelio Pfirter.    However, so far Brazil has not ratified the treaty, although  it had agreed with Argentina and Chile to simultaneously submit  the documents.    "What happened was a little lack of synchronization, but  Brazil will ratify the treaty, possibly in the course of the  first quarter of this year," Petrella said.    The vice foreign minister denied that the Tlatelolco  Treaty's  ratification would reduce Argentine sovereignty in nuclear  matters "because it is just a matter of preserving the country's  current capacity, attained very well in the past."    "In this manner some situations will be whitewashed and we  will be in a position to have access to technology that the  National Atomic Energy Commission and the entire Argentine  nuclear industry need," he said.    Petrella said: "Ukraine, which is a nuclear power, wants to  stop being one, the same as the Czech Republic, and North Korea,  a country with which the international community is negotiating."    "I would say that most countries will be members not only of  the common agreements but of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)  as well, which Argentina hopes to join this year, as conveyed by  the president," he said.    Petrella also stressed the "distrust" that existed among  Argentina, Brazil, and Chile concerning the nuclear issue,  "partly created by the origin of the Treaty for the Provision of  Nuclear Weapons that has marked a sort of discrimination between  those that could be nuclear powers and those that could not."    "Those countries that conducted a nuclear explosion before  1967 could become members, while all other nations, some of  which had tremendous industrial development, were left out," he  said.    In that order he said: "That sort of discrimination has  generated a distrust in countries that, in this manner, could  not have access to technology that would allow them to use  nuclear energy for peaceful purposes."    "This has demonstrated that the treaty was baseless because  countries such as ours have broadly developed that technology  without violating, by self-control, what the treaty prohibited,"  he said.</p>

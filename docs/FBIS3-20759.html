			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stanislaw Marek Krolak: "The Soul Would Like To </F> Be in Paradise"]    [Text] A hundred days is too short a period of time to sum  up the Cabinet activities but long enough to notice main trends.  At this point, Pawlak's government is in power three times  longer than his prime ministership following the fall of the  Olszewski government. We recall this incident not without  reason. One can clearly see the continuation of the same  political line: the tendency to obliterate divisions between the  Polish People's Republic (PRL) and Poland as it is now, and a  departure from all promises given during the election campaign.    The defeat of post-Solidarity parties and the poor showing  of  the BBWR [Nonpartly Bloc in Support of Reforms], the  presidential party formed in such a hurry, in the 19 September  elections allowed the left to legally take power and form a  government. It seemed to some people that one had but to look to  see the slogan "All power in the hands of the people's councils"  [a communist-era slogan]." There was no lack of people who  scared others with the return of communism. Nothing of that sort  happened because it could not happen. But it does not mean that  nothing happened. The most important threat is not the return of  a sinister ideology that is still claiming victims in the  Balkans and the Caucases but, rather, the final legalization of  the succession inherited from the PRL. Erasing dividing lines  between the thief and his victim, betrayal and patriotism,  independence and subordination to a foreign power must sooner or  later influence the country's defense and society's bearings  [??].  <H5>  The Comrades Are Returning </H5>   The first signal given to the owners of People's Poland that  it was time to return to the scene was sent as soon as 26  October at the swearing-in ceremony of Pawlak's government in  the Belweder [the presidential residence]. Leszek Miller, the  representive of the "beton'1 [hard-liners] in the PZPR [Polish  United Workers Party] (communist party), who is, together with  Rakowski [Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the last first secretary of the  PZPR], accused of illegal money dealings with the Soviets to  finance the 1989 elections, became a minister. This could appear  to be an incident--the price Pawlak had to pay because  Kwasniewski was too weak to pacify Miller's supporters in his  own party. Today, unceremoniously, Miller accuses Solidarity of  illegally receiving money from the West. The fact that the  attorney general is his colleague from the SLD [Democratic Left  Alliance] is of lesser importance. What is important, however,  is that today there are many such Millers. They are in the  government, in the central administration, and in the  voivodships. The best example may be that of Ireneusz Sekula.  This decision on the part of Waldemar Pawlak symbolically  closes the period of transition that began after the 1989  elections. It would be hard to find a clearer political message  for a population that was under communism for 45 years. Sekula,  appointed president of the Main Customs Office, was, in  Rakowski's government, responsible for the creation of a legal  base that allowed for the enfranchisement of the  nomenklatura, and he himself is today a beneficiary  of that decision. Pawlak's government seemd to be saying,  paraphrasing president Walesa, "Comrades, the time of pretending  that we are not here is over," and "Take power into your own  hands." In such a situation, should one be surprised that local  apparatchiks of the coalition government are throwing out  voivodes in order to take over their jobs? This process is not  merely the replacement of one group of people by another. The  clientele of the SLD and the PSL [Polish Peasant Party] [the two  parties in the governing coalition] throughout the years has  gotten so accustomed to sinecure and power that to try to stop  this wave could cause mutiny in its own party ranks. From the  perspective of local, presidential, and eventually parliamentary  elections, the state interest must lose with the interest of the  party. For this reason, Pawlak postponed the county (powiaty)  reform, hoping to distribute these seats after succesful  elections in June.    This whole process is, in a way, completed with the return  of  higher security officials to the departments directly  responsible for state security. The ridiculed and discredited  idea of vetting has died, and it is doubtful that it will ever  have another chance. Fortunately, there are no longer any  Russian garrisons in Poland that served as centers for  espionage. However, foreign press information that our country  is an object of strong intelligence penetration confirms fears  that foreign agents may still, in an essential way, influence  the decisionmaking process in Poland.  <H5>  Cynical Treatment of the Electorate </H5>   The slogan "It doesn't have to be like this anymore" [the  main SLD election campaign slogan] turns out to be only a  campaign promise. The SLD treated its own electorate rather  cynically, while the PSL, often in good faith, was promising  farmer paradise without consideration for what the state could  deliver. Both of these parties do not know how to fulfill these  declarations. That demagoguery ended soon after these parties  won the elections, and the slightly embarassed Pawlak stated in  the Sejm that he must continue the policy of the previous  governments. It is good, obviously, that the government does not  intend to destroy what the other governments accomplished during  past four years. But what is troublesome is the fact that, in  the programs and actions of Pawlak's Cabinet, there are no new  ideas that would stimulate faster growth. In the explanatory  statement to the draft budget law, there is no trace left of the  preelection rethoric on the tragic recession, growth stimulation  through higher inflation, radical changes in the exchange rate  of the dollar, or increased emission of the currency in order to  cover social expenses. On the other hand, the clearly visible  tendency in 1993 of an improvement in the state of public  finances greatly eased the way for the start of Prime Minister  Pawlak's government. However, because the minister of finance  came to the conclusion that further balancing of the budget by  means of cutting expenses was not possible, budget revenues and  outlays were enlarged. From the current year's tax law, we know  whence the revenues are to come. Above all, those who voted for  the left will pay for them: consumers and small businesses. "You  wanted new people in power, so you have it," one would like to  say, if it were not for the fact that here we are talking about  the poorest layers of society.  <H5>  Who in Reality Has Power? </H5>   Waldemar Pawlak seems to be aware of the danger of an  outbreak of social discontent. The prime minister's expose just  before the end of the year can be read as an expression of  anxiety, that matters are not following the earlier forecast.  This begs the essential question: Who in this Cabinet has the  deciding voice?    Already the battle surrounding the placing of people in  certain ministries (when Waldemar Pawlak withdrew certain people  from the list of names given to the president and replaced them  with SLD names) proves that nothing of importance can occur  without Aleksander Kwasniewski's approval. I do not claim that  the SLD leadership fulfills the role of a Politburo in relation  to Pawlak's government. However, there is no doubt that it is  precisely this party [SLD] that makes the strategic decisions.  The SLD consistently guards the interests of the PRL  nomenklatura, which now has time for an undisturbed  strengthening of its position in the economy. Taking over  economic control of the country's economic life, which was  allowed by the previous governments under the rulings of this  present Cabinet, will result in broadening and such a  strenghtening of the structures that no changes will be possible  in the future. The fundamentals of privatization as proposed by  Minister Kaczmarek constitute but one example of such a policy.  The forecast of Lech Mazewski, associated with the liberal  circles of the previous governments, that we are moving toward a  South American type of capitalism, where a very narrow group of  people control the whole economy, appears to be closer to  realization. This will support the formation of a new  arrangement on the political scene. In the new political  configuration, there may be found liberals from the SLD, the KLD  [Liberal-Democratic Congress], and UD [Democratic Union]. The  process of rapprochement of former political adversaries will  demand time and will depend on both the presidential elections  and the behavior of the Solidarity groups now outside  parliament. But the common economic interest, the similar  liberal views ideologically, and the fact that they share the  same electorate will lead to unity and ignoring biographical  differences.  <H5>  The Force in Adapting Oneself </H5>   The strength of Waldemar Pawlak's government is in accepting  the strategy of accommodation. This government does not wish to  antagonize either the opposition, the president, foreign  relations, or the mass media, or even the church, whose support  it seeks, wishing to create the impression that it is the only  political force defending national traditions and Christian  values. Such a strategy may bring success under the condition  that it will not be necessary to seek support from the  electorate. In the meantime, the presidential election will take  place in two years' time [late 1995]; this election designates  the time frame in which the government will have to account for  its actions to date. In this time frame, the difference in PSL  versus SLD interests will become clear. Both Aleksander  Kwasniewski and Waldemar Pawlak dream about the Belweder. The  altercations with Lech Walesa are thus unavoidable. Prime  Minister Pawlak has no need to hurry. He is counting on the fact  that time is on his side. He can wait--under the condition that  the possible failure of the government will be blamed on the  coalition partner [the SLD]. But Aleksander Kwasniewski has to  play the same game. He looks after the businessmen but courts  the electorate; he does not attack the church, but he pays  careful attention to the activities of Barbara Labuda [UD  deputy, who is outspoken in her support of abortion rights].  Both Pawlak and Kwasniewski have to keep in mind the fourth  presidential candidate--without knowing yet who this person will  be, other than Lech Walesa. How this game will end, it is hard  to forecast at this time. If it is true, as Jacek Soska [PSL  deputy] claims, that Waldemar Pawlak has no intellectual  capacity at his disposal, his government is working not for him  but for Aleksander Kwasniewski.</p>

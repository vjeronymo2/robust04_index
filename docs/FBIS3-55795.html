			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Vladimir Berezovskiy report: "Ruble Has </F> Scaled the Pamirs"]    [Text] Tashkent -- Last Sunday Tajikistan entered the  Russian ruble zone. Moscow has allocated the republic credit  worth 120 billion rubles [R]. The objective is to get the  republic's economy, brought to its knees by civil war, up and  running and to avert the real threat of famine.    During recent months, and after Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and  Turkmenistan switched to their own currencies, Tajikistan has  been buried in an avalanche of Soviet money. By hook or by  crook, this money worked its way into the Pamirs where it was  used to buy cars, houses, carpets, and valuable items. The  rapid increase in inflation cast practically the entire republic  beyond the pale of poverty. Especially as the average wage here  used not to exceed R20,000.    However, the Russian ruble does not promise Tajikistan an  immediate solution to all its problems. The government has  taken extremely unpopular measures in order to ensure that the  credit it has received will last six months, whereupon Dushanbe  will probably switch to its own national currency anyway.    And so the old money cannot be exchanged for Russian money.  Only half of January's pay will be issued in Russian money; the  rest will be paid into special accounts. The population can  place old money on deposit, but it is unclear when this will be  unfrozen. The confiscatory nature of the money reform is also  emphasized by the fact that a ceiling of R64,000 has been  imposed on wages. This is motivated by the fear that "spare"  money will flood into Russia, washing away goods and whipping up  inflation -- which was what happened before.    The introduction of the ruble, unfortunately, has hit "our  people" hardest -- those looking to resettle in Russia. Under a  government directive, only R20,000 per family member may now be  taken out of the republic. But what is to be done with the  money that was paid out for apartments, houses, dachas, cars,  and other property?</p>

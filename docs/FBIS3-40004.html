			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Michielsen report on interview with FYROM Foreign </F> Trade Minister Stevo Crvenkovski in The Hague; date not given:  "`If we Survive This, We Will Survive Anything'"]    [Text] The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] is  stuck between two embargoes: First, the UN embargo against its  northern neighbor, the former Yugoslavia, which used to account  for 70 percent of its trade and now contributes nothing. And  now, there is the recent Greek boycott, which is costing FYROM  another 70 percent of its trade. But Foreign Trade Minister  Stevo Crvenkovski remains optimistic.    The FYROM Foreign Trade Minister Stevo Crvenkovski, who was  in the Netherlands for a brief visit, said he still did not know  why Greece had chosen this moment to restart its boycott of  FYROM which ended last year. "We have not provoked them," he  said. In fact, Greece has made it very clear why they want to  close off FYROM from the outside world at this particular time.  The measures, Greek Trade Minister Simitis said last week, were  "a necessary consequence of the premature recognition" of FYROM  by the entire international community, including EU [European  Union] countries and the United States.    The recognition has irritated the Greeks because they feel,  as they have done since 1991 when their northern neighbor became  independent, that FYROM should change its name, flag, and  constitution. Because the name and constitution contain  implicit territorial claims on the Greek province of Macedonia  and the flag still contains a Greek symbol, the Star of Vergina,  it is therefore "a provocation." Athens wants to talk about  bilateral relations only when FYROM has met these conditions.    The solidarity from abroad has not yet helped FYROM: Greece  is holding firm. Nor will the visit by European Commissioner  Hans van den Broek to Skopje and Athens today and tomorrow  produce much, because "Van den Broek is not mediating,"  Crvenkovski said. "Our talks with him will be limited to trade  relations with the EU only."    Therefore FYROM must reckon with an economic blockade which  will last some time and could have dramatic consequences. No  trade is possible with its northern neighbor, the former  Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), because of the UN embargo.  Trading with FYROM's other neighbors, Albania and Bulgaria, is  difficult, because there are no rail links with these countries  and, as Crvenkovski said, "the road links are bad, they are  fully used and are completely jammed." Therefore FYROM is  isolated economically by the Greek decision.    "It is one disaster after another," Crvenkovksi said. "The  embargo against Yugoslavia has cost us US$3 billion, according  to international estimates. The EU has promised us US$120  million compensation but that has only been given in part and  what still gets through has to come via Greece, therefore that  too is at a standstill. We have suffered relatively more damage  than the rest of Yugoslavia's neighbors: They have lost 5-10  percent of their foreign trade, we have lost 60-70 percent."    Add to that the fact that FYROM was already poor, that it is  in the middle of economic restructuring, that it is groaning  under the strict conditions of an IMF stabilization program, and  that last year it was hit by the worst drought in 50 years. It  was clear that the Greek measure, to put it mildly, came at a  very bad time, he said. "In a normal situation the closure of  the southern border by the Greeks would have been a big, but not  extreme problem," he said. "However, now it is an extreme  problem. There is no alternative to the route through Greece."    He went to Albania himself last week, he said, and Tirana is  offering full cooperation but can do little in practice.  Bulgaria is offering FYROM the harbor of Boergas as an  alternative to Thessaloniki but this "good gesture" does not  mean much, because "the harbor is not the problem, but the  roads, the connections." No, he said, the best thing was to  talk to the Greeks, but they did not want to. "Talks continued  until last April," he said. "Then the Greeks asked to suspend  them because of their elections. The talks were never  restarted. As far as we are concerned we have not finished  discussing; we are ready to talk again at any moment."    But Crvenkovski would hear nothing of prior conditions, as  demanded by Greece. "After all it is impossible to negotiate  about any subject whatsoever without a negotiating process," he  said. It was clear in advance that FYROM has no territorial  claims on any of its neighbors. "But we have always said that,"  he added.    FYROM, closed off as it is, will only be able to defend  itself against Greek surprise attacks in the long term. With  international aid, work is continuing on an East-West link, a  Transbalkan road, railroad and communication networks which are  to link FYROM to the world -- Italy and Turkey -- via Albania  and Bulgaria. However, that is a question of years and in the  meantime the whole of the FYROM economy could be run down.  There were already social and ethnic tensions in FYROM,  Crvenkovski said. "As experience shows, they grow as economic  conditions worsen," he said. "No economy in the world is able  to survive complete isolation from its normal markets."    This does not stop the minister from remaining optimistic.  "The FYROM economy is stronger than during the previous Greek  boycott," he said. "We have been independent for three years  now. We are better organized. We have state institutions.  There is a functioning system." In the meantime 50,000 private  companies have been set up in FYROM, he said. "If two-thirds go  bankrupt, one third will still remain, with which we can  continue. We have already gone through a lot. The fact that we  have survived these blows during these three years illustrates  the vitality of our economy. If we survive this, we will  survive anything. Then there will be every reason for optimism."</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Telecoms ministers stress role of global 'highway' The early construction of a global information 'superhighway' is critical to achieving balanced economic growth over the next century, telecommunications ministers from nearly 50 countries will declare this week. A draft of the communique from a ministerial meeting, to be held in Kyoto, Japan, this week, focuses on telecoms expansion as a key element in economic advance in developed and less developed countries. The communique, due to be released on Thursday, is likely to be less explicit about the best means for fostering telecoms expansion, despite recent strong pressure from the US and international agencies in favour of privatisation and competition. The ministers' meeting is being sponsored by Japan's ministry of posts and telecommunications to coincide with a plenipotentiary conference of the International Telecommunications Union, to be held in Kyoto from today. Although several major regional groups, including the EU's Bangemann committee, have examined the implications of new superhighways, the ministers' meeting will be the first high-level gathering at which both developed and developing countries address the issue. It is likely to have a significant impact on a Group of Seven industrialised nations meeting set for next February to discuss a global information network. The Kyoto communique, prepared from statements submitted by participating countries, emphasises the desirability of developing 'superhighway' infrastructures on a global basis so advanced information and communications services can be provided to every country and region as soon as possible. Although subject to modification based on discussion during the meeting, it reflects strong concern among developing countries that they could be left behind in the modernisation of international telecoms. Most developing countries have fewer than five telephone lines per 100 people, compared with more than 40 per head across the developed world. The developed world is also far ahead in the use of mobile communications. According to a senior official at the Japanese ministry: 'Information will become more and more important for economic activity, particularly as the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreement makes the flow of goods and services increasingly smooth.'

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee rise meets resistance - Market Report COFFEE prices rose again at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday. The May futures position edged up to resistance at Dollars 1,250 a tonne before backing off Dollars 1 by the close, still up Dollars 6. Traders said sentiment was still friendly although some thought the market looked overbought and that producer selling might be attracted . The COCOA market cautiously embraced Friday's strong gains in New York, which were attributed to chart-inspired fund buying. By the close the May position was Pounds 13 higher at Pounds 932 a tonne, having eased from an earlier peak of Pounds 937. Traders said the US jump was primarily a short-covering rally and predicted more sober gains for London. 'We'll probably consolidate here, we don't have the spec interest,' one said.

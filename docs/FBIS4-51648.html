			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Policy Committee [FAPC] and secretary-1 of the  State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], met with  officers and staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs reception hall at 0745 this morning  and delivered an address concerning departmental affairs.    The ceremony was attended by FAPC members Home Affairs  Minister Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn, National Planning and Economic  Development Minister Brigadier General Abel, Foreign Affairs  Minister U Ohn Gyaw, Attorney General U Tha Tun, SLORC Office  Director General Lieutenant Colonel Pe Nyein, and Myanmar  [Burmese] ambassadors, directors general, officers, and staff of  the Foreign Ministry.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that personnel from the  Foreign  Ministry know very well that the SLORC has given special  consideration to international relations and has accordingly  worked for Myanmar [Burma] to have a good image in the  international community. The SLORC, which took on the  responsibilities of the state on 18 September 1988, in its  Announcement No. 3/88 of that day stated that the Union of  Myanmar will continue to pursue an independent and active  foreign policy. Everybody knows, he noted, that the SLORC has  implemented its foreign policy with straightforwardness and  dignity in the area of international relations since then. He  also noted, that it [the SLORC] has faced and steadfastly  overcome -- and is still steadfastly overcoming -- threats,  impasses, allegations, pressures, and tensions so as not to  deviate from its independent and active foreign policy. [passage  omitted on diplomatic principles and rejoining Nonaligned  Movement]    He remarked that Myanmar has constantly opposed allegations  based on the original fixed standard of human rights, which is  without any regard to a country's significant historical,  cultural, religious, and traditional backgrounds. Khin Nyunt  explained that Myanmar has already accepted human rights  standards in accordance with its own cultural and traditional  background and these standards are the main consideration for  the Myanmar people. He noted that, although the contribution of  labor is a noble deed in Myanmar tradition, western tradition  eyes it as forced labor and a violation of human rights. Next,  he observed that Myanmar is working together with United Nations  human rights organizations to show Myanmar's sincere desire to  cooperate with international organizations concerning human  rights. [passage omitted on cooperation with UNHCR, neighboring  countries, and international organizations]    Continuing, Lt. Gen Khin Nyunt explained that the SLORC, in  order to effectively and extensively implement matters relating  to foreign affairs, has formed the FAPC with responsible  personnel from the government. He explained that the FAPC has  been responsible for important policy matters concerning  international relations. Next, he noted that the SLORC has  reorganized the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control and has  stepped up its efforts with increased momentum on drug  eradication. [passage omitted on formation of border development  committee, drug eradication efforts, and formation of  environmental protection committee] He remarked that the damage  to Myanmar's image caused by allegations based on human rights,  drug eradication, and environmental protection matters can be  repaired if the current achievements are made known to the  international community. He noted that the main duty of the  Foreign Ministry service personnel is to inform the  international circle about the accomplishments, the government's  stance, and its goodwill. [passage omitted on activities of  information committee] He stated, only when one knows the true  facts about one's country can one be able to explain it to  others. Khin Nyunt urged the foreign service personnel to study  more about the country's true facts and to explain those genuine  conditions when opportunity arises for the benefit of the  country. [passage omitted on national convention, economic  reforms, economic plans, personal affairs of foreign service  personnel, national objectives, national reconciliation, and  border development]    He explained that he was saddened to hear that some armed  organizations have not only neglected the country's goodwill  gesture for national reconciliation but have been planning to  create obstacles for the country. He noted that these  organizations have accepted assistance from countries and  organizations which are trying to influence Myanmar, and are  drawing up plans and trying to humiliate and tarnish Myanmar's  image on the international stage. He remarked that they have  approached foreign governments, nongovernmental organizations,  and international organizations and have given them fabricated  news concerning Myanmar; they have drawn up and engaged in plans  to create difficulties, to exert pressure, to impose political  and economic sanctions, and finally to isolate Myanmar from the  international community. He said that they are using all kinds  of ways to influence various international organizations. In  implementing their plans, they have arranged talks and seminars  at foreign universities and among intellectuals, and have  approached organizations that present awards. Khin Nyunt  explained that it can be clearly seen that they have now even  reached the international organization level by using human  rights as a leading tool. He noted that since these  organizations are using diplomatic and other means to implement  their plans, the state [Myanmar] will also have to use the right  diplomatic approach to let the world know of the state's  constructive views. He stated that last year a special  delegation was sent to several countries to explain Myanmar's  stance, objective, and achievements. [passage omitted on  diplomatic code of conduct, and cooperation among departments]    Finally, Khin Nyunt urged foreign service personnel to abide  by the diplomatic code of conduct in performing their duties and  responsibilities, to let the world know about the state's  objectives and accomplishments, to uphold the dignity of a  diplomat and abstain from activities that would tarnish the  country's status, to safeguard Myanmar culture and traditions  and to be patriotic, to be loyal to the country and the people,  to adhere to the public services code of conduct and to fulfill  the national duties of a citizen, and to work for the betterment  of the country and the people with a spirit of unity. The  ceremony concluded at 0900.</p>

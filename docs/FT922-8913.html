			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Arts: The Hypochondriacs - Theatre Plato's Cratylus knew that far from being able to step into the same river twice, one could not step into the same river once. He eventually settled on moving his finger in response to everything. A measure of Cratylus's view is essential for enjoying Botho Strauss's The Hypochondriacs at the Citizens Theatre, Glasgow. Without it, the evening becomes frustrating and pointless: intellectually vibrant but theatrically dull. Strauss's expressionist play relies on the notion that anything can mean anything: time becomes elastic, and lives have purpose only in relation to others. Strauss wrote the play when he was 26; it belies its 1972 premiere, seeming much more from the 1930s. The play marries magic realism to a form of implacable logic, a meeting of Gunter Grass and Wittgenstein. As explanation for its method, the play offers this: 'an apparently free and planlessly spent life is only a prelude to the moment when you realise it.' The plot flickers in and out of prominence, undermined by characters unsure of themselves: 'What exactly are we talking about?' - 'I don't know, I was just reacting.' However, a sequence of events emerges, and the action occurs in turn-of-the-century Germany, just before psychoanalysis would have made it all explicable. Vladimir, an incurable hypochondriac, lives with his lover Nelly. She has been bailed on a murder charge by two dodgy pharmaceutical entrepreneurs after a cure for tuberculosis. Around them, Vladimir's mother, father and maid weave a sinister intrigue worthy of Len Deighton in Ipcress File form. Vladimir's diseased and decadent intelligence is met by Nelly's cool hysteria and the extraordinary venom of his Mother. Each has a litany of non-verbal gestures, mimes, grunts and statements which are variously interpreted by those around them. One does not need to be a student of Saussure to realise that collective communication is under threat where meaning itself is random. People agree not in what they say, but in the form of their life. The play's consistencies come from an awkward faith in personality. Anything a character does is consistent, so the unexpected simply disappears. This drains the evening of dramatic tension; for where anything can happen, nothing can surprise. The pleasures of Strauss's play are more arcane: he invites a theatrical daydreaming; he urges thinking about thinking, so one finds that this really does provoke thought. The set answers the disjunctions of the text; sofas on lime chippings surround a fish tank. 'All the things around us,' one character confides, 'we observe at the same time as we bring them about'; so the actors move the furniture obsessively, repositioning the stage impedimenta. The acting is detached and precise, with fine performances from Julie Saunders as Nelly and Gerrard McArthur as Vladimir and his father. David Fielding's direction slows the play to a crawl, but then he has been faced with the task of staging an attitude of mind. Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, until May 23 (041 429 0022)</p>

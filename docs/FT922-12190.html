			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Arts: The stuff of Zen and Shinto An exhibition, Earth, Air, Fire, Water, of the work of the young Japanese sculptor, Takashito Endo, makes a striking initial impact: a huge and solid drum of densely charred wood at one end of the gallery, a circle of not so thoroughly burnt posts at the other, with their tops cupped and filled to the brim with water, and in the middle, lying on the floor, a large broken bronze circle like a giant's bracelet. Such romantic and associative minimalism is hardly novel in itself, nor is it particularly difficult or obscure in these late modern days, but it is none the less interesting and imaginatively potent. Its affinity to the work of our own middle generation of sculptors, such as Richard Long and David Nash, is clear almost to the point - at a superficial glance - of actual derivation, but to push that impression too far would be both unfair and misleading. The points of similarity between the British and the Japanese lie with a common feeling for landscape and for the materials of nature and the landscape. The garden is accepted as a work of art by both cultures and, even in our mutual decadence, a sense of long historical continuity is still strong and instinctive. For our part, we still respond to the spirit of place, vested in such things as megaliths, tombs and monuments, relics of an ancient and forgotten past. The point of difference is that while still felt, it is indeed forgotten. Nash with his low charcoal mound in the forest, like a black barrow, or his ovens and fires, Long with his stone lines, cairns and circles, might hint at old meanings, rituals, beliefs, but the old religion that gave them force is but folk memory and superstition. Endo, on the other hand, is of a culture that needs no Guy Fawkes excuse for its autumn beacons. The mythic symbolism that informs his work is still the stuff of active belief and daily practice, of Zen Buddhism and animistic Shinto. The fire still purifies and renews what it destroys, the water still succours and revives. And always there is the form itself, the object as sculpture, to bring the work back into the currency of modernism. The physical presence of these objects is very strong, the smell rich and pungent, the surface irresistibly tactile, the image simple and monumental. * * * Meanwhile the upper galleries of the ICA, which remain two of the most beautiful exhibition spaces in London, hold a small show of recent works by the young Scottish artist Callum Innes. He was until lately a figurative painter, an approach he has abandoned in favour of a rigorous yet seductive minimalism. The imagery, such as it is, is the direct and natural expression of the method he has chosen to employ to make it, usually reductive, sometimes passively sedimentary. He lays a rich ground of oilpaint across the canvas, which he then erodes or removes selectively in various ways. A stiff stump of a brush rubs away the pigment along a single straggling line down the centre of the canvas. Successive trickles of turpentine run down the surface, washing away the pigment. As the spirit evaporates and the paint dries, so the surface wrinkles and contracts to achieve the craquelure of dried mud on a river bed. An ochre wash, with the pigment in dense suspension, dries and settles like the sand as the tide goes out. Again, the influences are manifest, with Innes looking especially to American minimalists, such as Barnett Newman, Robert Ryman and Morris Louis. But he remains his own man, going further than Newman's bland and inflated graphic simplicity. And, close as he is to Ryman in his physical interest in the surfaces of paint, he rejects his monochrome persistence. He is indeed a romantic, evidently happy in the associative qualities of his work, for all its immediate physical preoccupations. He is no narrow theoretician, no insistent minimalist 'the paint is paint, surface surface man'. The scale of these things is for the most part merely medium-large, by modern standards. They are scrupulously made and rather beautiful, and of course they do raise certain questions. Is it all just a shade too easy? Just where may the line be drawn between a legitimate painterly enquiry and development and an indulgent, exquisite aestheticism? What is the point? There can be no answers to such questions, save only what subsequent work affords. Should indeed the work come to confine itself merely to predictable and elegant variation, then those doubts would naturally confirm themselves as positive accusations. But Innes is young enough, and his work properly varied and rich enough to secure, for the moment at least, the benefit of those doubts. He must only let the work lead him where it will, rather than content himself with effects he has already mastered. The pictorial imagination, its spaces conjured by a single wobbly line crossing and dividing a ground, should see him through.

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Gemms come back into fashion - Sara Webb looks at the recent turnround in interest in trading gilts GILT trading is back in fashion again, if the latest round of musical chairs is anything to go by. Securities houses are queueing up at the Bank of England for approval to set up as gilt-edged market-makers, or Gemms, lured by the prospect of earning healthy profits. The recent spate of hirings of gilt traders, sales staff, economists and trading strategists is testimony to the fact that at least two houses have serious intentions of setting up in the near future. Yamaichi International (Europe), the European arm of the Japanese securities house, is expected to start operating as a Gemm later this month while Merrill Lynch is likely to follow suit soon. Both have been busy recruiting to complement their existing bond trading operations. Yamaichi hired Mr John Shepperd and Mr Nigel Richardson, two of SG Warburg Securities' better-known UK economists, Mr John Battye (Warburg's head of gilt sales), and Mr Jim Goodey (NatWest's head of gilt trading), as well as three gilt traders and three sales staff. Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch has hired Mr Stephen Rumsey, former chief executive of BZW's bond operations, Mr Ifty Islam, BZW's gilt economist, Mr Dominic Franklin, from BZW's Eurosterling operations, Mr John Standeven, a bond analyst at BZW, Mr Tony Gray, Daiwa's short-dated gilt trader, Mr Alex Miller, NatWest's medium-dated gilt trader, and Mr Jeff Derx, NatWest's head of gilt sales. In addition to Yamaichi and Merrill, ABN-Amro of the Netherlands and Chemical Bank are understood to be considering setting up as Gemms. The desire for such status marks a turnround in interest in gilt trading. Following the reorganisation of the gilt market at the time of Big Bang, several houses found they could not make sufficient money and pulled out. These included both Merrill and Hoare Govett, now owned by ABN-Amro. The sudden demand for gilt specialists means firms are having to pay dearly for qualified staff, with market rumours circulating of seven-digit salaries and three-year guaranteed contracts. Clearly, some Gemms are worried their best people will be poached by newcomers. The combination of falling interest rates and high government debt issuance (after a period in which the government was buying back debt and the size of the gilt market had shrunk) provide an ideal scenario for making profits out of gilt trading. Mr Bob Pearce, head of gilt sales at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Since we left the ERM, we've been in a major bull market. We've been helped by favourable financing conditions since the positive shape of the yield curve means there is a lower funding cost for long positions.' Gemms as a group - there are 19 - posted an increase in overall profits in 1992 for the third year in a row. Their combined post-tax profit amounted to Pounds 65m, up from Pounds 49m in 1991, according to the Bank of England. The overall post-tax return on the Gemms' starting capital was 15 per cent in 1992, up from 12.4 per cent the previous year. The table shows the profits made by the Gemms in 1992 and in some cases, 1992/93 (the most recent years for which figures are available), taken from accounts filed at Companies House. BZW, the UK securities house, retained its position at the top of the league for the fourth consecutive year, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 37.174m. It was helped by the diversity of its trading strategies, which helped to spread risk, although rivals point out that BZW's figures include not only gilt trading but also its Eurosterling and Ecu government bond business, whereas some houses only include their gilt operations in the figures they file. The Eurosterling sector has seen record new issuance this year and several houses are thought to have benefited from this, due to the fact that Eurosterling bonds offer a better margin (in terms of the bid-offer spread), and generate fee income for lead managers. The ranking of Gemms' profits is a matter of much rivalry. 'The fundamental thing is you don't have a true league table of profits in this area as the figures are not strictly comparable,' complained one Gemm, who preferred to remain anonymous. While 1992 has clearly been a good year for most Gemms, many expect 1993 to be as good or even better, due to the continued rally in the gilts market and the prospect of continued new supply. If the immediate future looks rosy, though, some warn that as interest rates bottom out, 1994 could prove a more difficult year for making profits. 'You wonder whether some of these chaps who are coming in now are getting in at the top of the market,' scoffed one veteran of the gilt market.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            GILT-EDGED MARKET MAKERS' PRE-TAX PROFITS (LOSSES)                     Year-ending December 31 (poundsm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         1991       1992 BZW                                    25.67      37.17 Salomon Brothers                        5.99       14.1 Greenwell                               3.54      10.64 UBS                                    7.438      7.913 Kleinwort Benson                     (0.333)       6.28 Gilts Nomura Gilts1                           2.93       5.60                                       (91/2)     (92/3)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daiwa Europe                             5.1 (Gilts)2                              (91/2) Goldman Sachs3                         5.347        4.9                                       (90/1)     (91/2) Gerrard &amp; National                     2.644      2.645 Sec. 4                                 (91/2)     (92/3) SG Warburg                          (3.732)       2.43 Gilt-Edged5                           (91/2)     (92/3) NatWest Gilts                           1.73      1.291 Lehman Brothers                        3.239      1.053 Gilts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BT Gilts                               2.111      1.033 JP Morgan                            (0.955)      0.171 Sterling Sec.

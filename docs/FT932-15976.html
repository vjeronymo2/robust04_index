			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Council tax 'will benefit two thirds of households' TWO THIRDS of households will pay less under the council tax this year than they paid last year under the poll tax, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a social policy think tank. An institute report published today says that the new tax will bring greatest benefit to the lowest-income households. People who can afford high-value homes and single-person households will lose most. The structure of the tax contributes to the number of gainers, the institute says. Other factors include the 6 per cent fall in the amount to be collected by the council tax and the government's transitional relief scheme to limit increases over poll tax levels. Nearly 65 per cent of councils are raising less in local taxation in 1993-94 than in 1992-93. Almost half of all households will gain more than Pounds 50 a year from the introduction of the council tax, the report finds. The biggest gainers are the unemployed, who will get 100 per cent rebates on their council tax, compared with a maximum poll tax rebate of 80 per cent. The poorest 30 per cent of households gain the most from the change on average, according to the report. People with homes in valuation bands A to D (worth less than Pounds 88,000 in England) are also net gainers. The council tax is regressive in its overall impact: the rich pay a smaller percentage of their income than middle-income earners. However, it is less regressive than the poll tax, mainly because the benefit system has become more generous. The tax also redistributes the burden between different regions. Bills have increased substantially in London and the south-east, the report says. The north, north-west, east Midlands and west Midlands are substantial gainers. The feared avalanche of appeals against council tax valuations has so far failed to materialise, writes Rhodri Davies. Ministers had made provision for council tax offices to handle about 1m appeals between April 1 and November 30. It was assumed that there would be widespread protests over a tax which places each house in one of eight property bands. The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation had suggested that council offices had been flooded with up to 1.2m inquiries - almost 10 per cent of property owners. But revised Inland Revenue estimates say there had been about 410,000 queries, of which less than 60 per cent were thought to be potential appellants. The impact of the tax has been cushioned by the government's Pounds 340m transitional relief package and by some 200,000 changes to the draft valuations, recommended by councils to the listings officers before the tax was introduced. But many householders have yet to receive the new tax bills, and many of those who ignored the notice of valuation they received from their council may react once they see the bill. Right This Time?

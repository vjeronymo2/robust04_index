			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The following are main  points of a statement issued by Social Democratic Party Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama:    -- The SDP did its utmost to secure the election of Tsutomu  Hata as prime minister of Japan.    -- We expected Hata to convene a meeting of leaders of the  coalition parties and express the basic position of a new  cabinet. But no such request was made.    -- While we were waiting, secret preparations were made to  establish a new unified parliamentary group "Kaishin"  (Innovation) without consulting the SDP.    -- The establishment of the new group infringes the  relationship of trust among the coalition parties.    -- After intensive discussions, we signed the coalition  policy accord just prior to the establishment of a new  government. This was the result of sincere efforts we had made  from the standpoint of continuing the reform policies launched  by the Hosokawa cabinet and of maintaining the framework of the  coalition.    -- It was agreed upon that a change in the formation of the  government must be discussed among coalition parties. It is  unpardonable for specific parties or individuals to ignore those  processes and destroy the framework arbitrarily.    -- The SDP cannot permit such arbitrary maneuvering by a new  coalition government which amplifies the sense of distrust among  the people in politics. Therefore, the SDP cannot remain as a  member of the coalition, is determined to promote political  reform together with the people, and cannot respond to calls for  formation of a new cabinet. However, we will make every effort  to help the economy recover, including the enactment of the  fiscal 1994 budget as promised.</p>

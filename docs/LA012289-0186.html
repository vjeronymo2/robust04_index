			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA'S DOG FEES  </P> <P> Santa Ana residents were recently outraged by the Gestapo-like tactics of city  representatives who knocked on their door and demanded immediate payment of dog  license fees.  </P> <P> Due to the high rate of crime in Santa Ana, many residents have obtained a dog,  primarily as a deterrent to burglars. Who would deny that a dog is more of a  deterrent to unwanted intruders than a cat? Yet, cat owners are not subject to  paying license fees.  </P> <P> Not too long ago, a Santa Ana police officer suggested that concerned residents  obtain a Doberman pinscher because the understaffed Police Department was no  longer able to control crime in our city. Shortly thereafter, the city decided  to revise its 5-year plan to address public safety, specifically to hire 10 new  police officers for each of the next 5 years -- a total of 50 police officers.  This, apparently, is an admission that crime, in fact, was out of control in  Santa Ana and predictions indicate that it will continue to get worse for at  least the next 5 years.  </P> <P> Therefore, shouldn't dogs be considered an integral part of the city  crime-prevention effort? If dogs are involved in crime reduction in our city,  why should their owners be subject to paying a license fee?  </P> <P> If enough dog owners agree and let their elected representatives know, in all  fairness, the city should pay the owners a maintenance fee rather than charge  the owners a license fee.  </P> <P> JIM TUCKER  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

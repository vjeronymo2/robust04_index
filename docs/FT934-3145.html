			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Black Sea bank for Thessalonika - Institution aims to forge new links with ex-Comecon states The Greek city of Thessalonika was yesterday chosen as the site of the newly established Black Sea Trade and Development Bank at a meeting of foreign ministers of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation group in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital. The choice of Thessalonika, beating bids from Istanbul, Sofia, Bucharest and Costanza underscores the relative maturity of Greek financial instititutions and also its membership of the European Union. The agreement gives a symbolic boost to a pact set up in 1992, largely at Ankara's prompting, to reforge economic links in the wake of the communist collapse, between the region's market economies and the former Comecon countries. The group comprises Turkey, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, and represents a market of 325m consumers from the Balkans to the Caucasus. The bank will be capitalised at SDR1bn (Pounds 930m), with a paid up capital of SDR100m. The three bigget economies - Turkey, Greece and the Russian Federation - will each contribute 16.5 per cent, with smaller amounts from the others. The bank is also expected to seek funds from multilateral agencies such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Turkey will provide the bank chairman, while the vice chairman will be a Bulgarian. According to a draft of the resolution agreed yesterday, the bank will 'promote regional projects and assist in intra-regional trade especially in capital goods'. A Greek official said Thessalonika, with 240 local banks and 10 foreign banks, was well placed to secure access to international finance. The Black Sea is currently considering various telecommunications projects, free ports, and a road corridor linking the littoral states.</p>

He has  already been there three times, his most recent visit ending in  Beijing last Friday. And his meetings with Mrs. Wu Yi, his  Chinese counterpart, minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, have a touch of complicity, rather like school  friends meeting again after the long vacation.    This did not prevent Robert Urbain from giving Mrs. Wu Yi a  short expose on the beauties of democracy and giving her a list  of political prisoners drawn up by Amnesty International. Last  year, the minister remained silent on the subject of human  rights, not without prompting some criticism...in Belgium. The  minister is pursued by his public even on the other side of the  world!    Despite these admonitions which are generally frowned upon  by  China, Mrs. Wu Yi had no hesitation in giving the  Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union (UEBL) a "good report" with  regard to the development of trade. According to her figures,  bilateral trade increased by 39 percent last year, reaching $1.4  billion, of which $786 million were Belgian exports (in other  words up 71.4 percent). This Belgian trade surplus is due  (according to the Belgians) to Chinese industry's insatiable  demand for new and imported materials. But China also tried to  inundate the European markets last year at any cost, believing  that this year would serve as a reference for fixing the  European single market's import quotas: This hope was dashed,  the reference years stop at 1992, and Mrs. Wu Yi was strongly  critical of the European Union (EU), even reserving the right to  take "any measures" necessary to protect her country's  interests...  <H5>  Economic Growth of At Least 9 Percent This Year </H5>   Mrs. Wu Yi's only criticism of Belgium is the (high) prices  and especially the reduction in credit from Brussels to fund its  purchases of Belgian technology. Before 1989, the year of the  Tian Anmen Square [as published] massacre, it amounted to 400  million Belgian francs, it was then reduced to 200 million,  before increasing to 230 million last year, providing finance  for only 40 percent of Chinese purchases... Indeed, China is  trying increasingly to have its development paid for by other  countries, even if its means repaying the (reduced) interest  over very long periods, whereas the industrialized states prefer  to allow the capital markets (and the client states) to fund  infrastructure projects. A trial of strength has therefore  started between China, which intends to impose its preconditions  as the only country in the world to maintain strong growth (at  least 9 percent this year), and the GATT signatory countries who  are trying to guard against "development for free."    Robert Urbain gave an indirect response to the Chinese  expectations, stating that the ceilings on the pledges of the  National Export Guarantee Office (providing state guarantees for  contracts signed with China) for China had just been doubled,  making it possible to considerably increase the cover for  exports by Belgian enterprises operating in the Celestial Empire.  <H5>  Alcatel Bell, and ATEA Confirm their Presence </H5>   Foremost among them is Alcatel Bell with its new telephone  exchange factory in Pudong, Shanghai: A Belgian loan of $125  million is imminent and, when it reaches cruising speed at the  end of this year, it will become the biggest factory of its kind  in the world, with a production capacity of 5 million lines per  year, with a significant proportion of the components being  imported from Belgium.    In the same niche, ATEA, a subsidiary of Siemens, is  preparing to export exchanges worth $133 million to China.  Finally, among other promising Belgian developments, we should  mention Ahlers, the shipowner, which, after setting up an  initial joint consulting enterprise, is waiting for the go-ahead  to set up "Asco," a Belgian-Chinese maritime company, in the  port of Shanghai...    Finally, Robert Urbain's visit, which also took place in  Shanghai and Suzhou [as published] (another large coastal city),  made it possible to show what the minister calls the "growing  interconnection" of the two countries' economies, in particular  with the holding of the 13th Belgian-Chinese joint commission  meeting devoted to the funding of projects some of which have  already been mentioned. This public mission is announcing at  least three more visits by industrialists scheduled to take  place between May and September.  <H5>  Logistics Entrusted to the Chinese Administration? </H5>   These visits are being organized by Fabrimetal (with the  Bank  Association) and by the Antwerp chamber of commerce (with the  Kredietbank). They will provide an opportunity to make the  essential visits to Beijing and Shanghai, but also to less usual  cities like Dalian, Chongching, Nankin, or Xian. [as published]    Unfortunately, according to several Belgian sources in  China,  these missions, to reduce their organizational costs, tend to do  without the support of local expatriates and to entrust their  logistics to cumbersome Chinese administrative departments like  the CCPIT (Central Commission for Industrial Promotion), thus  depriving themselves of contacts and services which would be  very useful to novice businessmen arriving on Asian soil...</p>

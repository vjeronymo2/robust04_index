			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 21 February broadcasts the  35-minute sixth of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures,  and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture  Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the  Economic System."    The sixth lecture, entitled: "Mechanisms for Price  Formulation," is presented by Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the  State Planning Commission.    After recalling how the irrational system of  state-controlled  prices hindered economic growth in the pre-reform years, Luo  discusses three issues regarding the establishment of mainly  market- based, price-forming mechanisms: 1) A review of the  basic situation in price reform over the past 15 years. Luo  recalls the following "fundamental" changes in China's price  mechanisms as a result of 15 years of reform: The highly  centralized system of government-set prices has been dismantled  in favor of the market-based formation of most commodity prices  through the gradual decentralization of government price-setting  power. Market supply and demand is becoming increasingly  influential in determining prices, causing the irrational price  structure to become rational. A new system for monitoring and  controlling prices in keeping with the demands of the socialist  market economy has been initiated. 2) The necessity of  continuing to deepen price reform. Luo notes that although 15  years of price reform have produced "notable" results, many  problems have yet to be solved. One of the problems, he says,  is the failure to decontrol prices on a handful of potentially  competitive goods and services. Another is the unduly low  government-set prices for a few basic products and  infrastructure. A third is the lack of effective economic and  legal means by which the government regulates and controls  market prices. Luo then goes on to outline three main tasks for  continuing to deepen price reform, which are: "1. Seizing the  opportune moment to decontrol government-set prices on  individual commodities and to further expand the scope of market  regulation and control. 2. Gradually raising the unduly low  prices of a few basic products and infrastructure to enhance the  national economy's potential for continued development. 3.  Establishing a sound system of price regulation and control by  the government, as well as sound laws and regulations concerning  prices, in order to regulate the order of market prices." 3)  The basic principles for carrying out price reform. In  explaining these basic principles, Luo says: "Price reform must  promote the development of social productive forces," "the  general level of prices should be kept relatively stable," and  "the interests of the state, enterprises, and individuals should  be taken into account."    The lecture concludes at 0640 GMT.</p>

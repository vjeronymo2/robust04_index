			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Relief for development projects - Business support Tax reliefs for contributions to business development and training organisations will continue, and there will be a new relief for business contributions to Business Links - an initiative designed to provide a single point of access for local business support agencies. The latter relief will apply to contributions made on or after yesterday and before April 1, 2000. The existing tax relief for business contributions to Local Enterprise Agencies (LEAs), Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales and Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) in Scotland, which is due to expire on April 1 1995 will be extended to April 1 2000. The chancellor's intention is to give an incentive for donations to Business Links and at the same time bring the period for the existing reliefs for contributions to LEAs, Tecs and Lecs into line with the new relief. The Treasury said yesterday: 'The new tax relief will apply to contributions by businesses (in cash or kind) to projects authorised by the Department of Trade and Industry to use the service mark 'Business Links'. The relief will be given by way of a deduction in calculating business profits for tax purposes.' Contributions by businesses to LEAs, Tecs and Lecs already qualify for relief under Sections 79 and 79A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. This is due to expire on April 1 1995, but will be extended to apply to contributions made before April 1 2000. The cost of the proposals will depend on the number of donations made, but is not expected to be large. Business Links is designed to provide a single point of access for agencies including Tecs, LecS, LEAs, chambers of commerce, and local authorities, designed to offer a package of services targeted to meet the needs of local business. A project will not be able to use the service mark 'Business Links' without DTI approval. The Budget also proposes to extend tax relief for vocational training to National Vocational Qualifications and Scottish Vocational Qualifications at level 5 and to exclude from tax relief children under 16, and 16- to 18-year-olds in full-time education at a school, and training undertaken wholly or mainly for recreational purposes or as a leisure activity. The intention is to broaden the tax relief so that it is available for vocational training at all levels, and at the same time ensure that it is given only for genuine vocational training. The changes will take effect from January 1 1994. The proposal will cost less than Pounds 1m in the first year, but might increase to around Pounds 5m in a few years. The yield from the restrictions to the relief will be negligible.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Arts: Bad vision at Victoria - Architecture The best kind of architecture is appropriate architecture. But what is 'appropriate'? The word means fit, expedient, apt, suitable and belonging in its proper place. Propriety comes into it too - a sense of things being commensurate one with another. What seems to worry so many people about large out-of-scale and often brutal contemporary buildings is that they exhibit bad manners and do not make much effort to settle down appropriately with their neighbours. These thoughts were prompted by the display and publication of an exhibition of proposals for the long overdue improvement of the forecourt of London's Victoria Station. To me the model of these proposals is a demonstration of inappropriateness. The designs are the work of Britain's respected establishment modern architect, Michael Hopkins. Mr Hopkins has designed two office buildings to replace the present huddle of low and indifferent buildings on Victoria Street. The two buildings are the chief ingredients of a scheme that is intended to pay for the reorganisation of the tube station, the new glass canopied bus stand and the pedestrian square in front of the listed station facade. Clearly the cost of all this very necessary sorting out of the interchange is high and that must be the reason for the 22 storey office tower that will 'release the maximum area of land for the transport interchange and public spaces'. About the last thing Victoria needs is another office block. What is seen here is an accountants' exercise on how to pay for transport improvements at a time when there is not enough public funding. It is a technique that worked at Liverpool Street - but at Broadgate it was possible to think on a much bigger scale at a time when the building of offices actually made money. The tower at Victoria will, like all of Mr Hopkins's buildings, have a certain cool elegance although its stepped profile unfailingly reminded me of the Trump Tower on New York's Fifth Avenue. I doubt whether it will have the razzmatazz interior of the Trump Tower. In its present form, Victoria station provides a great sense of anti-climax when you arrive there, especially if you have just been whisked in high-speed comfort from Gatwick airport. It is not the station itself but the bizarre and extraordinary muddle that is presented to the arriving passenger. There are taxis, buses and a complicated tube station that seems to promise dirt and danger rather than an easy and elegant entrance to London. The redevelopment proposals are from a joint venture put together by Greycoat Estates and London Transport. They replace a scheme that was prepared for the same site by the American architects Skidmore Owings and Merrill. Mr Hopkins is a good modern architect. In London, as well as the modernisation of Lords cricket ground, Mr Hopkins was responsible for the conversion of Bracken House, former home of the Financial Times, and the interior design of this newspaper's new editorial offices at Southwark Bridge. He has designed the extension to the Houses of Parliament with the new Westminster underground station that is yet to be built. I am particularly looking forward to the new Opera House Michael Hopkins has designed at Glyndebourne which will open in 1994. For Victoria, I can see the virtue of employing Mr Hopkins - an architect who has done what his clients asked him to do. But the underlying commercial thesis is wrong and has been forced upon London by the dire political and economic climate. Westminster City Council should put these proposals on ice for a while. There can be no call for more offices, which would overshadow Victoria station and do little for the area. Pragmatism has its place in life but London and Londoners deserve a bit more vision at Victoria - not another inappropriate commercial compromise. Members of the public can judge the plans for themselves at the exhibition which is on the station forecourt behind the bus station until October 23rd. Open Monday to Friday, 7.30am to 6.30pm.</p>

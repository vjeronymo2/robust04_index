			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / EU rebuffs US plan to lift ban on Bosnia arms European Union foreign minis-ters have rejected lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslem-led government, calling it an 'absolute last resort'. The stage is thus set for a rift with the US over the war in the former Yugoslav republic. EU ministers, meeting at the weekend on the remote island of Usedom on Germany's Baltic coast, said lifting the embargo would probably lead to a withdrawal or dramatic scaling down of the UN's humanitarian and peace-keeping mission. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, warned of 'incalculable consequences' should US President Bill Clinton press ahead with his plan to start lifting sanctions if the Bosnian Serbs failed to agree to the US-EU peace settlement by October 15. The fragile cessation of hostilities and the risks of a wider winter war in Bosnia were driven home early yesterday morning after Mr Hans Koschnik, the EU administrator in the ethnically divided town of Mostar, narrowly escaped assassination in a rocket-propelled grenade attack. News of the assault shocked EU ministers, who called on President Franjo Tudjman to control renegade Croatian forces. Earlier they backed a strategy of 'total isolation' of the Bosnian Serbs in the hope of forcing a peace settlement in the next few months. At the same time, ministers edged towards approval for rewarding Serbia for its month-long blockade of the Bosnian Serbs, starting with a suspension of sport and cultural sanctions and a re-opening of Belgrade airport to international flights. However, Mr Kinkel emphasised that the reward was depended on President Slobodan Milosevic accepting a 'credible international presence' to monitor the border with the Bosnian Serbs and ensuring that the border was sealed to prevent weapons smuggling. Latest EU intelligence reports suggest that the threat of renewed fighting this winter is real. Officials at the foreign ministers' meeting spoke of deteriorating relations between Croats and Moslems, with the Bosnian Serbs girding themselves to strike against the Moslems if the arms embargo is lifted. British officials made clear at the weekend that the US would bear the brunt of recriminations which were bound to follow a withdrawal of the UN peace-keepers. They held out little hope that the US administration can persuade Congress to drop its support for lifting the embargo. Mr Clinton opposes lifting the embargo unilaterally, but has agreed to launch a diplomatic effort to persuade the UN Security Council to move in that direction on October 15. If the Security Council blocks the move, the US is likely to move towards a unilateral lifting of the embargo a month later. British officials said it was unlikely that either the UK or France would veto a resolution because of a common reluctance to veto a Security Council motion sponsored by the US. Alison Maitland in London adds: Mr John Major, the British prime minister, will today be briefed on the situation in Bosnia by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and Field Marshal Sir Peter Inge, chief of the defence staff. Officials said no decision had been made on whether British troops should be withdrawn. Britain has 3,300 troops in Bosnia.</p>

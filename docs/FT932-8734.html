			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Saudis defend clampdown on group SAUDI ARABIA yesterday sought to justify its clampdown on a self-proclaimed human rights group, arguing that the basic law of government enshrined full freedoms for the kingdom's citizens. Dr Ghazi Algosaibi, the Saudi ambassador in London, said if the group was interested in human rights 'the logical step would have been to refer to the basic law and work within its framework'. The seven members of the group, which described itself as the committee for the defence of legitimate rights, have all been dismissed from their official posts. In a statement issued on May 3, the seven, who described themselves as Islamic scholars, said their objective was 'to contribute in whatever way to the elimination of injustice, to offer support to the oppressed and to defend the rights of man'. They asked Saudis to contact them about any individual grievances. The announcement of the group's formation was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of the Council of Senior Ulema, which oversees religious affairs in the kingdom. The council said that the group was illegitimate and was to be condemned because no one in Saudi Arabia was barred from expressing grievances before the courts. The swift official response underlines the sensitivity of the regime to accusations from radical Islamic groups that it is failing to govern according to the tenets of the Koran.</p>

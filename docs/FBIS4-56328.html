			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nelson de Oliveira] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- Central Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan  confirmed on 28 April that Brazil spent nearly $2.4 billion in  the purchase of securities given as collateral for the debt  rescheduling agreement with foreign private banks on 15 April.  Malan explained that U.S. Treasury bills were purchased as  collateral for Brazil's external debt principal. The average  unit price of the T-bills that will mature in 2021 and 2022 was  $0.153 per dollar. The real cost of the transaction was not  disclosed.    Malan explained to the Senate Economic Affairs Committee  that  the securities were bought on the international secondary market  after the U.S. Treasury's refusal to put out a special issue for  Brazil as long as the country did not sign at least a short-term  agreement with the IMF. As the purchase of such a volume of  securities could have prompted much speculation and caused  Brazil great losses, the BC bought them little by little in  deals that were arranged with the utmost secrecy between  December 1993 and March 1994.    The purchases were made from top-notch institutions that  usually operate with Brazil. It is not known how many banks --  Brazil does not operate with brokers -- participated in these  transactions.    Malan guaranteed that Brazil was not burdened with the  payment of surcharges and commissions. The profit obtained by  the sellers was based only on the difference between the  purchase and selling price of the T-bills. Besides the $2.4  billion as collateral for the principal, Brazil had to disburse  $373 million as collateral for interest. This latter amount was  invested in bonds placed on the market that will yield  semi-annual interest.    The BC president told senators that Brazil will institute a  more efficient management of its foreign exchange reserves. Now  that an agreement with creditor banks has been reached, the  country will not only be able to place reserves at higher  interest rates, but also may repurchase and resell the T-bills  that were issued on 15 April based on market quotations.    With the exception of Senator Eduardo Suplicy (PT-SP)  [Workers Party-Sao Paulo], the committee members at the hearing  were satisfied with the agreement's terms.</p>

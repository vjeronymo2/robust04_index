			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TAXED INTO REVOLT;  </P> <P> CELESTE MERGENS, AN EL CAJON HOUSEWIFE, LEADS THE CHARGE OF A BURGEONING  GRASS-ROOTS ANTI-TAX MOVEMENT  </P> <P> Celeste Mergens, a polite, soft-spoken woman who is still a little  uncomfortable in her new role as tax revolt leader, found inspiration in an  unlikely source.  </P> <P> The Duke on late-night television.  </P> <P> In an old war movie, John Wayne tells a frightened comrade on the eve of battle  that all battles are won by scared men who would rather be someplace else.  </P> <P> "I thought, yeah, that's right. That's just like me," Mergens said. "I was  nervous, but I knew I had to do it."  </P> <P> We the People, an anti-tax citizens group that opposes new federal taxes and  calls for more efficient use of existing tax revenue, was born out of this El  Cajon homemaker's financial frustration; she was fed up with the government  swallowing a bigger and bigger chunk of her husband's paycheck.  </P> <P> "I kept waiting for someone to get elected to do something to stop these  taxes," Mergens said. "But I finally realized it would happen only if people  got involved.  </P> <P> "Our message is either return to ethical government, or we're going to vote  these politicians out of office."  </P> <P> Her new calling has stepped up the tempo in what was an already busy and  crowded home.  </P> <P> The phone rings. Her 6-year-old drips homemade clay on the rug. The 5-year-old  climbs the furniture. The 4-year-old makes enough popcorn for an army. The  2-year-old spits up oversalted popcorn. The baby needs nursing. The dog climbs  on the sofa. The doorbell rings.  </P> <P> At the heart of this perpetual motion is Mergens, a 28-year-old mother of five  who has found time to organize the burgeoning tax-revolt movement of  self-described middle- and lower-class "patriots."  </P> <P> Also known as PATRIOT -- People Against Taxes Revolt in Our Time -- the group  staged its first demonstration July 12 at San Diego Harbor.  </P> <P> The protesters condemned President Bush for recently suggesting a need for more  taxes and criticized Congress for what it called inefficient use of existing  tax money and for relying on special-interest groups for reelection campaign  funds.  </P> <P> "I assumed Bush was on our side," Mergens said. "He should have said: 'Read my  lips. I lied.' And Congress should use what money it has and cut the waste.  They have so many obligations to the special-interest groups that they've  stopped representing the people as a whole."  </P> <P> An area resident since 1980, Mergens has no experience in political activism.  She has rarely participated in community projects. Once, when living in San  Ysidro, she and some friends painted a few rundown, graffiti-covered buildings  that were an eyesore.  </P> <P> She married her husband, Donald, a property manager with a development company,  in 1982 and has been busy rearing their children since then in a two-story  house in the hills above El Cajon.  </P> <P> After writing to her legislators and getting virtually no response, Mergens  decided to become an activist.  </P> <P> "I asked my congressmen to use innovation and courage to find solutions to the  budget deficit," she said. "We just got tired of all the taxes -- 48% of our  income goes to taxes -- and with insurance and all the other costs of raising a  family, we're just getting by."  </P> <P> We the People plans to set up tax-protest demonstrations this summer in major  cities across the nation, encourage voter registration and target for defeat  those politicians who support new taxes and rely heavily on special-interest  contributions.  </P> <P> The group's next protest is scheduled for Thursday at the Embarcadero, near the  County Administration Center, the site of the first demonstration. That was a  symbolic re-enactment of the Boston Tea Party that culminated with Mergens  throwing a handful of tea into the harbor.  </P> <P> Mergens said a wildlife official warned her that dumping tea into the ocean was  a violation of state and federal laws and that she risked being arrested or  fined. But she said the issue was too important to back down.  </P> <P> For the Thursday protest, police will put a few extra officers in the area, but  no problems are expected, said Police Department spokesman Dave Cohen. There  was one arrest at the first demonstration -- a man who refused to relinquish  his sign, which police said was mounted on a stick that was too large. The man  later apologized.  </P> <P> "Every indication is that this group will be law-abiding," Cohen said. "They're  engaged in free speech, and that's what this country is all about. The only  problem might be some traffic congestion."  </P> <P> The group has focused its spotlight on federal and state taxes rather than  local government. San Diego County government spokesman Bob Lerner said county  officials are aware of the group but have not been contacted regarding the  efficiency of county spending.  </P> <P> We the People's sudden popularity is largely attributable to publicity from  radio talk-show host and former Mayor Roger Hedgecock, whose support Mergens  enlisted from the start. Using the airwaves, Mergens is encouraging a growing  number of couch-potato tax haters to join the movement.  </P> <P> The crowd estimate at the first demonstration varied from 1,000 to 3,400, but  there was no doubt about the anger among the diverse group. More than 400  people have volunteered their services -- from printing flyers to making phone  calls -- and the list grows every day, Mergens said.  </P> <P> Some volunteers said Mergens was the reason they attended the protest.  </P> <P> "I just felt it was time to get involved. I thought, by golly, if a mother of  five kids can take the time, then so can I," said Ron Shane, an El Cajon  contractor who dressed as Paul Revere at the July 12 demonstration.  </P> <P> Added Lee King, 73, a retired legal secretary: "I've been unhappy about all  these taxes for a long, long time. My son-in-law loses half his pay to taxes."  </P> <P> U.S. Rep. Jim Bate (D-San Diego) said he was not aware of We the People's  existence, but said he supports any citizens group that speaks its mind. Bates  advised such groups to narrow their goals -- such as targeting a specific  politician for defeat -- to be effective.  </P> <P> "If they're condemning all of Congress, then they will probably be  ineffective," Bates said. "They need to target their message if they're going  to accomplish anything."  </P> <P> Mergens said We the People is nonpartisan and accepts no donations, and she  says she takes no money and has no aspirations for political office.  </P> <P> "Be in at the beginning of a major movement that will certainly swell to  national proportions," declares a flyer put out by Internet Associates, a small  media-consultant firm volunteering its services. " . . . It began with Samuel  Adams in 1773. It continues with Celeste Mergens in 1990."  </P> <P> Mergens laughed.  </P> <P> "Well, maybe that is a little dramatic, but we think this is just as critical a  time," she said. "The Constitution is hanging by a thread. When the people lose  confidence in Congress, then it is now or never."  </P></p>

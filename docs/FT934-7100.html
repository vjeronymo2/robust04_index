			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Finance ministers plan tighter banking supervision European Union finance ministers are close to a deal on proposals to strengthen banking supervisory authorities in the wake of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Ministers from the Twelve will today review a Belgian presidency document which paves the way for tighter supervision of all financial institutions, including banks, credit institutions, and insurance businesses. A central feature of the proposal is the requirement for transparent operations. The idea is to make it easier for the regulatory authorities and auditors to establish the financial soundness of a financial institution and, if necessary, prepare a case for intervention. Other proposals for avoiding a BCCI-style scandal include: A requirement that financial institutions maintain their head offices in the same member state as their registered offices. An extension of the list of bodies with which confidential supervisory and prudential information can be exchanged by the authorities. Guidelines on whether auditors should be allowed to extend the scope of their reporting beyond the affairs of a specific financial institution to a group as a whole. This could allow auditors to track down, say, suspicious intra-company loans or outstanding debts. The Belgian presidency of the EU and the European Commission have been co-operating to iron out last-minute difficulties. A UK diplomat last week predicted there was a good chance of agreement.</p>

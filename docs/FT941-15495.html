			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Absence of exceptionals leaves Cray Elect lower An underlying 10 per cent increase in turnover and improved trading margins helped Cray Electronics Holdings, the data communications and software systems group, double interim operating profits from continuing operations to Pounds 9.6m, against Pounds 4.79m. However, pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 fell to Pounds 7.8m, after Pounds 1.12m in reorganisation costs, compared with Pounds 17.8m, swollen by a Pounds 13m exceptional gain on the sale of Malvern Instruments. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased to 3.1p (2.04p), but fell on an FRS 3 basis to 2.52p (10.33p). The interim dividend is 0.75p (0.5p). The figures were in line with expectations, but the market focused on the headline pre-tax figure and the shares slipped 6 1/2 p to close at 164 1/2 p. Turnover, including a Pounds 5.22m contribution from P-E International acquired for Pounds 16.2m in September and Pounds 396,000 (Pounds 11.7m) from discontinued activities, increased to Pounds 114.3m (Pounds 81.9m). The figure was boosted by higher overseas sales, particularly in the US and Asia Pacific regions, and by a full contribution from the Dowty IT businesses which were acquired in August 1992. P-E contributed Pounds 32,000 to operating profits while the discontinued Shrewsbury Technology operations incurred a Pounds 780,000 loss. Last year discontinued operations showed a Pounds 919,000 profit. Mr Roger Holland, chairman said: 'We have improved revenue, profit and operating margin in our principal businesses. The growth we have experienced outside the UK is particularly pleasing.' The advance in operating profits and the overall trading margins, which increased from 6.8 per cent to 8.8 per cent, was led by Cray Communications which accounted for almost 70 per cent of turnover. The division lifted operating profits to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 3.1m) while margins improved from 7.3 per cent to 10.4 per cent. It was helped by the strong demand for integrated local and wide area networking systems, and the introduction of new products. Cray Systems, which now includes P-E International's computer services operations, reported operating profits of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 900,000) while Cray Technology slipped from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 600,000. COMMENT Cray's management deserves credit for the detail and openness of the interim figures which included an illuminating breakdown of Pounds 4.2m in fair value adjustments following the P-E acquisition which has already helped the systems division achieve critical mass. The core communications division has a strong product portfolio in a dynamic growth sector and is aiming to lift margins to 20 per cent over the next few years. A traditionally stronger second half should lift full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 26m for earnings of about 8.8p. The shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 18.7.</p>

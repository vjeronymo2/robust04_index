			<p>BFN     [Text] On Wednesday the Russia's Choice faction in the  State Duma distributed two statements in which it expresses  concern due to the situation in the former Yugoslavia and the  recent incident in one of the units of the Black Sea Fleet in  Odessa.    In particular, the document on the situation in Bosnia and  the bomb strikes of the Serbian positions in the region of  Gorazde inflicted by NATO aviation, points out that as a  permanent member of the UN Security Council Russia "cannot stand  aside from such responsible decisions and should not associate  itself with forcible actions which it has not sanctioned."    At the same time the faction expressed conviction that there  cannot be any success without Russia's everyday contribution  into the settlement process in the former Yugoslavia. "One  should act resolutely in order to put an end to deaths and  deprivations of innocent civilians, to violence and terror, to  any provocations whoever provokes them," the statement reads.    The Russia's Choice faction also declared that the incident  connected with the seizure of the territory of the Black Sea  Fleet's 318th squadron in Odessa and the arrest of its officers  and employees by the Ukrainian special purpose forces "can  aggravate relations between Ukraine and Russia."    The indefinite status of the Black Sea Fleet "is fertile  ground for further dangerous provocations," says the document.  "We welcome the decision of Russian and Ukrainian presidents to  resume negotiations on the status of the Black Sea Fleet and  call on them to force diplomatic efforts in this important  sphere of bilateral relations," declared the Russia's Choice  faction.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Japan's economy has moved  "one step" toward recovery, but some concern still remains, such  as the yen's rise, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said  Monday [13 June].    "Assessing the recent economic indicators, there seems to be  high chances that the economy has moved one step toward a  recovery," Mieno told the Budget Committee of the House of  Councillors.    The governor said the "one step" was from his latest  assessment that the economy is "showing signs of bottoming out."    Mieno cited brighter signs in personal consumption,  inventory  adjustments and exports, particularly to Southeast Asian  nations, and noted that corporate concern about having a surplus  of facilities and equipment has "hit a ceiling."    His comments came after the central bank released Friday its  quarterly "Tankan" report on business sentiment that showed  improvement in confidence by both major manufacturers and  nonmanufacturers for the first time in five years.    Asked about the effects of the 5.5 trillion yen income tax  cuts, Mieno said he expects the cuts to "support the economy  that is showing slight brightness."    But Mieno said he remains uncertern if the economy has moved  "two or three steps forward," noting such prevailing concerns as  the yen's rise, sluggish corporate capital investment and  competition from other Asian nations.    As for capital investment, however, he said the environment  for a recovery is improving, and stressed that declines in  interest rates since the central bank cut its official discount  rate to an all-time low of 1.75 percent last year are still  supporting corporate restructuring efforts.    The central bank intends to continue carefully watching to  see whether the recent bright spots spread to the economy as a  whole, Mieno said.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MURDER TRIAL FIGURE CONVICTED IN NEW CASE  </P> <P> A jury Tuesday found Meecee Parks, formerly known as Sagon Penn, guilty of  filing false documents in court and of battery in an incident involving his  ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.  </P> <P> In trials in 1986 and 1987, Parks, 28, was acquitted of murder, manslaughter  and assault in the death of one San Diego Police officer and the wounding of  another officer and a civilian who was in a police car.  </P> <P> He recently changed his name from Sagon Penn to Meecee Parks.  </P> <P> The San Diego Superior Court jury deliberated about 5 1/2 hours before finding  Parks guilty Tuesday of all charges.  </P> <P> He was charged with two counts of filing a false document in Superior Court and  altering a temporary restraining order against his former girlfriend after it  had already been signed by a judge.  </P> <P> Judge Herbert Exarhos set sentencing for Jan. 10 and allowed Parks to remain  free on $15,000 bail.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Anear unsuccessfully asked the judge to remand Parks  to custody, saying he posed a danger because of his continued harassment of the  former girlfriend, Donna Parks.  </P> <P> Meecee Parks faces a maximum sentence of four years and 10 months in state  prison plus a $10,000 fine. The charges involving the filing of false documents  and altering court records are felonies, but the battery charge is a  misdemeanor.  </P> <P> Parks acted as his own attorney Aug. 17 when he met with Judge Wesley Mason and  won an order prohibiting Donna Parks from contacting him.  </P> <P> However, the judge later said he saw that the temporary restraining order had  been altered to include a ban on Donna Parks' contacting her new boyfriend,  Maurice Bell. Bell was not named as a party in the case, and Mason testified  that he would not have signed such a document.  </P> <P> The prosecution's case took up only one day, and Meecee Parks did not testify  in his defense.  </P> <P> Parks' two trials in San Diego were highly publicized events because Parks, who  is black, claimed he shot the white officers because one of them subjected him  to racial slurs and a beating after a traffic stop in Encanto on Mar. 31, 1985.  </P></p>

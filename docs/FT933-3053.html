			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Rise in inflation hits markets: FT-SE 100 falls 38.6 points  -Government strategy under pressure A LARGER than expected increase in inflation increased the pressure yesterday on the government's economic strategy and sparked big falls in London bond and share prices. The FT-SE 100 index of leading equities suffered its biggest setback for seven months and the gilt-edged securities market had its worst day since the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago today. News that the retail prices index rose in the year to August by 1.7 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in the 12 months to July, came the day after government ministers imposed a near-freeze on public-sector pay next year on the grounds that inflationary pressures were weak. It provoked an angry response from the Labour party and union leaders representing some of the 5m workers affected. The change between July and August in the year-on-year RPI rate was the highest monthly increase since November 1991. It was triggered by a broadly based rise in prices of retail goods and services, particularly affecting clothes, shoes and household goods. The Treasury's favoured measure of underlying inflation - the year-on-year increase in the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - edged up to 3.1 per cent in August from 2.9 per cent in July to its highest level since March. The figures affected perceptions among UK investors about the outlook for inflation, the weakness of which has helped prolong the recent London share and bond rally. With long-dated gilts closing down 2 points, investors also sold London equities, pushing the FT-SE 100 down 38.6 to 2,989.4, its biggest one-day fall for seven months. Investor nervousness about the UK economic outlook was heightened by separate Central Statistical Office figures indicating barely visible growth in retail sales volumes in August, and by weaknesses in share and bond prices across the rest of Europe prompted by worries about the effects of high interest rates and poor corporate earnings. Sterling lost ground against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.4725, down more than 1 pfennig, with little change in New York. Against a weak dollar, the pound strengthened by half a cent to Dollars 1.5515, easing in New York to Dollars 1.549. The news increased speculation that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, may have difficulties keeping the underlying measure of inflation within the bottom half of the Treasury's 1-4 per cent target range within the life of this parliament. However, the Treasury stressed that inflation remained low by postwar standards and the figures met with a calm response from Mr John Major. Speaking in the Midlands, the prime minister said: 'People want steady growth with low inflation. That's what we're planning for in the long-term.' Mr Gordon Brown, the Labour shadow chancellor, ridiculed government claims that it had created an 'inflation-free' environment and said price pressures would increase in the next few months. Mr Bill Morris, Transport and General Workers' Union general secretary, said government ministers were 'living in an economic fantasy world'.

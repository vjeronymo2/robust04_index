App. 1301  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), the FAA's regulations (14 CFR parts 1&hyph;199), and certain other statutes and orders. (49 U.S.C. App. 1471(a)(3)). In the case of persons other than those acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman, the procedures for civil penalty assessment actions are those contained in &sect;13.16 and part 13, subpart G of the FAA's regulations. The current civil penalty assessment process for these actions is outlined below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the investigation phase, FAA investigative personnel ordinarily notify alleged violators of an agency investigation by issuing a letter of investigation. This notification is described in FAA Order 2150.3A, the FAA's Compliance and Enforcement Program, but is not required by statute, regulation, or that order. Following an investigation, a civil penalty may be assessed only after notice of the proposed charges and an opportunity for a hearing. This process is begun by issuing a notice of proposed civil penalty to an alleged violator (respondent). Section 13.16(c) delegates the authority to the FAA's Deputy Chief Counsel and certain Assistant Chief Counsel in the regions, centers, and headquarters to issue such notices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents have several options to respond to the notice of proposed civil penalty. The person charged with a violation is required to do one of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-upon lower amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Submit written information demonstrating that the violation did not occur, or that a penalty or the penalty amount is not warranted under the circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Submit a request for a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including the amount of reduction along with supporting reasons and documentation, such as records indicating a financial inability to pay the proposed penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Submit a written request for an informal conference to discuss the matter with an agency attorney and submit relevant information or documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Request a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Hearings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a respondent does not respond to the notice of proposed civil penalty, or chooses to proceed informally in response to a notice of proposed civil penalty, and the matter is not resolved, the FAA attorney then serves a final notice of proposed civil penalty. The respondent must either request a hearing before an ALJ or pay the amount of the proposed civil penalty, or an agreed-upon amount, within 15 days of receipt of the final notice. If neither a penalty is paid nor a hearing is requested during the 15-day period, the FAA attorney serves an order assessing civil penalty, which contains a finding of violation and assesses a civil penalty. That order is final and not appealable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 7, 1993, the Vice President's National Performance Review published a report entitled ``From Red Tape to Results: Creating a Government that Works Better and Costs Less.'' That report included a recommendation that the FAA streamline its civil penalty enforcement program by eliminating several of the procedural steps it takes to issue civil penalties in certain minor, uncontested cases. The FAA has determined that streamlined procedures would be most appropriately applied to those legal enforcement actions that facially appear to be simple and factually straightforward. The SFAR adopts interim changes to the existing rules governing procedures and delegation of authority that are designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the processing of civil penalty assessment actions in these types of cases. The National Performance Review indicates that a streamlined enforcement process may reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance safety by notifying individuals of certain violations and processing these actions within reduced time frames.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

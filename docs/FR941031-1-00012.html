			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Section 618.8030_Out-of-territory Related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;618.8030 would allow a System bank or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association to offer a related service outside of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chartered lending territory. It would replace guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in FCA Bookletter 366&hyph;OE, which implemented the FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board policy statement concerning the offering of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out-of-territory related services (58 FR 36410, July 2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993). Presently, an institution is required to obtain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurrence of all System banks or associations serving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> territory before it can offer its related services. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other chief conditions are: (1) A common program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement within a district (associated with existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related service regulations); and (2) a requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the service provided within the institution's territory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain as the primary component of its services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation eliminates the common program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feature in &sect;618.8000(b)(3) because the FCA recognizes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this feature reflects an out-of-date system structure. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the PPC work group and FRS petition both requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the FCA drop the common program requirement in favor of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement that related services provided within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution's own territory remain the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary service component is not part of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. The FCA concludes that as long as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is able to adequately serve the needs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible borrowers in its chartered territory, there should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be a limit on how much business it conducts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out of its territory. The FCA agrees with a comment made by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the PPC work group that services can have a positive effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on an institution's credit program by providing diversity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and an additional income stream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed regulation, the requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consent before offering related services out-of-territory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be modified. In proposed &sect;618.8030(a), an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would be required to obtain the concurrence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least one institution chartered to service that outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> territory. The FCA believes it is important to preserve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights of all System institutions within their chartered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> territories. The fact that some territories overlap is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irrelevant to the right of an institution to determine what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services it wishes to provide in its own territory. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FCA believes that if a bank or association wishes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make a related service available to its customers, it can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrange with any other System institution to provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service in its chartered territory without any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's consent. This outcome is no different from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current situation in which an institution can offer a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service itself or it can contract with a non-System entity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to offer the service; in either case, the institution is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to obtain the consent of any other institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation also requires that for services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided out of its territory, the providing institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must meet all of the requirements of subparts A and B of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 618, including adopting a related services policy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining feasibility. It should be noted that if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing institution is expanding an existing program, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new feasibility analysis and bank verification would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed. An institution that gives consent to another bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or association to provide a related service in its chartered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> territory need must meet the requirements of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;618.8030, but need not comply with the other requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of subparts A and B, unless the program consented to imposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the consenting institution a financial obligation, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which case the consenting institution must comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;618.8015, 618.8020, and 618.8025.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another aspect to the out-of-territory issue is whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution that initially concurs in another institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing related service programs in its territory can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later withdraw its approval. One example could be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation in which an institution has approved a service in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its territory because that service is not currently offered,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but later that institution wishes to begin exclusively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering the same service. The FCA believes that by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entering into a written agreement with specific terms,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, and timeframes, the consenting institution can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best protect its interests. One example could be that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions enter into a formal contractual arrangement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provides for termination by either party with proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Subpart B_Member Insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 618.8040_Authorized Insurance Services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Debtor/Creditor Relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PPC work group and the Insurance petition raised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questions concerning the authority in section 4.29 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act for banks (excluding banks for cooperatives) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations to provide to members and borrowers credit or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term life and credit disability insurance appropriate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect the loan commitment. When it enacted section 4.29  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act, Congress stated that for System institutions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``sell credit or term life, there must be a debtor-creditor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship and the amount of insurance should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to protect but not exceed the total loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitment to the member-borrower.'' <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations require that a debtor-creditor relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist for the sale of credit or term life and credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability insurance. Although the Insurance petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested that this requirement be removed from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, the FCA concludes that this is a statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, not only a regulatory requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> H.R. Rep. No. 1287, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess., 43 (1980). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Questions have also arisen as to whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debtor-creditor relationship must exist with the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering credit or term life or credit disability insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, in situations in which related services may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offered out-of-territory, a borrower may have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debtor-creditor relationship with the bank or association in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the territory, but an out-of-territory association may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering the insurance. The FCA interprets section 4.29 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act and its legislative history to mean that there must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a borrowing relationship with a System institution, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not necessarily with the institution offering the service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as long as the recipient of credit or term life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or credit disability insurance has a debtor-creditor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship with a bank or association of the System, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance can be offered by any institution authorized to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide insurance to that recipient. Accordingly, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;618.8040(b)(1), the FCA would add a statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the debtor-creditor relationship does not necessarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to be with the offering institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

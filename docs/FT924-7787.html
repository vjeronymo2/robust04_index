			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Kmart founder dies aged 85 Mr Harry Blair Cunningham, former chairman of Kmart, the large US retail group, and one of the best-known figures in US retailing since the war, has died, Nikki Tait reports from New York. Mr Cunningham was 85. Mr Cunningham is widely credited with first introducing discount retailing to American shoppers on a big scale and effectively creating today's Kmart store chain in the process. He became manager of a Kresge store, one of the hundred of outlets built up by Mr Sebastian Kresge after the first world war. By 1959 he had risen to become president of the SS Kresge group. It was three years later, in 1962, that the Kresge company opened its first Kmart discount store in a Detroit suburb, a retail formula which proved immensely successful. In an expansion blitz, it exploded to 1,200 outlets by the mid-1970s. Recognising that discount stores had become the mainstay of the group, shareholders approved a change in the company's name to Kmart in 1977.</p>

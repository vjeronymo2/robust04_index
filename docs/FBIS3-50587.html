			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 3  January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item.    Rodolfo Uribe, director of the National Administrative  Department of Statistic (DANE) has disclosed that inflation in  Colombia during 1993 had reached 22.6 percent, 2.5 points less  that in 1992. He indicated that despite the government's  inability to reach its 22 percent inflation goal, it came pretty  close, evidence that "it is winning the battle against  inflation." Uribe recalled that in 1993 accumulated inflation  in Colombia reached 25.13 percent. In December 1993, cost of  living increased most in Cali at 1.67 percent, followed closely  by Medellin with 1.46 percent. Santa Fe de Bogota recorded  inflation of 1.03 percent in December. Colombian cities with  the lowest increase in cost of living were Cucuta with 0.85  percent and Pasto with 0.15 percent. President Cesar Gaviria's  administration has set 19 percent as the 1994 inflation goal.  (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1752 GMT 2 Jan 94)    Figures made public today by DANE reveal that unemployment  fell during 1993 from 9.6 percent to 7.9 percent. According to  DANE figures, unemployment levels in the four leading  metropolitan areas of Santa Fe de Bogota, Cali, Medellin, and  Barranquilla were less than 7.6 percent. The report also  reveals that the private sector created at least 75,000 jobs in  the past year. Unemployment in the four leading metropolitan  areas during December totalled approximately 354,000, of an  economically active labor market of 4.7 million Colombians.  (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2041 GMT 28 Dec 93)    Gasoline prices were adjusted by 19 percent throughout  Colombia on 27 December. The price of regular gasoline  increased from 578 to 688 pesos, and premium gasoline prices  increased from 718 to 854 pesos. Cocinol, fuel distributed  mainly in Santa Fe de Bogota's lower income communities, rose  from 85 to 100 pesos, or 17.65 percent. It is the first time in  six years that the government has increased gasoline prices  based on the 1994 inflation goal of 19 percent. Previously,  price adjustments were implemented with the intention of  covering fluctuations in the cost of living index during the  current year.

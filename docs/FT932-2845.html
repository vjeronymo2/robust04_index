			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Company says unresolved strike sealed plant's fate TIMEX'S failure to end the conflict with its sacked workforce in Dundee clinched its decision to close the electronics plant, the company indicated yesterday. The underlying reason for the closure was its weak financial state and continuous losses over the past five years which came to Pounds 10m. The US company denied that its long-term aim had always been to close the plant. Its intention had been to upgrade its capabilities and reduce operating costs, to make it a 'world class manufacturer'. The company explained: 'The backdrop of conflict places too much strain on the organisation. We fully expected a picket on the factory gate for a long time. But we never thought there would be mass picketing with violence.' It said it had never been the intention of the company to re-hire selectively from among the sacked workforce after the legal prohibition on doing so expired 90 days after they were sacked on February 17. The company made an offer on June 3, repeated on Monday, in the hope of ending the conflict. It offered to re-employ those sacked workers who were judged by consultants to have the 'skills and commitment'. The company accepted that many sacked workers would not want to return and work alongside the 'scab' replacement workforce. The offer was not accepted by the sacked workforce which demanded the reinstatement of all 343 dismissed staff. The company said it had been left 'financially exhausted' after the strike in January. But it had a full order book, had lost no customers because of the dispute and was in a state of 'fragile recovery'. It had announced Pounds 5m of new orders in early June and had wanted to increase its 260-strong labour force by 200. Mr Peter Hall, who resigned as president of Timex Electronics on Sunday, yesterday refused to explain his departure from the company.</p>

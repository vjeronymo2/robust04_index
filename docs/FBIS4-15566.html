			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] New Delhi April 11 TASS -- Russia plans to begin  before the end of this year the building of a maintenance centre  in India to service Soviet and Russian-made airplanes of the MiG  series that are being used by the Indian armed forces.    The Indian EXPRESS newspaper reported, citing sources in the  Indian Defence Ministry, that the centre will be built jointly  by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the Moscow  Aircraft-Producing Association (MAPO) as a pilot project in the  country, which will provide services to other countries whose  armed forces use the MiG planes, from the MiG-21 to the MiG-29,  primarily in Southeast Asia.    Commenting on this report at a request from ITAR-TASS, an  informed Russian source in New Delhi, speaking on condition of  anonymity, confirmed that an agreement on the building of a  maintenance centre has been signed between HAL and MAPO. The  realisation of this agreement will be a subject of negotiations  between a high-ranking delegation from the Ministry of the  Aircraft Industry of the Russian Federation, which is due to  arrive in India in the middle of April, and Indian authorities.    According to the same source, Indian press reports about the  interests shown in the construction of the enterprise by the  airforces of Malaysia, Vietnam and some Arab countries are  premature. According to the source, they are rather interested  in developing their own potential in this direction.    Nonetheless, undoubtedly, the idea of creating a maintenance  centre marks not only a new step in the development of  military-technical cooperation between Moscow and New Delhi, but  will reduce the acute shortage of spare parts which the Indian  airforce needs badly. The press blames the shortage on Russia  which is not quite fair, according to Sergey Anishchenko, the  local representative of the Russian state company  Rosvooruzheniye (Russian Armaments).    "Despite numerous claims, it is not understandable why the  Indian side delays the consideration and signing of contractual  documents with Russia," Anishchenko said in an interview with  ITAR-TASS. "In some cases the procrastination lasted up to one  year. Sometimes when signing contracts our partners  unilaterally annul up to 30-40 per cent of their own official  bids".    Along with this Sergey Anishchenko expressed the hope that  Rosvooruzheniye remains a highly qualified partner capable of  solving adequately and promptly all problems in the interests of  strengthening the Indian armed forces.</p>

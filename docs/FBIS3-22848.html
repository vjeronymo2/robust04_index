Acquired as an important tool for  training Brazilian technicians, the simulator reproduces all the  operations and emergency situations in the control unit of a  nuclear plant. To finance its upkeep and pay its operators, the  simulator is being used by foreign plants and enterprises  interested in training their personnel. During the past few  years, professionals from various countries have come to Angra-2  for training courses using the plant's equipment and local  personnel at a cost of $30,000 per week per person.

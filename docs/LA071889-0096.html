			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VONS ROLLS OUT ALTERNATIVE TO FAST FOOD FOR BUSY SHOPPERS  </P> <P> Vons Cos., which rolls out new store concepts at a dizzying pace, has  introduced a Deli Express where customers can buy breakfast, lunch or dinner to  take out or eat at a counter in the store.  </P> <P> With the format, unveiled last week as a "walk-around island" in the company's  supermarket near the traffic circle in Long Beach, Vons hopes to go after the  business of McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Winchell's Donut House, El  Pollo Loco, Wendy's, 7-Eleven and other places geared to on-the-go customers.  </P> <P> In addition to such standard fare as hamburgers, sandwiches, nachos and pizza  slices, the in-store shop is selling bagels, breakfast rolls, fresh fruit  trays, salads, baked potatoes, kung pao chicken and chicken pot pies.  </P> <P> The new format grew out of the Express convenience store-within-a-store that  Vons started last summer and now has in two stores. The idea was to combine in  one spot several services normally found scattered throughout many upscale  supermarkets.  </P> <P> "We want (Deli Express) to be a destination," said Phil Hawkins, vice president  of merchandising, who came up with both ideas.  </P> <P> Early results are encouraging, a Vons spokeswoman said. Over the weekend, Deli  Express couldn't keep some fast-selling items in stock. MARTHA GROVES  </P></p>

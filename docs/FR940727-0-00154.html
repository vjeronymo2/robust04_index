			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) For purposes of this part, technical assistance costs associated with developing the capacity to undertake a specific funded program activity are not considered administrative costs. Therefore, these costs are not included in the twenty percent limitation on planning and administration stated in part 570, subpart C of this title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Technical assistance costs cannot exceed ten percent of the total grant award. As used in this part, ``technical assistance'' means the transfer of skills and knowledge in planning, developing, and administering the CDBG program to eligible Indian CDBG recipients who need them in order to undertake a specific funded program activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Single Purpose Grant Application and Selection Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;953.300  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Application requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application information <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

Notwithstanding any provision in Part 570 of this title, HUD will not reimburse or recognize any costs incurred before submission of the single purpose grant application to HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) HUD will not normally reimburse or recognize costs incurred before HUD approval of the application for funding. However, under unusual circumstances, the field office may consider and approve written requests to recognize and reimburse costs incurred after submission of the application where failure to do so would impose undue hardship on the applicant. Such authorization will be made only before the costs are incurred and where the requirements for reimbursement have been met in accordance with 24 CFR 58.22 and with the understanding that HUD has no obligation whatsoever to approve the application or to reimburse the applicant should the application be disapproved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;953.301  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Screening and review of applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each Field Office will screen and review applications for single purpose grants in accordance with the requirements specified in the annual NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;953.302  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Selection process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Threshold requirements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

The applicant possesses, or will acquire, the managerial, technical, or administrative staff necessary to carry out the proposed projects.

Performance determinations are made through the field office's normal monitoring process. Applicants that have been advised in writing of negative findings on previous grants, for which a schedule of corrective actions has been established, will not be considered for funding if they are behind schedule as of the deadline date for filing applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Housing assistance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

An applicant that has an outstanding ICDBG obligation to HUD that is in arrears, or one that has not agreed to a repayment schedule, will be disqualified from the current and subsequent competitions until the obligations are current. An applicant whose response to an audit finding is overdue or unsatisfactory will be disqualified from the current and subsequent competitions until the applicant has taken final action necessary to close the audit finding(s). The field office administrator may provide exceptions to this disqualification requirement in cases where the applicant has made a good faith effort to clear non-monetary audit findings. In no instance, however, shall an exception be provided when funds are due HUD, unless a satisfactory arrangement for repayment of the debt has been made, and payments are current.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

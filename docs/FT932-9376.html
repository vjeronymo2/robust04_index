			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / India asks IMF for three-year support INDIA, which is in the middle of wide-ranging economic reforms, plans to ask the International Monetary Fund to support its programme for a further three years. India has been borrowing from the Fund to help finance its external account under a two-year stand-by arrangement which expires this month. Indian officials plan to negotiate a three-year loan under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility - a medium-term programme designed to finance structural change. Indian officials secured broad agreement from the IMF for the three-year scheme earlier this month, during the annual spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, where Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, met Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director. However, detailed negotiations over the terms of the new loan will not begin until July or August this year. India has so far fulfilled most of the conditions imposed by the IMF on loans taken since the start of economic reform in mid-1991. These included cuts in government borrowing, financial deregulation and reductions in import barriers. However, the IMF's economists believe more needs to be done  -such as further reductions in government borrowing, changes in labour law and banking reform. Reform-minded Indian officials accept that much more must be done fully to liberalise the Indian economy. But there is strong political opposition to some proposed reforms - such as curbing subsidised bank loans to state industries and to farmers, and increasing em-ployers' rights to sack workers. Before the visit to Washington, Indian officials hinted that they may delay negotiating the new three-year programme because the country's foreign reserves are about USDollars 1bn higher than expected at just under Dollars 7bn.</p>

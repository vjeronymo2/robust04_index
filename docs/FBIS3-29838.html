			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- The government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [23 February] indicated  it could accept a proposal to agree to nonbinding targets for  measuring progress in opening Japan's markets to imports. A  government source said the proposal aired Tuesday by ruling  coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, "is one idea."    "What is important is not to make (the targets) binding,"  said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.    Ozawa, the de facto head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party),  the key force in Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, said Tuesday  he believed Japan could accept "endeavor targets" to assess its  compliance with trade agreements. Ozawa made the comment in a  meeting with foreign journalists, according to the associated  press.    The AP [ASSOCIATED PRESS] report quoted Ozawa as saying  Japan  only should agree to such targets only if the United States  agreed not to penalize Japan for failing to meet them. "If we  weren't able to meet the goals and the U.S. side quickly turned  to trade sanctions, that wouldn't be right," he was quoted as  saying.    Earlier this month, Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton  met in Washington but failed to strike a deal on ways to slash  Japan's trade surpluses with the United States. At that time,  Japan rejected a U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure  the openness of its markets to imports.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luc Dettier: "East Asia: Seduction </F> French-Style"]    [Text] France's profile in Asia is too low! At a time of  unprecedented growth in this region, the French presence there  remains too marginal, despite the media attention given to some  industrial contracts, such as Airbus or Alcatel-Alsthom, and the  activities of some small and medium-sized enterprises, such as  Gemplus, Sopha Medical, or Cisigraph.    In a bid to promote French industries in the region, the  Ministry of Industry, Post and Telecommunications, and Foreign  Trade has just launched a massive project called "French  Initiative For Asia", just a few days after the restoration of  the traditional French cooperative links between France and  China. The aim is to raise Asia's share of French exports from  the present 7 percent to 10 percent over the next five years.  This wide-ranging venture, pivoting around 10 actions, targets  the region as a whole, from Pakistan to New Zealand, and  particularly the rapidly developing Far East: China, Hong Kong,  Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the ASEAN [Association of South-East  Asian Nations] countries: (Indonesia, Malaysia, the  Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei).    All the experts agree on one point, their consensus  supported  by a recent World Bank report on the Chinese economic area: The  21st century will be the "Asian century." This report's  conclusions, founded on very cautious hypotheses, are that by  the year 2000 the China-Taiwan-Hong Kong triangle could account  for 6.5 percent of global trade (including internal trade). By  2030, this zone will account for 12 percent of global GDP, or  around the same as the then figure for the United States or  Japan.    Economic expansion, which has abandoned Europe, has already  moved to the Far East. Between 1986 and 1990, Korea, Thailand,  Taiwan, and China had real annual average growth rates of 10.2,  9.9, 8.8 and 8.1 percent respectively. Unfortunately, France's  market share ranged, depending on the country, between 1 and 4  percent of imports (apart from Vietnam, where the figure is 6  percent). The average figure for the region is 2 percent, or  one-third of France's overall global market share and,  crucially, well below the figure for France's major partners.  It should be borne in mind that Germany's performance in  south-east Asia is twice as good.    France's performance over investments is even more modest:  Its share of foreign investment is 0.7 percent for the  Philippines, and 2.5 percent for Singapore.    There are, however, a few signs of improvement. In 1992,  French exports to the Pacific Rim rose to 86 billion French  francs, or 7 percent of our total exports, doubling the 1980  figure. Furthermore, besides the significant reduction in our  trade deficit with newly industrialized countries, the value of  French exports to Asia rose by 14.5 percent in 1993, compared  with a 5-percent reduction in exports to the rest of the world.  There were particularly noticeable increases in Malaysia (plus  63 percent), China (plus 23 percent), Hong Kong (plus 34  percent), India (plus 21 percent), and Singapore (plus 33  percent).    The French authorities have for some years been actively  encouraging companies' activities in this promising region. For  instance, it receives around 40 percent of total development  aid, and a quarter of the total funding provided by COFACE  [French Company for Guaranteeing Foreign Trade]. Besides joint  financing by several supporting bodies whose job is to find  local partners for joint ventures (OCIFA [expansion unknown] in  Indonesia and Taiwan, APRODI [expansion unknown] in South Korea,  Malaysia, and Thailand), there has been significant  strengthening of local teams. The transfer of DREE's [Management  of External Economic Relations] resources to the Ministry of  Industry, Posts and Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade, has  enabled the number of organizations geared toward economic  expansion in the Pacific Rim to rise to 32.    However, political leaders consider it is now time to fight  back against our traditional competitors -- hence the launch of  the "French Initiative for Asia" program. One of the program's  strongest thrusts is the organization in 1994 of two entirely  French events in East Asia. These are intended as a  high-technology shop windows, with an emphasis on industrial  goods. The first takes place in Taiwan at the start of July,  with the second in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) in November. These  are free-standing events, rather than being based on a local  trade fair or exhibition. The project's second phase, starting  in 1995, will also feature three French exhibitions of consumer  goods. To support these ventures, a major public-relations  campaign will be launched in 1994/95, featuring the distribution  throughout the region of a brochure entitled "High Tech, High  Touch: France," available in both English and Chinese, in 1994.  This brochure, already issued in Japanese and Korean, has been  completely updated.    Structural measures designed to produce effects in the  medium term have also been taken. These include both strong  budgetary mobilization of the bodies which promote foreign trade  (CFCE [French Foreign Trade Center]; CFME [French Committee for  Economic Events Overseas]; ACTIM [Technical, Industrial and  Economic Cooperation Agency]) and of the procedures which  provide existing trade with financial support, and the  development of a policy for Asia in the energy and  telecommunications fields.    The Industry Ministry also plans to fund the creation of a  business center in Singapore to host French small and  medium-sized enterprises and industries. This project, under  which support for economic development will be sought from  partners operating internationally (regions, professional  organizations, international chamber of commerce) is currently  the subject of a feasibility study. A decision should be made  by 30 June.  <H5>  The Ten Actions Under the French Initiative for Asia </H5>   1. Measures taken by CFCE over the rapidly developing Asian  market to be tripled within three years.    2. A quarter of CFME's credit to be oriented towards Asia.    3. 30 percent of ACTIM's credit to be oriented towards Asia.    4. Priority for financial procedures for supporting trade in  east Asia. In particular, the Codex procedure to be 50 percent  dedicated to this region from this year.    5. Expansion of major French events in Asia.    6. Intensification of public relations campaigns in Asia to  promote French industry and technology's image.    7. Project to launch a French business center for French  small and medium-sized enterprises in Singapore.    8. Project for framework agreements for joint investments in  Asia.    9. Launch of an Asia telecommunications program.    10. Intensification of French presence in the energy sector  in Asia.    EDF [French Electricity] and GDF [French Gas] will propose  an  active international strategy in the countries concerned by 30  April.</p>

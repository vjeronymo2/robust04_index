			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Matif plans to start long bond futures contract THE Marche a Terme International de France (Matif) yesterday announced plans to launch a futures contract based on long-dated French government bonds, maturing in 15 to 30 years. The new contract, due for launch on January 28, is designed to complement the exchange's 10-year bond future, which trades an average 120,000 contracts a day. Turnover at the longer end of the market has grown dramatically as a result of the French government's policy of extending its debt profile. 'About 35 per cent of supply from the French Treasury this year has consisted of 30-year bonds,' said one trader, 'but most of the dealing is between professional players'. Four tap stocks (OATs) due 2008, 2012, 2019 and 2023, will be deliverable under the contract. Outstandings in these lines total FF160bn. Dealers said the French government bond market, widely believed to be the most liquid in Europe as a result of the government's far-sighted structural reforms in the 1980s, is deep enough to support two futures contracts. However, they expect liquidity to be concentrated in the 10-year notional bond future. On its first day's trading, the new Euroswiss option on Liffe traded 425 contracts. OTOB, the Austrian futures and options exchange, plans to launch an interest rate futures contract in the second quarter of next year based on the Austrian government's benchmark 10-year govern-ment bond.</p>

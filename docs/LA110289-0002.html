			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 13 HELD IN HUGE MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE;  </P> <P> DRUGS: MEXICAN AUTHORITIES DESCRIBE THE ARRESTS AS A MAJOR BLOW TO COLOMBIA'S  MEDELLIN ORGANIZATION.  </P> <P> A Colombian who allegedly led a ring that laundered as much as $70 million in  drug proceeds and shipped a ton of cocaine to Southern California each month is  in U.S. custody, while 12 people identified as accomplices are being held in  Tijuana, Mexican authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Luis Fernando Mejia Pelaez, 50, was arrested at a San Diego area motel last  Thursday and is charged with 174 counts of making false statements and failure  to file currency transaction reports, Assistant U.S. Atty. L. J. O'Neale said  Wednesday. Mejia has been a fugitive since 1986, when he was indicted by a  federal grand jury in San Diego, along with eight other people, on money  laundering charges, O'Neale added.  </P> <P> According to Mexican Federal Judicial Police, Mejia headed an organization that  laundered $60 million to $70 million a month. The ring allegedly used three  Tijuana auto dealerships and two currency exchange houses in Mexico to launder  money for Colombian drug lords. Mexican officials said the ring also used banks  in Miami, Tampa, Fla., New York and Panama to launder drug proceeds.  </P> <P> The Mexican authorities described the arrests, which they said resulted from a  joint investigation by U.S. and Mexican police, as a major blow to the Medellin  drug cartel. Although the Mexicans alleged that the ring was shipping cocaine  to San Diego and Los Angeles, the U.S. indictment against Mejia does not  include drug charges.  </P> <P> The 12 people arrested in Tijuana include three women and three Colombian men.  In making the arrests, Mexican authorities also seized 42 cars from the auto  lots and an undetermined amount of cash.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Mexican federal judicial police issued a written statement that  police are continuing the investigation and expect to make more arrests.  </P> <P> O'Neale said that Mejia, who was a fugitive for three years, had $50,000 in  cash when he was arrested by U.S. Customs agents. He is being held in San Diego  without bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center and has a court appearance  scheduled for today.  </P> <P> "The government requested that he be held without bail because he is a flight  risk. He is in control of extensive assets outside of the United States,"  O'Neale said.  </P> <P> When arrested, Mejia was carrying a Mexican driver's license with a Tijuana  address and a Colombian passport, O'Neale said. In addition, Mejia had U.S.  tourist and business visas that were issued to him in Bogota, Colombia.  </P> <P> "The application and issuance of the visas to Mr. Mejia are being investigated  by the State Department," O'Neale said.  </P> <P> He added that Guillermina Watson was named in the same indictment with Mejia  and was convicted in 1987 on 206 counts of currency violations. Watson, who was  an officer at the now-closed Bank of America branch in Coronado, was sentenced  to five years in federal prison and is the only person named in the indictment  who has gone to trial. Watson was engaged in illegal activities without the  bank's knowledge, O'Neale said.  </P> <P> The U.S. indictment alleged that Watson and Mejia were involved in a scheme to  launder $36 million that Watson testified came from a Colombian family which  inherited a gold mine. Watson, 57, was convicted of using a San Ysidro currency  exchange and area banks to launder the money in 1985 and 1986.  </P> <P> When sentencing Watson, U.S. District Judge John Rhoades noted that the charges  against Watson did not allege that the laundered money came from drug profits.  Rhoades said there was "a strong aroma but no proof" that the money came from  drug sales.  </P></p>

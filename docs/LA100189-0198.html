			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOM, ABE -- BOTH BEAT HARDSHIPS  </P> <P> At first glance it is hard to understand how Mayor Tom Bradley and Abraham  Spiegel became such close friends because the two men appear to have little in  common.  </P> <P> Bradley's personality is reserved and he has a reputation as a penny pincher.  Spiegel greets friends effusively and has been known to hand out $5 bills to  every parking attendant in sight at the City Hall garage. Spiegel can be  brutally outspoken as well.  </P> <P> Bradley's politics are liberal. Like the mayor, Spiegel is a registered  Democrat, but he holds more conservative views -- once pledging, for example, a  significant sum toward the Ronald Reagan presidential library.  </P> <P> Bradley, 71, is the son of Texas sharecroppers. Spiegel's Old World origins are  evident in his accented English. Born in 1906 -- 11 years before the mayor --  Spiegel spent his early years in a village in Czechoslovakia where his family  owned a lumber mill.  </P> <P> On closer inspection, however, the two are not so different after all.  </P> <P> "The mayor, like Abe, is somebody who's overcome tremendous hardships, a . . .  minority who became successful," said a source close to both Spiegel and  Bradley.  </P> <P> When Bradley was in high school, he disregarded the advice given to many blacks  not to try for college. He was a track star at UCLA, and then went on to a  career as a police officer, studying law at night and eventually establishing a  private practice. In 1963, he became the city's first black council member; 10  years later, he became its first black mayor.  </P> <P> Spiegel, a Hebrew scholar, survived the Nazi Holocaust. He tells stories of  being kept alive by a friend in an Auschwitz kitchen who slipped him raw  potatoes. Spiegel's wife also lived through the horrors. But their 2-year-old  son, Uziel, died in the gas chamber in 1944.  </P> <P> After the war ended, Spiegel emigrated and made a fortune building modest tract  homes in the San Fernando Valley and Orange County. He bought Columbia Savings  &amp; Loan Assn. in 1975. Home is a low, rambling mansion north of Sunset  Boulevard in Beverly Hills, where Columbia has its headquarters. He also has a  string of other real estate and investment corporations and partnerships. At  least twice in recent years, Columbia has leased space in buildings owned by  Spiegel -- including the glassy new Third and Fairfax Plaza.  </P> <P> Bradley resides at Getty House, the mayor's mansion in Hancock Park. His  personal investments in stocks and bonds -- some of them arranged by Spiegel --  and his dealings with local financial institutions have tarnished the mayor's  once squeaky-clean reputation.  </P> <P> Bradley and Spiegel consider their friendship very special, according to  sources close to both men.  </P> <P> "I see it when they greet each other, the feeling of good will and pride in Abe  Spiegel's eyes," said one source.  </P></p>

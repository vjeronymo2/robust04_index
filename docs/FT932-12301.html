			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Trade News: Seoul broke Gatt rules SOUTH Korea breached fair trade rules in an anti-dumping investigation of imports of polyacetal resins from the US and Japan, according to an independent disputes panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. South Korea said it would implement the panel's recommendations to conform with the world trade body's anti-dumping code. The code covers procedures for identifying and levying duties on dumped imports - goods sold below cost or below prices in the home market. The anti-dumping investigation by the Korean trade commission led to the imposition of duties in 1991 on US and Japanese exports of polyacetal resins, a plastic widely used in the manufacture of audio and video tapes, car parts and electronic components. Dumping margins were assessed at between 20 and 108 per cent.</p>

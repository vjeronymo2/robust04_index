			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Beijing repeats offer of talks with Dalai Lama UNDER international pressure over human rights in Tibet, China yesterday repeated its offer to hold talks with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.

'The Community and its member states believe that the problems of Tibet can best be resolved through dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of the Tibetan people, including its spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and urge both sides to engage in this without preconditions,' the statement said. The London-based Tibet Information Network, meanwhile, reported that between 7 and 13 Tibetans were arrested in Lhasa on Tuesday for pro-independence agitation. Xinhua news agency quoted the Tibetan governor, Mr Norbu, as firmly rejecting criticism of Beijing's policy towards Tibet, saying it was an internal matter for China. 'Tibet is an indispensable part of China and Tibetans constitute one part of the Chinese nation,' he declared. 'No government, organisation or individual is permitted to intervene in the affair.'</p>

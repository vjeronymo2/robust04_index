			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (1): Europe's reluctant tiger - The belief among economists that Portugal could do better reflects a feeling that the government has lost its nerve Portugal is weighing itself in the balance as it prepares to enter its 10th year as a member of the European Union and to mark a decade of centre-right government under Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva. The prevailing judgment is that reasonable expectations have not been frustrated, but neither have dreams been fulfilled. Gross domestic product per capita grew from 51.4 per cent of the EU average in 1985 to 64.5 per cent at the end of last year. In the decade to the end of 1995, Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, estimates the economy will have expanded at an average of 3.17 per cent a year, compared with 2.29 per cent for the EU and - an important comparison for Portugal - 2.75 per cent for Spain. In effect, Portugal has been catching up with the rest of Europe at a rate of 0.88 per cent a year above the average European growth rate since it joined the EU. That represents the strongest era of growth in Portugal's modern history and compares with a 3.2 per cent decline in GDP per capita over the previous decade, a period marked by the overthrow of the Salazar dictatorship in 1974 and several years of revolutionary upheaval. At its present rate of growth, Portugal will take another 40 years to reach the average economic strength of its EU partners, not allowing for the adjustments to be made after the admission of new member states. From an historical perspective, this seems like reasonable progress. The hopes raised in Portugal a decade ago that the country would be enjoying living standards comparable with those of most other Europeans by 2000 have since been written off as wholly unrealistic. But were these hopes unrealistic? Some economists believe Portugal may be missing a unique opportunity to attain growth rates of 5, 6 or even 7 per cent a year - becoming a sort of European tiger. 'There is no reason why we should not achieve rates of growth similar to those in certain parts of Asia,' says Antonio Borges, a former deputy-governor of the Bank of Portugal and now dean of Insead, the business school near Paris. 'All the favourable conditions that we see in such fast-growing, emerging countries are also to be found in Portugal.' These conditions include an open economy benefiting from access to the European market and a high level of public and private investment. Portugal is to benefit from at least Es4,450bn in EU aid over the next six years, more than double the funds received from Brussels in the previous six years. Portugal suffers no balance-of-payments difficulties and enjoys a high level of savings and investment. Above all, the labour market is flexible to a degree that 'would be the dream of most other European countries', according to Mr Borges. Given these advantages, he and like-minded analysts ask why Portugal has been satisfied with rates of growth not much different from those in the rest of Europe. The reason, according to analysts, is an economic policy often directed at guaranteeing the survival of inefficient companies and sectors, even though this slows down long-term growth and restricts economic development to the pace of the slowest movers. EU funds, they say, are frequently applied to maintaining a status quo already proven to be inadequate. As examples, they point to the troubled agricultural sector, to a Es180bn aid package for the loss-making state airline TAP and to large subsidies for the ailing state-owned steel company Siderurgia Nacional. The conviction held by several economists that Portugal could do better reflects a more prevalent sentiment that Mr Cavaco Silva's government has lost the reforming zeal of its early years - when important economic and legislative advances were made - and has grown steadily more averse to risk and conservative. A view widespread in the business community is that the governing Social Democrats (PSD) have lost their nerve and are not prepared to accept the political discomfort that more radical industrial restructuring, resulting in an economic leap forward, would involve. Antonio Guterres, leader of the opposition Socialists (PS), has a harsher view of what he perceives to be the government's deficiencies. 'The PSD has created a vast network of clients, partly through the way it distributes EU funds and other subsidies,' he says. 'The government intervenes in the economy in the interests of these clients, who are political supporters, rather than on the basis of clear policies.' The accusation, not unfamiliar in other countries, is echoed by smaller opposition parties to the left and right. As evidence, critics point to the government's recent veto of a hostile bid by Banco Comercial Portugues, the fifth largest bank, for control of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, the second biggest, and to the possible closing of hypermarkets on Sunday afternoons to defend small shopkeepers. In a recent speech, Mr Cavaco Silva dismissed his political opponents as 'prophets of doom' and 'defeatists'. He said the government's decision not to agree to trade union demands for a 5 per cent wage increase in 1995, an election year, showed he was prepared to sacrifice short-term political interests for the long-term good of the country. He defends the PSD as a pragmatic party that gets things done, while the opposition is limited to rhetoric. Opposition voices, rhetorical or otherwise, have grown louder over the past two years, mainly as a result of recession. A period of negative growth from mid-1992 to mid-1994 abruptly ended the euphoria Portugal enjoyed in the late 1980s. Competition within the single European market and reform of the Common Agricultural Policy have exposed Portugal to less benevolent aspects of EU membership than previously experienced. Recent eruptions of discontent - from the blockading of the April 25 bridge in Lisbon because of a toll increase to the blocking of a train importing Italian milk - have their root in economic concerns caused by the recession. The flagging economy has also drawn attention to issues less closely examined during the boom years, such as rural poverty, illiteracy, child labour, slums, shanty towns and deficient education and health services. The recession has made a strong impact in Portugal, but by international standards was relatively mild. GDP fell by 1 per cent in 1993 but growth has already resumed and will reach 1.1 per cent this year and a forecast 2.5 to 3.5 per cent in 1995. Unemployment has risen but is still low at 6.8 per cent. There has been no devastating impact on the financial sector, no property crisis, no wave of bankruptcies. Business confidence is weak but recovering. In this climate, Portugal's medium-term objective is to secure full participation in the EU's plans for economic and monetary union, particularly now that the community is expanding and the possibility of a multispeed Europe has been raised by politicians in Germany and France. An election next October will decide who leads the country towards that goal. Mr Cavaco Silva may have lost some support. But it is not clear that Mr Guterres has yet gained enough credibility to replace him.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Worries about family values - NFC's recent rights issue, which diluted employees' shareholdings, caused some disquiet at the AGM Annual meetings of NFC, the transport and logistics group, have always been distinctive occasions, ever since the former National Freight Consortium was the subject of an employee buy-out in 1982. Attended by up to 4,000 people, they have had a unique atmosphere, with current employees and pensioners keen to monitor the progress of one of the first nationalised industries to be privatised. It was, therefore, like eavesdropping on a family row at the weekend to hear Sir Peter Thompson, who led the original buy-out, accuse his successor, Mr James Watson, of putting the group's traditional values at risk. Sir Peter was upset that shareholders were not consulted before NFC's Pounds 263m share issue in December. Following a strategic review, the group plans to expand its distribution and removal businesses internationally. However, there was no doubt that Sir Peter's real concern was that NFC's distinctive culture, based on employee ownership and participation, was in danger. The rights issue will accelerate a process of diminishing employee control which started when NFC was floated in 1989. About 42 per cent of the equity was in private hands before the December rights issue and 85 per cent of the group's 32,000 employees are shareholders. NFC does not yet know how far that proportion of equity held by employees has fallen as a result of the issue, but it is bound to have been diluted by institutional cash. More symbolically, current employees - who had 13 per cent of the shares before the rights issue - enjoy double voting rights, but only so long as their total stake is more than 10 per cent. The rights issue itself will not push the employees' share below this level, but the steady rate of share sales means that double voting is likely to be lost sometime this year. Mr Watson, who succeeded Sir Peter in 1991, insisted that the 'continuing evolution' of the group posed no threat to its core values. He said the fact that employees were shareholders was more important than the size of their stake. Mr Peter Sherlock, the former Bass director who became chief executive last February, also insists that NFC's 'enviable heritage and culture' is not in question - indeed, he says employee participation is a key element in the group's focus on service, through relaying what customers want. The end of double voting will make NFC more attractive to investment institutions which dislike unusual share structures, but Mr Sherlock says of the provision: 'We have never sought to implement it, or even contemplated it.' Mr Sherlock said the main reason for the rights issue was to give NFC some financial elbow room for its new focus. This involves the merger of the BRS transport operations and Exel Logistics in the UK, and the international expansion of both the distribution logistics operations and Allied and Pickfords, the moving service businesses. With shareholders' funds of only Pounds 312m supporting a business with annual turnover of Pounds 1.9bn, NFC had very little room for manoeuvre. Before the rights issue it had gearing of 53 per cent and even a moderately sized acquisition would have pushed gearing up to unacceptable levels. The rights issue has left the group with net cash of Pounds 89m. Sir Peter did not discuss the merits of the rights issue, saying he was sure that shareholders would have given their approval to any reasonable case made by the board. But, he protested: 'We used to pride ourselves on sharing big decisions with employees and shareholders.' Mr Watson stoutly defended the board, saying he had flagged the need for a rights issue to previous shareholder meetings and advance notice of the rights issue could have undermined the NFC share price. The AGM at Wembley approved all the resolutions before it and the chairman was applauded, although not as warmly as Sir Peter. Even board members who were irritated by the way the former chairman chose to air his complaints continue to have a high regard for Sir Peter, who in 1990 published a book on the NFC story, Sharing the Success. Mr Sherlock believes the rights issue means NFC is entering a third phase, after the previous landmarks of the 1982 buy-out and 1989 flotation. He said: 'It is much easier to articulate a philosophy of enhancing shareholder value if 85 per cent of the employees are shareholders. But we must not let it act as a restraint on the business, which employees also understand.' In some ways the rights issue is only the latest in a series of steps which has taken NFC away from its unusual origins and towards more conventional corporate practices. In September the group confirmed it would end its unique tradition of giving 'best view' forecasts of future profits. Developed to keep shareholder employees informed after the initial buy-out, NFC won special permission from the Stock Exchange to maintain the practice after flotation because many employees were not familiar with owning shares. However, the group was advised that it could face legal challenges in the US if it failed to meet its best view forecast. It would be wrong to suggest that NFC is already like any other company. The group still gives 1 per cent of profits to charities each year and the AGM enthusiastically applauded a video reporting how the group's charitable foundation spent Pounds 1.3m last year. It then presented a Pounds 50,000 cheque to the Macmillan Nursing appeal - half raised by employees, the rest matched by NFC. Some 10,000 retired employees take part in the pensioners' association, which has 71 branches in the UK. The rights issue was well received by the City and the shares have since risen 15 per cent. Analysts welcomed the strategic review and are enthusiastic about NFC's prospects - as were shareholders at the AGM. How far NFC can maintain its distinctive culture in the years ahead must remain an open question. However, no-one who attended the Wembley meeting could be in any doubt that the issue will be closely followed by the shareholders - not least Sir Peter.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Arts: Purcell's 'Dioclesian' - a rarity revived / Concert Only 12 months to go until the long-awaited tercentenary of Henry Purcell's death. The preliminary fanfares which started to be heard as early as two years ago are now in a crescendo, as early music groups line up to go into the recording studios so that their new Purcell records will be ready for next year. The latest rarity to be revived is Dioclesian, a semi-opera composed in 1690, originally blending play and music. In the light of current political events its attitudes look most unfashionable. No opportunity is missed to praise the ruling monarch, to 'sound his renown', to 'embalm his name'. Nor is much time spent debating moral propriety. In the celebratory masque at the end Bacchus and Cupid are the two immortal guests, promising 'days and nights spent in delights'. The plays which were intended to go with Purcell's semi-operas do not as a rule add much to our understanding of the music. Roger Norrington recently performed The Fairy Queen complete with the re-hashed version of A Midsummer Night's Dream for which it was intended, but that is a special case. The Shakespeare, even mutilated, retains its strength. When the other plays have been unearthed, they have merely made the evenings very long indeed. For their concert performance of Dioclesian at St John's, Smith Square, Trevor Pinnock and The English Concert kept strictly to the music. No play, no acting to talk of, no sets. (In Purcell's day the lavish transformation scenes brought vistas of palaces and gardens descending from the ceiling.) For present-day audiences this is probably the best way, though it would be fascinating just once to lash out on a comparable staging for the commemorative year. Even if he did have to share the limelight with the dramatist, there is no sign that Purcell gave the music anything less than his fullest attention. Odd corners of the score are enlivened by a pride in detail. The picturesque moments, including the Butterfly Dance, the Chair Dance, and the Canaries, are drawn with skill and delight. With their recording imminent, Pinnock and his players were rehearsed to top form, as was the exemplary Choir of the English Concert. Nancy Argenta and Ann Monoyios were the two soprano Wood-Gods, the latter the more delicate, neatly turning her ornaments. Stephen Gadd makes an impressive, firm Purcell bass, but was po-faced as the shepherd who sweeps his shepherdess off her feet in the space of four stanzas. Some of the other solo singing was on the dull side in music as fresh and alive as if it was written yesterday - no doubt why the programme gave Purcell's dates as 1965-95.</p>

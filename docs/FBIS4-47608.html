			<p>SUMMARY                                  China's leadership is moving ahead with its strategy of creating  "policy banks," recently establishing a State Development Bank  and an Import and Export Bank as the first step in implementing  banking reforms endorsed at the Third Plenum of the 14th Central  Committee last fall.  Although PRC media reports of the change  have emphasized the use of bond issues to fund the State  Development Bank, the leadership nevertheless appears not to have  departed far from traditional financial practices in setting up  the banks.  PRC media, however, have failed to signal movement on  another goal of banking reform, the transformation of state-owned  specialized banks into market-oriented "commercial" lending  institutions.                             END SUMMARY     A Xinhua report of 13 April announced the establishment that day  of the State Development Bank, describing it as a "policy-  oriented" financial institution directly under the State Council.  Consistent with previous media reporting on the purpose of the  bank, the report said it will be responsible for the "overall  regulation and control" of investment funds for "key state  projects" and was established to "further deepen" reform of the  investment system.  On the 28th, Xinhua reported that a second  policy bank--the Import and Export Bank of China--had been  established on 27 April and claimed that the establishment of the  bank was a "clear gesture" by the government to give "strong  support" to foreign trade, in particular financing the "import  and export of capital goods."     First Step in Reform     The creation of the two policy banks indicates that Beijing is  moving ahead on the banking reforms approved by the Third Plenum  of the 14th Central Committee last fall that called for  separating more traditional "policy banks" from market-oriented  "commercial banks."  As envisioned by the plenum, commercial  banks were to serve as the core of a risk-based investment  system, granting loans on the basis of market assessments of  project viability, while policy banks were to ensure funding for  less profitable infrastructure projects deemed necessary by the  state (Xinhua, 16 November 1993).     Beijing's decision to move ahead first with the establishment of  the State Development Bank appears to reflect in part the  leadership's determination to impose central control over the  unbridled investment that has resulted from senior leader Deng  Xiaoping's fast growth policies and that the media have blamed  for inflationary pressure and economic overheating.  For example,  the 13 April Xinhua report stated that, among the bank's other  duties, it will "control and regulate" fixed asset investment and  create a "responsible system" in the socialist market economy to  "rein in excessive investment."  Similarly, Premier Li Peng had  linked the bank to what he said was the pressing need for  regulation of investment in his Government Work Report to the  National People's Congress on 10 March.  He stated that the  reform of the investment system this year "mainly involves" the  State Development Bank, which will "check inflation and  investment expansion" through the "balancing of capital" (Xinhua,  23 March).     Mixed Financing     Although Chinese media have reported that the new policy banks  will raise capital both through direct state funding and the sale  of bonds--an approach consistent with the reform postulates of  the authoritative "decision" of the Third Plenum--they have  attempted to give the impression that the issue of market-based  bonds will be the major source of financing.  For example, the 28  April Xinhua report declared that the sale of 20 billion yuan  worth of bonds issued by the State Development Bank was a  "success" and quoted bank president Yao Zhengyan as saying that a  total of 65 billion yuan worth of three-year and five-year bonds  will be issued this year.     Despite efforts to emphasize reliance on this market-based  approach to capital accumulation, PRC media have hinted that the  purchase of the bonds by major state-owned financial institutions  may not have been voluntary and that the leadership will continue  to rely heavily on direct transfers from the state treasury to  subsidize the development of the bank's operations.  The 28 April  Xinhua report, for example, quoted Yao as stating that the bonds  will be purchased by state commercial banks and non-bank  financial institutions "under quotas" set by the central bank.  In addition, it noted that the treasury had issued a one billion  yuan grant to the State Development Bank to subsidize the low-  interest loans it had already extended to state projects.  Similarly, Beijing's English-language paper China Daily reported  that the "national treasury" had promised 50 billion yuan of  registered capital to the State Development Bank "over the next  four years" (24-30 April).  Further demonstrating the new policy  banks' dependence upon state appropriations, a 27 April Xinhua  report said that the Import and Export Bank will depend upon  "state financial appropriations" for its capital needs, issuing  bonds only to "raise enough money" for the bank's "daily  operations."     Delays for Commercial Banks     Despite these initial changes in the banking system, Chinese  media have not been observed to report that the leadership is  moving forward in remolding China's four "specialized" state  banks into commercial banks along Western lines--the heart of the  reformers' efforts to establish a risk-based investment system  based on market principles.  The China Daily report, for example,  referred to such specialized state banks as the Bank of China,  the Agriculture Bank, the Construction Bank, and the Industrial  and Commercial Bank as purchasers of State Development Bank bonds  but gave no indication that their status has been changed.  The  lack of progress in reforming these banks may reflect their heavy  debt burden.  In a speech at a national financial work conference  in January, Politburo Standing Committee member and central bank  chief Zhu Rongji had hinted that the specialized banks' bad loans  to unprofitable state enterprises had delayed this reform.  Zhu  declared that specialized banks can only "begin their transition"  toward commercial banks "once their policy-oriented businesses  are divested" (Xinhua, 19 January).     Implications     Although Beijing has made a modest beginning in implementing  plenum-endorsed banking reforms designed to move China closer to  a market economy, the establishment of the two new policy banks  appears designed as much to strengthen central control over  investment through the traditional direct channeling of treasury  funds as to allocate investment capital through market-based  incentives.  Possibly fearful of exacerbating current  inflationary pressures, the leadership appears to have put the  more risky banking reforms--the establishment of a market-driven  commercial banking sector--on hold.

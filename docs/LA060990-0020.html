			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIGHTING UP U.S.-MEXICO BORDER AREA  </P> <P> As residents of Southern California, we are well aware that the Immigration and  Naturalization Service is not able to cope with the thousands who break the law  and cross our border from Mexico.  </P> <P> For a lawyer, Antonio Rodriguez, and a psychologist, Gloria Romero, to feel  this behavior should be acceptable, makes me question their motives and  integrity.  </P> <P> The taxes of all of us are being stretched to the breaking point to care for  those living here illegally.  </P> <P> Light Up the Border may be a wrong way to protest this injustice. I deplore the  use of violence if they resort to that. However, two wrongs don't make a right.  </P> <P> What has happened to respect for the law? If you don't like a law, help to  change it, but observe it while it is a law.  </P> <P> For an attorney and a teaching psychologist to suggest citizens should look the  other way as more undocumented immigrants pour over our borders is morally  irresponsible. It has little to with xenophobia -- we do not "hate strangers or  foreigners" per se.  </P> <P> MARY B. SWENGEL  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Kohl 'brainstorming by telephone'in search for Community accord CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl may be determined to avoid transforming Europe into a 'glorified free trade area,' or 'Europe a la carte,' where every member state can pick or choose the policies it follows, but he is also set on getting an agreement in Edinburgh. Behind the scenes, the chancellor's key EC advisers have been carrying on an extraordinarily close liaison with their British and French counterparts, in an effort to forge an acceptable deal on the range of issues on the agenda. 'It has been brainstorming by telephone,' according to one official involved. Any suggestion of an Anglo-German chill is flatly rejected, with both sides said to be in 'deep and excellent contact'. The heads of government have talked on the telephone every week, as the British presidency stepped up its effort to cobble together a series of compromises. The decision to order such unusually close contacts was taken by Mr Kohl and Mr John Major, the British prime minister, at their bilateral summit at Ditchley Park in early November, when it looked as though time was running out for reaching a deal at Edinburgh. It also reflects the deep personal commitment of the German chancellor to the ratification of the Maastricht treaty by all 12 EC member states. Mr Kohl has made European union his overriding political ambition. He has disregarded opinion polls suggesting that his electors are profoundly suspicious of economic and monetary union, if it means giving up their strong and precious D-Mark. Instead, he has made it clear that the unification of Europe is his second great political goal, following the unification of Germany. Behind that commitment, he has confided to his close aides, is a fear that if European integration is not achieved while he is chancellor, his successors may not have the same determination to follow it through. When some German officials and commentators floated ideas about pressing ahead with a two-speed or variable-speed Europe - leaving behind doubters like Britain and Denmark, and weaker currency countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece - the Chancellor has instantly condemned them. He wants a Europe of 12 member states, and rapid enlargement negotiations to bring in Austria and the Scandinavians. Yet it is a fine line he is treading. He is equally determined that the doubters in Britain and Denmark shall not continue to dictate the slow pace of integration, nor begin to unravel what has been achieved to date. And with his own economy slipping into recession, and facing huge bills for the revival of eastern Germany, he is desperate to keep his EC budget contributions under control. On Denmark, the strategy is clearly to push the Danes to the limit of what they can accept, to refuse flatly any renegotiation of the treaty, but still to get a deal in the end. On the budget, the aim is to find enough money to satisfy the weaker economies, while keeping a strict ceiling on the overall finances. What Mr Kohl has clearly realised is that his best bet to achieve all of that is not to do so by sniping at the British presidency, but by giving all the help and support he can.</p>

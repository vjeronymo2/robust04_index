			<p>BFN     [Text] The fighting between the Democratic Party of  Kurdistan [DPK] and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] in  northern Iraq has not ended, regardless of the many cease-fire  agreements the two sides have reached until now. Although the  sides have claimed that they are heeding the latest cease-fire  agreement, an official of the National Congress of Iraq, which  is made up of several groups that are opposed to Saddam Husayn,  has said that uninterrupted clashes are continuing in Halabjah.  The official, who prefers to remain anonymous, has said that at  least 600 persons have been killed in the clashes thus far, the  great majority of whom supported the PUK.    Meanwhile, it has been reported that DPK Leader Mas'ud  Barzani and PUK leader Jalal Talabani have been unable to draw  up an agreement to end the fighting.    The Western countries headed by the United States  established  an autonomous region in northern Iraq when Saddam Husayn moved  against the Kurds after the Gulf War ended. The DPK and PUK  took part in the parliament of the Kurdish administration with  equal strength after the elections in 1992. The dispute between  the two sides broke out on 1 May. An international effort has  been made to establish a basis for peace between the two sides.  Turkey has contributed toward that effort. However, the  initiatives that have been made have failed to yield results  thus far.</p>

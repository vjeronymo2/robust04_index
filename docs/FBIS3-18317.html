			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Four Fall From the Sky"] </F>   [Text] The shooting down of the four Bosnian Serb aircraft  was a chance event which could hardly be avoided. The U.S.  planes were acting within the terms of the no-fly-zone  resolution authorised by the Security Council nearly a year ago.  Though the zone has been repeatedly violated by helicopter  flights on all three sides, this is the first time in months  that fixed-wing aircraft have defied the ban. Eyewitness  accounts appear to confirm that the six Bosnian Serb Galebs (two  got away) were making a bombing raid against targets on the  ground and had inflicted significant damage. We do not know  whether their flight was intended as a deliberate challenge and  if so, by what level of the Bosnian Serb leadership. But the  Galebs were taking a chance -- and they paid for it.    Had they flown a month ago, or at any time before the recent  NATO ultimatum, it is quite possible that the Bosnian Serbs  would have got away with it. The UN and those acting in its  name have got tougher: if the Galebs' flight was designed to  test this greater resolve, it secured a straightforward answer.  Yesterday should also have seen the start of a more determined  effort to get aid convoys past the blockades (mounted by  combatants of all forces) which have so often forced them to  grind to a halt. Instead the first convoy to travel under the  new rules was halted by the UNHCR "until the system clarified."  This is an early demonstration of an obvious truth -- often  stressed by the aid workers themselves -- that being tough in  one area can make life harder in another. There is no easy  answer to this dilemma.    The Russian government (Mr Zhirinovskiy is another matter)  appears to accept that if the Serb planes were engaged in  offensive operations, then they were liable to UN sanction under  a resolution which Moscow had fully endorsed. That does not  diminish the political difficulty for the Russians if this leads  to further incidents in which UN forces clash with the Serbs. A  more forceful policy also has to steer very carefully between  letting the Serbs off too easily and driving them into their  preferred state of beleaguered martyrdom. It is essential too  that the forces of the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims must be  rigorously policed.    Incidents such as yesterday's Serb shelling of Tuzla present  the UN with what may be a multiplying sequence of very difficult  choices. It is unlikely to have been a direct riposte to the  shooting down of the four planes. Tuzla, though one of the five  UN safe-areas, has been shelled before with impunity, but it is  also one of the issues over which the UN Commander intends to  proceed more forcefully. Yet this is still a case to be tackled  by negotiation rather than further retaliation. As it  increasingly adopts the dual roles of peace keeping and peace  making, the UN is going to encounter a widening patchwork of  difficult and specific problems on the ground. They will need  very sensitive handling: they cannot all be shot out of the sky.</p>

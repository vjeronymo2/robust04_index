			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Team close to finding asthma gene SCIENTISTS in Oxford are close to identifying a single defective gene which triggers several common allergic disorders including asthma, hay fever and eczema. The discovery could lead to a cure for a group of diseases that kills 2,000 people a year in the UK and affects millions more. The researchers, led by Dr William Cookson and Dr John Hopkin at the John Radcliffe and Churchill hospitals, are thought to be within months of finding the defective gene, which is carried by at least a quarter of the population. Once the gene is known the pharmaceutical industry can start to develop a drug to block the protein it produces. This would cure the conditions it causes. Dr Hopkin warned last night against excessive optimism. 'It's likely to be 10 to 15 years before our research leads to a drug on the market,' he said. The Oxford team has been funded by medical charities, the Wellcome Trust and the National Asthma Campaign.</p>

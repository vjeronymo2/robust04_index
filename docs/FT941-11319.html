			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Delta Air drops more routes Delta Air Lines, one of the three biggest US carriers, is to drop two more transatlantic services as part of its continuing efforts to restore profits to the portfolio of international routes it bought from Pan Am in 1991. Its daily non-stop service between San Francisco and Frankfurt will stop at the end of April, and its three-times-a-week non-stop service between New York and Budapest will be abandoned at the beginning of May in favour of a code-sharing agreement with Malev Hungarian Airlines. After the latest cuts, Delta will have decreased its transatlantic flights from 293 a week last summer to 259 - a reduction of 12 per cent.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK unemployment total nears 3m: Industrial production falls in November - Hopes raised for cut in interest rates UK UNEMPLOYMENT came within a whisker of the politically sensitive 3m mark last month, triggering hopes of lower interest rates in the City and furious exchanges in the Commons. The government also announced a fall in industrial production in November while the British Chambers of Commerce said the economy was still in recession. The seasonally adjusted jobless total jumped by 60,800 to 2.97m in the month to December, its 32nd consecutive monthly rise. Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons that the figures were 'deeply disappointing'. The increase was much higher than the 35,000 rise predicted in the City and lifted the UK unemployment rate to 10.5 per cent from November's 10.3 per cent. The actual number of people unemployed increased by 119,270 to 2.98m. The unemployment figures prompted a significant change in financial markets' perception of the pound and encouraged analysts to believe that the government will soon have to cut bank base rates from 7 per cent. The pound closed at DM2.4525, down some 2 1/4 pfennigs on the day and 4 3/4 pfennigs lower than at the end of last week. Sterling also fell against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5180, more than 2 1/4 cents down on the day. In New York, sterling recovered slightly, closing at DM2.4574 and at Dollars 1.5225. Equities rose on the hopes of lower interest rates with the FT-SE 100 index gaining 24.6 to 2,773.3. On the domestic money market, three-months' money dropped by  1/8 per cent to 6 13/16 per cent. This rate, often seen as a bellwether of future interest rate trends, touched its lowest level since base rates dropped to 7 per cent in November. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said the rise in unemployment was of 'deep concern' to the government. She said the figures were 'very difficult for both the individuals involved and for their families'. The government was trying to ensure that existing measures to help the unemployed were working as effectively as possible. Unemployment has increased by 1.38m since it began rising in April 1990. The December increase, which was the biggest monthly rise since July 1991, brought unemployment back to levels last seen in February 1987. The Central Statistical Office reported that manufacturing output declined by 0.5 per cent between October and November and was 0.2 per cent lower than in November 1991. While reporting an upturn in exports and improved business confidence, the British Chambers of Commerce yesterday voiced 'extreme concern' about the state of the domestic UK market and warned of further job losses to come. The Treasury did nothing to encourage speculation of lower interest rates. It said the latest rise in unemployment did not suggest that economic activity was still falling. It recalled that the government had eased monetary policy significantly since September and announced measures in the Autumn Statement aimed at restoring confidence and encouraging recovery. These had not yet fed through fully to the production and employment figures. At Westminster, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, described the figures as 'horrendous' and accused the government of failing the nation. Roared on by rowdy backbenchers, Mr Smith questioned the credibility of Mr John Major's expressions of concern and branded as 'feeble and lame' the government's 'excuses'. 'You express concern for the unemployed but aren't you the person who told us 'If it isn't hurting, it isn't working,'' Mr Smith told the prime minister. Mr Major said Labour had 'no idea how to deal with the economy or unemployment'. He told a new cabinet sub-committee reviewing possible improvements to measures to tackle unemployment of a 'dual strategy' to provide long-lasting solutions. This consisted of a 'solid foundation' for economic recovery and 'wide-ranging' help for the unemployed.

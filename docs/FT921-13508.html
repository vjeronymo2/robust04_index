			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Indonesian names for June poll Indonesia yesterday announced candidates for June's general election, including children of both Indonesia's presidents since independence, its only official sultan, and many businessmen, artists and intellectuals, Reuter reports from Jakarta. No one doubted that the ruling Golkar party, which took 73 per cent of the vote in 1986, would again win by a wide margin over the two other political parties. Political analysts said interest would focus on just how wide that margin is as an indicator of what Indonesians think of the 26-year rule of President Suharto, who is widely expected to stand again when his current term expires next year.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: German banks ride high as economy sags - Why the sector is expected to report record profits for 1991 At a time when German industrial companies are struggling to maintain profits and shareholder dividends in the face of a deteriorating economy, the banking sector is enjoying a boom. Germany's banks are certain to report record profits for 1991 when full-year figures are released this spring. Moreover, the biggest and most profitable bank - Deutsche Bank - signalled its confidence in the outlook for the current year when it recently increased its 1991 dividend by DM1 to DM15 a share. Although few other banks are confident enough to match Deutsche Bank's dividend move, the increase in the sector's profits last year was spread widely. Group operating profits rose by 21.7 per cent at Deutsche Bank in the first 10 months of the year; by more than 31 per cent at Commerzbank, Germany's third largest bank; and by as much as 50 per cent at medium-sized banks such as Deutsche Verkehrs Bank. Strip out the effect of trading gains, and the rise in so-called partial operating profits was also impressive and widespread. At the parent company level, this figure increased by 11.4 per cent to DM2.99bn (Dollars 1.92bn) at Deutsche Bank; by over 20 per cent to DM1.22bn at Dresdner Bank, the second largest in Germany; and by 29 per cent to DM626m at Bayerische Vereinsbank, Germany's fourth largest bank. For the sector as a whole, partial operating profits are likely to rise by more than 15 per cent for the full year, according to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, compared with an increase of just under 11 per cent for 1990. Central to the profits performance last year was a surge in demand for credit, with banks' lending to non-banks rising 12.7 per cent during the first eight months of 1991. According to Vereinsbank, the growth in lending volume reflects investment opportunities in the east of Germany, where economic growth is likely to outpace that of the west for some years to come. To the great benefit of the banks, the risks of lending directly to east Germany have been curbed by credit protection schemes put in place by the Treuhand, the privatisation agency for former state-owned enterprises in the east. To round off the virtuous circle, the banks' cost of funds has fallen at the same time that lending volumes have risen. This again reflects conditions in east Germany, where hundreds of thousands of unsophisticated and conservative customers have left their money in low-yielding accounts. Recent statistics show that nearly 30 per cent of the total liabilities of Germany's large banks are financed by money on which they pay out 3 per cent or less a year. This can be lent out at up to four to five times this rate to eager corporate customers - at no risk at all to the banks if the Treuhand is guaranteeing the loans. The higher German interest rates, the higher the spread for the banks - and since the Bundesbank's decision to raise rates by a full half point just before Christmas, they are now at their highest level since before the Second World War. In the light of these favour-able circumstances, even earnings growth of 15 per cent last year looks modest: banks' profits would have been significantly higher had administrative and other costs not also risen last year. Again, this reflects circumstances in the east, where the banks have had to invest heavily in new technology, training and property. At Deutsche Bank's parent company, for example, the costs of developing a network of branches in the east led to a 19.3 per cent increase in staff and other operating costs, to DM5.47bn, in the first 10 months of last year. By the time the banks report their profits early this spring, the boom conditions which inspired them will have fallen away, for three reasons: The pre-Christmas rise in interest rates will have dealt a further blow to the German economy and to the demand for credit. A weaker economy will expose the banks to bad and doubtful debts. As yet the banks have not made any provisions for bad loans. The banks' exposure to the former Soviet Union stood at DM35bn in the middle of last year. Analysts are playing this down as a depressant on 1991 and 1992 earnings. They point out that the bulk of the risk is shouldered by the German government or its agencies, leaving the private-sector banks' uninsured exposure at a relatively modest DM6bn to DM10bn, spread among some 4,000 German banks. Of the big three banks, only Commerzbank has yet to make any provision against its Soviet exposure, although it has said that it will bite the bullet this year. Deutsche, meanwhile, is likely to increase its provisions from 65 to 70 per cent of a total of an estimated DM1bn-plus of uninsured loans. The costs of doing business in eastern Germany are likely to fall this year, but any benefit here is likely to be offset by rising wages. The 430,000 members of Germany's banking unions are demanding a pay rise of 10.5 per cent for this year. They have been offered 5 per cent but they are unlikely to moderate their demands. While bank workers are currently being ballotted on strike action, Deutsche's dividend increase at this sensitive stage of the pay round shows that the banks feel no compulsion to hide their prosperity. Despite these factors, analysts are expecting the big banks' earnings to rise as much as 9 to 10 per cent this year - about twice the rate of increase for the German market as a whole. Does the performance of earnings mean the banks' shares will do well this year? Analysts are pinning their hopes on interest rate cuts later this year. This would reduce the banks' cost of funds without obliging them to pass on all the benefits of lower rates to their customers, at least not at once. 'Once the market gets a hint that interest rates are coming down,' says one German broker, 'banks shares will go into orbit.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             GERMAN BANKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Business Volume        Partial op'ting profit                          DM m    change           DM m    change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deutsche Bank          297,582   +14.3 percent   2,994    +11.1 percent Dresdner Bank          189,371    +3.5 percent   1,215    +20.2 percent Commerzbank            150,831    +2.4 percent     974    +18.7 percent Bayerische Vereinsbank 129,236    +9.8 percent     626    +29.4 percent Hypo-Bank              130,184    +3.5 percent     820    +10.1 percent Berliner Bank           26,900   +21.0 percent     161    +43.0 percent BHF Bank                27,547    +9.4 percent     188    +22.1 percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Parent company results for first 10 months of 1991  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

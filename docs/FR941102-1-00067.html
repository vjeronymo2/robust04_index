			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A witness from Land O'Lakes, Inc. (LOL), testified in support of the adoption of MCP in the five orders in general, and the NAJ proposal specifically. He discussed how the NAJ multiple component pricing proposal would better reflect the market value of nutrients in the milk to the farmer. He stated that the proposed system, compared with the current system, would essentially eliminate the value of milk used in manufacturing that is currently associated with water which, he said, has very little market value in dairy products. The witness said that MCP would affect the cost of milk to LOL as a handler in that it will come closer to equalizing the cost of milk relative to the value of the products derived from the milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The LOL witness also described four major weaknesses in the existing voluntary MCP plans. The first weakness, he said, was that the current plans emphasize component test instead of component yield. He said that the price paid to each producer should be tied more directly to the value of the products that can be produced from the producer's milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second weakness described by the LOL witness is that many existing plans do not provide for deductions for milk with low component levels. This, he said, indicates that the plans recognize the higher value of milk with more pounds of components, but do not recognize that milk with fewer pounds of components is worth less. He said that competitive, rather than economic, factors are the reason deductions for low component levels generally do not exist, as many producers do not like to see deductions on their milk checks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the LOL witness, an inequitable feature of the voluntary MCP plans is that they generally pay no component premiums when the somatic cell count of the milk is above a fixed level, resulting in high test producers losing their component premium because of high somatic cells, while low test producers with high somatic cell counts lose nothing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth weakness described by the witness is that some existing MCP plans pay premiums for protein, while others pay premiums for solids-not-fat. He said that most producers in Wisconsin receive premiums based on protein, while most producers in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota receive premiums based on solids-not-fat. The witness claimed that the variety of payment plans currently in existence do a poor job of transmitting market signals to the producers, are not economically consistent, and lead to confusion among farmers. He said that the NAJ proposal would address the deficiencies in the current situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most participants at the hearing advocated the introduction of MCP for payments to producers and for milk delivered to handlers for Class II and Class III use in the five orders. There was no support for pricing Class I milk on other than the current butterfat and skim basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to NAJ and LOL, adoption of some form of multiple component pricing in the five orders was supported by Central Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC), the Trade Association of Proprietary Plants (TAPP), Farmers Union Milk Marketing Cooperative (FUMMC), National Farmers Organization (NFO), Kraft General Foods (Kraft), Associated Milk Producers, Inc., North Central Region (AMPI North Central), Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association (WCMA), Dean Foods, and National Cheese Institute (NCI). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CMPC witnesses strongly supported the need for implementing multiple component pricing in the five orders and proposed a plan very similar to that of NAJ. The fundamental difference between the two plans is that the CMPC proposal would result in lower protein prices than the NAJ proposal. The appropriate level of the protein price is discussed under Issue 3a below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CMPC proposal was supported in testimony and in a post-hearing brief by NFO. A witness for WCMA testified in support of the CMPC proposal for multiple component pricing. A witness for Dean Foods testified in support of the concept of MCP, and in response to a question about which proposal he favored, he expressed support for the CMPC proposal. AMPI North Central Region submitted a brief in support of the CMPC proposal for multiple component pricing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

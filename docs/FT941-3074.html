			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Telstra cautious despite 26% rise in first half Telstra, the Australian telecommunications company, yesterday reported a 26.3 per cent increase in profits after tax, to ADollars 997m (USDollars 717.3m) for the six months ended December. However, it warned that increasing competition would put pressure on future returns. Mr David Hoare, chairman, described the first-half results as sound but said that competition had been fierce. 'This will increase pressure on Telstra's future profit margins and cashflows,' he said. Due to the progressive deregulation of the Australian telecommunications sector, Telstra now faces competition from Optus in the long-distance market, and from Optus and Britain's Vodafone for mobile telephone services. The government's aim is to move to full network competition by 1997. Revenues for the six months rose 3.5 per cent to ADollars 6.41bn and operating profits were 12.2 per cent higher at ADollars 1.48m. Telstra's debt fell, leaving the gearing ratio at 37 per cent by the end of 1993, compared with 41 per cent six months earlier. The company is to pay an interim dividend of ADollars 361m to the federal government. It does not give a detailed break-down of its figures.</p>

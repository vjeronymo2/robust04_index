			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Split in Taiwanese ruling party Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party formally split for the first time in more than four decades yesterday when some of the party's top vote-winners broke away and formed a splinter party, Reuter reports from Taipei. The six legislators, including two former ministers, accused the party leadership of failing to halt rampant corruption and dragging its feet on internal reform, and announced the formation of the New party. It is the first formal split among the Nationalists since they fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949. The MPs' departure has lowered the number of seats the Nationalists hold in the 160-member parliament to 96 from 102. The opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) has 52 seats.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Job satisfaction higher in east Germany than west: Survey points up the growing divide between those with work and the unemployed WORKERS in eastern Germany express more job satisfaction than their counterparts in the wealthy west of the country, in spite of poor job security, lower wages and worse working conditions, according to a new survey. The result underlines the growing divide in the former Communist part of Germany between those who are delighted to have held on to their jobs in the new market economy, and those who have lost them and face prolonged unemployment. The survey of more than 1,000 workers in both parts of the country, carried out by the London-based International Survey Research, concludes that 95 per cent of east German employees believe they are doing something really worthwhile in their job, 86 per cent say their work gives them a sense of personal achievement, and 82 per cent think that their job is varied and interesting. 'Equivalent scores in western Germany, though still high in absolute terms, are significantly lower by comparison,' the survey reports. 'There seems to be little doubt that the high regard eastern German employees continue to have for the value and purpose of their work enables them to maintain a very high level of morale in the face of difficult economic circumstances and diminishing employment security.' Indeed, as might be expected, their confidence in job security is much lower than in the west, and they are significantly less satisfied with their pay and fringe benefits. For example, only 44 per cent of east German employees believe fringe benefits are adequate, compared with 74 per cent in the west. They are also less positive about western-style management practices in their enterprises, such as performance recognition, training and development and corporate communications, suggesting that such practices have yet to gain much priority in the east. The study is one of the first in the former Communist parts of eastern Europe to be carried out by ISR, which specialises in surveys of employee attitudes. It points out that eastern employees are perhaps surprisingly confident about the quality of the work produced in their companies (71 per cent), a finding mirrored by east German management, in spite of the problems of marketing eastern products on western markets. The survey concludes that for Germany as a whole, employees are noticeably less confident about the prospects for their companies than in other west European economies: only 22 per cent of the Germans expect a change for the better, compared with 36 per cent in France, 33 per cent in Britain and 32 per cent in the Netherlands, according to comparable ISR surveys.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS--The government will reconsider the  prices of the PLTGU's [gas-steam electric power plants] at Muara  Tawar in West Java, Tambak Lorok in Central Java, and Pasuruan  in East Java. This will be done through a "repeat order." The  prices bid for Muara Tawar by ABB [expansion unknown] in  partnership with Marubeni of Japan, for Tambak Lorok by Sumitomo  of Japan and General Electric of the United States, and for  Pasuruan by Mitsubishi of Japan and Siemens, which will have a  total of 2,342 MW [megawatts], were considered by the government  to be quite high and thus require reconsideration.    Minister of Mining and Energy I.B. Sudjana said this  Saturday, 23 April, at the Department of Mining and Energy after  inaugurating the Board of Commissioners of Aneka Tambang and the  Boards of Commissioners and Directors of PT [Limited Company]  Tambang Timah.    "The bids offered by the three contractors were quite high.  For that reason, the government needs to reconsider them,"  Sudjana said.    For the readers information, the high prices were actually  reduced by the contractors at the end of February after  receiving instructions from President Suharto. The bid price of  the three PLTGU's, which have a total capacity of 2,342 MW, was  reduced from $2.147 billion to $1.769 billion. This approaches  the PLN price for the Tanjungpriok PLTGU. The total price  reduction by the three consortia was $378.15 million, or about  801.678 billion rupiah.    Sudjana said that although there is to be a reconsideration,  as of now he cannot set an ideal price for the three PLTGU's. At  present, the final price for the construction of the  Tanjungpriok PLTGU is still being used as a reference for  setting a price for the projects. The government must decide an  ideal price for the three PLTGU's after calculating operational  and technical aspects and the prices of components involved in  each project.  <H5>  Coordinating Minister of Economics, Finance, and Development </H5> Supervision    In view of these considerations, the press asked if a new  contractor is possible, in addition to the three contractors  decided by the government through the "repeat order." "I do not  know and cannot yet say," Sudjana replied.    The minister of mining and energy said that the decision on  who is qualified to get the work is up to Saleh Afiff,  coordinating minister of economics, finance, and development  supervision. The project is funded by foreign loans connected  with the Foreign Commercial Loan Team (PKLN), which is under the  coordination of the coordinating minister of economics, finance,  and development supervision.    "Everything is up to him. If the coordinating minister deems  another new contractor is needed as compensation for the length  of time in bringing the project to realization, that is up to  him. He has the authority to do that," Sudjana said.    When mention was made of losses incurred by the PLN because  of the repeated postponement of a government decision on the  winning tender, Sudjana admitted that the PLN has suffered  losses. The losses have not been very big, however, and have  been limited to loss of time rather than material losses.    "There have not been great losses of time, however. I am  sure  that if we look at the program for the three projects, all that  remains to be done is to proceed with them. The sites are ready  and do not need to be prepared. If everything is ready, that  will save time in catching up. All that will be needed is  assembly, and that will not take long compared with the initial  process, from site preparation to project construction," Sudjana  asserted.    Some time ago, Uno Bintang Sudibyo, chairman of the Electric  Power Studies Program of the University of Indonesia, said that  comprehensive comparison studies should be conducted before  setting a price for the three projects. Whether a project is  cheap or expensive cannot be determined merely by comparing the  total price of the project with other projects built previously  but must take into consideration the details of components that  make up each project.    He said that setting a project price based on each kilowatt  of electricity from a PLTGU that is to be built must be done  through a comprehensive comparison study. Primarily, comparison  must be made with similar projects in other places or other  countries, possibly in Thailand, for example.    As an example, he said the international standard price for  the capital cost of a PLTGU project of three times 600 MW is  $700 per kilowatt. "Thus, the PLN may set a price of $800 per  kilowatt, as long as it conducts very detailed research and make  comparisons with other countries with lower prices before  setting a price," he asserted.</p>

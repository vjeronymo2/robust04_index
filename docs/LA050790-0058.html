			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> ERROR RATES TALLIED ON PRESCRIPTIONS  </P> <P> Efforts to cut U.S. medical costs should leave in place the safety mechanisms  that catch mistakes doctors make in prescribing drugs, says a researcher who  documented hundreds of such errors at a New York hospital. The study in last  week's Journal of the American Medical Assn. found an average of 2 1/2 errors a  day in written prescriptions at 640-bed Albany Medical Center Hospital in 1987.  </P> <P> Doctors at Albany wrote 289,411 prescriptions in 1987, and errors occurred in  905 of them, including 182 mistakes that could have caused severe harm or death  if they had gone undetected, the researchers reported. Mistakes varied from  ordering too strong a tranquilizer for the size or age of a patient to  prescribing penicillin or related drug to a patient who is allergic.  </P> <P> But, said Timothy S. Lesar, assistant pharmacy director for clinical services  and the study's co-author, "all these errors were (detected and) averted. They  never put a patient at risk."  </P> <P> Researchers found higher error rates in obstetrics-gynecology and  surgery-anesthesia than in other services. Error rates were higher among  first-year residents and declined with successive years of training. Mistakes  were highest during daytime hours, when large numbers of prescriptions were  being written, and lowest during evening hours, suggesting fatigue is not a  factor.  </P></p>

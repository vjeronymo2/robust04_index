			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Arabs held after soldiers' deaths FOUR Arab Israeli citizens have been arrested in connection with the killing of three Israeli soldiers at an army camp last month. It is the most serious act of political violence of which Israeli Arabs have been accused in more than four years of revolt against Israeli rule in the neighbouring occupied territories. Mr Ya'acov Terner, Israel's chief of police, said that four men, two of them brothers and one a Tel Aviv university electronics graduate, had confessed to the killings. Mr Terner said they were an isolated cell of the Islamic Jihad fundamentalist organisation and he called on the public not to harm Arab citizens in revenge. 'We must not make generalisations about Israeli Arabs,' he said. Arabs living within Israel, who have full Israeli citizenship and make up more than 15 per cent of the population, have demonstrated in sympathy with the uprising. The killings exposed a breach in army security and shocked the Israeli public. The soldiers were hacked to death with axes and knives. Reuter adds from Geneva: The United Nations Human Rights Commission censured Israel yesterday for human rights violations in occupied southern Lebanon. The UN's principal rights watchdog overwhelmingly adopted a resolution condemning Israel for its actions in the area, including abritrary detention of civilians and the bombardment of villages.</p>

Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi met with Yasir 'Arafat  and Executive Committee members for four days this week in Tunis.    Ghawshah pointed out that the Executive Committee authorized  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who submitted to the Palestinian president a  memorandum demanding that reforms be made in PLO institutions,  to choose members of the national dialogue committee without  intervention from the PLO leadership.    He added that the Executive Committee has agreed in  principle  to set up a special department to develop human resources in the  PLO and admit new capabilities to the planning council  supervising the Palestinian planning center belonging to the PLO.    Ghawshah denied that the Executive Committee members are  responsible for President 'Arafat's monopolization of power and  decisionmaking.    At a press conference held in Tunis the day before yesterday  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi criticized the Executive Committee members,  saying they were encouraging him ('Arafat) by keeping silent  about his continued monopolization of power. But Ghawshah  stressed to AL-HAYAH that he had sent to three Executive  Committee members -- namely Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh, and Sulayman al-Najjab -- an internal memorandum to  President 'Arafat containing four major points to change the  leadership's working methods toward democracy. He pointed out  that the four Executive Committee members returned recently to  attend the committee's meetings after a period of seclusion,  following the president's agreement to their demands, which are:    1. To hold the Executive Committee meetings on the basis of  a quorum, that is half the members plus one (10 members),  considering it the source of decisions, with the possibility of  holding mini-meetings for consultations only, but at which no  decisions should be made.    2. To reactivate the committee following up the negotiations  and consider it the body supervising the negotiation process.  The Executive Committee responded to this demand and decided  officially to revive the committee, which includes Abu-Mazin  (chairman), 'Abd-Rabbuh (deputy chairman), al-Najjab, and  Ghawshah.    3. To submit a detailed report on the financial crisis in  the PLO and to consider the Executive Committee the body  authorized to supervise financial matters in the PLO. Juwayd  al-Ghusayn, chairman of the Palestinian National Fund, pledged  to submit a comprehensive report on financial conditions in the  PLO at the Executive Committee's next meeting.    4. To draft the basic law of the national authority on a  democratic basis and to lay the foundations capable of effecting  PLO institutions.    At the end of last month the Executive Committee devoted  three meetings to discussing the draft fundamental law  (constitution). Then it referred it to Palestinian committees  and institutions inside and in the diaspora to debate it and  express their views.    At another level, Ghawshah confirmed that the Executive  Committee will convene after the delegation headed by PLO  Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi returns to Tunis in  order to discuss Palestinian-Jordanian relations in the stage  ahead.</p>

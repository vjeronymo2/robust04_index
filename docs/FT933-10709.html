			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Singapore restricts Economist circulation SINGAPORE yesterday imposed restrictions on the circulation of The Economist magazine, the latest in a series of moves against the media by the island's notoriously sensitive government. In a statement, the Ministry of Information and The Arts said the government was restricting the circulation of The Economist, which is 50 per cent owned by the Financial Times, to its current level of 7,500 and would reduce it progressively unless the magazine published a letter relating to a story about Singapore which appeared in June. The story concerned the trial of five people accused of breaking secrecy legislation by publishing a government estimate of second quarter gross domestic product growth before it was officially released. Headlined 'Psst - wanna see a statistic?', the article went on to discuss the travails of politicians who oppose the ruling People's Action Party. Singapore's declared reason for restricting The Economist was 'for refusing to print a reply from the government', but the authorities are also incensed by the magazine's occasional levity. The Economist did print two of Singapore's letters replying to the article, but a sentence was omitted from one of them. Yesterday The Economist said it declined to print a third letter because it did not want to publish two letters from the same person and the same organisation in one issue. Last night Mr Bill Emmott, the editor of The Economist, said he did not rule out publishing the letter in a future issue.</p>

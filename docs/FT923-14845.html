			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / India orders audit at four foreign banks INDIA'S central bank has ordered a detailed audit of the treasury operations of the four foreign banks most heavily involved in the securities trading that precipitated the Bombay financial scandal. The Reserve Bank of India is appointing special auditors to look at the accounts and internal control systems within the treasury departments of Standard Chartered, ANZ Grindlays, Citibank and Bank of America. The audits, which come in the wake of a similar scrutiny of Indian state-owned banks most actively involved in securities dealing, are to be completed within a month. The announcement marks the first time that the two large American banks have been officially linked to the scandal, the dimensions of which continue to grow as further brokers are arrested and interrogated. Both Standard Chartered, the British bank, and the Australian-owned ANZ Grindlays have made heavy provisions for losses as a result of the scandal. Bank of America says that its own internal audits have revealed no faulty transactions. Citibank said yesterday: 'We have nothing to hide and nothing to worry about.' The fresh inspection came as a surprise to the foreign banks as the Reserve Bank has already conducted an extensive inquiry into the trading operations of banks in the securities market. The full report of the committee under Mr R. Janakiraman, vice governor of the Reserve Bank, is due to to be published today. Politicians and commentators have, however, been pressing for a fuller inquiry into the operations of the four major foreign banks, which derived a substantial part of their profits from securities trading. In what could be a growing backlash against the foreign banks, press reports have suggested that some foreign banks acquired undue influence through recruiting relatives of politicians or civil servants. Police inquiries are also believed to have prompted the Reserve Bank to take a further look at transactions in the interbank securities market where the activities of brokers have increasingly come under investigation. The inquiries are focusing on transactions between the foreign banks and the domestic banks most deeply involved in the scandal, including State Bank of India, United Commercial Bank of India and Canara Bank. The Reserve Bank said at the weekend that it was focusing on the treasury departments of foreign banks the securities trading of which seemed disproportionately high in recent months.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "hg": "Russia: Finance Minister Wants To </F> Hold Course"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 11 February -- Russia will stick to  the reform course even under the current, more difficult  conditions and will strive for further progress in the  negotiations on restructuring its old debts. This was indicated  by Andrey Kasmin, deputy finance minister of the Russian  Federation, speaking in a series of lectures at the  Reconstruction Loan Corporation [KfW] in Frankfurt. The main  goal of the "medium tough" stabilization policy remains the  further reduction of inflation. There are particular  expectations from cooperation with Germany; in this connection,  Kasmin thinks that the relations with the KfW are more effective  than those with the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development [EBRD] in London.    Furthermore, Kasmin did not want to leave unchallenged the  impression that there is a permanent contradiction between the  policy of the Finance Ministry and the attitude of the Russian  Central Bank. In reality, there is now rather sensible  cooperation at expert level, which is not so much noticed in  public. This exchange is effective, and the parliamentary  committee for supervising the central issuing of loans also has  an influence on the Russian Central Bank.    At the moment, however, the problem consists in  restructuring  the way the Central Bank is constitutionally anchored. In this  respect, one must make certain pragmatic concessions during a  transition period. This also applies to the issuing of loans to  industry by the Central Bank. Here one has to take into  consideration the social interrelationships of the large  industrial and economic institutions. This sets limits for the  restrictive course in monetary and loan policy. Nevertheless,  it is necessary to make a really serious start with  restructuring the real economy in Russia. This is the only way  to ensure a future for the Russian economy. If one follows a  tough course, which will logically be painful, one must keep the  consequences of social dissatisfaction under control. if the  current path is continued, however, and an uncontrolled influx  of money permitted, it is possible to predict that Russian  economy will completely collapse.  <H5>  For the First Time Saving With Positive Real Interest Rate </H5>   Last year financial policy certainly made progress, Kasmin  explained. After all, in December the inflation rate was  reduced to a monthly rate of 13 percent, which, of course, is  still extraordinarily high by Western standards.    However, one has to set this against the background that  throughout 1993 the monthly inflation rate was still between 25  and 30 percent. In addition, the financing of the budget  deficit has been improved, and during the second half of the  year it was finally possible to keep a grip on the development  of the ruble exchange rate. Calculated on the basis of the  dollar, real wages even increased, and at the end of 1993 it was  possible to raise the interest rate for savings deposits of  private individuals to such an extent in nominal terms that,  compared with December inflation, they even achieved a positive  real interest. After more than two years of negative interests,  financial policy certainly has the ambition to bring about a  general trend toward positive real interests, whereby the main  goal of financial policy remains the further reduction of  inflation. The volume of the budget deficit has been brought  down to a rate below 10 percent of the national product.    A certain amount of success was also achieved by means of a  "medium tough" loan policy. After all, it was possible to limit  the volume of the global loans controlled by the Central Bank to  12.8 percent of GNP, compared with 35 percent a year ago.  However, one has to take into consideration the fact that these  loans constitute 85 percent of the total loan volume in Russia.  This shows the weakness of the country's financial and banking  system. It is important to increase the share of loans issued  by the commercial banking sector. Corresponding decrees can be  expected in March. The attempts to establish a financial market  are also showing the first, encouraging results. It has at  least been possible to issue state securities for the first time  -- three- and six-month treasury bills and gold certificates.  Even though only 3 percent of financial resources are raised  via these securities, the most important thing is that it has  been possible to gain credibility for state securities at all.  Financial policy planning envisages a clear increase of such  issues for this year, and work is already being done on the  issuing of medium-term state bonds. After the "child-like  belief" that every city needs a stock exchange, these  institutions are not so important at the moment.    One must also first wait for the continuation of "coupon  privatization." The currency exchange gained ground in the end.  However, the development of the financial markets also requires  the development of the securities markets. The securities  dealers have already developed considerable know-how. In the  end, it is intended to establish a unified securities exchange,  which permits "real time" trade from Moscow to Vladivostok.    In the currency area progress has been achieved by the fact  that, after the dramatic period of confusion in cash circulation  as a result of the uncoordinated behavior of 12 central banks,  it was possible to establish new structures by revitalizing the  idea of a unified currency area. Above all, it is necessary to  develop orderly foreign currency markets in other ruble-zone  countries outside Russia. Russia's foreign currency situation  has been improved by the decree that 50 percent of foreign  currency revenues must be put on the market. Kasmin said that  Russia's foreign assets amount to $4.9 billion. In 1993, gold  reserves went up from 243 to 305 tonnes.  <H5>  Passive Bank for East Europe </H5>   In 1994 further negotiations about agreements with  international financial institutions are planned. Further loan  agreements are being prepared with the IMF and the World Bank.  However, Kasmin's statements indicated disappointment  concerning cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development in London. The EBRD remains "surprisingly  passive," Kasmin noted. A total of 16 projects covering an  overall volume of $1.7 billion are being examined. Relatively  little has been paid of the promised volume of about $174  million for the country's oil industry and for further  infrastructure measures. In any case, the means received are  clearly below the capital share of $56 million, which Russia has  had to pay to the EBRD so far. So far, no progress has been  made at the EBRD regarding the fund for medium-sized industries.    All the greater are Russia's expectations concerning  cooperation with Germany and, in particular, relations with the  KfW. Kasmin expressly paid tribute to the relations with the  KfW and to KfW advice. Cooperation with the KfW is more  effective than with the EBRD. He expressed the expectation that  the bank for medium-sized industries, which is planned in  Russia, will be established this year.    Increased integration in the discussions and agreements of  the G-7 is of particular importance for Russia. Having been  invited to the summit in Naples, Russia can practically be  considered as the eighth member of this group of industrialized  nations.</p>

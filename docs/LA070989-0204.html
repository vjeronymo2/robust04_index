			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEGALIZING VOLUNTARY PRAYERS IN SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Re "Dannemeyer Suggests Top-Level Gay Drift" (July 1): As Rep. William E.  Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) continues his pitiful publicity march against  homosexuals, the family unit, which he contends he's protecting, stands alone  in its effort to maintain the very fabric of its existence. Orange County  families are on a daily battlefront facing the realities of unaffordable  housing, drug abuse, chemical air pollution, inadequate day-care facilities,  deteriorating public school systems and the necessity for two incomes to  survive. Dannemeyer meanwhile, kicks up his heels, tinseled in a gaudy  self-promotion, headlining in his silly savagery against the "pink plague."  </P> <P> A politician interested in making news by spitting bullets at a life style is  missing the target; worse still, he leaves his constituents defenseless in  their crusade against the problems they elected him to combat.  </P> <P> I would suggest that the brave soldiers who are fighting to keep their families  intact, retire Dannemeyer and his fruitless, incompetent efforts and elect a  leader with backbone, one interested in solving real problems, not making them  for his personal glorification.  </P> <P> JEFFREY FLEMING  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

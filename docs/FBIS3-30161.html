The enlarged meeting of the executive committee of the  Cilreco held in Paris charged that the United States was  carrying the tensions on the Korean peninsula to extremes with  provocative acts, while refusing to improve relations with the  DPRK and calling for "sanctions" against it, noted the  statement, and continued:    "The United States has suspended DPRK-U.S. negotiation and  is  zealously pursuing a policy of pressure on and threat to the  DPRK under the unreasonable pretext that the DPRK is refusing to  accept the high-handed demand of the Internatiomal Atomic Energy  Agemcy for inspection.    "The hypocritic attitude of the United States is so  dangerous  that it may lead the situation to a hopeless phase.    "The United States must immediately stop its reckless  attempt  at isolating and stifling the DPRK and come out without delay to  the DPRK-U.S. negotiation for a final solution to the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula.    "The Cilreco calls on world public to watch the U.S.  attitude  with vigilance and put a strong pressure on [words indistinct]  so that it may look straight at the trend of the times and act  with discretion."</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Kuwait KUWAIT's stock exchange reopens on Monday after a two-year closure forced by the Iraqi invasion and the state's subsequent economic and financial dislocation, writes Mark Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent. Shares in 31 companies, including five non-Kuwaiti groups, will be traded during a 2 1/2  hour opening session. The market, which was capitalised at just over Dollars 3bn before the Gulf war, is not expected for several months at least to reach even the lowest pre-war daily turnover, which ranged between Dollars 17m and Dollars 35m.</p>

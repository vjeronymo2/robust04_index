			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Policemen jailed for King beating TWO police officers convicted of violating the civil rights of Mr Rodney King, a black motorist whose beating in 1991 by the men was captured on videotape, were sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment yesterday, Reuter reports from Los Angeles. District Judge John Davies imposed the prison terms on Sergeant Stacey Koon and Officer Laurence Powell after nearly four hours of arguments by prosecutors and defence lawyers. Koon, who directed the beating, and Powell, who delivered most of the baton blows, could have received prison terms of up to 10 years. The judge said he chose a lesser sentence because of the resistance put up by Mr King during his arrest and the negative impact on the police officers' lives from the notoriety of the case. The acquittal of the two men, and two other police officers, on most charges in a state court in April, 1992, sparked three days of rioting in Los Angeles.</p>

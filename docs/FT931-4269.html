			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (17): Supermarket pioneer / Here and on the following pages, John Kavanagh examines electronic trading from the different perspectives of customers and suppliers in the EDI chain - and uncovers the benefits and problems CHECK-OUT operators in a Tesco food supermarket are the only human link in the entire business chain of recording sales, amending and checking stock records, re-ordering goods, receiving and checking invoices and making payment. All these actions are handled entirely automatically and are sparked off by sales recorded at the check-out point. Tesco has been a pioneer in electronic data interchange (EDI) and heads the biggest retail EDI community outside the US. Over 1,200 suppliers, supplying more than 95 per cent of the products on Tesco supermarket shelves, now trade electronically with the company. Almost half these suppliers send their invoices to Tesco by EDI. And a quarter have an even closer relationship, receiving 13-week sales forecasts through the EDI network. Tesco has been using the INS Tradanet EDI service since 1987. During that time it has also installed barcode scanners at most of its 400-odd supermarkets. This combination of EDI and scanning has enabled it to automate its trading from end to end. The check-out terminal records sales of individual items. Every evening Tesco's central mainframe computer system connects automatically to each supermarket computer to retrieve that sales data. The data brings stock files up to date and the new levels determine whether orders should be placed and the size of those orders. The orders are sent through the EDI service to suppliers, many of which can send ba ck their invoices by EDI. The Tesco systems can then produce cheques from the invoices. These payments, too, could be made automatically through EDI if Tesco and other retail chains could come to agreement with the banks (see applications debate, page 18). All this happens without any human involvement. The benefits have been so great that Tesco has given up measuring them - 'benefits? You name it,' says stock management director Mr Dave MacInnis. 'We know for certain that we've reduced stock levels yet improved stock availability and sales, cut lead times on orders, cut administration, improved communications with our suppliers. It's not just EDI that has brought the benefits - it's all bound up with other developments such as barcode scanning - but EDI has been very much the enabling tool.' The benefits are so great that the costs of running EDI through the Tradanet service are 'absolutely negligible,' Mr MacInnis says: 'The basic running costs are covered by our savings on use of the phone, fax and mail. That means we have achieved all the business benefits for nothing.' EDI and scanning have also enabled Tesco to re-organise its distribution, to the benefit of itself and its suppliers. Deliveries from suppliers now go to eight warehouses instead of directly to the supermarkets. The precise sales data gathered each night allows orders to be placed on the warehouses as close as possible to the time the goods will be sold. This means the supermarkets only need hold minimal stocks, so they can devote more space to sales. The number of deliveries is reduced to a minimum, as all goods come from one Tesco warehouse rather than from separate suppliers. And all checking of the quality and quantities delivered by suppliers is done at the warehouses rather than at individual stores. The suppliers benefit by receiving just one order for each warehouse, rather than separate orders from hundreds of stores. Similarly, they only deliver to the warehouses. The savings in their distribution costs give Tesco the opportunity to negotiate better terms. Dave MacInnis reacts sharply to suggestions that Tesco enjoys such benefits from EDI that it has threatened to cut off suppliers which do not sign up. 'We see EDI as a cornerstone in the effective management of our supply chain and those of our suppliers,' he says. 'Our insistence might sometimes come across as bullying, but where do you draw the line between that and saying this is the way we see business going: towards greater efficiency and the elimination of paperwork.' He adds: 'The success of our approach is shown by the fact that we have not de-listed a single supplier or threatened to do so. In a recession some companies are reluctant to invest in a new broom, let alone something like EDI. Yet we've got hundreds of companies which are saving money on traditionally paper-bound activities such as order processing and invoicing.' Around 200 suppliers have yet to sign up for EDI, although most are companies supplying specialist products or services in low volumes, such as fascias for stores. Tesco helps companies get going, not least through a Tesco account team at INS. Dave MacInnis says it takes about six weeks from an initial meeting to get a company 'going live.' TESCO has now started communicating with individuals in its supplier companies through INS' electronic mail service. There are 4,000 electronic mail users in Tesco and they can communicate with 3,000 contacts in 200 suppliers. Dave MacInnis points to the benefits of electronic mail, such as the ability to send reports and memos directly from personal computers and the elimination of problems in trying to telephone an elusive business contact. Tesco is also providing sales forecasts via EDI to over 280 suppliers. It works on sales history data, seasonal factors, local knowledge, planned promotions, load sizes and so on to produce forecasts of up to 13 weeks by product and by warehouse. This helps suppliers schedule production and reduce their own stocks and lead times. Tesco's exploitation of EDI certainly adds a new significance to that can of baked beans about to pass through the check-out. The EDI chain: see page 15</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's last gambit IN THE END the power of a prime minister is the power of dissolution. By making the Tory rebels choose between the Maastricht treaty and the likely extinction not just of the government, but perhaps of their party, Mr Major has played for the highest possible stakes and won. Some argue, wrongly, that this will prove a Pyrrhic victory. True, it has been costly, but it is still far better than a defeat. Yesterday's vote keeps the UK where it should be, inside the European Community. Mr Major has made many mistakes: mistakes over the ERM, over the economy, over political management and over this treaty. For all that, he was right on the essential point. The UK has no future isolated from the powerful economies to its east. Naturally, it has its own traditions, interests and ideas, which are often difficult to reconcile with those of its closest neighbours. But the UK is either in Europe or in limbo. Mr Major understands this. To his credit, he obtained a treaty his party could just about live with and will now be able to ratify what he obtained. His tactics may often have been inept, but the strategy has been correct. The extent of the difficulties the prime minister has faced must also be acknowledged. There is a majority in parliament, however unenthusiastic a majority, for ratification of the treaty. But, as became obvious on Thursday, offered a choice between a treaty without the social chapter and one with it, many Tories who hoped for no treaty at all would vote for the latter option, so depriving the government of its majority. Steep price By turning the question into one of confidence, Mr Major took this option away from the rebels. But the political price he has had to pay is a steep one. Many in his party are embittered by what the prime minister has done, although he will be encouraged that none pushed rebellion to the point of losing the whip and so further reducing his majority. That majority and Mr Major's authority are likely to be further diminished by the Christchurch bye-election. More damage may yet be done by whatever emerges about his discussions with the official Unionists. But at least Mr Major can now focus public attention upon matters other than the tortuous tedium of Maastricht. He can also enjoy the fact that he has come out of this battle better than has Mr Smith, a man who has seemed willing to play fast and loose with his Euro-enthusiast principles. Mr Major may not be a brilliant politician. But he has at least proved a dogged one. The Maastricht treaty is now ratified in the UK, unless, as is most improbable, Lord Rees Mogg's suit against it succeeds. The only remaining obstacle is then the German constitutional court. In all probability, the European Union will soon be born. What might that mean, not just for the EC but also for the UK? Not for many years has the likely future development of the EC been more obscure: the Maastricht treaty has been ratified, but with great difficulty; the ERM, the foundation stone of economic and monetary union, is shaking once again; the parity of the French franc against the D-Mark is under pressure; economic and monetary union looks no more than a distant hope; the European economy is in recession; unemployment appears an intractable threat to social stability; and, last but not least, dreams of foreign policy co-operation are daily belied by the carnage in Bosnia. Immensely risky Faced with this crisis, the central players, Germany and France, may embark on a determined move towards greater integration. Such a response would be far from unprecedented. But it would be an immensely risky course, since it might well fail to win support even in those countries. It would certainly shatter any hopes for peace in the Tory party. It might also disrupt the Labour party. For the moment at least, Maastricht seems as far as the UK is able to go. It is certainly as far as the Conservative party can go. Alternatively, scarred by recent failures, continental politicians may concede the wisdom of a different agenda, one based on enlargement and economic deregulation. If so, the UK would be able to play a more central role than hitherto. It need not be in a permanent minority of one, but may be able to be a helpful participant in the reformulation of Europe's future. But that development, however helpful to the Conservatives, would be disturbing to the Labour party, which has come to embrace the EC largely because of its social programme. Nobody knows how the game will now be played, either in the EC or in the UK. The divisions inside British political parties are at least as deep as over any previous issue. But this is hardly surprising, since the question of Europe determines the kind of polity in which the political game is played. The issue of Europe could still shatter British politics. But it need not come to that. Much will depend on where Europe goes. A British prime minister cannot determine the rules of the European game. But Mr Major has at least kept the UK as a player. For that, he deserves credit.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein waits for clarification Sinn Fein will make no formal response to the Downing Street declaration until it has received the clarification it has demanded from London and Dublin. Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, gave the first explicit confirmation of this stance yesterday, as the party used a Westminster press conference to publish its version of the contacts between the British government and republican leaders. Mr Hartley said: 'Sinn Fein has actually sent a letter to John Major asking for clarification. I think it is obvious Sinn Fein will not make its decision until it gets that clarification.' His remarks leave the UK-Irish peace initiative at an apparent impasse: London has said repeatedly that no clarification of the joint declaration is necessary. Unveiling a dense 47-page document giving details of the dialogue between Sinn Fein and the British government, Mr Hartley also revealed the principles enshrined in the so-called Hume-Adams accord. Mr Hartley referred to three principles agreed by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, during secret discussions last year. These were: That there should be no 'internal' solution (ie within the 'six counties') to the Irish problem. That there should be a right of national self-determination for the people of Ireland as a whole. That it was 'desirable' for unionists to be on board. Speaking of 'a period of political flux,' Mr Hartley said he doubted the Irish situation would ever revert to that before Hume-Adams. 'I think there is a momentum about Ireland now,' he said. 'In a sense, the logjam has been broken.' In its version of the contacts with the British government - which it said stretched back over 20 years - Sinn Fein again insisted that last year's series of messages was initiated by London. An introduction to the dossier - which claims there are further textual errors and bogus messages in London's version of the exchanges - states: 'In the early part of 1993, the British government proposed a series of meetings with Sinn Fein, arguing that an intensive round of such meetings would result in Irish republicans being convinced that armed struggle was no longer necessary. 'They requested a two-to-three week undeclared suspension of operations by the Irish Republican Army to facilitate this. Sinn Fein sought and gained such a commitment from the IRA.' Downing Street last night attacked Sinn Fein for trying to divert attention from its failure to embrace the UK-Irish peace process.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Tory relief as Archer not due at conference Conservative party managers are relieved that Lord Archer is not expected to attend the party conference next month. The millionaire novelist and former deputy chairman of the party, who was recently the subject of an investigation into insider dealing, has been a prominent figure at past conferences. However, party managers are understood to be relieved that he will not be present while questions remain over his role in the purchase of Anglia Television shares. Mr Jeremy Hanley, Tory party chairman, said Lord Archer would not be able to attend next month's gathering in Bournemouth because he was busy with his duties as a working Conservative peer. 'I don't think he is actually coming for the simple reason that the House of Lords are well in session,' he said yesterday on BBC television. 'They have got a running three-line whip and he is a hard working peer.' Lord Archer's share dealing was investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry after a business associate of Lord Archer - whose wife is a non-executive director of Anglia - made an Pounds 80,000 profit. Although Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, ruled that no action would be taken over the deal, Labour MPs have been pressing for a full explanation of Lord Archer's role in the affair. Mr Hanley warned that Lord Archer may have to bow to pressure and make a full public statement when he returns to Britain after a book-signing tour abroad. 'It is very much a matter for Jeffrey. I am not asking him to explain anything. I merely think that the pressures of the press on any individual in our society are such that Jeffrey will find it is probably better to speak rather than not,' he said. Meanwhile, Mr Hanley warned potential backbench rebels that they must adopt Labour's new disciplined approach if the party is to stay in power. He admitted that divisions over Europe had damaged the Tories and urged MPs to rally round the leadership of Mr John Major to defeat the challenge of Labour's Mr Tony Blair. 'I think the discipline of the Labour party is actually something that parties ought to concentrate on. If you have a united party then it is very much easier,' he said. He was earlier forced to issue a retraction after saying that crowd violence at a boxing match was 'just exuberance'. There was chaos on Saturday night during a world championship contest at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre when rival gangs fought and threw chairs. Conservative Central Office issued a statement on Mr Hanley's behalf saying that he 'very much regrets' the impression he gave in a live BBC television interview that any violence in sport could be exuberance.</p>

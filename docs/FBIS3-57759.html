Lobskiy; place  and date not given: "Despite Reductions the Fleet Continues To  Develop"]    [Text] [Lobskiy] Comrade Admiral, how do you assess  the results of your work with the Baltic Sea Fleet?    [Kasatonov] Analogous inspections concerning the course of  combat training are currently being conducted on all four  Russian fleets. Of course, the situation in the Baltic Sea  Fleet has an array of characteristic features, since to meet  with those people and inspect units and vessels, one must leave  the country and pay visit to countries of the near abroad.  However, we did not experience any difficulties; the Latvian  authorities facilitated our work.    In general, inspections of units deployed in Kaliningrad  Oblast and at the Liepaja Naval Base showed that the Baltic Sea  Fleet is well prepared for the new training year, organizational  problems have been solved, and methodological issues have been  examined. The Baltic Sea Fleet has successfully begun the new  training year, and I hope it will end the year the same way.    I visited the Liepaja submarine brigade, and despite the  fact  that the troops are to leave the base soon, the results of  combat training were just brilliant. This happening one more  time merely testifies to the fact that the Baltic Sea Fleet,  despite all its problems and difficulties, maintains  self-control and manageability and efficiently performs tasks of  combat training.    [Lobskiy] Has the Naval Command set any new goals for  the Baltic Sea Fleet for the new year?    [Kasatonov] Of course. In connection with the fact that we  have lost many of our Baltic bases, it is necessary to reexamine  issues concerning communication, combat training, coordination,  and command.    [Lobskiy] The issue of establishing in Kaliningrad  Oblast a unified defense rayon with a joint command, supply  system, etc., has been examined for long time. What is the  opinion of the Russian Naval Command on this issue?    [Kasatonov] Great attention has been paid to issues of close  cooperation among units of the Navy, Army, and Antiaircraft  Defense, in the plans for combat training in 1994. Such work  was conducted before. The command of the Russian Navy supports  the establishment of a unified structure in the oblast, however,  you probably understand that this issue does not fall within our  competence.    Returning to the question concerning new tasks, I will point  out that the Baltic Sea Fleet will have to establish relations  with navies of our former Baltic republics, which are today  sovereign states. That is a very important task for the Baltic  Sea Fleet. The commanders of these countries' navies also  understand the importance of this issue. I met with Latvian  Fleet Commander Zeibots, and I must admit that he expressed his  willingness to initiate a constructive dialogue between our  navies. Certain steps have already been made to establish a  system of secure naval traffic, rescue operations, and early  warning. The results of this work will be defined by the  effectiveness of relations which are currently being established  by the Baltic Sea Fleet Command with representatives of the  Baltic states' navies. The Russian Naval Command is interested  in continuing this work and will render any necessary support.    [Lobskiy] You visited Latvia and met with  representatives of the local authorities, commanders of military  units, and workers. What problems should be resolved immediately?    [Kasatonov] According to reports prepared by commanders of  Liepaja garrisons -- both our commanders and the Latvians --  they have established working relations and jointly solved many  problems. The same can be said regarding relations with local  authorities. However, certain violations of the rights of  Russian-speaking workers and servicemen of the fleet have taken  place. We addressed this issue at a meeting with the head of  the Liepaja Administration, and he promised to take necessary  steps. I will report on this issue to the commander in chief  and the Russian Defense Ministry. If this attitude does not  change, the Russian Foreign and Defense Ministries will have to  apply extraordinary measures.    In general, in my opinion, a wise approach begins to prevail  in the position of Baltic states, and I believe that all the  problems will be solved at the negotiating table. The Baltic  Sea Fleet Command has appropriate experience in this field, and  it skillfully conducts its work in this direction. Speaking  about Russian-Latvian relations, in my opinion, the Latvian side  does not take into account the fact that Russia began to build  those seaports and bases as early as the 17th and 18th  centuries, and that, for example, Liepaja is closely connected  with Russian history. This is the cradle of our submarine  fleet. In this century, Russia has also done a lot to develop  the infrastructure of these cities and seaports. I hope that  these issues will be solved justly and by means of civilized  negotiations.    [Lobskiy] Comrade Admiral, last year, the Russian  Federation Government adopted a program for revival of the  Russian Navy. Does it include a chapter concerning the Baltic  Sea Fleet, and if it does, what is its substance? How will the  fleet look on its 300th anniversary?    [Kasatonov] The military doctrine of our state defines  defense tasks for the Navy, as well. Moreover, the importance  of the Navy's role in the country's defense system will be  increasing, since the number of nuclear warheads and ammunition  deployed in the Navy will increase. Whereas the number of the  Navy's nuclear warheads currently amounts to 27 percent of the  total number of nuclear warheads, in the future, it will climb  to 42-47 percent. Nevertheless, concrete elements of the Navy's  development will depend on the results of economic reform.  Today, the Navy is not only being reformed and reduced, but it  also continues to develop. Recently, several modern battleships  have been launched, and on 21 December, I participated in the  launching of the newest nuclear submarine, the Severodvinsk.    The Navy continues to conduct its regular cruises, patrols,  and visits. Of course, all this is conducted in a different  context than it was five or ten years ago. Today, the Navy  fulfills appropriate international agreements on early warning  of all sorts of incidents, which have been signed with various  countries, conducts joint naval exercises, and pays working and  official visits. This year, similar activities are to be no  less frequent than they were last year.    The concept of naval development in the third millennium is  currently being examined, and what is most important, the  Russian Government and the highest authorities of our state  express their understanding. This allows us to be optimistic as  to the future of the Navy.    [Lobskiy] You know about the problems of the Black Sea  Fleet very well. How do you assess the current situation in  Sevastopol?    [Kasatonov] Certain forces have been trying to entangle the  Black Sea Fleet in political battles. This is the reason behind  its instability, spread of crime, and activation of Mafia  structures and nationalist, extremist forces. The murder of  Captain First Rank Andrey Lazebnikov, a Russian officer, is the  latest evidence of this. Moreover, the situation is not  improving, only further deteriorating.    Whereas Russia has proved its ability to solve the problems  of the Black Sea Fleet, the other side has shown nothing but  ambitions. In accordance with the Massandra agreements, this  issue should be solved this year. If we keep waiting, history  will never forgive us.    [Lobskiy] Igor Vladimirovich, during your visit to  Liepaja, you discussed the possible sale of scrap metal sunk in  Latvian ports. However, the issue remained unresolved.  Unfortunately, a great many material resources are being  wasted, despite the fact that they can be cashed in today.    [Kasatonov] Negotiations on property have been proceeding  since we started our withdrawal. Today, Lieutenant Colonel  Buyanov, a representative of the Central Department of Material  Resources within the Russian Federation Defense Ministry, is in  charge of these issues. Practically speaking, everybody admits  that the current activities are inefficient. However, there are  no appropriate legislative acts, government resolutions, or  other documents. Apparently, such a situation satisfies  somebody.    [Lobskiy] Is there any hope that the situation will  change? After all, the Navy commander has stated that if he had  the right to decide about the fate of the remaining property, he  would not take a kopek from the state coffers to build housing  for servicemen.    [Kasatonov] We have repeatedly addressed this issue to the  Defense Ministry leadership and the government. And we will  continue to do so in the future. However, I am not convinced  that this issue will be resolved.    [Lobskiy] What is your opinion of the reform of the  personnel service structure?    [Kasatonov] The defense minister has issued an order in this  regard, and, as is known, one must not evaluate orders.    [Lobskiy] But, even a preliminary examination of this  document shows that an array of aspects of such work has been  eliminated. For example, there has been no other structure  dealing with the social problems of servicemen. Now, these  kinds of activities will be reduced if not discontinued.    [Kasatonov] Yes, such a threat really exists. However, I  can say that, in a certain amount of time, maybe a year or half  a year, we ourselves will analyze the work of the new structures  and submit our conclusions to the defense minister. I am  convinced that everything will be taken into account. These  structures are to comprise only chief and deputy commanders,  therefore, our job will be to help them organize their work and  draw conclusions.    [Lobskiy] Igor Vladimirovich, how would you comment on  the results of the recent elections in our country?    [Kasatonov] Our country has entered on the path of  democratic development, which has been confirmed by the results  of the elections. Another issue is that we can encounter  certain setbacks and obstacles on this path, and they should be  reckoned with. I believe that the common sense of our people  will prevent any cataclysms.    [Lobskiy] Comrade Admiral, during the tragic events in  Moscow, certain newspapers disseminated a report saying that, on  behalf of Rutskoy, you were proposed to take the side of the  White House. Was that true?    [Kasatonov] Nobody came forward with such a proposal to me.  Probably, because I instantly declared my position: The  president of Russia is the commander in chief. Moreover, it is  immoral to solve political problems by means of military  battles, as the former leaders of the Supreme Soviet did.    Another important lesson coming from these events is that  politicians, civil activists, and authorities should base their  activities on the Constitution. Only such a path will safeguard  the interests of Russia, its economic growth, and stabilization  in society and the Armed Forces. This is a prerequisite for the  effective development of the country and its government.</p>

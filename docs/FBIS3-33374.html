			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Health Minister Henrique Santillo denied having  threatened to resign and said he is not playing the role of a  blackmailer by asking that more funds be allocated for health.    Santillo said he is not planning to leave the government  because he is not against approval of the Social Emergency Fund,  FSE. He asserted that he did his best to convince congressmen to  increase health allocations in 1994, but did not speak against  the FSE. He added that as soon as the FSE is approved, he will  again talk to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and  President Itamar Franco and try to obtain more budget resources:  first, for the hospital assistance program and then for other  Health Ministry programs.    Santillo refuted rumors that he was planning to leave his  position, and added that he will remain at the head of the  Health Ministry until the end of his mandate. [passage omitted]    Education Minister Murilio Hingel said he does not oppose  the  FSE, and he does not plan to leave his position because he  believes in the plan proposed by the government.

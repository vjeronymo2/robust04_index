			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Technology: The chance to shine - The therapeutic benefits of using a 'sophisticated' toothpaste An old-fashioned scouring agent which has cleaned up in the American personal care market is making a comeback in Europe as the latest high-technology ingredient in toothpaste. Toothpaste containing bicarbonate of soda, or baking soda, accounts for 25 per cent of the US toothpaste market. Now European consumers are being given a chance to go back to basics and sample the delights of scrubbing with baking soda, the crystals which conventionally have been used to ensure that boiled cabbage stays green or to deodorise refrigerators. US brand leader Arm &amp; Hammer, whose parent company Church &amp; Dwight of Princeton promotes itself as the baking soda company, making everything from industrial cleaners to cooking ingredients out of the crystals, entered the UK market in January this year. Following the brand's 'Wow]' television advertising campaign, which began last month and concentrates on the taste sensation produced by brushing with a baking soda paste, demand has been phenomenal. 'We reached three-quarters of the month's forecast sales in a week,' reports Melinda Bowles, marketing assistant at Foodbrokers of Portsmouth, which distributes Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste. 'We sold a third of our month's total in a single day.' Arm &amp; Hammer is not being allowed a free run in Europe, however. Elida Gibbs launched its Mentadent bicarbonate of soda brand in Italy in November and it will be on sale in the UK from this month. In the US, Colgate, Crest (from Procter &amp; Gamble) and Aim (a Unilever brand) have also introduced baking soda 'dental pastes', as toothpaste is known in the trade. 'Baking soda toothpaste could be worth 10 per cent by value of the UK toothpaste market,' predicts Steve McNicol, category manager for Elida Gibbs, which manufactures the Mentadent brand. He does not believe its popularity will reach the same heights as in the US, however, where baking soda toothpaste has strong historical connotations and is even rumoured to have helped the Yankees win the American civil war. Nevertheless, Elida Gibbs is planning to spend Pounds 3.2m on promoting its new toothpaste this year. Baking soda toothpaste is the latest in a rush of new toothpaste brands to hit chemists' shelves over the past two years, each claiming to be technologically more advanced at preventing tooth decay and controlling plaque. The launches have followed the realisation by the pharmaceuticals companies that although the market for toothpaste by volume is static - consumers still brush only twice a day - the growth in awareness of dental hygiene has meant that people are prepared to pay a premium price for a technically superior toothpaste. 'Consumers are now looking for more therapeutic benefits and so are trading upwards,' says McNicol. The result is that though volume sales remain steady, in terms of value the toothpaste market is growing by 7 per cent a year overall. As a result, the UK toothpaste market is expected to be worth Pounds 215m in 1994. The demand for advanced protection - the latest night action, tartar control and baking soda pastes - is growing even more quickly and is predicted to grow by 21 per cent this year. The therapeutic benefit of bicarbonate of soda claimed by toothpaste makers is that it helps to neutralise the acids produced by the growth of plaque, the complex microbiological community which builds up on the tooth surface. Neutralising the acid prevents it attacking the tooth surface and causing decay. A further advantage of the ingredient, says McNicol, is that it produces fresh breath. 'It's therapeutic in that it balances the acid and it's cosmetic in that it fulfils the need for a strong taste. So it's addressing both the primary and secondary needs of the consumer.' Not everyone will find the powerful salty flavour of baking soda toothpaste to their liking. 'It's difficult to use in the morning for the first few times, particularly after a heavy night,' admits Bowles. But, she says, consumers who persevere soon refuse to use anything else. Perhaps surprisingly, in spite of its gritty taste, baking soda is the mildest ingredient in toothpaste except water. Arm &amp; Hammer has two strengths of paste, a green minty gel which contains 29 per cent bicarbonate of soda, and a white opaque paste which contains 65 per cent. The Mentadent brand contains 10 per cent bicarbonate of soda, and the manufacturer has added a strong minty flavour to try to mask the salty taste. Both brands contain fluoride, which toughens teeth against decay and which is a general ingredient in toothpastes. The Mentadent paste also contains triclosan, an anti-bacterial agent which reduces bacterial growth and inhibits the metabolism of plaque. If baking soda toothpaste is the European flavour for 1994, 1993 saw the launch of several high-tech toothpastes designed to persuade the consumer to trade upwards. There were pastes which combined cleansing agents with mouthwash and others which claimed to work all night, inhibiting plaque formation and so reducing decay, by working long after the consumer has stopped brushing. Mentadent Night Action Toothpaste, for example, which took more than 18 months to develop, is formulated with a base of calcium carbonate rather than the traditional silica. As well as acting as a physical cleaning agent the calcium carbonate also helps to neutralise the plaque acids because the chalky substance is retained in the plaque and so reduces further attacks. At night the flow of saliva is halted so the active ingredients delivered by the toothpaste in the late night brushing are not washed away, aiding the process. According to McNicol, the real acid test of whether such developments work is whether the consumers are convinced. 'If consumers weren't believers then I don't think they'd buy the products.'</p>

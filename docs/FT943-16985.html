			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Printing price fall not so great Sir, The UK printing industry has maintained its efficiency through recession but prices have not tumbled as Mr Erwin Konigs, of Linotype-Hell, suggests (Technology: 'Death of a craft', June 28). He says 'the price of printing has been cut in half in the past two years or so'. Printers have competed hard during this recession and continue to give extremely good value. Let's not exaggerate, however; today's price for printing ranges from 1990 levels to 5 per cent below that. At the depth of the recession it was 6-10 per cent below the peak touched in mid-1990. We believe this to be achievement enough and would not like to pretend to have done better. Colin Stanley, director-general, British Printing Industries Federation, 11 Bedford Row, London WC1 4DX</p>

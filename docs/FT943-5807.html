			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Bermuda plans tougher rules for insurance market The Bermuda government has announced plans to tighten its insurance regulations, in a move designed to affirm the long-term stability and financial health of its rapidly growing commercial insurance and reinsurance market. Over the last two years between Dollars 4.5bn and Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of capital has been pumped into the island, much of it directed towards the formation of eight new companies specialising in catastrophe risk. The government aims to update a framework developed largely to control an industry dominated by captive companies - subsidiaries formed by industrial and service companies mainly to insure the risk of their parents. The changes, which are expected to come into force by the end of 1995, were announced yesterday by Mr David Saul, the minister of finance, and include a range of tough new requirements. Highly capitalised insurers writing significant amounts of 'direct excess liability' and/or 'property catastrophe reinsurance' will be required to demonstrate minimum capital of Dollars 100m, while some other insurers will also need to show higher levels of capital. Solvency margins - the yardstick which compares net assets as a percentage of premium income and measures the financial health of an insurer - are to be radically tightened. These will be adjusted to levels which in some cases are more stringent than the international norm. The heavily capitalised companies will need to show solvency margins to at least 50 per cent, for example. 'The significant changes that have taken place in the Bermuda marketplace now require change in the insurance regulatory system,' said Mr Saul.</p>

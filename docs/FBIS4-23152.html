			<p>BFN     [Text] President Nelson Mandela and the leader of the  Conservative Party [CP], Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, agreed during  talks in the Union Buildings in Pretoria this morning to  establish a trilateral negotiating forum to discuss an Afrikaner  volkstaat [homeland]. President Mandela said it would be  senseless to hold parallel talks with the Volkstaat Council and  the CP. He said the talks between the government, the Freedom  Front, and the CP would be headed by Deputy President Thabo  Mbeki.    Indemnity for right-wingers, who committed political crimes  since December 1993, was also discussed. At a news conference  after the talks President Mandela announced that Dr. Hartzenberg  would hold urgent talks with Justice Minister Dullah Omar on  indemnity. Dr. Hartzenberg said he wanted to give input on the  bill Mr. Omar was preparing before it went through Parliament.  When asked whether the government was planning to hold talks  with AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene  Terreblanche, President Mandela said the government's door was  open to all who wanted to negotiate, but added that nobody would  be forced to talk to the government.</p>

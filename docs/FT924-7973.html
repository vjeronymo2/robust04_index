			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Comment: One's best is not always good enough - The overall economic impact of what has turned out to be a full-scale Budget A very old trick used by chancellors of all parties when replying to critics of a Budget is to ask: 'Are my critics saying that I have stimulated the economy too much or too little? Should I have borrowed more or less?' This never fails to floor the opposition; and judging by the way Gordon Brown began his reply with prepared, but stale and inaccurately phrased, Labour party cliches, it will be quite effectively used on him. The word 'Budget' is used advisedly. For although the switch from spring to end-year Budgets was not due until next year, the British chancellor, Norman Lamont, effectively presented his 1993 Budget yesterday. It is difficult to see what more he can do next spring, unless there are still further shocks, requiring still further U-turns. Yet there was no one document listing all the measures and their expected spill-over effects of the kind to be found in the Budget Red Book. I worried much less that this omission would give the chancellor an unfairly bad specialist press when he began his monetary section by repeating what he last said at the IMF after sterling had been forced out of the ERM. 'Interest rates are now set according to British monetary conditions - to meet the target I have established for inflation' - with a metaphorical glance over his right shoulder and an emphasis on 'British', which no-one who has only seen the written statement will appreciate. If that is his view, the question arises what he was doing being chancellor for nearly two years up to September operating an ERM policy he now seems so delighted to have junked. My own answer to the standard Budget question is that the chancellor has been insufficiently bold on the fiscal side but could be taking too many risks on the monetary and exchange rate side. It looks as if total spending, or the national income in money terms, will still rise by less than a normal rate; yet much too much of this will be inflation, and not enough real growth. One must accept that the Treasury has made an honest attempt to find ways of stepping up public spending and quasi-public spending (by which I mean private investment committed to public-sector projects) in a way which need not add to public spending in the medium term. I do not mind the creative accountancy involved, as it seems to be valued by the profoundly non-market-oriented business and professional bodies to whom the Major government gives so much attention. But I would scrap the lot for the temporary tax holiday suggested by Peter Jay. Most worrying are the special tax incentives for industrial investment - which contradict the principles of the anti-tax privilege 1984 Budget that Mr Lamont praised and which will be difficult to get rid of in later years. They could have been devised by Robert Reich, Bill Clinton's economic czar designate. The fact that some analysts were simultaneously criticising the chancellor for excessive public-sector borrowing, and for not doing enough to stimulate the economy, strengthens the low-level case for creative accountancy. The projected public sector deficits of 6 per cent of GDP in the present financial year and 7 per cent next year would not be alarming for depression years, if one had more confidence in medium-term monetary and exchange rate strategy. The doubts stand out from the Treasury's own documentation. After several years of recession the official forecasters expect real GDP to rise by only 1 per cent in 1993. This means that the gap between output and productive capacity will carry on rising - which is why I have started writing about depression - and that unemployment will continue to rise. As unemployment is now almost certainly well above the equilibrium rate one would normally expect inflation to carry on falling further. Yet the Treasury expects the underlying fall in inflation, measured by the RPI, excluding mortgage interest, to stall. It is expected to be 3 3/4 per cent in the fourth quarter of both this year and next. Producer price increases - in some ways a better measure of the underlying trend - are expected to accelerate from 2 1/2 to 4 per cent. Only the GDP deflator, which suffers from statistical jinxes, especially in the market price version on which the Treasury has unhappily hooked itself, shows a continuing decline. The most dubious part of the official reasoning is the chart, reproduced here, showing cost and price competitiveness retaining all the devaluation advantages, which makes British products more competitive than at any time in the 1980s. Indeed, another chart shows competitiveness continuing to rise. This can probably be reconciled with the inflation forecasts by some assumptions about improved profit margins. But unless the exchange rate is taken more seriously than the present team is inclined to do, I can see inflation climbing in the 1990s, while output and employment are still at depressed levels. Suspicions are further confirmed by the second in the series of much vaunted explanations of base rate changes, which refers in some detail to domestic monetary indicators, but has nothing to say about the exchange rate, which in principle is supposed to have an equal weight as it had before sterling joined the ERM. As so often, one should be most grateful for the touted measures which the Budget did not contain. There was no attempt to freeze social security benefits. The temptation to make a disguised increase in income tax by raising National Insurance contributions - which must have been considered, as the chancellor had the figures at his finger tips - was resisted. I wish he had also resisted the base rate cut, at least for now.</p>

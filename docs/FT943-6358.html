			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / PIA has applications of 4,000 financial advisers The Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private investor, will today publish figures likely to show that applications from companies and individuals regulated by Lautro and Fimbra have reached 4,000 out of a potential membership of about 5,500, Alison Smith writes. There is less than five weeks to the deadline by which any financial adviser must apply to the PIA for authorisation to remain in retail financial services. The regulator became operational last month. The gap between the actual and potential numbers of applicants has sparked suggestions that there could be a significant fall in the independent financial advice sector, as many now authorised decide not to continue under the PIA.</p>

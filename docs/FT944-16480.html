			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (6): Reason for optimism - Agriculture Returning agriculture into private hands has so far been more of a disruption than a stimulus to production, and has not yet led to the expected revival of a sector which has declined in relative importance but still accounts for about one fifth of gross domestic product and 20 per cent of employment. The dismantling of state co-operatives by government-appointed liquidation committees since 1991 initially brought chaos to much of the countryside. Farm output in 1992 fell by almost 15 per cent but now there has been a reaction to early excesses. 'Co-operative is not a dirty word, no matter how our politicians speculate with it,' says Georgy Tanev, the outgoing minister of agriculture who has been in charge of this sector for the past two years. 'Bulgarians have been used to working in co-operatives for decades. We cannot do without them, at least for another five years,' he adds. He claims it is not just peasants who support new-style co-operatives but many UDF supporters also realise that they cannot survive without some form of rural co-operation. 'The liquidation committees (set up to dismantle the co-operatives) almost managed to liquidate our agriculture, especially stock-breeding,' Mr Tanev says. Some of the committees lacked experience in agriculture and sold off the co-operatives' fodder before returning animals to individual farmers. Animals were also returned before land was redistributed and peasants had the means to feed and breed them. As a result hundreds of thousands of pigs, sheep and cattle have been slaughtered over the past two years. The 1991 land law aimed at the restitution of land to those who owned it before 1946 when the communist regime forced collectivisation on farmers. But about 60 per cent of the new land owners now live in cities and towns and many are unable or unwilling to return to farming. Some work their newly returned plots of land only at weekends, using spades and wooden ploughs. Lack of money and the small size of holdings usually prevent them from using machines. According to Mr Tanev, the average size of the newly returned plots is just 1.6 hectares, too small for modern technology. 'The new land owners have three options: to sell the land, lease it or form a co-operative with other owners,' he says. But no real land market exists yet and leasing the land has not become a widespread practice due to the lack of proper legislation. 'What remains is to form new co-operatives,' says Mr Tanev. He points out that co-operative farms in Bulgaria were not a communist invention. Some have a century-long history. The Souhindol co-operative in central Bulgaria, set up in 1909, is a good example of how such a venture can thrive under market conditions. Through restitution, its property has been returned to the former workers but the re-formed co-operative has developed new meat processing works, bakeries, vineyards, and bought new animals. Representatives of the Bulgarian-American Enterprise Fund recently visited Souhindol and were surprised by its efficient operation. Such success stories indicate that the sector can recover. Another reason for optimism is the fact that the decline in stock-breeding has gradually led to higher meat purchase prices, giving fodder producers and animal breeders more incentives. Powerful private groups, such as Prime Investment Trust, have started positioning themselves in the sector and executive director Ivo Ivanov says the group is preparing a programme for investment in fodder production, flour mills, sugar plants and meat processing. Agriculture ministry experts believe that the 1994 decline in output will be smaller than in the previous three years but UDF spokesmen, along with some western experts, believe that substantial recovery of agriculture will only be possible when people receive full legal title to their land. Only then will smaller plots be sold and consolidated into more viable farms. The free market, and not government attempts to reform the old co-operatives, should be the driving force, they add. It may take another year before land restitution is completed. Early last year, government officials said the land reform plan would be completed by the end of 1993, but this month agriculture ministry sources revealed that only half the farmland had been returned with the full title by the end of September and only 60 per cent will be returned by the end of this year. Meanwhile privatisation of state owned agricultural enterprises is now moving ahead slowly. The ministry of agriculture has opened privatisation procedures for 90 units, but deals have been completed for only 30 so far, including pig farms, poultry farms, mills, machine repair works, and fisheries.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Gaz de France drops 30% to FFr1bn Gaz de France, the state-owned utility, announced net profits of FFr1.1bn (Dollars 184m) last year, a fall of about 30 per cent compared with the FFr1.59bn reported in 1992. The results, achieved after a dividend payment of FFr575m to the state, were based on stable sales of FFr49.1bn. Investments increased from FFr4.9bn to FFr6bn, while debt was reduced from FFr16.4bn to FFr13.2bn. Gaz de France said the results reflected its strategy of increasing productivity and expanding its presence in international markets. Last year, for example, Gaz de France took a stake in Noverco, the principal shareholder of Gaz Metropolitan, which has a substantial presence in Quebec. The French gas company also developed in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, opening representative offices in Kiev and Budapest.</p>

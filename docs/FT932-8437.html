			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Management: Do not underestimate the overtime ban - Reports of a new era of UK industrial co-operation may be exaggerated Most managers must rate industrial relations as the least of their current worries given the virtual disappearance of strikes. But the absence of strikes does not necessarily mean a contented workforce. Currently conflict-free industrial relations appear to result more from worker compliance than from co-operation with management. The UK has seen important changes in industrial relations over the past decade, with many observers now talking of the 'new industrial relations'. One of the most important features of NIR is the decline in strike incidence since the mid-1980s. There has also been a reassertion of managerial prerogatives, the death of the closed shop and a slump in trade union membership. According to some, we have moved from an era of industrial conflict to one of co-operation, with workplace relations no longer characterised by 'them and us' attitudes, but simply referred to as 'us'. The evidence on strikes is fairly clear cut. Fewer working days were lost due to strikes in 1992 than in any other year since records began a century ago. There were only 240 officially recorded strikes last year, less than a 10th of the number 15 years ago. But other evidence suggests that the NIR label may be somewhat misplaced. A strike has two basic elements: an unsatisfied grievance and an ability to strike. The reduction in strike activity must have resulted from either a decline in unsatisfied employee grievances and/or a decline in the ability to strike. If advocates of NIR are correct, then a fall in the level and intensity of grievances must be the more important explanation. There are at least three points to make against the NIR case. The most obvious is the current spring of discontent, with industrial action at the Timex electronics plant in Dundee, on British Rail and buses, in the pits and in schools. Evidence has also emerged that the official record of strike activity does not tell the whole story. Alongside the contraction in strike frequency was a shift in favour of the overtime ban. Using information collected by the CBI Pay Databank survey of manufacturing pay negotiations, research at the London School of Economics* has revealed that, on average in the period 1979-89, overtime bans were twice as likely to occur as strikes. This was not the case throughout the economy, however, as public-sector workers have continued to favour strikes over non-strike action. Why did employees turn increasingly to overtime bans to pursue their grievances? Contributing factors include: the role of the law which concentrated, before 1988 at least, on stamping out strikes and largely ignored non-strike forms of action; leaner production systems, such as just-in-time and other techniques which made an overtime ban more effective; and high unemployment which appears more effective in discouraging strikes than overtime bans. The common thread is that the overtime ban provides a relatively low-cost way for workers to express their dissatisfaction. A final piece of evidence on worker disquiet concerns the use of dispute procedures. The recently published Acas report for 1992 reveals that the statutory advisory and conciliation body was busier than ever last year. Between 1976 and 1988 the use of collective conciliation closely followed the pattern of strike incidence. But, since then, the paths have diverged. As strike incidence has plummeted to an all-time low, the number of conciliation requests has stayed stable at around 1,200-1,300 a year. The number of individual conciliation cases shows a more marked trend upwards. Last year Acas received more than 72,000 requests, up 12,000 on 1991. In part, this increase results from the recession, since most conciliation cases concern claims for unfair dismissal. But it must also result from a decline in workers' ability to pursue disputes in any other way. The decline in strike action is welcome. But it results largely from the most disaffected employees no longer being able to take strike action, rather than from an absence of grievances. The fact that some dissatisfaction is still being expressed through non-strike industrial action and the use of Acas suggests that the foundation of NIR is workplace compliance rather than co-operation. Compliant employees may be sufficiently productive when labour markets give management the upper hand. But, when (and if) unemployment starts to fall, the absence of a co-operative spirit may lead to problems of employee turnover, absenteeism and a lack of effort. The ball is firmly in the managerial court and has been languishing there for some time. High-trust employee relations take time to develop and the necessary initiatives must be employer led. * Discussion Paper 136 available from the LSE. Tel. 071 955 7801. Free.

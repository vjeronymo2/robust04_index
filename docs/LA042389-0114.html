			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN STILL FEELS 'VINDICATED' DESPITE AWARD CUT IN HUDSON CASE  </P> <P> Marc Christian said Saturday that despite a Superior Court judge's decision to  reduce the award in his suit against Rock Hudson's estate to $5.5 million, he  still feels "vindicated" by the award.  </P> <P> A jury had awarded Christian, Hudson's former lover, $21.75 million in punitive  and compensatory damages against Hudson's estate and Mark Miller, the late  actor's personal secretary, deciding that Christian suffered extreme emotional  distress after learning that Hudson had hidden the fact that he had AIDS.  </P> <P> On Friday, Judge Bruce R. Geernaert reduced the award of compensatory damages  from $14.5 million to $5 million, and the punitive damages from $7.25 million  to $500,000.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased," Christian said Saturday. "The punitive award would have  been nice if it stayed at $1 million. But I think the judge did us a big favor  because it reduced the other side's causes for appeal."  </P> <P> At the end of the five-week trial in February, Christian said he brought the  suit because people have a duty to tell their sexual partners that they have  AIDS.  </P></p>

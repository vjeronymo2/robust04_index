			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Doboj, April 20 (TANJUG) -- In Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Moslem units continued Wednesday [20 April] attacks on Serb  positions and settlements in the broader area of Doboj, northern  Bosnia, said Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) military sources. The  sources said Moslems fired 82 mm and 120 mm mortar shells,  infantry arms and rifle grenades on the Serb defense positions  northeast of Doboj. After the Serb side's response, in which  several trenches were destroyed, the Moslem activity ceased.    Serbs in Doboj have for days been exposed to strong mortar  and artillery fire, but although the Serb side suffered many  casualties, the world public, including UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force], did nothing to prevent the plight of the Serb civilian  population. In the Teslic war zone, south of Doboj, the Moslem  formations stepped up provocations, mostly using infantry and  anti-aircraft weapons, and regrouped. The Serb forces did not  respond to occasional provocations by the Moslem forces which  used infantry arms in the Mt. Ozren war zone.    It was quiet in the night of Tuesday-Wednesday along the  whole length of the confrontation line at Brcko, in the Sava  river region, the Serb military sources set out. The same  sources also said Serb reconnaissance parties observed the  arrival of fresh Moslem forces. This was an indication that the  Moslems did not abandon attempts to cut the R.S. in two at this  point in the Sava river region. Minor provocations by the  Croatian forces were recorded in some parts of the front near  Orasje, in the Sava river region.</p>

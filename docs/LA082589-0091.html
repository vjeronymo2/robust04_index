			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY HELPS E. GERMANS MOVE TO WEST;  </P> <P> BUDAPEST GRANTS MORE THAN 100 'HUMANITARIAN' EXIT PERMITS  </P> <P> More than 100 East German refugees, granted "humanitarian" exit permits by the  Hungarian government, arrived in West Germany on Thursday.  </P> <P> The East Germans had been holed up in the West German Embassy in Budapest for  the past 11 days, refusing to get out until they were granted permission to  leave for the West. Their presence in Budapest had caused considerable friction  between Hungary and East Germany, with the West German government caught in the  middle.  </P> <P> Diplomats here said that Hungary's approval of the East Germans' departure --  via chartered plane to Vienna, with documents issued by the International  Committee of the Red Cross, and then by bus to a camp near Nuremberg -- would  not improve relations between East Germany and West Germany.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Last Holdouts  </P> <P> The refugees were the last holdouts in the West German Embassy in Budapest when  Bonn ordered the embassy closed because of overcrowding. Bonn had done the same  thing with its missions in East Berlin two weeks ago and in Prague on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Hungary indicated that its action was a special case, worked out in  negotiations with the West German government and the Red Cross in Geneva.  </P> <P> Ordinarily, Hungary does not let East Germans leave on West German passports  issued in Budapest, on the grounds that there is no entry stamp in the  passport.  </P> <P> Under the West German constitution, all East Germans are entitled to West  German citizenship, but the West German passport does not guarantee passage out  of a Communist country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 800 Camped on Border  </P> <P> At present, about 800 East Germans are camped out in Budapest trying to find a  way out to the West. Hundreds of others, "on vacation" in Hungary, have  congregated near the Austrian border hoping to cross there because of relaxed  frontier controls.  </P> <P> Across the border in Austria, tourists have been gathering to watch and cheer  the fleeing East Germans.  </P> <P> About 3,000 East Germans have reached Austria from Hungary since May, when the  Budapest regime began dismantling the wire fences that define the border with  Austria. Another 5,000 are said to have been caught by Hungarian border guards  and sent home.  </P> <P> In Budapest on Thursday, officials said Hungarian frontier guards stopped  hundreds of East Germans from crossing into Austria the day before. Under an  agreement with East Germany, Hungary is required to stop people from crossing  into Austria.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vacation Ban Reported  </P> <P> The East German government on Thursday denied a report in the West German  newspaper Die Welt that East Germans would be prohibited from taking vacations  in Hungary as of Sept. 1 because of the exodus.  </P> <P> "The East German leadership will, in the future, treat Hungary like a Western  foreign country for travel purposes," the paper said.  </P> <P> But an East German spokesman said that travel to Hungary would continue to be  permitted. Every year, about 2 million East Germans go to Hungary for  vacations.  </P> <P> The East German government accused the West of engaging in "trade in human  beings, and people are being illegally shipped out."  </P> <P> In Bonn, the West German government said that "efforts for a practical solution  for those East Germans still in Hungary and wanting to emigrate will continue."  But West German officials admitted that they expect no improvement in the  status of East Germans seeking refuge in West German missions in East Berlin  and Prague.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Kamal] </F>   [Excerpt] ROSE AL-YUSUF has obtained a new document  detailing the extent of the Muslim Brotherhood's secret action.  A report published by the "Orphan Child Project in November  1993" indicates that the Muslim Brotherhood distributes some 12  million pounds annually. The project, which is reported to be  the Muslim Brotherhood' new secret organ, covers 20  governorates, and their expenditures have risen by 300 percent  over the last three years.    According to the document, which bears the name "The  Republic  Report," the number of the Muslim Brotherhood's committees  increased by 17 during this month. The committees are taking  care of 154,043 orphans. Some 121,144 children receive a  monthly payment of 10 pounds.    The project is being implemented by the Muslim  Brotherhood-controlled Shari'ah Society through official  channels. Those following up the project said it will allow the  Muslim Brotherhood to be associated with some 150,000 children,  who will later become sympathizers of the group. [passage  omitted]</p>

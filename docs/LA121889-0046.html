			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN MODERATES SCORE GAINS BUT HARD-LINER IS REELECTED  </P> <P> Moderates scored gains over the weekend in Iranian elections seen as the first  test of popular support for reformist President Hashemi Rafsanjani in his  campaign to overhaul the economy.  </P> <P> To the delight of the radicals, however, fiercely anti-Western Ali Akbar  Mohtashemi, a middle-ranking cleric, was returned to Parliament for one of  Tehran's four seats, winning a valuable platform for his militant stance on  both foreign and domestic issues. But Mohtashemi's victory appeared to be an  isolated one. The election results suggested that support is waning for the  radical camp opposed to the market economy pursued by Rafsanjani's government.  </P> <P> Hard-liners won a majority in the general elections of June, 1988, and have  dominated the 270-seat Majlis.  </P> <P> Mohtashemi's election did mark a comeback for the 43-year-old Islamic  fundamentalist.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists, dumped Mohtashemi and  other hard-liners in August, when he formed a Cabinet dominated by technocrats  designed to revitalize Iran's economy after last year's cease-fire in the war  with Iraq.  </P> <P> Mohtashemi is allied with Ahmed Khomeini, son of the Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini, the late revolutionary leader.  </P> <P> A total of 64 candidates ran for nine seats in Friday's by-elections. The four  winners in the provinces were relatively unknown figures.  </P></p>

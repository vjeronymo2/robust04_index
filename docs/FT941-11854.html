			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / A tough climb in Silicon Glen: James Buxton asks if the Scottish electronics industry is equipped for long-term survival Elegant electronics factories set in landscaped parkland, producing personal computers, mobile telephones or microchips, have replaced smokestack industries such as steel and shipbuilding as the mainstay of Scotland's manufacturing industry. For the government, the Scottishelectronics industry is one of its successes of industrial policy. It accounts for 40 per cent of Scotland's exports. But questions are being raised about whether Silicon Glen has the resilience to survive changes sweeping the international electronics industry. Critics charge that it is an artificial creation, consisting largely of branches of foreign-owned companies lured in by government grants, and showing little capacity for spontaneous growth. After expanding by an average of 16.5 per cent a year in the 1980s, the industry's output hasnot grown since 1989. Its weaknesses have been crystallised in arecent report by Monitor, the US management consultancy, which warned that if nothing were done to strengthen the industry plants would close or contract and employment might, as early as 1997, fall to about 27,500 from its present 45,300. The report has produced alarmist headlines, and the gloomy findings were probably overdone. But Mr Alastair Macpherson, former head of the electronics division at the now defunct Scottish Development Agency, the government's economic regeneration organisation, says: 'What the report said couldn't have come asa surprise to anyone. All that's happened is that it is no longer taboo to talkabout problems which were recognised in the late 1980s. What's needed is a change in government policy.' In the past four decades the government's policy has been to encourage inward investment by global companies such as IBM and Compaq, which make personal computers, Motorola, which makes mobile telephones and microchips, Digital (computers and microchips) and NEC (microchips). They have regarded Scotland as a relatively low-cost manufacturing base for the EuropeanUnion market. But few of these multinationals carry out research, development and marketing in Scotland. The main exceptions are NCR, which makes cashdispensers in Dundee and markets them worldwide, and Hewlett-Packard, which develops telecommunications testing equipment in South Queensferry. In addition, few of them have significant links with indigenous Scottish suppliers, which have won only 12 per cent of the market for subcontracting and components. The Monitor report, commissioned by the SDA's successor, Scottish Enterprise, says the Scottish electronics 'cluster' is thus weaker than those of some other countries. Unlike, for example, in Singapore or Ireland, the UK government has not picked particular sub-sectors, such as software, and encouraged companies which concentrate on them. The report adds that companies, universities and investors, such as venture capitalists, have not been integrated in the typeof network that has generated innovation in Silicon Valley, California, or Massachusetts. This, it says, has meant the region has lacked the ability to respondto market opportunities. Further, the consultants believe, global trends are working against Scotland. As product life cycles shorten, software is becoming more im-portant in product design. But Scottish industry is heavily oriented towards hardware. Not only does the Scottish electronics industry have structural weaknesses, but the report suggests it cannot rely on a fresh influx of investment to fuel future expansion. It will face strong competition from low-cost manufacturing bases in eastern Europe, while development of Scotland's transport and telecommunication links may have lagged behind other parts of western Europe. The picture, based on research carried out in 1992 and 1993, may be unduly pessimistic. Foreign companies are still setting up in Scotland: Exabyte, which makes computer tape systems, last week announced plans to open a factory employing 100 in Falkirk, central Scotland. In spite of difficulties at its parent company, IBM's Greenock plant is not shedding labour; and Compaqis taking on 250 extra staff at its plant near Glasgow. Mr John Dolan, Compaq's head of European logistics, says: 'A lot of multinationals have improved their productivity since Monitor came to Scotland, and if it came back now, it would revise its opinion.' A mark of the seriousness with which the Scottish electronics industry views its problems was an agreement by local branches of multinationals to co-operate with each other and with indigenous companies in setting up the Scottish Electronics Forum in October 1992. Their objective isto strengthen the industry. Co-operation of this kind is unprecedented in Scotland. But Mr John Ward, the resident director of IBM in Scotland and chairman of the SEF, says that intensified global competition means that a multinational plant in Scotland must compete for survival against other plants in the same group. 'It is in the interests of a plant in Scotland to strengthen its links with local suppliers and win as much product development work as possible in order to differentiate itself from the company's other plants,' he says. 'So anything that can be done to improve the Scottish electronics industry should help the SEF's individual members.' The SEF's 30 members include multinationals and smaller local companies. It is addressing problems common to all members - such as occasional blips in the local electricity supply. It is also looking at how members could share training of junior employees to avoid duplication; build better links between assembly plants and subcontractors; and exploit the research work of Scottish universities. But despite the goodwill behind the SEF, it is evident that the multinationals may go only a little way towards full co-operation in an attempt to revive the industry. Mr Ward acknowledges that multinationals will make strategic decisions according to their own interests. If it is up to the indigenous companies to spur a revival, the record is not particularly encouraging. Multinationals provide big opportunities for local companies to assemble products under contract, but only two or three Scottish companies have exploited this market on a large scale. Many in the electronics industry believe the government itselfshould do more to remedy the weaknesses of the electronics industry. One is Mr Martin Ritchie, who runs Spider Systems, an Edinburgh-based company with Pounds 20m turnover which designs its own computer networking systems. He says government policy is skewed towards encouraging foreign companies to set up new plants. 'I might, with a great deal of effort, be able to get a Pounds 100,000 grant from the Department of Trade and Industry to develop a new product. But if I was a foreign company promising to create several hundred jobs in Livingston I might get Pounds 4m.' Mr Finlay Mackenzie, a retired manager of Hewlett-Packard's SouthQueensferry plant, says the government ought to encourage multinationals to putdown deeper roots by giving them financial incentives for R&amp;D. He says the Queensferry plant is a good example: 'It is dependent on British brains; it is not something that can be whisked away at the whim of someone elsewhere in the company.' So far there is no sign that the government is planning to change its approach to inward investment. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, says the report is 'helpful' but adds that 'better founded predictions can be made'. He has left it to Scottish Enterprise and the SEF to deal with the specific threats to the industry. But warnings about the future of Silicon Glenhave led many in the industry to believe that the government needs to rethink its attitude to inward investment, to focus less on job creation in the short term and more on building a sustainable industry that can prosper in the longer term.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SCOTTISH ELECTRONICS: OUT OF TUNE  --------------------------------------------------------------------- The top high-tech employers Company            Location            Products              Employees  --------------------------------------------------------------------- IBM                Greenock            PCs &amp; monitors            2,300 Motorola           East Kilbride       Semiconductors            2,000 Motorola           Bathgate            Cellular phones           1,600 NCR                Dundee              Auto teller machines      1,600 Digital            Ayr                 Workstation &amp; PCs         1,550 National Semi      Greenock            Microchips                1,300 Hewlett-Packard    S.

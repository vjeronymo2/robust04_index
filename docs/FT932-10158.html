			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Confusion over Belgrade border ban BOSNIAN Serb leaders yesterday accused their former Belgrade patrons of barring them from leaving their self-styled state. In often conflicting statements, officials of the self-proclaimed Serb state, which covers some 70 per cent of Bosnia, said Serbian police had refused to allow them to cross the frontier. The ban, if confirmed, would signal another move by the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, to punish the Bosnian Serbs for refusing last week to toe the Belgrade line and support an international peace plan. Just hours after they rejected the plan, Serbia announced it was cutting off all supplies, except for food and medicine to Bosnia. Serb-held parts of Bosnia, devastated by war, depend almost entirely on Belgrade. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said: 'We are just sad. We know they are squeezed and blackmailed.' Mr Dragisa Jokic, his aide, speaking from Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold, said: 'The president did not even try to cross the border. But we received notice from the police that our ministers were banned from crossing.' But an official of the Yugoslav Interior Ministry denied the ban, reported Tanjug, the Belgrade news agency. Even an aide of Mrs Biljana Plavsic, a hardline member of the leadership, who first claimed to have been blocked at the border, said: 'It is just confusion.' Mrs Plavsic, who at Pale publicly snubbed Mr Milosevic by refusing to shake his hand, said border police had handed her a notice which said officials were not allowed in. 'They said they were sorry, but they could not let me cross into Yugoslav territory,' Tanjug reported Mrs Plavsic as saying. Mrs Plavsic managed to cross but did not reveal how she reached Serbia.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Markets: Cheer for RMC and Redland - The Bottom Line GERMAN manufacturing industry may be in the midst of the worst recession since the end of the second world war, but the news for shareholders in some of Britain's biggest building materials groups remains positive. Both RMC, Europe's biggest concrete and cement producer, and Redland, Europe's biggest roof tile maker, reported strong first-half results from German operations, buoyed by the strength of the housing market in east Germany in particular. Redland, which reported a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 108m earlier this week, has a 51 per cent stake in Braas, Germany's biggest roof tile manufacturer. Operating profits from German operations rose to Pounds 56.2m from Pounds 41.1m a year earlier and represented over 46 per cent of total operating profits. Robert Napier, Redland's chief executive, argues that the German roofing market has been 'de-coupled' from the rest of the economy thanks to immigration, higher household formation and growth in housing activity in east Germany - including repair of existing housing stocks which are generally in poor condition. Napier backed his optimistic outlook with figures showing an 18 per cent increase in residential building permits during the first-half which, given that some are for apartment blocks with flat roofs, should convert to a 9 per cent increase in second-half pitched-roof house-building. The figures do not fully reflect the sharp increase in building activity in the east where residential single and two-family building permits grew by 208 per cent in the first half and multi-family permits jumped by 359 per cent - allbeit from a low base. This east German weighting is particularly important to RMC Group which is half-way through a Pounds 500m investment programme in its east German cement operations. In the first-half, RMC's German operations contributed operating profits of Pounds 50.4m (Pounds 40.5m) on sales of Pounds 654.6m and helped offset declines elsewhere in Europe, particularly in France and Spain. Although the cost of RMC's Berlin investments were reflected in higher net interest charges of Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 18.5m), the group also benefits from tax breaks for investing in the east which are not fully reflected in its reported 26 per cent tax charge. The tax breaks flow from the merger of the group's east and west German operations in April which enabled RMC to take advantage of substantial German tax reliefs and incentives available on current and future investment in eastern Germany. But not all UK building materials companies stand to gain from the east German construction surge. As NatWest Securities analysts noted, although the radiator market in Germany is stable, the boiler market was down by over 10 per cent in the first half affecting Blue Circle's Celsius operations. Other companies, such as Pilkington, straddle the two halves of the German economy - construction and manufacturing. Pilkington's Flachglas subsidiary has managed to defend its leading position in the architectural glass market, but profits from automotive glass sold into the deeply depressed German motor industry have fallen. There are also some doubts among analysts about how sustainable the boom in German construction will be. For example Mike Betts, of Goldman Sachs, is forecasting that Redland's profits from Germany will peak at Pounds 150m this year and could fall to Pounds 96m in 1997, Pounds 76m from west Germany and Pounds 20m from the east. Betts argues that the 'normal' relationship between interest rates and the housing market does not seem to apply in Germany and that therefore the eventual reduction in German interest rates would be bad news for the German housing market. By that stage most companies are hoping for a rebound in UK profits from their cyclical lows. In the interim those building materials companies like RMC and Redland which have invested in building up a strong market postion in Germany still look like they have backed a winner.</p>

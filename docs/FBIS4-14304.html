			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait City, 26 Apr. (KUNA) -- An authoritative  source from the Foreign Ministry today denied a report published  by the London-based AL-HAYAH on the existence of Algerian good  offices to clear the atmosphere between Kuwait and Iraq, on an  alleged meeting between Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations at an Arab  embassy, and on a linkage between these allegations and [Foreign  Minister] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir's current tour of  sisterly Arab states in North Africa. In a statement to KUNA,  the source also expressed Kuwait's rejection of any linkage  between Shaykh Sabah's tour with the message sent by the  president of the Iraqi regime to the Algerian head of state.    The source said that "while Kuwait denies the report  published by the London-based AL-HAYAH, it would like to  emphasize that Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's tour of sisterly Arab  states aims to bolster relations between Kuwait and these  states. It also falls within Kuwait's policy of aiming to  consolidate ties between Arab brothers to strengthen the Arab  stance." The source also indicated that Kuwait's relations with  Iraq are governed by the UN resolutions that Iraq must adhere to  instead of pursuing blatant attempts to flout them and refusing  to implement them.    In today's edition, AL-HAYAH published a report which it  attributed to a source close to the Algerian Foreign Ministry  who stated that "Algerian endeavors are being made to clear the  atmosphere among Arab brothers." The paper reported that the  source "did not rule out the possibility of Algerian mediation  between Kuwait and Iraq." The paper added that reliable sources  had disclosed to AL-HAYAH that "a Kuwaiti delegation has held a  meeting with an Iraqi delegation at an Arab embassy."</p>

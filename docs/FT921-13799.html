			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / 'Serbs would leave independent Croatia' SERB leaders from Croatia yesterday promised that Serbs would not remain in an independent Croatian state. Mr Goran Hadzic, leader of the self-proclaimed Serb region in eastern Croatia, said: 'Serbs from our region, at the price of our lives, will not remain in independent Croatia.' His remarks coincide with heightened tensions in Bosnia-Hercegovina over plans to hold a referendum on independence for the republic of 4.4m people. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia, said parliament would approve the proposed referendum later this week. Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs, who oppose independence, said: 'The referendum will be for Bosnia's Moslems and Croats, because the Serbs have already chosen to remain in Yugoslavia.' The federal military, which has substantial munitions and air force industries in Bosnia, sharply opposes the referendum. A letter signed by the 'officers and soldiers' of the Banja Luka corps, western Bosnia, at the weekend 'demanded' that the 'only acceptable question was: are you for a sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina within the framework of a new Yugoslavia?' The Serb-dominated army and Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, are planning to form a rump Yugoslavia which would include Bosnia and Montenegro, Serbia's closest ally. But Mr Momir Bulatovic, Montenegro's president, said at the weekend: 'It is realistic that only Serbia and Montenegro would remain together in a common state.' Meanwhile, both Croatian and Serbian media yesterday reported sporadic violations of the latest ceasefire, brokered by the UN on January 3.</p>

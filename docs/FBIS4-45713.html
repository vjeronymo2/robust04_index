			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F> "Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations"]    [Text] Robert Atkins, Minister of State for the Environment  and Countryside, today announced a new set of Regulations to  tighten controls of transfrontier shipments of waste.    The Regulations were laid before Parliament on Monday and  will come into force on 6 May 1994. They supplement the  provisions of the EC [European Commission] Waste Shipments  Regulation, which comes into operation on the same date.    In a written reply to a Parliamentary Question from Nigel  Waterson MP [Member of Parliament] (Eastbourne), Mr. Atkins said:    "The Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1994, laid  before Parliament on Monday, will come into force on 6 May when  Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 on the supervision and  control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the  European Community (the "Waste Shipments Regulation") applies.  The Waste Shipments Regulation implements the obligations of  the Basel Convention which, together with the EC, the United  Kingdom ratified on 7 February and to which it will become a  Party on 8 May. The EC Regulation is directly applicable, but  additional domestic legislation is required to give full effect  to some of its provisions. For the UK, this additional  legislation is contained in the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste  Regulations 1994.    "The Regulations designate Waste Regulations Authorities in  Great Britain and District Councils in Northern Ireland as the  competent authorities of dispatch and destination, for imports  and exports to and from the UK, and designate the Secretary of  State as competent authority for transit shipments, and as  `correspondent' for the purposes of the EC Regulation. Other  provisions include conferring powers on customs officers to  assist competent authorities in carrying out their functions by  detaining shipments where appropriate; and specifying offences  and penalties relating to compliance with the Regulation. The  Regulations also provide for the preparation of a waste  management plan (in accordance with the Waste Framework  Directive).    "Public consultations were carried out in March on a draft  of  the Regulations and of accompanying guidance. The Regulations  have been modified to reflect the concerns and interests of  industry, local authorities and the public in response to those  consultations. The Government is satisfied that these  Regulations will enable the UK to fulfil its obligations under  the Basel Convention, and contribute significantly towards  securing the environmentally sound management of waste movements  to and from the UK."  <H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>   The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Basel  Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of  Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal provides a framework for  states to control movements of hazardous waste. Parties to the  Convention may ban imports of waste, and shipments are not  allowed between Parties and non-Parties without specific  (bi-lateral or multi-lateral) agreements. Where shipments do  occur, the Convention provides for a global system of  environmental controls in which the onus is on the exporting  state to ensure environmentally sound management of the wastes.    The UK, together with the EC, ratified the Basel Convention  on 7 February, and will become Parties to the Convention on 8  May. The EC Waste Shipments Regulation (259/93), which  implements the obligations of the Basel Convention in the  Community, will apply on 6 May.    The new Regulation, which supersedes the existing EC  Directive 84/631/EEC, as amended (implemented in the UK by the  Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1988), will enable  the UK to exercise strict controls over imports and exports of  waste. The EC Regulation is directly applicable, and therefore  does not require transposition into national legislation, but  some additional domestic legislation is required to give full  effect to some of its provisions. These matters are covered in  the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1994.The main  provisions of the new Regulations are:    --designation of competent authorities and "correspondent";    --discretionary powers for competent authorities of dispatch  to require notifications of shipments of waste from their area  to be routed through them;    --enforcement powers for competent authorities to ensure,  where appropriate, the return of waste to the UK, or to secure  the environmentally sound disposal or recovery of waste;    --to require a certificate relating to financial guarantees  to be obtained prior to shipments into and out of the UK;    --powers for customs officers to detain shipments in order  to  assist competent authorities in carrying out their functions;    --provision for the preparation of a waste management plan  (in accordance with the Waste Framework Directive);    --offences and penalties;    --powers for the Secretary of State to request information;  and    --various transitional provisions and revocations of  superseded legislation.

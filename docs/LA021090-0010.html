			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GOOD LIFE IN BEVERLY HILLS  </P> <P> We are disappointed that David Farrell in his article, "Town That Tells Time on  a Rolex" (Part A, Jan. 28), did not delve a little further into the reasons for  the Beverly Hills teachers' strike in a community described as "a symbol of the  finest in life, of quality and social refinement."  </P> <P> Your readers might have been interested to know that two years ago the  residents were asked to vote on a minimal parcel tax to maintain the  educational standards and programs for the children and competitive teacher  salaries.  </P> <P> The measure requiring a two-thirds majority failed to pass.  </P> <P> The $600,000 pledged by parents has to date only totaled $200,000. Each  teacher, aide and classified employee will receive a 1% payment from the money  this year. Class size has risen in the elementary and middle schools. Many  teachers are struggling with 27 and 28 students in a room. We find it difficult  to believe that this number is 10 fewer than similar classrooms in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> It is hard to understand why a community which has a minimum welfare system, no  hospital, let alone a museum, concert hall or sports arena, cannot afford to  support its own school system about which it is so proud.  </P> <P> A condominium owner may call the town a "fairyland" but unless she and the rest  of the residents of Beverly Hills vote for the new parcel tax planned for the  June 5 ballot, the present schoolchildren and future generations may have to  come down to Earth and face the reality of a severely curtailed school system  and its consequences.  </P> <P> JULIE SWANSON  </P> <P> BEATRICE FARBER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (8): New faces in Ottawa - All change in the corridors of power / Bernard Simon identifies the up-and-coming names to note Compilers of the federal government telephone directory have had to change an unusually large number of entries since the last edition was published in April 1993. The new Liberal cabinet, which took office after last October's general election, is the most obvious change in the corridors of power in Ottawa. But it is no means the only one. The Bank of Canada has a new governor. For the first time, a woman holds the job of Clerk of the Privy Council, the most senior position in the federal civil service. Names of several government departments have been changed. More than two-thirds of the 295 members of parliament returned in last October's general election are newcomers. Furthermore, the way that business is done in Ottawa has undergone some changes since the Liberals came to office. 'The previous 10 years were government by the friends of (former prime minister Brian) Mulroney,' one lobbyist says. He adds that the Liberals have so far been 'very open and very forthcoming. They're not willing to talk about 'I scratch your back, and you scratch mine'.' The Liberals have launched top-to-bottom policy reviews of such contentious and wide-ranging areas as defence, social security and transport. Some lobbyists report that politicians and civil servants are calling on them as the new government feels its way. Mr Jean Chretien, the prime minister, has discouraged cabinet members from assembling the large political staffs which became a fixture of ministerial offices during Mr Mulroney's tenure. While decisions were channelled through a maze of ministerial committees and a pyramid of advisers during the Mulroney years, the centre of power in Ottawa is now a small group of senior cabinet members. Besides Mr Chretien, the group includes Mr Paul Martin, finance minister; Mr Lloyd Axworthy, human resources minister and Mr Roy MacLaren, trade minister. Any important decision involving Quebec is likely to have the stamp of approval of Mr Andre Ouellet, the wily foreign affairs minister. Though Ms Sheila Copps was renowned as one of the Liberals' most forceful debaters on the opposition benches, she has yet to make a mark as deputy prime minister. She also holds the environment portfolio. One consequence of the leaner political decision- making process is that senior civil servants have regained some of the clout they lost during the Mulroney years. The most influential department heads include Mr David Dodge (finance), Mr Jean-Jacques Noreau (human resources development), Mr Harry Swain (industry), Mr Allen Kilpatrick (international trade) and Mr Reid Morden (foreign affairs). 'The number of people you have to talk to is still relatively small,' says Mr Tom D'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, a big business lobby group. Nonetheless, life has changed for the army of lobbyists which sprang up in Ottawa during the 1980s. Liberal ministers and MPs have put out word that they prefer to deal directly with companies and individuals seeking favours, rather than with professional arm-twisters. Many lobbyists' work now centres more on research and advice than directly pleading clients' cases. But some of the firms which were most successful at opening doors in the Mulroney years remain widely respected. They include Hession Neville &amp; Associates, and Parker Norquay, whose head, Mr Rob Parker, has the unenviable job of representing the interests of Canada's tobacco companies. At the Bank of Canada, Mr John Crow was replaced last February as governor by the less prickly Mr Gordon Thiessen. Mr Thiessen was formerly senior deputy governor, acting in effect as the bank's chief operating officer. Perhaps the biggest change is in the House of Commons, where two of Canada's three national parties, the Progressive Conservatives and the left-of-centre New Democrats, were all but annihilated in the election. The opposition benches are now filled by two regional parties - the Bloc Quebecois, whose 54 MPs are all French-speaking and all from Quebec, and the Reform party, all but one of whose 52 members represent constituencies west of Ontario. The BQ has so far proved to be a more effective and cohesive opposition than the Reform party. Although their concerns are centred on Quebec, BQ members have carved out a left-of-centre position on some national issues, such as social security reform. But the Liberals have so far had the field largely to themselves. With all these changes, anyone planning to do business in Ottawa would be well advised, as a first step, to pick up a copy of the government phone book. The Government Telecommunications Agency has just produced a new edition that incorporates the comings and goings of the past six months.</p>

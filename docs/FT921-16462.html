			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Soaring prices leave Russians in the cold A HEAVY snowfall, which emptied Moscow's streets and made those who dared to venture out all the more vulnerable, seemed an appropriate accompaniment yesterday to the harshest economic reform Russia has seen in decades. Instead of the usual crowd of Muscovites scurrying to work with their ubiquitous shopping bags, just a few people braved the snow, suggesting that Russia was taking a second day off in addition to the new year public holiday. But with authorities and citizens alike braced for the worst as President Boris Yeltsin freed prices after 74 years of Communist controls, many shops were closed, allegedly for stocktaking. If they were open, the state stores were largely empty - either of customers frightened off by new prices, or of goods because suppliers had not delivered. Prices increased by far more than the 100 per cent which the government predicted for the first month without controls. And it did not release any extra stocks to help limit the increases. Lena, an art historian, on her shopping trip stopped first at her local supermarket, Gastronom number 44, in the same Stalinist skyscraper which houses the Ukraine Hotel. On offer was champagne at Rbs121 a bottle and lots of low-grade sausage at Rbs59 a kilo. Complaining that until recently such sausage cost just Rbs2.20, Lena, who has been earning Rbs500 a month (close to the average monthly salary) walked straight out. Zhenya, a cashier, shrugged her shoulders. 'If nobody buys then I suppose we'll have to lower the prices,' she said. But her boss, Mr Boris Strukov, the shop manager, said that January was always a 'bad month' because people always built up large stocks just before New Year's Eve. Was Mr Strukov afraid that people could come to turn their shock into anger? Yes, he said. That was one reason why he no longer stocked vodka, since late last year a group of angry shoppers had surrounded a truckload of the stuff demanding that he sell it to them instead of the industrial workers for whom it had been reserved. Lena agrees about the importance of the stocks. Although she has a number of foreign friends with access to well-stocked foreign currency shops, Lena feels vulnerable because as a member of the 'intelligentsia', she shuns queues and consequently has few reserve supplies. Nor does she have access to the supplies available to factories. Next stop, a bakery in Leningrad Prospekt, a co-operative shop selling her favourite Georgian bread, turned out to be closed for the holidays. At another bakery the cheapest white loaves were selling for Rbs1.08, up from 30 kopecks. Lena bought one loaf as a small queue quickly formed behind her. Then on to the peasant market - where prices have long been high and goods abundant - for vegetables. But the doors of the covered market near Profsoyuznaya (Trade Union) Street were also closed, with only pensioners and other small-time speculators touting items which have been missing from state shops for months, such as bags of coffee. They cost Rbs140, said one old lady. At another supermarket the usually well stocked grocery section was sealed off. 'The suppliers haven't delivered,' said one assistant. Only bread was for sale, and a sign said people could not buy more than 2kg each. Upstairs, shampoo was an astronomical Rbs24. Still, Lena bought a bottle, ending her first day of market-priced shopping. Up to 90% of Muscovites 'will fall below poverty line' Page 2 How to sell raincoats to Russians Page 6</p>

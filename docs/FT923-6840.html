			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Letter: Feather bed candidates and culture Sir, There was a splendid contradiction on your Leader page on August 19. Your Leader records how Japan's economic managers have (albeit you think unjustifiably) been able to watch the stock market fall to 35 per cent of its one-time value with equanimity and only now resort to marginal fiddles to help banks adjust. Below that, in Personal View, Sir Alan Walters and George Guise explain how South Africa's industrial financing system - extensive share cross-holdings, with takeovers virtually impossible - is the source of that economy's inefficiencies. South Africa's corporations will never pull their socks up until the stock market assumes central importance and becomes a market for corporate control, not just for income-flow rights. Where have they been during the short-termism debate of the past five years? The South African system is almost a replica of Japan's. It is precisely the peripheral importance of the stock market to the real economy that explains the equanimity of Japan's economic managers. Freed from the fear of takeovers, industrial managers can concentrate on the long term; they can keep, not lay off, their human capital when share prices are tumbling, while continuing to invest. That is why 'recession' in Japan means growth below 3 per cent. Can it be that Anglo-Saxons need the spectre of takeover artists to make them efficient? Give Anglo-Saxons a feather bed and they immediately lie on it? But give one to a Japanese and he works harder so as to look forward in better conscience to bedtime? I hardly think Walters and Guise would be the ones to resort to such a leopards-and-spots cultural argument.

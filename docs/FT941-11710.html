			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Six consortia to bid for West Coast rail study Six consortia have been shortlisted to carry out a feasibility study for the Pounds 500m modernisation of the main west coast railway line, Railtrack, the company which will manage British Rail's track, announced yesterday. More than 40 groups bid to carry out the study into improvements to the 480-mile line linking London with Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, including re-signalling and straightening the route, said Mr Gil Howarth, Railtrack's director of major projects. Railtrack did not name the shortlisted consortia, but they are understood to include the following: Sir Alexander Gibb, an engineering consultancy, with Brown &amp; Root, engineering and construction; Eurorail, a consortium of Trafalgar House, the construction and engineering group, BICC, communications and cabling, and GEC, electrical systems; Kennedy &amp; Donkin, an engineering consultancy, with Laing, the construction company, and Ansoldo Trasporti, an Italian engineering company; ABB, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group with Amec, a construction company. Railtrack expects to award the feasibility study contract by early April for completion in nine months. It will then call for tenders for a contractor to carry out the upgrading work, which is expected to take five years in two phases. One company which did not make the shortlist said it believed its bid had been rejected because it had proposed changes to the terms of the tender. It was unhappy that it might not benefit from its proposals for improvements in the study because another company might win the upgrading contract. Mr Howarth was speaking at the launch of a week-long series of roadshows expected to attract up to 1,500 directors and senior managers of construction, engineering and rail equipment companies including many non-UK groups. Railtrack will have Pounds 500m to spend on improvement schemes this year rising to Pounds 600m next year and Pounds 750m in 1996/97. These are 'considerably larger' amounts than those previously available to BR, Mr Howarth said. Passenger transport executives and local authorities will contribute an additional Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m a year to local rail improvements. Railtrack expects to carry out about 5,000 projects a year, of which 200 will be worth Pounds 500,000 or more each.</p>

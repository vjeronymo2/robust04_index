			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Waigel says no to Emu subsidies GERMANY'S finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, rejected suggestions yesterday that European Community members should be subsidised to help them meet the economic targets set as a condition for taking part in European monetary union (Emu). He also promised to set a good example of the necessary self-discipline when he tables his own budget on July 1. 'Member states need constant pressure from the convergence criteria in order for them to make the necessary adjustments at home,' the minister told a conference in Frankfurt. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said it would be prudent for a future European central bank to set monetary goals and minimum reserve requirements for banks. Mr Waigel said there was no mention of a convergence fund in the Maastricht treaty, which established the ground rules for economic, monetary and political union by the end of the decade. Subsidies to help poorer members meet the criteria could be counter-productive. He had already proposed his measures for controlling Germany's rising deficits, and gave assurances that his budget package for 1993 would be no more than 2.5 per cent higher than that for 1992. Mr Waigel will today discover how much help he can expect in his much-vaunted 'hard-as-nails' budget policy at a meeting between leaders of the ruling coalition and the opposition Social Democrats. The main aim of the talks, which follow further setbacks for the mainstream parties in elections in Berlin at the weekend, is to reach an understanding on financing economic recovery in the east. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank stood by its own strict criteria. Mr Otto Issing, the central bank's chief economist, said there would be no change in its money supply growth targets, which come up for review this summer. Revision would undermine the bank's credibility and arouse 'mistrust', he told a Bundesbank seminar. He acknowledged the rapid expansion of the broad M3 measure, up 8.8 per cent in the first four months of this year compared with the bank's target corridor of 3.5-5.5 per cent. The Bundesbank had to bring them closer into line, he said. Even so, he added, the target was only a 'rough guide' and in the past had been met only around 50 per cent of the time. However, according to Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the bank's vice-president, expansion of the money stock and the current 'far too high' rate of inflation ruled out any interest rate reductions 'in the foreseeable future'. Speaking in Singapore on Monday night, he said an inflation rate of 2 per cent must again become the benchmark for the next few years. Recent pay deals of around 6 per cent were still not satisfactory in terms of anti-inflation policy, although Mr Waigel's plans for controlling public spending were the correct course. Inflation during May is expected to be steady at around 4.5 per cent on an annual basis. A drop to below 4 per cent is widely expected in July, when excise duty increases imposed last summer drop out of the reckoning.</p>

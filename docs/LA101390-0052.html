			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BOOK OF J' LACKS NERVE TO NAME 'J';  </P> <P> THE BOOK OF J. TRANSLATED FROM THE HEBREW BY DAVID ROSENBERG; INTERPRETED BY  HAROLD BLOOM. GROVE WEIDENFELD. $21.95; 340 PAGES  </P> <P> Harold Bloom has a lot of nerve, but then again he may not have quite enough.  "The Book of J," his commentary on David Rosenberg's punning, experimental  translation of portions of the Old Testament books of Genesis, Exodus and  Numbers, is both less and more than it seems.  </P> <P> It is less than it seems when the distinguished Yale literary critic writes, at  the end of his introduction: "I am aware that it may be vain labor, up Sinai  all the way, as it were, to seek a reversal of twenty-five hundred years of  institutionalized misreading. . . . Yet the Book of J, though fragmentary, is  hardly Mr. David Rosenberg's creation or my own. All I have done is to remove  the Book of J from its context in the Redactor's Torah and then to read what  remains. . . ."  </P> <P> The lay reader may be excused if he takes away from that paragraph the mistaken  impression that "The Book of J," though not Bloom's creation, is at least his  discovery. The inconvenient truth is that nothing in biblical interpretation is  more thoroughly "institutionalized" than the notion that the Bible -- and in  particular the Pentateuch -- is an edited work.  </P> <P> The use of the letter J as the scholarly tag for the oldest of the four  documents that after editing became the Pentateuch, is itself a century old.  The letter stands for Jahve, the German spelling of the name later re-spelled  in English as Yahweh. Not even the separate publication of the Yahwist document  is a new idea. In 1968, Peter Ellis published the Jerusalem Bible translation  of J, with commentary, as "The Yahwist: The Bible's First Theologian" (Fides).  </P> <P> Bloom does not deny any of this. But to put it kindly, he is not, as we say  these days, "up front" about it. Among those who seem to have been misled we  must count his publisher.  </P> <P> Bloom's major claim to originality, however, is not the isolation of J but the  discovery or invention of "The Author J," to whom he devotes the first 60 pages  of this book. "As we read any literary work," he writes, "we necessarily create  a fiction or metaphor of its author. That author is perhaps our myth, but the  experience of literature partly depends on that myth. For J, we have a choice  of myths, and I boisterously prefer mine to that of the biblical scholars. I  will put all my cards on the reader's desk here, face up. My J is a Gevurah  ("great lady") of post-Solomonic court circles, herself of Davidic blood, who  began writing her great work in the later years of Solomon, in close rapport  and exchanging influences with her good friend the Court Historian, who wrote  most of what we now call 2 Samuel."  </P> <P> Boisterously, let me suggest that Bloom's most important card is not on the  reader's desk at all. Bloom has lifted the notion that the author of J may have  been a woman from Richard Elliott Friedman, of UC San Diego, who proposed it in  1987 in his book "Who Wrote the Bible?" (Summit). Bloom cites this work in  passing but does not credit Friedman for the provocative hypothesis that Bloom  has placed at the center of his own work.  </P> <P> Does this mean that Bloom's work is without originality? Not quite: "The Book  of J" is a work of modest, if truncated, originality. Its method is circular  and unabashedly subjective but, in my view, legitimate and, on occasion,  brilliantly brought off.  </P> <P> Bloom infers a personality for his "great lady" from what she has written;  namely, the received "Yahwistic" source of Pentateuch scholarship. Then,  allowing the inferred personality to feed his imagination, he reads the text  again and allows himself to notice what he might at first have missed. The  text, now more deeply and artistically understood, further specifies the  imagined personality of the author.  </P> <P> This method leads Bloom to four principal assertions:  </P> <P> 1. J and Yahweh are both in love with David. In another Pentateuchal source,  man is created in the image and likeness of God. In Bloom's J, Yahweh is  created in the image and likeness of Israel's exuberant founding monarch.  </P> <P> 2. J and Yahweh are decidedly cool toward the stiff and stammering Moses and  oddly detached, even ironic, toward the Mosaic religion. "The Yahwist herself  is not a Yahwist," Bloom writes.  </P> <P> 3. David aside, J and Yahweh respond more to vigorous women than to even the  most vigorous men. "There is a grand hardness in J's women," Bloom writes, "in  Sarai, Rebecca, Rachel, Tamar, and Zipporah, a hardness that perhaps J found in  herself, or in Solomon's mother, Bathsheba. . . ."  </P> <P> 4. J and Yahweh are cool not just to Moses but also to the Israelite rank and  file. They are aristocrats, in a word; their affections go to the chosen among  the chosen: "A lifelong monarchist, as I read her, a distruster of priests and  people alike, she had more faith in David than in Yahweh."  </P> <P> More than can appear in such an enumeration, these are earned insights. Bloom  may go perversely to those verses that most critics find peripheral or even  undecipherable and ignore those verses, even in J, that most critics find  central. The result, nonetheless, has impressive internal coherence. Bloom's  essays "The Representation of Yahweh" and "The Psychology of Yahweh" present a  god with a daylight clarity that can be stunning.  </P> <P> And yet there is, even on Bloom's own aesthetic and free-wheeling terms, both a  structural weakness in his work and, as noted, a failure of nerve.  </P> <P> Bloom never asks after the overall aesthetic effect of the removal of those  other materials that were combined with J by the ancient redactor. We may grant  that their removal throws J into relief. What else does it do?  </P> <P> The fact is that this removal produces an effect rather like that of an opera  cut to just the arias or a film with all the dissolves and fade outs, all the  continuity, eliminated. Looked at one way, J without the rest of the Pentateuch  is clean and masterful narrative; looked at another way, it is just "Bible  stories" for children. Bloom writes, intuitively (and defensively): "We need to  be like wise children in reading or listening to J, because her mode, and not  just in the primeval history of humankind, is like a more sophisticated kind of  children's literature than we now possess." There is a question here that needs  more attention than Bloom has given it.  </P> <P> So much for the structural weakness. The failure of nerve is Bloom's failure to  see how directly his evidence suggests that his "great lady" is Bathsheba. The  wife of a Hittite and almost certainly a Hittite or a Canaanite herself,  Bathsheba -- as a nubile young woman -- seduced the much older David even as  Tamar, the Adullamite, seduced the older Judah. If Bathsheba is Bloom's J, we  need not wonder that her sympathies tend so powerfully toward Tamar, that  earlier Gentile who forced her way into Israel's destiny and whom Bloom calls  "of all J's heroines . . . the most revelatory of J's identity . . . the most  memorable character in the Book of J."  </P> <P> No wonder, either, that David's wife should be so in love with David as to take  him as her model for the personality of God. Or that this foreign woman should  look with such studied coolness on Moses and on the fiercer, more moralistic  strand of Yahweh-worship that he represented.  </P> <P> As we read in 2 Samuel, Bathsheba did not blush when she asked whether Abishag,  David's last concubine, was still a virgin after he had begun to sleep with her  (she was). It is entirely possible that this indomitable queen mother survived  her son Solomon as well as her husband, taking herself -- quite as Bloom  suggests -- as the model for all those "hard" women of her own patriarchal  narratives, not least for the two -- Sarai and Rebecca -- who make impolite  jokes about the sexual limitations of elderly men.  </P> <P> And finally, once her hapless grandson Rehoboam has betrayed the Davidic  legacy, who better than the queen mother to weave regal indignation into the  warp and woof of Israel's foundation myth? It all fits. Why does Bloom,  otherwise so acute, fail to see it?  </P> <P> He fails, in my view, because he has an agenda in "The Book of J" which  requires the repudiation of the very insight that made his reputation in "The  Anxiety of Influence." In that book, Bloom taught us that a literary successor  can escape the humiliation of being merely a successor by a "strong misreading"  of his predecessor, strong misreading being the kind of deliberate, calculated  error that brings new truth into view.  </P> <P> In "The Book of J," by sharpest contrast with "The Anxiety of Influence," Bloom  wants history to stop. The earliest stratum of Yahwism is the only one worthy  of consideration. No strong misreadings here. All successors, beginning with  Moses, are seen as weak "misreaders," mere corrupters.  </P> <P> But are they so in fact? Bloom, Yahweh's psychoanalyst, cannot fail to see the  intrinsic interest in watching God's character change as the rest of the Hebrew  Bible comes into being. But then can that process halt at the end of the Hebrew  Bible? What is there to prevent Israel's masterpiece from becoming, as Bloom  bitterly puts it, "the Protestant Bible, in which the Hebrew Scriptures dwindle  down to that captive prize of the Gentiles, the Old Testament"?  </P> <P> The New Testament is, of course, the strongest, most outrageously successful  misreading in history. If Bloom had the nerve to honor that misreading in the  same spirit in which he honors Tamar for winning "a central place in the story  that she was not born into and so had to usurp for herself," then he could also  recognize all the greatness that intervenes -- the greatness of Moses, not to  speak of Jeremiah (whom he professes to despise) and Isaiah and Job. And if he  had the nerve to do all that, then he might have the nerve to face the  implication in his own research that the Hebrew Bible was a Gentile captive in  its opening moments; that as perhaps only Bloom would ever have the nerve to  put it, Bathsheba invented Yahweh.  </P></p>

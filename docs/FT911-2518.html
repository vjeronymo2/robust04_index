			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Arts: Today's Television Among those interviewed on BBC2's weekly Assignment (7.45)is the French President Francois Mitterrand, no less. It is quite a coup since this is the first television interview granted to British television in all the (nearly) 10 years he has been in office. He talks to David Walter about France'sstanding in the world, the future of Europe, and his own politics which, he claims, are still left wing, despite appearances to the contrary. Other interviewees include the right winger Jean le Pen and chef Paul Bocuse. Episode 2 ofCivil War, C4's account of the momentous events in 17th century England, comes to the actual fighting and considers the way that groups of all sizes, from families to entire nations, were split down the middle (8.00). If you hate snooker and loathe comedian Jim Davidson be sure to avoid BBC1's new game show Big Break (8.30) since Davidson is the presenter and snooker the central activity. Second episode in the excellent series A Secret World Of Sex (9.50 BBC2) deals with pornography and prostitution in England in the years before World War II.

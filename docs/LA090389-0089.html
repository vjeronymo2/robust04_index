			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOMBSTONES CONTINUE TO TURN UP;  </P> <P> DELIVERIES TO CEMETERIES COME FROM DEFUNCT BUSINESS  </P> <P> The Mystery of the Missing Tomb Markers deepened Saturday.  </P> <P> Four grave markers from Valley Memorials Lodge Monument Co. of Encino, which  went out of business without warning 12 days ago, have turned up at a  Chatsworth cemetery.  </P> <P> And a North Hollywood woman who purchased a marker from the company said  Saturday that it had appeared at a cemetery near her home.  </P> <P> The appearances cast more darkness than light on the circumstances surrounding  the closure of Valley Memorials.  </P> <P> Bewildered, grieving customers began showing up at the company's offices last  week, looking for tomb markers that they had purchased.  </P> <P> Sixteen markers were dropped off 12 days ago at Mt. Sinai Mortuary in  Hollywood. Officials said they were left without the proper papers,  authorizations or fees to cover placement of the stones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4 Dropped Off  </P> <P> Norman Ruppert of Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth said Saturday that four  markers were dropped off there a week ago, with a check signed by David Lodge,  who identified himself as president of Valley Memorials.  </P> <P> Ruppert said he had contacted two families who apparently paid for the markers  to be placed in that cemetery.  </P> <P> Ann Butler of Burbank said she had spoken to a David Lodge on the phone a few  days ago and had pleaded with him to bring her deceased husband's marker to  Valhalla Memorial Park. "I didn't know where it was, but I just cried and cried  to him," she said.  </P> <P> The grave marker showed up the following day at Valhalla, she said. "I'm glad  it showed up, but it was a hard week dealing with that."  </P> <P> She said her husband died in March, and she paid $500 for the marker and  placement fees.  </P> <P> She said she still may have to pay the cemetery for the marker's placement.  Attempts to reach Lodge on Saturday were unsuccessful.  </P></p>

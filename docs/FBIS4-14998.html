			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, April 5 (LETA) -- It is completely out of  question not [as received] to sign one separate accord out of  the number of agreements which have been initialed in Moscow in  early March, for the agreements made a whole inseparable  package, said Edvins Inkens, the Minister of Special  Assignments, in a statement which was to be understood as the  government's reply to an appeal submitted to President Guntis  Ulmanis by a nationalist parliamentary faction "Tevzemei Un  Brivibai" ("For Fatherland and Freedom"). The faction demanded  canceling of the agreement on issues concerning social  protection of retired Russian militaries and their families,  initialed by the Latvian delegation at Latvian-Russian  intergovernmental talks.    The opposition faction claims that the agreement would pave  the way for retired Russian militaries to stay and keep living  here safely, as it was earlier demanded by the union of war  veterans' rights protection.    The Presidium of the Saeima [parliament] on Tuesday [5  April]  decided to include the debates on the appeal of the opposition  faction into the agenda of an extraordinary session of the  parliament due to be held next Friday.</p>

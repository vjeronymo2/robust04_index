			<p>BFN     [Text] One of the communist party leaders Anatoliy  Kryuchkov speaking at a rally in Moscow's Kalyzhskaya Square has  backed up a proposal by chief of the Russian Communist Party  Viktor Anpilov to hold a national strike on May 3rd to mark  seven months since last October's parliamentary uprising.    For his part, leader of the Union of Communists Aleksey  Prigarin called for next year's May Day celebrations to be held  in a Soviet state. On last October's events, he said "the  government neither wants nor is capable of leading the country  out of crisis." He denied that the present regime had become  stronger since. The regime is on the brink of an abyss and that  is why it has started to talk about civil peace, Prigarin said.  By contrast, he said, the opposition has built up its muscle  though it is not strong enough yet to be able to lead most of  the farmers, workers and intellectuals.    The rally involved prominent opposition leaders such as  chairwoman of the former Soviet Union's parliamentary leadership  Sazhi Umalatova, Ilya Konstantinov of the National Salvation  Front, Communist Party leaders Gennadiy Zyuganov and Anatoliy  Lukyanov, leader of the Russian National Union Sergey Baburin  and chairman of the Union of Communist Parties Oleg Shenin.    As the marchers went along Leninskiy Prospect in  southwestern  Moscow, a man was spotted on the rooftop of an adjacent building  throwing down anti-communist leaflets.    Police have begun searches for the man while the marchers  tore apart the leaflets describing the action as provocation,  our corespondent reports from the scene.    Earlier, similar leaflets were thrown down from the top of a  building in Tverskaya Street during a demonstration arranged by  the trade unions in Moscow.    The demonstrators marching along Leninskiy Prospect stopped  close to Gagarin Square, the scene of last year's violent  clashes between police and protesters, to keep a minute's  silence in memory of the victims. Red flags were lowered and  several flowers laid on the roadside.    Speaking over a loudspeaker, communist party leader Viktor  Anpilov promised that "time will come when police will appear on  city streets without truncheons or automatic guns, but this is  impossible under the present regime." On his proposal,  anti-Yeltsin slogans were chanted.    One of the leaders of the Working Russia Movement Vladimir  Gusev called on the demonstrators to take a vow to the fallen  opposition members that "we will defend our Soviet state" and  win the cause that "our friends have died for."    Our correspondent says that none of the speakers mentioned  that Vladimir Tolokneyev, member of riot police, was the only  dead victim from last year's clashes. Leader of the National  Salvation Front Ilya Konstantinov told our correspondent that  although he mourned about all victims dying in violent clashes  last May and October, "it must be realized that the opposition  tried to defend itself." At the same time, he admitted that  Tolokneyev's should have been mentioned.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: High interest rates help Procordia to 8% rise PROCORDIA, the Swedish food and pharmaceutical group, increased profits by 8 per cent in the first nine months to SKr3.33bn (Dollars 554.62m) from SKr3.08bn. The group benefited from a big increase in net interest income, as a result of the high level of Swedish interest rates, and a strong performance from its Kabi Pharmacia unit. Sales and operating income climbed 1 per cent to SKr29.16bn and SKr2.98bn respectively. Kabi Pharmacia improved operating income by 17 per cent to SKr1.94bn, while sales surged 13 per cent to SKr9.71bn. The acquisition of the Italian group Pierrel accounted for 7 per cent of the increase. However, sales dipped in the third quarter after health-care authorities in some of the group's key markets cut their expenditure. Pharmacia Biotech fared badly, with operating income down 37 per cent at SKr49m. The company blamed falling exchange rates in important markets. Income at Procordia Invest fell 51 per cent to SKr180m, mainly because its involvement in hotels has produced heavy losses.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Companies House wins appeal case Companies House, the govern-ment's corporate information depository, yesterday an-nounced that it had won a significant legal victory in attempts to impose its penalties for the late-filing of company accounts. The organisation, which is an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry under the Next Steps programme, won on appeal a court case against an arbitration. A company - Livepine - had initially succeeded in overturning a Pounds 100 late-filing penalty after it missed the deadline when Companies House rejected the accounts it initially submitted. The company had failed to sign the directors' report in its accounts, and argued in its defence that this was not required under section 242 of the 1985 Companies Act. However, the Basingstoke court demanded that the fine be paid, arguing that the wider context of the act required that the report must be signed. Companies House allows companies submitting incomplete filings 14 days to make modifications and re-file the accounts to avoid penalties. Most companies have 10 months after their financial year-ends during which to file. Late filing penalties were introduced in 1992 in response to politicians' concerns over the high proportion of companies filing many months after the legal date had expired. Last month Mr David Durham, chief executive, told the Commons committee on the parliamentary commissioner for administration that Companies House had handled 65,000 disputes since the regime was introduced - the volume of calls and letters was greater than he had anticipated. Mr William Reed, the parliamentary commissioner - or ombudsman - said he had completed examinations of two cases concerning Companies House in 1993 and a further six were still under investigation. By that time, 164,000 penalties had been imposed on companies, generating fines of Pounds 33m, which are remitted to the Treasury. The annual administrative cost of running the late penalty regime is Pounds 1.3m.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (35): Surprise packages - Modelmaker for Windows, written by Andrew Walker, research assistant at University of Nottingham, graduated 1991-92, MSc degree in environmental science, measurement and modelling Andrew Walker's software solution is aimed at students and researchers who are not (nor want to be) mathematicians and programmers, but who need to use mathematical models and simulations in their research. The system runs on IBM compatible PCs (486) under MS-DOS 5 and Windows 3.1, written in Borland Turbo Pascal for Windows v1.5. This program was written by a mathematician with unusual sympathy for non-mathematicians. Initially baffling to the panel, it emerged as a winner when it became clear that equally baffled students were being led gently by the hand in building screen-models which came alive courtesy of ready-made underlying mathematical formulae. Simply choose your formula, feed in the figures, and forget the mathematical grind. Scientists in the research and academic community often need to use mathematical techniques. Too often, this means resorting to programming in a language like Fortran or Pascal, and getting to grips with arcane mathematical theory, a headache for students of subjects from social sciences to environmental studies. This program, and its excellent documentation, (complete with index) played the same role as the top-of-the-class student who helps the less gifted with their homework. Its aim was to deliver results - graphs and models - without having to program or even understand the maths. Equations, key relationships, are easily defined, referenced, and printed out. If you want to use Runge-Kutter, here it is: the exercise of creating a model, and the online help, (backed by crisp, encouraging documentation), might even help you understand the Runge-Kutter formula. This was a surprise winner: one that sprinted from the back in the home straight to overtake other hopefuls. The identification of a real need, the programming, presentation and documentation (created to satisfy 30 eager users) all convinced the judging panel that this was in the tradition of many successful software products that have started in academia, and been taken out into the world by enthusiastic users. The judging team was unanimous in this choice of overall winner. Mr Abram Azagury, managing director of Computer Associates, commented: 'Judging the competition each year is proving more and more enjoyable, as we've seen a steady increase in the standard of entries. It is most rewarding, as well as a pleasure to help encourage such original work.' The Sales Decision Support System What was judged to be the best business solution was written by Richard Maher, fourth-year student in manufacturing and engineering systems at Brunel University. This software aims to give sales people in a manufacturing environment quick and accurate information, enabling them to see the effect on other production of manufacturing decisions and promises to customers. The software runs on an Olivetti PC under MS-DOS, using CA Clipper, DGE, Visual Interface. This system was an ingenious approach to the eternal problem of 'make what you can sell, don't sell what you can make.' The idea was to provide sales and marketing staff with dynamic manufacturing information, so that they might assess the profitability of an order, and see how it affected other work in progress. Optimising capacity, and concentrating on profitable runs was the goal of the system. The nature of manufacturing has changed, and resources have to be flexible when demand is unpredictable. Leadtimes and costs depend not only on the product itself, but what else is being manufactured, for what delivery dates. Manufacturers are increasingly concentrating on short runs, quick turnaround and low stock, sometimes of products specifically made to order. This is bringing about new pressures, and posing questions that factory managers, let alone sales people, are rarely equipped to answer. Richard Maher's application aims to fill that gap. Its ease of use, and instant impact ('what if' 3D bar charts of factory loading) were persuasive, and demonstrated a thorough grasp of the problem. Most impressive was the addressing of a real problem, a communication gap between different groups of workers, with a clear demonstration to both of what's possible - and what's profitable. Research with potential users, and a recognition of all the issues, some of them highly emotive, paid off in a well-designed, system that is well on its way to being a real live product. The following three entries were commended: Route Finder for Windows Written by Ian Foster, BSc hons in computing science, Staffordshire University; graduated 1993. This software is aimed at anyone needing optimisation of route-finding, in buildings or theme parks, or more traditional route-maps. The programme runs on Compaq 386 portable under Windows 3.1, written in Borland Pascal with Objects for Windows. The application started as an exercise in mapping buildings, fire-escape routes, circulatory flow, and so on. But it developed into general mapping tool when the author assessed AutoRoute, Nextbase's de facto standard in this area, and found no street-level facilities, and no way of optimising, blocking, or costing specific routes with multiple stops. A heuristic approach allows users to model alternative routes on different criteria. The maintenance of data (on roadworks and so on) might pose a problem, but while the author couldn't possibly create the database alone, he knows an organisation that can, as the AA says. Commended Diamond Smiles Written by Michael Walters, BSc honours, Computer Studies, University of Glamorgan; graduated 1993. Aimed at dental practices where there are several practitioners, but also applicable to doctors' surgeries, and so on. Runs on IBM PC and compatible, (386) under MS-DOS 5.0, written using Borland DBase IV (v1.5) and the Leonardo expert systems shell 3.0. An enticing name to solve a problem that makes few people smile: the need to make multiple appointments, perhaps with different clinicians, for some extended dental treatment. After talking to dentists, examining compatible appointment and dental charging systems, the author identified a real need, ably fulfilled with this well-crafted, easy-to-use, and instantly understandable system. The judges found this an attractive presentation and an 'intelligent' expert advice system on when to recall patients was a bonus which put this on the final shortlist. Commended Cadno Written by Phil Thompson, BSc honours, University of Glamorgan, (1992), now developing the product as a consultant to Metrology Systems Wales (MTS). The software is aimed at steel mills, and other manufacturers involving process rollers, such as aluminium, paper, and plastics. The software runs on PCs, in conjunction with a special 'smart card' which feeds in data from an electronic caliper. This program is already in commercial use, because it arose from a real-life requirement, already identified by the manufacturers (MTS) of an electronic caliper that measures inconsistencies in roller quality. The author took the smart-card used in the specialised measurement process and created a PC-based solution, easily used and understood on the factory floor to interrogate and display the data graphically. Commended Among the other entrants, the following three were shortlisted: QFD Written by Andreas Ikonomou, graduated January 1993 from Buckingham University in computer science with operations management. The software is aimed at project teams developing, designing and testing new products or services; it runs on IBM compatible PCs, with VGA/EGA graphics adaptors, written in Topspeed Modula-2 compiler v3.02. An interest in quality, and the application of quality function deployment theories brought about this powerful application, which creates a systematic method of comparing customer requirements and preferences with technical features. A potentially powerful tool for quality consultants, it is almost certainly unique in its functions: research and feedback on its practical use would make it even more convincing. N-Plan Written by a team of six: Stewart Waldie, Neil Peacock, Johnny Chan, Jonathan Rees, Simon McCahy, and Samantha Ward, BTEC HND students at Farnborough College of Technology, Computing and Maths Department. Aimed at supervisors in health and fitness clubs, dieticians helping to balance diets. Runs on IBM compatible PCs under MS-DOS 5, written using Microsoft C V7. Helping end-users to understand and eventually improve their nutritional intake is the aim of this ingenious program, which displays food on one side, chosen vitamins and nutrients on the other side of the screen, in a cleverly linked, interactive and adjustable display, showing recommended and actual amounts. Triggered by talking to the local fitness centre, it might also save dieticians tedious searches through books. City News Analyser Written by Matthew Lett, BSc in computer science; graduated July 1993 from University of Wales. Aimed at private investors with a portfolio of shares, and stockbrokers as a service to their customers, corporations. Runs on IBM compatible 286, under MS-DOS 5 written in Turbo C, using Teletext adaptor for downloading data. Private investors who want to keep a check on share performance were the aim of this tool. The author had spotted a gap in existing products at the home and low-end of the market, and aimed to deliver faster, more up-to-date data, through a very simple interpretation and presentation. Thorough research of the technical potential was evident, but real users, if tested, might require more flexibility in analysis and selection.</p>

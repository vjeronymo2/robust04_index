			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Arts: Clouded by the death of a master - Ballet in 1992 The accounts for 1992 do not balance. Loss outweighed gain; the good had to be set against much that was footling, inadequate. The year was overshadowed by the death of Sir Kenneth MacMillan, whose career was dedicated to the idea of ballet as an art of our - rather than our grandparents' - time. He found a way to show the springs of behaviour through eloquent movement, and sometimes questioned ballet itself in order to reach a truth. His last gift to the Royal Ballet was The Judas Tree, seen in March, a work as densely layered with meaning as anything he had created, and one which showed him still finding stimulating dance imagery. It was a piece centred upon Irek Mukhamedov, but like all MacMillan's repertory, it inspired superlative performance from its entire cast. Mukhamedov, at the peak of his powers, was the year's dominant performer from the January evening when he stepped on Covent Garden's stage as a tremendous Albrecht in Giselle. I have been fortunate enough to see almost every leading Albrecht of the past 50 years, both East and West. None, for me, has gone more potently to the core of Albrecht's being than Mukhamedov, nor made the romantic agonies of the role so moving. He went on to give a no less grandly romantic interpretation of Solor in La Bayadere, in a cast which brought Altynai Asylmuratova as the ideal Nikiya, Darcey Bussell as a virtuoso Gamzatti, Stephen Jefferies as a commanding Chief Brahmin. The old ballet came gloriously alive. Mukhamedov's artistry was also fascinating when he was cast against type, as des Grieux in Manon, where his dramatic intelligence was matched by that of Jefferies' menacing Lescaut; these two vivid theatrical temperaments were also ablaze when Mukhamedov made his debut as Romeo with Jefferies as Mercutio. To watch Mukhamedov's Rudolf in Mayerling was, again, to see a reading of passionate truth. In his MacMillan roles Mukhamedov has found artistic justification for his decision to join the Royal Ballet. This repertory has had most rewarding playing from the company. Michael Nunn won his laurels in his created role in The Judas Tree, and, in the biggest challenge of his career, showed us a Rudolf whose vulnerability was made clear by his refinement of means as dancer and actor. From Tetsuya Kumakawa dancing of technical brilliance as Colas, as Solor, as Puck, and in Scenes de ballet. To the company's credit we must also place Viviana Durante's mysterious dignity as the woman in Judas Tree, Darcey Bussell's speed and clarity in Balanchine works and in Forsythe's In the middle, and interpretations by Leanne Benjamin, Fiona Chadwick, Lesley Collier, Gillian Revie, Natalie McCann and Jane Burn in Mayerling. Performances of Scenes de ballet, of Balanchine's Symphony in C and Violin concerto were a joy of the year, and I salute the musical standards that obtained under Barry Wordsworth's baton. Forsythe's In the middle (fast junk-food for the eyes) sat heavily on the debit side, as did the decision to turn a lightweight film into the interminably flimsy Tales of Beatrix Potter on stage. Birmingham Royal Ballet produced an impressive revival of MacMillan's The Burrow. The acquisition of his Romeo was a move which seemed at first to over-stretch the company, though Nina Ananiashvili made a noble and touching Juliet. I have never been an admirer of Kurt Jooss's brand of European dance  -too earnest for its limited means - but BRB's revival of The Green Table, to mark the piece's 60th year, was well liked by its fans. A new piece by Oliver Hindle, pious about American Indians, also failed to convince me that worthy causes necessarily make worthy ballets. English National Ballet had a bad year, its repertory too reliant upon stagings by Ben Stevenson. His crass Nutcracker and noxious Cinderella contrive to minimise their interpreters. ENB offered one interesting creation, Kim Brandstrup's poetic White Nights, which was given in the welcome context of an evening of short pieces that included two brief dance-jokes by David Parsons, well told by their casts; something rather earnest about Schubert by Robert North (though the admirable and Apollonian Thomas Edur came to its rescue) and L, a muscle-bound moment from the inescapable Mr Stevenson which lived up to its title. That ENB acquired the Moscow star Ludmila Semenyaka as guest and then hardly cast her, was like using a Faberge Easter egg as a door-stop. She was allowed, though, to redeem the role of Cinderella (a task akin to turning plastic into platinum). ENB spent the year looking far below its best, without concern for its historically interesting repertory, and without a classical ballerina (Semenyaka's role, but one denied her). If I have a hope for 1993, it is that the company be rescued from its artistic and technical doldrums. Elsewhere 1992 was (like every other year, alas) much concerned with swan-upping. Performance of Swan Lake was an epidemic. The Royal Ballet began the autumn season with its choreographically admirable, but dramatically anxious, staging. In June, Birmingham also offered swans. London City Ballet toured a version throughout the first months of the year. Northern Ballet Theatre, with an improbable staging (but ah] the title]) presented it for 16 weeks. 'Stars of the Bolshoy' travelled the land with the second act for three months, though with the redeeming presence of Natalya Bessmertnova. The National Ballet of St. Petersburg (resounding title; less than resounding company) also trudged the provinces with a version, made bearable by Nadezhda Pavlova and Lubov Kunakova as guests. I need hardly add that ENB will mount a new production early next year. That there are precious few ballerinas - and how precious that few - who should be entrusted with its leading roles, is yet another nail in the coffin of this masterpiece. When not distracted by our feathered friends, London City Ballet showed sound triple bills of work by Balanchine, Ashton, Lichine, Jack Carter - pleasingly done. Northern Ballet Theatre, as an alternative to its alleged swans, came up with A Christmas Carol. Dull choreography was rescued by well focussed performance, songs, brilliant design by Lez Brotherston, and enough sentiment to knock Tiny Tim off his crutch. Clinging desperately to my principles, I enjoyed it. A year of directorial uncertainty did not inhibit London Contemporary Dance Theatre from performing with tremendous verve, and acquiring work to challenge its excellent dancers. PIeces by Mark Morris, Christopher Bruce, Amanda Miller were all welcome, and found the company in cracking form. Rambert Dance Company produced a lot of new choreography, and lost Richard Alston as director. Workshops in May brought intriguing (and in the case of Mark Baldwin, intriguingly different) dances. By the time the company reached the horrid Royalty Theatre for a summer season, six new pieces had been introduced to the repertory, including a disappointing 'first' - Merce Cunningham's Touchbase, which was shared with Cunningham's own company and was reportedly partly 'generated' by computer. It looked it. Serious design is part of the Rambert image, and Paul Huxley's bold set for Alston's Cats Eyes was distinguished. Novelties from Mark Baldwin and Paul Old were welcome, but the most impressive creation was Siobhan Davies' Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues, in which the lives of the workers and their looms seemed one. Among the year's dance pleasures was Siobhan Davies' White Bird Featherless, made for her own troupe. It was clear-toned, allusive, and Sean Feldman's dancing was outstandingly elegant. But dominating the year's free dance creativity was DV8's Strange Fish, a fierce theatre piece about faith, love, belief, and the way they all, says DV8, let us down. No matter what the message, the ensemble playing was stunning, with Wendy Houston and Nigel Charnock leading a troupe of hair-raisingly committed artists. Nothing else approached this, and much of what was on view - from dim British groups to dimmest French ensembles - was a vexation to the spirit. Michael Clark's MMM, was a joy-ride on a stolen Sacre du printemps, noteworthy only for his own exquisite solo. Adventures in Motion Pictures took a flyer at The Nutcracker at the Edinburgh Festival, and Matthew Bourne made something merry of it, though Tchaikovsky's greatest moments escaped him. I did not enjoy Jonathan Burrows new Very as much as I had hoped, but I am eager to see anything this gifted creator shows. And whatever the ups and (mostly) downs of the year's free dance, the work of The Place as a platform for every kind of movement performance remains invaluable. Adventurous, generous-minded, its policies are admirable, no matter how awful some of the things on view. Prospective sponsors, please note. Visitors included the Berlin Ballet with a less than happy repertory; the Australian Ballet with sound classical stagings; Alvin Ailey's company with familiar work and familiar energy; Cumbre Flamenca, with Mariquilla hammering rhythms into the ground; the Ballet du Nord with an enchanting re-creation of the original Fille mal gardee. Mikhail Baryshnikov came with his White Oaks Project, and remains a prodigious artist in Mark Morris's Ten Suggestions and in Graham's El Penitente. The rest of the White Oaks offerings ranged from the tedious to the frightful. The Royal New Zealand Ballet came to the Derngate Theatre in Northampton (which has the liveliest dance programming of any British theatre outside London) with a theatrically vital Hamlet. Nederlands Dans Theater appeared briefly in Bradford. Russian companies, bearing a variety of improbable names, came in quest of hard currency, with stagings hardly worth a rouble at today's rate. The presence of the princely Yury Posokhov, from the Bolshoy, made Moscow City Ballet's Sleeping Beauty bearable. Star-less, their Nutcracker was also pointless. Bessmertnova toured with a Stars of the Bolshoy group, lustrous still as Giselle; the National Ballet of St. Petersburg swanned around. The Ballet Theatre of St. Petersburg came burdened with supposedly modern choreography by Boris Eifman - an experience not recommended. These visitors are victims of economic conditions in Russia. Tour they must, in quest of convertible funds, in order to exist (and there was a depressing rumour that some corps de ballet dancers received bed and breakfast and just Pounds 30 a week as recompense for slogging night after night at the mill. Slavery is not dead). That most of their offerings were conceived without regard for Western standards in design and production, and that lack of resources meant pauperish presentation, is sad, but no excuse for risibly inadequate stagings, nor for standards of dancing that are, shall we say, variable. There are significant companies in Russia apart from the Mariinsky and Bolshoy troupes - the Perm Ballet has a fine reputation - but care is essential is showing them off. The visit of the Kiev Ballet to Paris was less valuable than we had hoped, as I reported from the Palais des Congres. The good name of Russian ballet must not fall victim to audiences willing to clap anything with a Russian name - or to fast-buck impresarios. Among performances abroad - the Paris Opera Ballet on magnificent form; Roland Petit's endearing Chaplin tribute in Rome - the second Bournonville Festival in Copenhagen is the year's happiest event. There were ten days of Bournonville's choreography; the Master's bust garlanded with flowers in the dear King's Theatre; a 'family' of admirers from round the world; the delights of Copenhagen itself. Good ballet-goers are Danes at heart.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- China has seen the  fastest growth in the world in terms of housing construction in  the last 15 years, according to the latest statistics compiled  by a U.N. organization.    The average per capita living space for urban Chinese  residents has risen to 7.4 sq.m. at present, a sharp contrast  to the mere 3.6 sq.m. fifteen years ago.    According to Deputy-Minister of Construction Tan Qinglian,  urban Chinese residents are now enjoying better housing  conditions, with larger houses, better architectural designs and  more beautiful residential environments.    The senior official said that residential housing has been  given top priority in China as a result of the government's  macro control over the once overheated real estate industry.  According to him, the construction of luxury hotels, apartments  and villas has been strictly controlled since May of last year.    The deputy-minister expects record growth this year in the  construction of total floor space and the average per capita  living space.    To boost the construction of residential housing, the  government has granted preferential treatment to housing  construction companies in terms of land allocation and reduction  or exemption of taxes as well as loans and materials supply.    According to the government housing plan, the average per  capita living space for urban Chinese residents should reach 8  sq.m. by the turn of the century. To meet the target, China  has to build 150 million to 180 million sq.m. in floor space  every year before the end of the century.    The leading official said that the housing strain is still  serious in China. Taking the country as a whole, more than 4  million urban households still live in houses with a floor space  of less than 4 sq.m. per person.    In addition, over 30 million sq.m. of old and dilapidated  houses need to be renovated.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Futures up after dip SHORT dated sterling money market futures dipped sharply lower yesterday morning as traders reacted nervously to the pound's losses on the foreign exchange markets. The September short sterling contract dipped down to 90.12, its lowest level since the  1/2 percentage point base rate cut in May, as sterling reached a low point of DM2.9077 in the morning. The contract later recovered in tandem with the currency to close at 90.23. This closing price implies that the three month sterling interbank rate in September will be 9.77 per cent. Similar gyrations were seen in the June short sterling contract, which hit a low point of 89.93 in the morning and closed at 90.00. This implies that the 3-month rate will be at 10 per cent by the end of next week. Traders were at odds over how to explain the movement in futures. One said that that the short contracts were tracking the movements of sterling throughout the day. But others said that the bullish view about rates in the afternoon followed a newspaper report that the Treasury had cut its growth forecast for 1992. Although the Treasury said it had not revised its forecast, any such fall in its growth estimates might suggest the need for a new base rate cut. There was far less activity in the sterling cash market, after the Bank of England forecast a small shortage in the morning of Pounds 250m. As sometimes happens with the smaller shortages, this one proved difficult to remove. The Bank did not operate in the market during the day and provided late assistance at 2.45 pm of around Pounds 140m. The difficulties removing the shortage meant that short term rates in the cash market firmed slightly in the morning. But they ended the day unchanged on Monday's close. 1-month money ended at 9 7/8 -9 13/16 per cent, while everything from 2 months to 9 months closed at 10-9 7/8 per cent. Traders reported that there was a slightly more bearish tone to the market, with more sellers than buyers. The overnight rate was reported to have hit a low of 8 1/2 per cent in the morning, and closed at 9 3/4 per cent. German call money was steady at 9.60-65 per cent yesterday, unchanged at the levels seen on Friday, before Monday's one-day holiday.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Inquiry finds no direct racial bias in Bar exams AN INQUIRY into allegations of racial discrimination at the Bar's law school has found no evidence of direct discrimination, says an interim report published yesterday. But the inquiry, chaired by Dame Jocelyn Barrow, did not rule out of the possibility of indirect discrimination and of direct discrimination in some individual cases. It was set up earlier this year to find out why ethnic minority students taking the Bar finals exam in 1992 had a failure rate nearly three times that of white students. In the 1991-92 academic year, 44.7 per cent of ethnic minority students failed the exam compared with only 16 per cent of white students. The results for this year showed an improvement, but ethnic minority students' failure rate was still more than double that of white students. Just 12 per cent of white students failed the exam in 1993 compared with 30 per cent of ethnic minority students. Dame Jocelyn said that research was continuing and a review of 20 individual cases was to be undertaken next month. While poorer prior academic performance could account for part of the disparity, a substantial difference still remained. The committee had identified a number of problems relating to teaching assessment, she said. Potential solutions included the introduction of a double marking system and the appointment of external examiners. The final report will be published in March.</p>

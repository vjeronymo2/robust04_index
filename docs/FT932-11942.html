			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: St Ethelburga must be fully restored Sir, The virtual destruction of the ancient church of St Ethelburga on Saturday morning ('Historic church reduced to rubble after 600 years', April 26) represents far more of a loss to the City than the loss of a few office blocks which can easily, if somewhat expensively, be replaced. St Ethelburga's is a symbol of the will of the City to survive and prosper and the psychological boost of its complete restoration would both do immeasurable good and send the clearest possible message to terrorists of any description that the City's spirit is unbreakable.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ``special correspondent'' Kang You-feng in San </F> Jose from the "Hookup" program]    [Text] At a joint news conference held by Republic of China  [ROC] President Li and Costa Rican President-elect Figueres,  President Li said he has a dream of transferring state power to  another person in a peaceful manner during his lifetime. He  said this would be his happiest wish. Meanwhile, President Li  also called on Communist China to establish the system of the  peaceful transfer of state power based on the concept that  sovereign authority rests with the people.    Especially to express high respect and courtesy, Costa Rican  President-elect Figueres held a joint news conference attended  by the heads of state of both ROC and Costa Rica. Owing to the  fact that the transfer of state power from the old president to  the new president in Costa Rica will take place soon, reporters  from various countries who are going to cover the presidential  inauguration ceremony all seized the opportunity to attend the  news conference. The site of the news conference was crowded  with people.    When a reporter asked President Li about his views on the  democratic politics in Costa Rica and the enlightenment of Costa  Rica's democratic experience, President Li pointed out that in  recent years, Costa Rica has been a very democratic country  because all systems of the country are based on the concept that  sovereign authority rests with the people. In particular, the  transfer of state power from the old president to the new  president is being carried out peacefully. People will not feel  uneasy because of the transfer of state power.    At that time, when President Li noticed that there were  XINHUA reporters present, he switched the conversation to  another subject and pointed out: The biggest problem in  mainland China is how to find a successor. We can understand,  after examining democratic politics in several countries, that  we must establish a system to ensure a long period of political  stability. Establishing a good system is the basic way to  ensure a long period of political stability. President Li said:    [Begin Li recording] The sovereign authority rests with the  people. This sentence is not new. In fact, however, it is also  a new concept. Are representatives of mainland China here, too?  Think about it! The biggest problem in mainland China is how to  transfer state power to a successor. Please see that only  people elected by the people can represent the will of the  people. Our current goal is to improve democratic construction,  which is precisely to establish such a system. [words  indistinct] [end recording]    At this point, President Li emotionally said he has a dream,  which is not to transfer state power after his death. If  possible, he will transfer state power peacefully to another  person during his lifetime. He said that this is his happiest  wish.    [Begin Li recording] I have a dream. That is, if there is  such an opportunity, I shall transfer state power to another  person. This will be my happiest wish. In China, our ROC, no  president has ever transferred power to another person during  his lifetime. I hope that our society [words indistinct] will  not have such problem. This is why I said that sovereign  authority rests with the people. Meanwhile, our constitional  reform is precisely for this purpose. Only in this way can the  state achieve stability. To develop the country, we must have a  stable foundation. [end recording]    After President Li spoke about sovereign authority resting  with the people under democratic politics and the establishment  of a political system to ensure a long period of political  stability, reporters from the Xinhua News Agency also expressed  their views to ROC reporters that President Li's remarks are  quite right and that China needs a scientific system and must  not continue the past way of a certain person designating a  successor. Su Chih-cheng, head of the secretariat of our  presidential office, who accompanied President Li on his visit,  also told the XINHUA reporters that President Li's remarks all  were words from the bottom of his heart and he expressed his  hope that they could reflect and report fully President Li's  remarks.</p>

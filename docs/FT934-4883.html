			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Turkish tax net tightened A programme of tax changes designed to close Turkey's budget gap and offset expected losses from the move to a customs union with the European Union in 1995 were unveiled yesterday by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister. The changes, which parliament will have to rush through in the next few weeks to take effect in the 1994 tax year, include a new consumption tax, increases in effective corporation tax, increased tax allowances for the lower paid, and administrative reforms to reduce tax evasion. 'For some people not to pay tax while those on the minimum wage pay their tax automatically every month is a shame, a sin and an injustice,' Mrs Ciller said, warning that the names of tax evaders would be exposed. The reforms aim to raise the tax take by 2 per cent of gross national product next year and 3 per cent in 1995. The parliamentary budget commission is expected to conclude the 1994 budget discussions this week, before taking the draft to the full house for approval. The budget, which has been calculated assuming parliamentary backing for the new tax reforms, envisages a deficit of TL192,000bn (Pounds 9.3bn), on spending of TL819,000bn. The reforms reduce the number of exemptions which allow corporations to reduce their tax liabilities. Under the new system, companies will pay corporation tax at a minimum rate of 20 per cent. Tax incentives are to be introduced for companies going public. The new consumption tax is specifically aimed at offsetting lost revenues resulting from the move to lower import tariffs and the scrapping of the mass housing fund as Turkey implements a customs union with the EU in 1995. The announcement, which Mrs Ciller made during a nationwide television address, coincides with publication of figures showing gross national product growing by 7.9 per cent in the third quarter. Growth was strongest in the services sector. After 12 per cent GNP growth in the second quarter, economists are projecting growth for the whole of 1993 at around 8 per cent, which should result in higher than budgeted tax receipts for the government in the current year.</p>

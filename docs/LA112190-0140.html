			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ACTION-PACKED, DERIVATIVE 'PREDATOR 2'  </P> <P> Like the original, "Predator 2" (citywide) has a jungle setting, only this time  it's an urban jungle -- downtown Los Angeles in 1997 -- instead of the  strife-torn Central America of the first. Another Predator, a member of that  gigantic alien species with hideous, crablike heads hidden by a helmet and  claws for hands, pops up in the midst of a garment district shootout between  Colombian and Jamaican drug gangs, making quick work of these criminals.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the huge creature with his awesome weaponry makes no distinction  between good and evil, which spells big trouble for veteran L.A. cop Danny  Glover and his partners, Maria Conchita Alonso and Ruben Blades.  </P> <P> "Predator 2" may be a sequel, but it plays like a reworking of "Predator"  punched up to the max to distract from this unavoidable impression. This means  the filmmakers hit us hard with elaborate special effects, stunt work and  production design plus plenty of violence.  </P> <P> Since writers Jim and John Thomas' plot this time involves much stale, tough  cop talk and a trite jurisdictional clash between the maverick Glover and Gary  Busey's rigid federal agent, the film essentially marks time until the  inevitable showdown between Glover and the Predator, again played beneath heavy  masking by 7-foot-2 Kevin Peter Hall. Because it's like a repeat match, it  cannot hope to equal the effect of the scary suspense generated when Arnold  Schwarzenegger took on the first Predator.  </P> <P> We can be grateful that "Predator 2" has first-rate actors, even if the demands  placed upon them are mainly physical, and that director Stephen Hopkins (whose  last picture was "Nightmare on Elm Street 5") is relentless in his swift  pacing. Virtually everything about the film is derivative -- even the design  for the eerie setting for the climactic struggle recalls the interiors of the  more exotic old movie palaces -- but its makers can't be accused of cutting  corners. No doubt about it, those who ask only for pure action will be getting  their money's worth. "Predator 2" (rated R for violence and language) makes it  clear that we haven't seen the last of these ugly, outsized aliens. After all,  only poor box office can kill off monsters.  </P></p>

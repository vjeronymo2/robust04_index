			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Tokyo looks to Keidanren MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, is today to meet the head of the Keidanren, the country's influential business grouping, for what were described as emergency talks on ways to buoy the slowing domestic economy. The talks with Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, who is also chairman of Tokyo Electric Power, come at Mr Miyazawa's request. They follow a week in which the Tokyo stock market has touched six-year lows, most economic data have remained discouraging, and ministries have squabbled over the size and content of a package of stimulatory measures. No immediate solutions were expected from the meeting. Equities yesterday managed their first rally in seven trading days on largely technical factors. The Nikkei average of 225 leading companies was 52.08 points higher at 14,820.25. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) yesterday revised upwards its industrial production statistics for June, but an official said the underlying tone was weak. Seasonally adjusted production in manufacturing and mining rose 2.5 per cent from May, Miti said, compared with its preliminary figure of 2.1 per cent. The index of shipments rose 0.7 per cent month-on-month, but compared with June 1991, production was down 3.9 per cent and shipments fell 3.5 per cent. The Bank of Japan meanwhile announced that domestic wholesale prices, although 0.1 per cent higher in July than the previous month because of higher electricity charges, were down 0.7 per cent from a year earlier. Evidence of continued weak consumer demand came yesterday in sales for July at Tokyo department stores, which were down 3.7 per cent from a year earlier, the fifth monthly fall in a row. The Japan Department Stores Association said this was the sector's most protracted downturn ever, exceeding the four poor months experienced during the 1982 oil crisis. The association said high-value goods fared particularly badly, while foods were the only area to show a rise.</p>

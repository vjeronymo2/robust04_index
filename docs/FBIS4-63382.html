			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marina Ryklina report: "Russian Convoy on African Soil"] </F>   [Text] A special detachment from the Russian Ministry for  Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Elimination  of Natural Disasters, comprising 15 drivers, communications  workers, medics, and translators, flew out of Moscow to Tanzania  18 May. Two transport aircraft -- an Il-76 and an An-124  "Ruslan" -- delivered 10 "KamAZ" trucks, spares, and  communications systems to the African continent.    According to figures from the World Food Program, there are  already more than 320,000 refugees in Tanzania from neighboring  Rwanda -- where an interethnic war still rages. Every day more  than 1,500 people are arriving in the quest to escape. The  United Nations is so far succeeding in supplying food to the  world's largest refugee camp at Benako [name as transliterated].    Within the framework of the recently concluded agreement to  support the humanitarian aid operations, the Office of the UN  High Commissioner for Refugees has appealed to its partner --  the Russian Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency  Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters -- asking it to  take part in transporting international humanitarian cargo to  Rwandan refugee camps. Following this request an advance party  from the Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency  Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters went to  Tanzania to arrange the routes for the delivery of the cargo and  look at security problems, the conditions under which Russian  drivers would be living, and funding issues. Our participation  in this action will be effected on the basis of the United  Nations reimbursing our transport costs, detachment members'  pay, and certain other expenses....    Meanwhile the Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense,  Emergency Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters is  already installing a special communications system which will  make it possible to monitor the Russian convoy's progress all  along the route.</p>

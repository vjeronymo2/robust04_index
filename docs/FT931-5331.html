			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Writ on NatWest chairman struck out THE HIGH Court yesterday 'struck out' a writ issued by Mr George Mainz, a businessman, against Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank. Mr Mainz, a frozen foods manufacturer, claimed Lord Alexander 'became party to a bank conspiracy' and partook in his defamation. He claimed the bank lost him Pounds 2m and cost him his business. He said he had never received an explanation. But after an hour-long private hearing High Court official Master Hodgson ruled the writ showed no reasonable cause of action and was 'scandalous, frivolous or vex-atious'. The bank has denied Mr Mainz's allegations, which go back to 1966. Lord Alexander was not present at the hear-ing.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (34): Banks, brothels and a high body count - . . . it's all there in Ken Follett's latest saga of skulduggery A DANGEROUS FORTUNE by Ken Follett Macmillan Pounds 14.99 434 pages IN SPITE OF its gentlemanly image, merchant banking is a cut-throat business. But by the time young Hugh Pilaster finally struggles to the top of the family firm, the body count has surely breached every definition of good corporate governance. Not that poor, priapic Hugh - the mere sight of a female breast means a week of restless nights - has any blood on his hands. He is decent and honourable in business, though a little less classy when it comes to women like Maisie, the former circus bareback rider who still performs tricks for gentlemen friends. Most of the skulduggery is down to Augusta, Hugh's scheming, statuesque, sex-starved aunt, who conspires with multiple murderer Micky Miranda (no relation to Carmen) to destroy lives and careers in order that her own branch of the family gets the gilt and the glory. Micky hails from Cordova, where his dad dreams of being president and amuses himself by blasting the heads off dwarves. One unfaithful mistress was despatched by a rifle pointed 'up her'. Cordovans do not like it up them. But those were the good old days, when Pilaster's bank granted a loan and saved a monarch or refused an advance and started a revolution; when, in Cordova, a silver dollar would do nicely for a slap up meal, a bottle of rum and a whore for the night. Follett's latest, breathless novel, a 19th century saga of two dynasties, races through banking halls and bordellos, from Santamaria to Southampton, trailing popping hymens and involuntary deposits behind it. There are more sub-plots than there are noughts in the author's bank account, with the mystery drowning of one Peter Middleton during Hugh's school days dogging his life and influencing those of many around him. But while the characters are every bit as colourful as a Cordovan ten dollar bill they are equally as thin. Stubborn old Seth, Pilaster's senior partner, is smothered by a pillow, to all intents and purposes carried off to the strongroom in the sky while reading The Economist. He had, after all, been blocking the rise of Augusta's husband, for whom she gets a peerage by funding a crooked MP and whispering in the ear of Queen Victoria's lady-in-waiting. Solly Greenbourne, heir to the other banking dynasty, threatens to withdraw funding which Mickey has lined up for the rebels back home. He gets his, courtesy of a careless postillion in Piccadilly; Tonio - 'one of the nicest men I ever opened my legs for' - catches a bullet instead of a train. Augusta's hapless son Edward, who switches affections between bawdy house 'dollymops' and Mickey himself, briefly gets the top job and a more permanent dose of syphilis. Hugh finally wins the bank and Maisie. Bankrupt Aunt Augusta grabs the priceless snuff boxes and heads for the boat with Mickey, who takes to a bath chair and flowered hat. But her Latin lothario has seriously misled her all these years, both about his love for her and about the true circumstances of that terrible drowning. Mickey hides in the trunk from police, which Augusta promptly dumps overboard. Too bad the Bank of England lifeboat was still decades away.</p>

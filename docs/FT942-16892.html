			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (8): Star chefs are in a transfer market - Nicholas Lander investigates the phenomenal rise to fame of the hotel restaurant If the Edwardian gourmet, Colonel Newnham-Davis, gastronomic correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette before the first world war, were to return to London today he would not be too surprised at the location of some of the capital's finest restaurants. Eighty years ago he was accustomed to dining in splendour at the Savoy, the Ritz, Claridges or the Berkeley. These hotels still prosper, but if Newnham-Davis were to pick up the 1994 Michelin Guide he would see that, in the gastronomic league table, their dining rooms have been surpassed by other hotel restaurants. Two of London's three two star Michelin restaurants are in Forte-owned hotels - Chez Nico at the Grosvenor House and the restaurant at the Hyde Park. The third, Le Gavroche, supplies meals to the bedrooms upstairs at 47 Park Street, part of the Demeure hotel group. Of the 11 one star Michelin restaurants in London, five are in big West End hotels - the Capital, the Connaught, the Oak Room at Le Meridien, Piccadilly, the Four Seasons at the Four Seasons hotel, and the Oriental at the Dorchester. This phenomenon of the impressive hotel restaurant is not confined to London. Monte Carlo boasts the Hotel de Paris (where the chef is Alain Ducasse); Washington DC has the Watergate (chef Jean-Louis Palladin); San Francisco has Postrio in the Prescott Hotel (chef Wolfgang Puck). Dallas is home to the Mansion on Turtle Creek (chef Dean Fearing). In France, the country's most highly-esteemed chef, Joel Robuchon, has moved out of his own restaurant, Jamin, to take over the kitchens and restaurant at Le Parc Victor Hugo, another Demeure hotel. The most surprising thing about this transformation has been the speed with which it has taken place. Hotel dining rooms used to be, with one or two exceptions, dull and uninviting - and almost invariably empty. They stood as necessary but uncared-for appendages to supply the much more profitable banqueting suites and room service to the bedrooms. In 1971, when 27 hotels opened in London as a result of the bedroom building subsidy granted by the then Labour government under the premiership of Harold Wilson, just two hotels were renowned for the excellence of their food: the Connaught and the Savoy. The Savoy's head chef, Silvano Trompeto, was the only well-known hotel chef. Hotels in those days had dining rooms, not restaurants; and many newly-opened hotels in the 1970s opted for 24 hour coffee shops, followed the American fashion. David Levin was the first to challenge this. He opened the Capital Hotel in Knightsbridge which, in the French tradition, he called 'a restaurant with rooms' rather than a hotel with a dining room. Across Hyde Park, hotel restaurants were given another shot in the arm by the arrival of Anton Mosimann at the Dorchester - where he was actively promoted by the controlling McAlpine family. In 1974, Michelin produced its first red guide to the UK. Awarding stars to hotel restaurants immediately identified the chefs. For the first time, diners went to eat Michel Bourdin's food rather than simply to dine at the Connaught - just as they went to discover what Peter Kromberg was cooking at the Inter-Continental, or Bernard Gaume, at the Hyatt Carlton. Competition between the hotels was established, and the fires further stoked, by annual appearancesin Michelin. All the hotels needed was a separate kitchen for their prestigious new restaurants and cash to buy the culinary stars. As with top footballers, chefs are in a transfer market. When Bruno Loubet decided to leave the Four Seasons hotel, having won a Michelin star for his cooking, the hotel was able to replace him with Jean-Christophe Novelli, who had won his own star in Hampshire. Forte did the same thing twice, importing Nico Ladenis (and his two Michelin stars) into the Grosvenor House, and Marco Pierre White (and his stars) into the Hyde Park Hotel. As international business hotels vie for column inches around the world, and for local custom, a distinctive restaurant has become essential; as important - although possibly for opposite reasons - as a swimming pool or exercise rooms. Michelin made it possible for all the hotels to compete, by making it clear  -albeit as one of its many unwritten rules - that when a chef won a Michelin star, that star was transferable. Hotels have adopted varying tactics to keep their restaurants in the news. International Hotels' St James Court boasts three different cuisines - Chinese, Provencal and international - under one roof. It has just put on an Austrian food festival, with one of that country's top chefs. Over in Piccadilly, Le Meridien boasts a Michelin-starred chef in David Chambers, but the hotel flies in Michel Lorain, a three star Michelin chef in Joigny, France, as consultant and inspiration for its seasonal menus. What has united international hotels and top chefs most closely, however, has been the recession and the Gulf War. The consequent fall in conspicuous consumption has forced hoteliers to try to make every inch of their buildings pay. Chefs such as Ladenis, White and Robuchon, who prospered during most of the 1980s, have been persuaded to sacrifice their independence for the opportunity to continue cooking with such expensive ingredients as foie gras, lobster and truffles. For the chef, the association with a top hotel has also often brought with it a well-oiled publicity department only too keen to promote his name, his cookery books, and even his range of conserves. Over the past five years the big transformation in London hotel restaurants has been brought about via an association with a top chef. It has been an expensive process and one whose heavy investment - in personnel, refurbishment and new crockery - may not yet be showing a substantial return. An alternative strategy, pioneered by Bill Kimpton in California, may hold the solution for London's hotel restaurants in the future. His company, Kimco Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management Company, now manages restaurants in 17 different hotels where it pays the hotelier a rent and a percentage of the takings. This arrangement has so far proved extremely successful for both the hotels and restaurants. It would come as something of a shock to Colonel Newnham-Davis.</p>

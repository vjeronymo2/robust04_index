			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this interim rule in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformance with Executive Order 12866 and it has been designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``economically significant.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the final rule in 7 CFR part 3015, Subpart V and related Notice (48  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 29115), this Program is excluded from the scope of Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and local officials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). Ellen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Haas, the Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified that this rule does not have a significant economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on a substantial number of small entities. State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local welfare agencies will be the most affected to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they administer the Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3507).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Need for Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is required to eliminate inconsistent policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from litigation, promote equity in the treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing and energy assistance, and increase consistency with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action increases benefits to low-income households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for paying utility expenses separately from their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rent who receive utility reimbursements from HUD and FmHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is estimated that this action will increase the cost of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Food Stamp Program by approximately $13 million for each month of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its implementation in FY 1994 and $160 million in FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures are as follows: (1) For Program benefit recipients_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2020(e)(1) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities) or Part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) for Program retailers and wholesalers_administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 278.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Participation and Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of this rulemaking are required to be effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and implemented no later than August 1, 1994. Because of the need to establish a consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide policy with respect to the treatment of the specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility reimbursements, Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Consumer Services, has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that public comment on this rulemaking prior to implementation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impracticable. However, because we believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of the rule may be improved by public comment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments are solicited on this rule for 60 days. All comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be analyzed, and any appropriate changes to the rule will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated in the subsequent publication of a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HUD utility reimbursements excluded from Food Stamp Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Program) income consideration by this rule are provided pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the Housing Act), 42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 1437, to comply with a provision of the Housing Act (42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 1437a(a)(1)) that requires HUD to limit the shelter costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of tenants in Federally assisted housing to 30 percent of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income. In calculating a tenant's rent payment, HUD has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpreted the term ``rent'' to include the cost of utilities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other services, including electricity, gas, heating fuel, water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and sewerage, and trash and garbage collection (24 CFR 813.102,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 965.472, 965.476). In some housing, utilities are included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tenant's rent. In units in which the utilities are paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly by the tenant, HUD permits a deduction to be made from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rent paid to the owner on account of the separate payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being made to the utility supplier. This deduction, provided for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 24 CFR 813.102 and 913.102, for the estimated value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilities and charges for other housing services payable directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the family is called a ``utility allowance.'' The amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility allowance is based, not on an individual family's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses, but on a community-wide standard. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tenant's actual utility costs may be more or less than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

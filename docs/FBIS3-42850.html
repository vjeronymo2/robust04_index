Gamova; place and date not given: "The Roots of  the Mutual Relations Between Moldova and Ukraine Go Back  Centuries"]    [Text] More than 600,000 Ukrainians live in Moldova  today. This and also being Ukraine's immediate neighbor dictate  the interest of the people living in our republic in the mutual  relations of the two states. The interview with Vitaliy Boyko,  Ukraine's ambassador in Moldova, is about this.    [Gamova] Vitaliy Fedorovich, how are Ukraine's relations  with  Moldova developing, and what in them is determinative?    [Boyko] Moldova is viewed in a strategic sense as a very  close neighbor with which it is possible to build normal  friendly relations. Ukraine's position is built on recognition  of the unity and indivisibility of Moldova's borders. This has  been repeatedly confirmed by Ukraine President L. Kravchuk. But  as a very close neighbor, Ukraine is alarmed by the problems  associated with the Dnestr area conflict. Especially because the  conflict occurred on the borders with Ukraine, and this speaks  of possible moral and material losses for us. In addition, every  seventh resident in Moldova is of Ukrainian origin. Moreover, a  majority of Ukrainians are residents of the Left Bank. This is a  feature that we cannot fail to take into account. Therefore, at  the last meeting in Kiev, Leonid Kravchuk expressed Ukraine's  intention to promote a settlement of the conflict in the Dnestr  area. Adhering, as I have already noted, to the principle of the  unity and indivisibility of Moldova, Ukraine thinks that the  possibility of allotting special status to the eastern rayons of  Moldova, with definite guarantees in the event of changes in the  status of Moldova itself, is a step that could remove the  existing problems.    Since the proclamation of independence of our states, their  mutual relations are being placed on a legal basis. A treaty on  good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation between Ukraine  and Moldova was signed in October 1993. About 30  intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements on different  directions of cooperation were concluded on the basis of this  treaty. It is characteristic that the year 1993 ended with  another meeting of President Snegur and President Kravchuk in  Kiev. Documents were signed at it in the sphere of protection of  the rights of citizens: Ukrainians in Moldova and Moldovans in  Ukraine. These concern basically social protection, for example,  of pensioners. Although it would be nice if the number of these  documents increased, inasmuch as other problems also exist.  Essentially, there is no state border between Moldova and  Ukraine, there is an administrative-territorial one. Meanwhile,  the state border is the sign of an independent state. You know,  you somehow feel more confident with a neighbor when a boundary  is drawn between your plot and his. At the Kiev meeting the  presidents talked about the need to accelerate resolution of  this question.    [Gamova] Customs posts are also a sign of independent  states...    [Boyko] There is a lot of unfavorable criticism of the  existing customs barriers. Things have developed in such a way  that there are blood ties connecting the residents of Ukraine  and Moldova. In this connection, round trips are quite natural.  In the process of inheritance among citizens of Moldova it can  happen that their home and vegetable garden are in a Ukrainian  village. But a person has to pay to transport across the border  what he has raised in his very own garden--the customs duties  are such that it is cheaper to buy food products at the market.  Recently, to officially register a crossing of the Ukrainian  border, customs charged $5 from each vehicle. This kind of  $5-customs barrier turned out in fact to be a closing of the  Ukrainian border. It is true that this measure existed for only  two weeks; however, it evoked colossal indignation. Errors like  this cost us a lot, inasmuch as they have a negative effect on  the assessment of Ukraine.    [Gamova] In your opinion, is anything changing in the  conditions in which the Ukrainian diaspora has to live in  Moldova?    [Boyko] There are some changes for the better in the revival  of Ukrainian culture and language. I detect in this the policy  of the president of Moldova and on the whole of the authorities  of the republic who are trying to create a definite base for the  future. Ukrainian groups are being created in Moldovan VUZ's  [higher educational institutions]. The university in the capital  will prepare elementary grade teachers for Ukrainian schools.  Two groups have been formed in the Lipkany teachers college for  the training of educators for Ukrainian kindergartens. According  to the joint agreement of ministries that are in charge of  questions of education, a student exchange is being conducted,  and young boys and girls of Ukrainian nationality from Moldova  can receive an education in Ukraine, and vice versa. State  policy in Moldova is directed at the creation of conditions for  the revival of national cultures. This is also indicated by  support at government level of Ukrainian cultural societies in  Moldova.    [Gamova] Are requests addressed to you at the embassy  concerning the granting of Ukrainian citizenship?    [Boyko] There are such requests. But the fact is that the  laws of Ukraine do not envision granting Ukrainian citizenship  to persons who live outside its borders. Only those who have  moved to a permanent place of residence in Ukrainian cities and  villages can become citizens of Ukraine.    Meanwhile, our legislation permits dual citizenship on the  basis of intergovernmental agreements. Except for Tajikistan,  this practice as such does not exist in the CIS. As a lawyer, I  am interested, for example, in what the basis is for such an  agreement between Russia and Tajikistan. This question is being  studied at the expert level in Ukraine and Russia. In the  future, it can also come up against the background of our  relations with Moldova, and what is meant here is the  development of a special interstate agreement. Although numerous  questions crop up here. Including also the question of  obligations with respect to the state whose citizenship a person  is assuming. In dual citizenship, perhaps, only his rights are  being looked into.    Nevertheless, the statement of the issue of dual citizenship  itself is important, if at least because requests regarding  adoption of Ukrainian citizenship are numerous. They are  especially being looked at in the Dnestr area and the rayons  bordering Ukraine. The residents of these rayons, referring to  the fact that until 1940 they were in the structure of Ukraine,  are insisting on confirmation of their Ukrainian citizenship,  although, however, citizenship of Ukraine as such did not exist  before 1940.    [Gamova] What would you wish for the readers of  KISHINEVSKIYE  NOVOSTI in the New Year?    [Boyko] Returning to the meeting of the presidents of  Moldova  and Ukraine, I would wish for the results of the agreements  achieved in it to be filled with a good deal of substance. So  that their implementation will proceed for the good of both the  Ukrainian and Moldovan people.    For the readers of your newspaper--happiness, health, and  abundant peace in the New Year.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIPLE TROUBLE;  </P> <P> SUNDAY SILENCE HASN'T GONE EASY ON TRAINER, GRAZING HIM WITH HOOF  </P> <P> The third time is supposed to be the charm for Sunday Silence today in the  Belmont Stakes as the 3-year-old colt tries to become the 12th horse to win the  Triple Crown.  </P> <P> But the three times that Sunday Silence has attacked his trainer, 76-year-old  Charlie Whittingham, have been anything but charming.  </P> <P> Whittingham has been bitten on the back of the leg and on a finger by Sunday  Silence, and Friday morning, the hyperactive colt reared in the air and grazed  the trainer with a hoof to the right temple.  </P> <P> "Another inch or two and it could have been much more serious than it was,"  said Richard Craigo, Whittingham's attorney, who was standing about 10 feet  from the incident.  </P> <P> Whittingham was leading Sunday Silence from the paddock to the Belmont Park  track for his customary morning gallop, with exercise rider Pam Mabes in the  saddle.  </P> <P> The horse left the tunnel and was just about ready to step onto the track, but  before Whittingham could remove the lead shank, Sunday Silence reared high in  the air and wheeled in the trainer's direction. Mabes was able to stay in the  saddle.  </P> <P> "The horse reared up so high, he looked like Roy Rogers' horse (Trigger),"  Craigo said. "Charlie had to do some fancy footwork just to get out of the way  as much as he did. He looked like a ballet dancer getting away."  </P> <P> Whittingham suffered a minor bruise and was treated at the track.  </P> <P> Whittingham complained to friends about a sore jaw but said he had no headache.  "I've never had a headache," he said.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence was being trailed by an army of photographers, and Whittingham  said that they may have spooked the colt. But other observers said that a  nearby horse might have caused Sunday Silence to rear up.  </P> <P> Whittingham was more concerned about Sunday Silence than himself. "It's a good  thing he's such a sound horse," he said. "I'm just glad he didn't hurt his  foot. I thought I moved quick enough to get away from him, but he got me,  anyway. These things happen."  </P></p>

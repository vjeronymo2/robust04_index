			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner on 3  June recognized that Paraguayan settlers are having problems as  a result of the filling of the Yacyreta hydroelectric dam. The  minister said, however, that those problems are not reason  enough to stage an aggression such as the one that occurred in  Encarnacion in the afternoon of 2 June. During the incident a  crowd threatened an Argentine official working for the Yacyreta  Binational Entity [EBY] and then pushed his car into the river.    Ramirez Boettner met Raul Enrique Justo, minister adviser to  the Argentine Embassy in Paraguay, at 13:25 on 3 June. Justo is  temporarily heading the Argentine mission for Ambassador Raul  Eduardo Carignano, who traveled to Santa Fe Province the day of  the incident.    Justo conveyed to Ramirez Boettner the Argentine "concern"  over the 2 June incident. The foreign minister said he shares  Argentina's concern and promised to do his utmost to solve the  social situation that is at a boiling point in the Encarnacion  area.    The foreign minister on 3 June received a "top secret"  [preceding two words in English] report from EBY's Paraguayan  director, Antonio Adam Nill, about the incident staged by  settlers. Ramirez Boettner did not want to elaborate on the  document's contents, but said it was a report on what happened  on 2 June. "We will study it in order to solve the problem," he  added.    The foreign minister called on settlers to review their  decision to prevent the entry of all Argentine and Paraguayan  officials to the area until a solution is found because their  position closes the possibilities of a dialogue.    Technical sources warned that Inter-American Development  Bank  (IDB) and World Bank technicians have expressed a very lukewarm  position regarding the social problems of those affected by the  dam's filling, adding that they even lean toward the Argentine  position, which seeks to fill the dam at any cost.  <H5>  Workers and Relocations </H5>   The foreign minister conveyed to the Argentine Foreign  Ministry, through Raul Enrique Justo, its concern about the  situation of workers and the relocation of settlers living on  Parana River islands because they also must be relocated and  provided with basic services.    Regarding this point the Argentine foreign official said: "I  don't have all the information at hand, but I will transmit the  concern to my government and we will continue working to resolve  these problems."    The two countries' Foreign Ministries promised to be in  permanent contact to seek a quick solution to the problem raised  by settlers and the lack of compensation pay. On 3 June, Ramirez  Boettner traveled to Belem do Para to participate in the 24th  OAS ordinary session that will meet from 6 to 11 June.</p>

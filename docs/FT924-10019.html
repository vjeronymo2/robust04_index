			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World TV starts Canadian service BBC WORLD Service Television launched its first North American operation yesterday with the start of services on CBC's 24-hour Newsworld channel, giving access to 6.5m homes in Canada. The move into North America brings closer to reality the promise made this year by Sir Michael Checkland, director-general of the BBC, that World Service Television would be available worldwide by the end of next year. WSTV, a wholly owned, self-funding subsidiary of the BBC, is available on satellite throughout Asia and Africa. Negotiations are proceeding to make it available in the US, Australia and the Pacific. After a deal with Nissho Iwai, the Japanese trading house, a 24-hour news and information service for Japan awaits final regulatory approval. The service will be mainly in English, with segments in Japanese. Eighteen months after its launch, no one knows precisely how big WSTV's audience is. Mr Jonathan Birchall, the BBC's Singapore correspondent, says that, after a long trek across mountains to film Karen tribesmen fighting the Burmese government, he found the rebel leaders watching the news from London on WSTV. Government ministers and officials in Vietnam are said to be keen viewers. Unofficial estimates say WSTV's audience may already be as high as 20m. In Asia, where it is part of the five-channel Star TV, it can be seen from Taiwan to Turkey and from Siberia to Sumatra. Mr Christopher Irwin, chief executive of WSTV, says: 'A vast increase is taking place in India. The number of viewers is growing by 200 per cent every three months.' A study of 38,000 households in 24 urban centres in India found that the BBC service was available in 20 per cent of the highest-earning, social group A households. Regional partnerships have helped the service develop. The company behind Star TV is part of the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, and in Africa the BBC's partners are M-Net, which operates South Africa's subscription television service. The BBC has full editorial control and the service originates from a London studio. This month Mr Irwin signed a deal with Yorkshire Television for 150 hours of programmes a year  - including the award-winning documentary series First Tuesday. As WSTV starts to challenge the US broadcaster CNN, Mr Irwin says any surpluses will, for the time being, go towards enhancing the service.</p>

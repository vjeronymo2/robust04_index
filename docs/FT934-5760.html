			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Minister for a Day: From minor to major - Nigel Spivey picks up the sports portfolio MENS SANA in corpore sano (a sound mind in a sound body) was a maxim fashioned by a satirist, not a doctor. And if you go back to its original Latin context (Juvenal Satires 10) you find that it was framed not as a conditional prescription, but rather as a wistful fritter of stoic simplicity. Numerous examples can be cited of sportsmen and women whose ungracious boorishness appears to disprove the formula as it is commonly understood. But not to worry. In my Ministry of Sport, the promotion of healthy minds in sound bodies will radically transform the tenor of life in Britain. In the past, this portfolio has been perceived as a minor sinecure. Some thoroughly wretched physical specimens have slouched in and out of the post, trailing clouds of ignominy behind them. Searching their polysaturated hearts over the birching of English hooligans or the steroid intake of Welsh weightlifters, they have treated sport as an activity marginal to commerce, education and social welfare. They have failed to grasp the fact that in a technological society there are always going to be large numbers of unemployed, and those in employment will be ever more sedentarily occupied. In such a society, sport is not marginal. It is at the heart of human happiness. So I shall be clearing the desks of my predecessors, and greatly extending the powers of the Minister for Sport. John Patten, the education secretary, will be first to feel my presence, for I have visited enough primary schools to realise that we are nurturing a whole generation of asthmatic, myopic and ill-co-ordinated children in this country, and my first move will be to get these youngsters fit. School teachers, who in the past used to be able (and willing) to stay on for games coaching after lessons, will have their salaries immediately doubled. School playing fields will be vastly extended, by compulsory purchase where necessary, and school premises, especially in the cities, endowed with new gymnasia. We shall raise funds in the short term by imposing a 40 per cent tariff on all computer games and videos (short-term, because I foresee a time not distant when children are weaned off these debilitators. In the long term, naturally, massive savings will be garnered from the fall-off in calls on the National Health Service. At the secondary school level a very similar programme will be in place. Those marvellous men and women who used to forfeit their Saturday afternoons to blow whistles on wet fields will be brought back and rewarded, and most teenagers will return home with only just enough energy remaining to pick up a book and sit quietly improving their literacy. The regime will not be Spartan, but neither will it be very different from Arnold's Rugby. I know that I shall have allies for my programme in both houses. Sebastian Coe, MP for Falmouth and Camborne, will help; as will those athletic lords Archer and Parkinson. In the first instance my ministerial aides will be entirely recruited from the Cheltenham Ladies lacrosse team, anunfailing advertisement for good sense and good health. In due time I trust that state schools will be turning out equally glorious products. I shall also employ a large detachment of peripatetic deputies, whose job will be to tour the country, encouraging all the many local initiatives which already exist. They will be role models of both prowess and pleasant manners: not the Gattings or Mansells, but the Brearleys and Linekers. No other nation in the world, I think, has such a reservoir of amateur enthusiasm for sport as Britain: my ministry will at last recognise this as the resource it is, assisting with club expenses, providing bursaries for those with special needs, and facilitating the escape routes sport offers to those whose futures are otherwise bleak. Some of our greatest sportsmen (Daley Thompson, Linford Christie, Frank Bruno, Geoff Capes) have openly admitted that they might now be doing time were it not for sporting opportunities. Ten years ago the government forced schools to sell their playing fields. Now it is urgently having to build new prisons. The price is being paid. Youth is like quicksilver. It needs to move, to collide and bounce. Injecting that elemental dynamism into the challenges of sport makes sense. I am not concerned about the fortunes of the national soccer teams, nor Britons who biff their way into the second round of the Wimbledon tennis championships. Professional athletes will always find their pitch according to the marketplace. But I am concerned about the youngsters reduced to raving, drinking, and fighting in the streets. There are happier ways of releasing that energy. Nigel Spivey is the 1993 Eastern Counties hammer-throwing champion.</p>

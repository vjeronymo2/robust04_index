			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Swimmers' reputation takes a dive: The embarrassment of China's drug-shamed sports leaders China's sports commissars banged the nationalist drum earlier this year when rival countries alleged that the phenomenally successful Chinese swimmers at the Rome world championships used performance-enhancing drugs. Then, Zhou Ming, a Chinese swimming coach, rounded on western critics, saying: 'I think the doping problem is a sort of political problem now because in the sports world it's always the domain of western people. They just can't tolerate that Asian peoples can be good in sport.' But now the truth, of an epidemic of drug-taking among Chinese swimmers, is dribbling out. Reports appeared this week that eight of them tested positive at the recent Asian Games in Hiroshima, and statements from Beijing have become contrite. Officials are still finding ways of blaming the west. 'Illegal drug abuse in sport is originally a western invention, but since China opened its doors to the outside world 15 years ago, such a bad thing seeped into China, too, just like prostitution,' Mr Yuan Jiawei, deputy secretary general of China's swimming committee, said this week. It is a moot point whether the world's oldest profession was ever completely eradicated from China, but the scourge of drug-taking in sport has certainly found its way to the Middle Kingdom, Chinese protestations to the contrary. Now that the cat is out of the bag, Chinese officialdom is seeking to put the best complexion on things but the doping scandal is a considerable embarrassment for a country whose sporting aspirations are so entwined with its political and commercial ambitions. China lost face this week in the eyes of the world sporting fraternity and in the process its credibility was harmed in a broader sense, at a moment when it is seeking closer integration with the international community - from membership of world trade organisations such as Gatt to a more active role in arms control. All these international commitments rest to an extent on trust and playing by the rules. China is in the process of trying to convince a sceptical world it will uphold Gatt principles, and honour undertakings to continue liberalising its economy. 'This is the last thing they would have wanted at this stage since international sporting success is part of their attempts to build an image of a comprehensively successful and all-round China,' said a western official in Beijing this week. But the official also noted that the problem of drug-taking in sport is far from confined to China; although few other nations have suffered the embarrassment of having 11 of their athletes, including world-record breaking swimmers, involved in a doping scandal all at once. Before the latest reports emerged from Tokyo, drug-taking among Chinese swimmers had already become a problem. In the past two years five had tested positive, which equalled the number of positive tests by FINA, the international swimming federation, in the previous 22 years. Inevitably, suspicion that such champion swimmers as Lu Bin and Yang Aihua, gold medallists in Rome, had taken steroids is casting doubt over the performance of other Chinese athletes such as women distance runners who have re-written the record books in the past year. Ma Junren, the flamboyant Chinese athletics coach, claims that his 'army' of woman runners owe their outstanding performances to a potion made from crushed turtle, and other exotic ingredients, but rival athletes are sceptical. Compounding Beijing's embarrassment is the fact that at the Asian Games in early October, Chinese sports officials had prevailed on the 43-member Olympic Council of Asia to condemn the western media over the drug-taking allegations at the Rome swimming championships. Wei Jizhong, China's OCA delegate, welcomed the stand of fellow Asians, saying: 'We are happy that the other Asian countries have finally decided to support us.' China won 137 gold medals out of 337 events at the Asian games, more than double the tally of South Korea, its nearest competitor. Its women swimmers won all 15 of their races and set a number of world records in the process. Its women weightlifters dominated, setting 16 world records. China hailed the results in official commentaries as a 'resounding success', and singled out the women swimmers for special praise, saying their 'astonishing performances marked a shift in the balance in a sport which the west had dominated for decades'. Those performances seem somewhat less astonishing now.</p>

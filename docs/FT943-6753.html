			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Hoechst sheds 1,000 jobs Hoechst, the German chemicals group, is to shake out its fine chemicals and textile dyes operations with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs over the next 15 months, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. The company, which this week reported a 39 per cent increase in first-half profits, said 'massive price pressure' from Asian dyestuffs makers had obliged it to restructure its business at three sites in and around Frankfurt, and transfer some of the productive capacity abroad. Fine chemicals had also been hit by low prices and newcomers to the market, especially in Asia. The company said it would concentrate in future only on more sophisticated products such as intermediaries - vehicles for active ingredients in drugs, for example - and food additives. Almost 300 of the affected jobs were to go by the end of this year through early retirement schemes, and the company said it hoped to negotiate voluntary redundancy agreements for the rest.</p>

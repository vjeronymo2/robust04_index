			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices drop after OPEC holds output Oil prices fell sharply yesterday as markets responded to the decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries not to cut output at a time of year when world demand is usually low. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for May delivery was Dollars 13.20 a barrel in late London trading yesterday, 70 cents below Friday's close. It has lost almost Dollars 5 over the past year. Traders said there was scope for prices to test the five-year low of Dollars 12.90 reached earlier this year. 'If it holds at that level then it could bounce back,' said Mr Lindsay Horne, a trader at the London office of Lehman Brothers, a US investment bank. 'But, if it breaks through that barrier, it could go as low as Dollars 12.50,' he added. Opec members, who met in Geneva at the weekend, said they expected the markets' initial reaction to be negative. But they justified their decision to hold the present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day until the end of the year, citing forecasts of higher demand by then. Iran, which had favoured a cut to boost prices, yesterday renewed its criticism of Saudi Arabia, Opec's dominant producer, which refused to take part in any scheme which would reduce its 8m b/d quota. Mr Gholemreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, told a Teheran news conference: 'Saudi Arabia's decision to oppose any decrease in Opec's production ceiling has only served to keep down the price of oil.' Analysts said prices were likely to be volatile next month. Mr Joseph Stanislaw, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris, believes prices will eventually recover if Opec states adhere to the quota. However, he predicted that traders would continue to test Opec's nerves over the next few weeks, and that it might take as long as three months for 'bearish market psychology' to be reversed. The prices will also be influenced by refiners, who must decide in the next few months whether they can put off rebuilding stocks depleted by recent cold weather in the hope of lower prices in future.

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Border boom town sets lesson in trade FOR A DECADE, the town of Mong Cai was almost deserted. As tensions between Vietnam and China spilled over into a bloody border war in 1979, local people were driven out of their homes and forced to move elsewhere. But since they were allowed to return to their homes in 1989, the town's inhabitants have made up for lost time. Today, Mong Cai is a boom town, the main centre of rapidly expanding border trade between the two former enemies. Every day, hundreds of traders load their goods into small boats that chug up and down the river between Vietnam and China. They carry seafood, coconuts, fruit and basic consumer goods into China. On the return journey, they bring construction materials, machinery and other consumer durables to Vietnam. Local government officials estimate that the two-way trade is worth tens of billions of Dong, or millions of dollars, every month. At Mong Cai, there's a thriving market selling Vietnamese produce to Chinese traders and Chinese imports to their Vietnamese competitors. Currency dealers, almost all of them women, do a roaring trade, exchanging Vietnamese Dong for Chinese Renminbi. One dealer said she makes a good living now that the government encourages trade and free enterprise. There's plenty of evidence that the local authorities on either side of the border have good relations. They meet frequently and have regular exchange visits to solve any problems that might hinder the trade on which they are both thriving. The volume of trade would be significantly larger, though, if the two countries could get on as well. Until 1978 a small amount of trade and other border traffic went over a bridge across the border, the so-called Friendship Bridge built in the 1960's by Chinese engineers. The bridge was blown up by Vietnamese Army sappers to stop the Chinese army driving tanks across the border in 1979. Both sides have now reconstructed their halves of the bridge but it hasn't yet been reopened because of an acrimonious dispute over exactly where in the river the border lies. Once the bridge reopens, local officials estimate that border trade will at least double. But until Hanoi and Beijing can resolve their differences over the precise position of the border, all trade will have to be carried on small and inefficient boats. Already, though, Mong Cai is living proof that the economic reform policies being preached in Hanoi are now being practised throughout the country. Every day, dozens of heavily-laden buses and trucks make the journey to the border from Hanoi and other areas of northern Vietnam, as well as from towns along the east coast and as far afield as Saigon, the former capital in the far south. There's also a major building boom going on. Local inhabitants who have returned to the town and other people who have moved in to profit from the border town are constructing new and more elaborate houses for their families. And there's every sign that the trading boom will continue. Mr Nguyen The Phong, the vice chairman of the local government, wants to see the area develop as a tourist resort as well as a trading post. Already, he says, his local authority has signed a joint-venture deal with a Hong Kong company to build a hotel overlooking the five-mile beach just outside Mong Cai. For Mr Phong and his local authority, the main drawback to dreams of expansion is transport. Mong Cai has good beaches and excellent seafood but the nine-hour drive from Hanoi along narrow, potholed roads is enough to deter all but the most determined tourists. Mr Phong, however, has a solution: luckily Mong Cai has an old airfield, built by the French in the days when they ruled Indo-China. 'Refurbish that,' he says, 'and people could come here for the weekend.'</p>

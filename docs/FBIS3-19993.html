			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Hans Guenther Merk, president of  the Federal Statistical Office, has drawn a broadly positive  picture of economic development in the former east Germany.  Speaking to the media in Berlin today, he pointed out that the  renewal and restructuring of the capital stock had made  considerable progress over the last three years. Thus from 1991  to 1993, 342 billion marks [DM] were invested in the new federal  states and the eastern part of Berlin. Of this, DM288 billion  was allocated to the private sector and DM54 billion to the  state.    Merk went on to say that in 1993 the per capita figure for  gross fixed asset investment in the former East Germany exceeded  the level in the former territory of the Federal Republic for  the first time. Net investment per capita was as much as 140  percent higher than in the former territory of the Federal  Republic. Thus the gap in capital stock between eastern and  western Germany had been reduced.    Following the deep economic slump, particularly in 1990 and  1991, and the loss of more than a third of jobs, gross domestic  product increased in real terms by 9.7 percent in 1992 and 7.1  percent in 1993. This had particularly positive effects on the  construction sector. Thus, production in the construction  sector had begun to increase again from mid-1991.    The president of the Federal Statistical Ofice pointed out  that the imbalance on the labor market is still very large. An  annual average of 1.15 million people were unemployed in 1993.  It was also calculated that the burden on the labor market had  been eased by around 1.5 million people due to labor market  measures such as training courses, retraining, and job creation  schemes. At the end of February 1994, 1.3 million people were  registered unemployed.    The gap between incomes of private households in the states  of the former East Germany and in the former Federal Republic  closed significantly, particularly in 1991 and 1992. Disposable  income per capita stood at DM1,450 per month in the second half  of 1993. This is 62 percent of the West German level. In the  second half of 1990 incomes had been 41 percent of the West  German level. Gross salary and wages per employee reached  almost 71 percent of the level in the former West Germany in the  second half of 1993, Merk announced. Compared to the second half  of 1990, they had increased by 124 percent.    Consumer prices rose by 38 percent over this period in the  states of the former East Germany, particularly because of the  alignment of rents and several public service tariffs. The  price hikes have since settled down. In February 1994 the price  index for the cost of living of all employees' households had  only increased by 3.5 percent compared to the same month in 1993.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Advertising curbs put skids on grand prix A SENIOR Socialist yesterday launched an 11th-hour bid to save next year's French grand prix, after the organisers struck it off the calendar for the first time in 37 years because of stringent curbs on tobacco advertising. Mr Michel Charasse, a cigar-smoking former budget minister and now a member of the Senate, the French parliament's upper house, has proposed amending a law against tobacco advertising on television, to allow cars to carry sponsorship stickers. If the senate adopts Mr Charasse's amendment, due for debate next week, it will go on to the National Assembly, which must also give its accord. Tobacco sponsorship is worth an estimated FFr500m (Pounds 61m) a year to French motor racing. He was stirred into action by the previous day's decision by Fisa, the world motor racing federation, to shelve the French grand prix, after courts imposed heavy fines on Renault and the Williams grand prix team for breaking the law. TF1, France's leading television station, also faces court action. To rub salt into the wound, Fisa said the French grand prix could be held elsewhere in Europe. The race was to be held near Nevers, where the mayor happens to be Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister. Formula One is not the only event to suffer. Competitors in next January's Paris-Dakar rally are down 50 per cent and the motorcycling grand prix is under threat.</p>

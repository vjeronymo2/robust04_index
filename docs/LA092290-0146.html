			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS': IS IT COMEDY OR BIGOTRY?  </P> <P> The Times' casual editorial attitude regarding Catholic bashing ("Sister Mary  Ignatius Isn't Happy," Sept. 13) prompts a comment.  </P> <P> The writer notes "There's no question that 'Sister Mary Ignatius' takes a  brutal, satirical look at Catholic dogma, and some will be offended by its  approach."  </P> <P> Having studied the script of the play, I would agree entirely with this  evaluation and point out that, by definition, to satirize is to hold up to  ridicule or scorn.  </P> <P> Ever since "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You" opened in an  off-Broadway theater in 1980, decent and fair-minded people from all sectors of  society, including public officials and legislators around the country, the  Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith as well as the American Jewish  Committee, have condemned this unremitting travesty of Catholic ritual,  tradition and values, with its particularly cruel caricature of Catholic  sisters. Moreover, a serious injustice is added to the insult when such  religious bigotry is supported with tax dollars. But The Times gives the  concern only an editorial shrug and suggests that there are more important  matters to occupy us.  </P> <P> Thank God that racism and anti-Semitism are types of prejudice that are too  disreputable to be supported by most newspapers today. Anti-Catholicism,  however, is apparently one type of bigotry which "enlightened" and  "open-minded" editors continue to tolerate. The Times has once again  demonstrated its concurrence with this fashion.  </P> <P> MOST REVEREND  </P> <P> NORMAN F. MCFARLAND  </P> <P> Bishop of Orange  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- Pro-independence  sentiment in Taiwan hit an all-time high after the March 31  Qiandao Lake incident in which 24 Taiwan tourists killed while  visiting Mainland China, according to results released by the  Gallup Poll Sunday [17 April].    The survey showed that following the Qiandao Lake tragedy,  27  percent of the 1,011 polled supported Taiwan independence, a  record high, and 45.6 percent opposed Taiwan independence, a  record low.    The survey also showed that 74.2 percent of the respondents  believe communist China is hostile to Taiwan.    In southern Taiwan, the support for Taiwan independence was  about equal with support for unification, standing at 36.7  percent and 36.4 percent respectively, the survey found.    The survey indicated that some who were previously  supporters  of reunification are now neutral while some who were previously  neutral are now supporters of independence, the local media  reported.    About 8.5 percent of those surveyed said that Taiwan will  declare independence in the next five years, while 42 percent  said they believe the status quo will prevail.    In the next ten years however, 8.9 percent said they believe  Taiwan will declare independence and 14.3 percent said Taiwan  will maintain the status quo.    Survey results were compiled from 1,011 responses by people  20 years of age or over. The survey has a margin of error of  3.1 percent.</p>

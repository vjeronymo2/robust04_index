			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HANDLING OF POSTER SITUATION WAS TRAGEDY  </P> <P> We at The Works Gallery are appalled by the total lack of vision and courage  shown by the Orange County Airport Arts Commission and the Airport  Administration regarding the commissioned poster by artist Jim Morphesis  ("Airport Poster Plan Melts Away, but Not the Art Uproar," Sept. 2.) I am  horrified by the lack of integrity exemplified by our civic "leaders" in the  process of effectively censoring a truly beautiful work of art.  </P> <P> Beyond the obvious stupidity displayed by the Airport administration in  censoring a work of art no more "obscene" than any classical Greek or Roman  work of art, the handling of this situation is a real tragedy. When one  individual -- (airport commissioner) Robert Cashman -- has the power to  override an entire committee which voted 9-0 to support the work of art and the  selected poster, and to make all decisions pertaining to the art collection of  the airport -- that is a tragedy.  </P> <P> When a single Orange County resident can elect himself "tastemaker" for an  entire community -- after he is quoted in the press as saying, "If they gave us  Michelangelo's 'David' today, I'd put it in a warehouse . . ." -- that is a  tragedy.  </P> <P> It is one thing for a printer to pull his offer to print a poster he doesn't  like; this is a free country. But when that printer also is an official on the  committee deciding the poster's fate -- that is where it gets interesting. This  conflict of interests is the direct result of poorly handled business planning,  typical of the entire airport project. How Cashman could turn a unanimous vote  in support of the poster on Wednesday into a vote of "Gee, I guess it's too  late to print it now, that's just too bad" 72 hours later, is another example  of back-room politics and nepotism.  </P> <P> The Morphesis incident is just one more example of the growing atmosphere of  bureaucratic restraint on the arts being manifested again and again by  individuals who feel they are qualified to decide for the rest of us what is  and what isn't good. I feel it is ironic that the image that Cashman found  offensive was that of Icarus, a man who fancied himself a god and in the effort  to emulate one caused his own demise. Maybe Robert Cashman has just flown too  close to the sun.  </P> <P> MARK MOORE  </P> <P> Director, The Works Gallery  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

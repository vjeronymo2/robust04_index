			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kamil al-Tawil: "Algeria: Salvation Front </F> Advised Not To Exploit Sunday March"]    [Excerpts] London -- Contacts intensified in Algeria  yesterday to ensure the success of the march to be staged  tomorrow [as published] in support of the dialogue and  reconciliation.    Well-informed Algerian sources have revealed to AL-HAYAH  that  there are fears that some elements might "exploit" the march in  favor of a certain party, namely the (disbanded) Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS]. [passage omitted]    In a statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received in  London, FIS denied reports in Algeria of the death of Major  General Abdelkader Shabouti and the murder of Said Makhloufi,  leaders of the Armed Islamic Movement, the FIS' military arm.  The statement said that "the reports (of their death) are  circulated by the defeated security services and some communist  circles with a view to hampering the good offices of unofficial  quarters to calm the situation in the country, and causing  confusion in order to thwart the national march" to be staged  tomorrow [as published], Sunday.

Guy] </F>   [Text] Ventersdorp March 28 SAPA -- The Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] has challenged  the Goldstone Commission to search the African National  Congress' [ANC] headquarters following Monday's shooting during  a Zulu march in Johannesburg.    "In the past he (Mr Justice Richard Goldstone) has not  hesitated to raid sensitive military and state installations,  and has also not hesitated to condemn white right-wing activists  before they have even appeared in court," said a statement by  the AWB's Executive Council on Monday evening. It added that  the AWB had taken note that peace monitors present had observed  that the Zulu march had been peaceful until AK-47-wielding  gunmen opened fire without provocation.    "Let today's events be a warning to the world: the proud  Zulu nation shall not be subjected to communist domination,  either in the form of the ANC or the National Party," the AWB  said.    "Likewise the Boer nation will also not rest until it has  won  freedom in its own land."</p>

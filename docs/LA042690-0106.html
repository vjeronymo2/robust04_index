			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: 'A SHOW ON ANYTHING BUT THE ALEX WOULD BE  SELF-DEFEATING.'  </P> <P> The future of Glendale's Alex Theatre has been studied, debated, wrestled with  and voted upon for the past four years, all with little visible effect.  </P> <P> At last, the problem of the Alex is bending to the sort of energy that was  needed all along, the energy of artists, moved by dreams and gifted with  serendipity.  </P> <P> Under their influence, the 1925 vaudeville house and cinema with its neo-Greek  columned entry and the 1940s obelisk is having its future shaped by the rebirth  of its past.  </P> <P> "Alexander Then and Now," a fantasy journey through the 6 1/2 decades of the  Alex, will play two nights in September, returning live performance to the Alex  stage after a hiatus of decades.  </P> <P> The event will take the form of a hybrid Broadway musical, with singing,  dancing, storytelling, photographic montages, a cast of hundreds and two  essentials of a winning show -- a hero drawn from real life and a celebrity  whose name is bigger than life.  </P> <P> The hero is Bob Caskey, who hired on at the Alexander in 1927, before its name  was shortened, and still works there today in the box office. He's seen  everything, from the secret entrances of movie stars to raffle nights in the  Great Depression.  </P> <P> The celebrity is Bob Hope. He's been a patron of the Alex and has lent his name  to the effort to save it.  </P> <P> Both came to the show by serendipity. But what aspect of "Alexander Then and  Now" hasn't simply fallen into place as if by a will of its own?  </P> <P> The good fortune began almost a year ago, when a committee of the Glendale  Historical Society found itself struggling to will a show into existence. The  Historical Society had concluded, after two years of debate, that the Alex,  soon to be closed by Mann Theatres, should be restored as a house for film and  stage, to become the central cultural element of a revitalized downtown. They  reasoned that a live show would be the best way to consummate the plan and  begin to raise funds.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the society, made up largely of borderline curmudgeons with an  admirable record of grit in fighting City Hall and a competent, if leaden, way  with historical fact, was hardly the kind of group likely to make a dancing  chorus appear.  </P> <P> Then came Paul Shipton, a New York transplant, veteran stage dancer, Hollywood  choreographer, classical dance instructor and creator of extravaganzas. Shipton  moved to Glendale four years ago and was beginning to wonder where the art  scene was.  </P> <P> One day, Shipton called on Shirley Seeley, executive director of the Glendale  Symphony. She referred him to the Historical Society.  </P> <P> Shipton concluded that what it needed was someone who could write, cast, direct  and choreograph a show. He said he was available if they didn't already have  someone in mind. They didn't.  </P> <P> It was soon decided that there would be two shows, one for the public at $15 a  ticket and another by invitation with a considerably higher price tag. Shipton  quickly settled on two things. The show should be a musical and it should tell  the story of the Alex.  </P> <P> The history itself captured Shipton's imagination. There were the vaudeville  shows, the Hollywood events -- premieres with stars such as Elizabeth Taylor in  the audience -- the raffle nights of the Great Depression, the bond rally of  World War II.  </P> <P> "We realized that doing a show on anything but the history of the Alex would be  self-defeating," he said, "The one thing the musical is going to do is alert  the citizens of Glendale what they have in the Alex."  </P> <P> Before Shipton knew there was a real Bob Caskey, he began to think of building  the story around a central character who would narrate. The idea was to invent  a janitor or usher.  </P> <P> "We were going to do a very artificial character," Shipton said. "Then Bob  showed up. It was like a gift from heaven."  </P> <P> Caskey became Shipton's "Icon of Glendale." He filled in the lore of the Alex  with details about Louis B. Mayer sitting in his private loge to supervise  premieres; about Bing Crosby waiting in the lobby in terror wondering how an  audience would take to a crooner playing a priest in "Going My Way;" about  Ginger Rogers sneaking in to see her own premieres.  </P> <P> Caskey's role will be played by Russ Marin, a professional actor who is  volunteering his time. Shipton is now auditioning to fill the myriad cameo  appearances of the Clara Bows and Bessie Loves and to recreate, en masse, the  dance shows of Fanchon and Marco.  </P> <P> But, through a final gem of good fortune, one role did not have to be cast. It  happened this way: Shipton recruited his friend, Ralph Ziegler, the financial  manager of Triad Artists, the talent agency that represents Bob Hope. Ziegler  had never asked Hope for a favor before, but thought, because of the personal  tie, it might be a good time.  </P> <P> He floated the idea to Hope's agent, Frank Rio. There were negotiations.  </P> <P> "Finally, he said, 'Yes, let's go ahead,' " Ziegler said. Hope will mingle with  the crowd before the gala performance and, as he did in the old days, sit down  to watch the show.  </P></p>

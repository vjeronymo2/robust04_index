			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Ziff Many a media group will run its slide rule over Ziff Communications in coming weeks. The family-owned US publisher, which was put up for sale last week, is an attractive property. Ziff is the world's largest publisher of computer magazines, a fast-growing segment of the print media. It also owns ZiffNet, an on-line information service about computers, which should appeal given the current multimedia vogue. Not surprisingly, speculation is rife over possible bidders. France's Matra-Hachette, K-III of the US and VNU of the Netherlands have said they are interested. Other names bandied around include Reed Elsevier, Bertelsmann, News Corporation, Time Warner and Times Mirror. Though many may be interested, few could plausibly afford the touted Dollars 2bn-plus price tag. VNU is too small to buy the whole group and the Ziff family have made clear they would prefer not to sell it in several chunks. Similarly, the balance sheets of Hachette, K-III, News Corporation and Time Warner look rather stretched. Reed Elsevier, Bertelsmann and Times Mirror are more likely contenders. The Anglo-Dutch group, in particular, has indicated it is keen to make further acquisitions following last year's Dollars 417m purchase of Official Airline Guides. But though Ziff might fit the bill, it is not the only fish in the sea.</p>

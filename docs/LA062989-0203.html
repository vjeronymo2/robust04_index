			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> JURY ALLOWS WOMAN TO SUE WINFIELD  </P> <P> A jury decided that outfielder Dave Winfield's live-in relationship with the  mother of his 6-year-old daughter was a common-law marriage, opening the door  to divorce and property proceedings.  </P> <P> The verdict could force the New York Yankee slugger to pay the woman half his  income of the last seven years.  </P> <P> The jury Wednesday voted 10 to 2 in favor of Sandra Renfro, a 34-year-old  Houston flight attendant who said she and Winfield lived as husband and wife  from 1982 to 1985. Winfield married another woman in a formal ceremony in 1988.  A divorce hearing is set for July 10.  </P> <P> Winfield did not dispute fathering the child but denied that he ever intended  to marry Renfro. He testified he has been paying $1,400 monthly child support  and provided a condominium for Renfro and his daughter. Winfield, who has been  out all season because of a back injury, left the courtroom after the verdict  without commenting.  </P> <P> Tom Alexander, Winfield's lawyer, said he will appeal.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Delayed launch for missile A NEW air-to-surface nuclear missile which the US wants to deploy in Europe and is also a prime contender for a British contract is not now expected to be ready for service before 1998, three years later than planned. The setback to plans for the SRAM-T, a tactical nuclear derivative of Boeing's short-range attack missile, emerged in recent evidence by the US Air Force to a sub-committee of the House of Representatives' Armed Services Committee. Plans for new tactical air-to-surface missiles are crucial to Nato's commitment to maintaining European-based nuclear forces, since all its remaining ground-launched nuclear weapons in Europe are due to be withdrawn or negotiated away. The SRAM-T project has been dogged by technical problems and the reluctance of European Nato governments to say publicly they will host the new US weapons. Mr Dan Plesch of the British-American Security Information Council, a research group opposed to Nato nuclear weapon plans, said the project's predicament would put pressure on the UK government to state clearly its readiness to have the missiles de ployed at US bases in Britain. The UK has meanwhile put off deciding whether to buy from the US or join a French project in order to provide a similar nuclear capability for the RAF. The latter's current free-fall nuclear bombs will be obsolete by the decade's end. The British Defence Ministry has been considering the SRAM-T as well as a version of Martin Marietta's Supersonic Low Altitude Target (Slat) missile and the French Air-Sol Longue Portee (ASLP) project. Officials now argue that the missile decision can wait while a UK warhead is developed.</p>

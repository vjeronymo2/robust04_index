			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK AIRPORT CLEARED TO APPLY FOR NOISE-RELIEF FUNDS  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration has given Burbank Airport approval to apply  for funds to soundproof nearby homes and schools as part of a long-range  noise-relief program, airport officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I think it's a significant accomplishment," said Thomas Greer, director of  airport services. "We feel real good that we've gotten to this point."  </P> <P> Some area residents, however, said that they oppose the noise-relief plan  altogether because they believe it will encourage airport officials to expand  the operation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not a Solution'  </P> <P> "This is definitely not a solution" to the noise problems, said Wally Berns,  leader of the Burbank Flatlanders Home Protection League.  </P> <P> The FAA notified the airport Monday of its eligibility for the federal funds,  Greer said. The FAA's decision was based on a noise study that concluded that  the airport should spend about $50 million to soundproof 2,300 homes and four  schools in the surrounding area, Greer said. The money also could be used to  buy some or all of 54 homes adjacent to the airport, he said.  </P> <P> Spokesman Victor Gill said the airport will apply for federal money for  specific projects on a year-to-year basis over the next 10 years to implement  the noise-relief program. He cautioned homeowners to be patient, saying Burbank  Airport must compete with 185 other airports across the country for the same  money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Encourage Expansion  </P> <P> Berns said such a plan would encourage future expansion of the airport. "All  this is a ploy by the airport to take away any threat of future lawsuits," he  said.  </P> <P> He said he would rather see the airport limit the number of flights and change  its flight patterns to share the noise with other area residents.  </P> <P> Airport officials maintain that they cannot legally restrict the number of  airlines using the airport. They said pilots oppose changing flight patterns  for safety reasons.  </P> <P> "This fight is just starting," Berns said. "It's going to be a never-ending  battle."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Karima Goulmamine: "Where Is the State?"; first </F> paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] This time, for once, the women had an hour of  freedom of expression in front of Ibn Khaldoun Hall. It happened  yesterday.    This 8 March (International Women's Day), Algerian women  rejecting fundamentalism and fanaticism answered the call by the  Rally of Algerian Women for Democracy (RAFD) to challenge the  state and remind it of its mission. Cries reflecting pain,  anger, protest, and above all the attitude that: "I have had it  up to here" were heard as the women expressed their deepest  feelings.    Their number included women who had lost their husbands,  brothers, or friends.    The family of the martyrs of hate-blinded terrorism was  there  to try to save what was left. But it must be said that 8 March  in this year of 1994 was different. There were no longer any of  the customary demonstrations or marches through the streets of  the capital.    This time, for once, the women had an hour of freedom of  expression in front of Ibn Khaldoun Hall. Blocking all traffic  so they could chant their slogans: "Where, where is the  government?," "No to Djaballah" [Islamic Renaissance Movement  leader], "No to Nahnah," and "No dialogue with the murderers who  think they are war veterans."    Those expressions had to be sincere because they came from  women acquainted with suffering: the wives of Liabes and  Djillali Belkhenchir. In the eyes of all women who are  determined when it comes to defending human rights, the state  must react so that blood will stop flowing and so that 8 March  will remain eternal.    In a letter sent by them to Liamine Zeroual, they challenge  him, saying that women refuse to be sacrificed once again on the  altar of a suicidal policy or of dialogue based on horse  trading. "Yes, Mr. President, the bloodthirsty sect is  continuing to bleed Algeria on this 8 March, the eve of Aid el  Fitr."    "Mr. President, genuine dialogue regarding the modern future  of Algeria must include the women and men who believe in it and  who are trying every day to protect this country from an Islamic  diktat."    In a separate development, the Socialist Forces Front (FFS)  says in a statement that women are fervent fighters for human  rights. It makes a most alarming observation, however. It says  that in all the confusion, women are powerless witnesses to the  tragedies that are occurring, being held hostage between  terrorism and institutional violence, to which are added the  sufferings of everyday life.    It also mentions the absence of any official text to provide  security and protection for women, who continue to be the  victims of obscurantism and illiteracy. It also points out that  no mention is being made of the ardently demanded suppression of  exclusionary laws, including, among others, the Family Code. The  date of 8 March used to be a kind of holiday on which women  could review the progress made and call for more. Women are now  reduced to asking for the most basic right: the right to live.</p>

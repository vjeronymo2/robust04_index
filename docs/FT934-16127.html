			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / French parliament hails return of a Bourbon A BOURBON - King Juan Carlos of Spain - was back yesterday in the Palais Bourbon, as the classical building which houses France's national assembly on the banks of the Seine was once known. The stir caused by the presence of the Spanish monarch, himself a descendant of Louis XlV, in the French parliament was nothing to do with any royalist revanchism or indeed what King Juan Carlos said; he delivered a 30-minute eulogy on the good state of French-Spanish relations. The controversy, rather, centred on the fact that Mr Philippe Seguin, the maverick Gaullist president of the national assembly, had had the temerity to invite, off his own bat, King Juan Carlos to be the first foreign leader to address the French parliament since President Woodrow Wilson in 1919. As far as the government and the Foreign Ministry in particular, are concerned, the legislature is straying dangerously into the executive's foreign policy patch. Yet Mr Seguin, who is campaigning to enhance the image of what is one of Europe's weakest legislatures, called the king's visit 'a great day' for parliament. Mr Seguin won praise from flattered MPs of all sides for pulling off his 'Juan Carlos' coup, but many deputies are less than pleased by his other moves to make their legislature more business-like. In order to increase flagging attendance, Mr Seguin has for instance forbidden individual deputies to cast electronic votes for absent colleagues, as they had freely done so in the past. President Francois Mitterrand himself shares some of Mr Seguin's aims, having proposed last spring that the constitution should be changed to give parliament more time and scope to organise its business. But the Balladur government wanted to limit such a constitutional change. It now finds, however, the other part of the legislature - the Senate which is not even directly elected - is taking a leaf out of Mr Seguin's book. It has invited Chancellor Helmut Kohl to address it next week .</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lord Finsberg, rapporteur for the Cyprus problem to  the Political Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe  Parliamentary Assembly, has stated that he observed a sincere  goodwill on the part of the Turkish Cypriots with regard to  assisting the UN secretary general in his efforts to assemble  the confidence-building measures package. Lord Finsberg left  the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] after concluding  his contacts.    In a statement he issued to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News  Agency], Lord Finsberg stressed that he had observed  considerable goodwill on the Turkish side. Stating that  constructive and useful exchange of views were conducted while  he was in the TRNC, Finsberg said he observed that the Turkish  side assisted the UN secretary general in assembling the  confidence-building measures.    Stating that north Cyprus would benefit from successful  negotiations, Finsberg stressed that he encountered the same  goodwill in north Cyprus as he did in south Cyprus. Reiterating  his decision to advise the COE Parliamentary Assembly members in  favor of hearing the Turkish Cypriots' voice, Lord Finsberg  added that work will be undertaken to enable the TRNC political  party leaders' participation in the parliamentary assembly.    Reiterating that it is impossible to fill the chair  representing the Turkish side for the time being, Lord Finsberg  added that he believes that the TRNC political party leaders  will be invited to the parliamentary assembly once progress is  made on the confidence-building measures and on a solution to  the Cyprus issue.</p>

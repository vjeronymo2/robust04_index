			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Mexico sells banking stake for 2.71bn pesos THE Mexican government has sold just over 66 per cent of Multibanco Comermex, the nation's fourth largest bank, for 2.71bn pesos (Dollars 872m), equivalent to 21 times last year's earnings and 3.73 times book value. The extraordinarily high multiple reflects a growing desperation among some Mexican brokers to buy a bank before it is too late. The government has already sold the country's three largest banks, and of the seven remaining, none has the national coverage of Comermex. Banamex, Bancomer and Serfin, the three largest banks, have been sold for 2.62, 2.99 and 2.69 times book value respectively. Comermex has assets of 24bn pesos, 6.4 per cent of the total in the banking system, and 352 branches spread across the country. Grupo Financiero Inverlat, the holding company of the large brokerage by that name, outbid its nearest competitor by a mere 2.81 per cent, and paid 1,029 pesos per share. Inverlat had previously failed in its attempt to buy two banks. The result will come as a bitter disappointment to Invermexico, the brokerage which missed out on buying Banamex, Mexico's largest bank. A group of top executives who had been forced to resign from Inverlat after a boardroom disagreement, recently joined Invermexico. The rivalry between the two brokerages may in part explain why the bids were so high. Inverlat has 26 branches in Mexico and one in New York. Its president, Mr Agustin Legorreta, is from Mexico's leading banking family. The bank has been conservatively managed in the past decade, and with a more aggressive strategy could increase its share of the loan market. In common with many Mexican banks, it made much of its money in the late 1980s from trading in the money market.</p>

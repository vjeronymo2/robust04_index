			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (9): Big ticket players take the risks - Robert Alldis finds that companies are now being made more aware of the industry FINANCE directors of small and medium sized companies are not fully aware of the benefits of leasing, believes Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the Finance and Leasing Association and vice-chairman of Hambros Bank. The FLA reckons leasing and hire purchase represents around 23 per cent of total investment in fixed plant and machinery. But the association is now working hard to make companies more aware of its industry. The FLA is currently circulating, through Department of Trade and Industry sponsored outlets, information on the benefits of leasing. But more can still be known - so what can finance and leasing companies do and offer? The major league ('big ticket') players are led by Lombard North Central, part of the National Westminster Bank group. Mr Peter Torrance, its director of marketing of business finance, estimates his company's asset base is worth around Pounds 8bn. But though Lombard North is big - and with the largest leasing sales force in the UK - Mr Torrance emphasises the value of maintaining a specialised and customer-based service: 'Nearly all our work is done direct, face-to-face and we do relatively little via brokers. We see our strength as coming from the specialist coverage offered by our sales force.' Lombard North offers customers a full range of lease/purchase packages (currently it helps finance a wide number of specialist contract hire services including vehicle hire, fork-lift truck hire and PC systems hire). But on the finance leasing side and bigger ticket deals, the size of Lombard North's asset base means that it has a tax capacity big enough to enable clients to get their tax allowances early. More recently, Lombard North has linked up with GATX (Asset Residual Management) - an UK offshoot of GATX of the US - to help companies lay off their residual risk profile. Mr Torrance explains: 'In car contract hire for example, you are providing not just the finance, but also the ordering of the vehicle, servicing and maintenance and so on. But at the end of the contract, the car is returned, and the contracting company now has to get rid of it either at a profit, break-even or loss.' If the lessor, when initially negotiating the contract, overestimates the value of the car at the end of the contractual period, he or she will be out of pocket. The accuracy (or otherwise) of the estimate is the lessor's 'residual risk'. As such estimates are difficult in nearly all but a few sectors where there is sufficient volume or a healthy second-hand market (such as motor cars and some printing products), leasing companies are reluctant to take on that risk profile. So, Lombard North Central and GATX are now offering residual risk guarantees to lessors as a form of insurance. Mr Torrance says that this should eventually make it easier for leasing companies to extend their product leasing portfolios into new sectors. At Barclays Mercantile Business Finance (BMBF), Mr John Callender, the managing director, estimates his risk profile is worth around Pounds 250m out of an overall small-ticket portfolio of Pounds 1.5bn. The bank arranges for this risk to be taken on either by itself or by a third party. BMBF also has 50 per cent of the agricultural leasing market through its Highland business, which, including its big ticket operations, brings the total portfolio nearer Pounds 5bn. As a big ticket finance company, 'BMBF is one of the few leasing businesses that focuses entirely on the corporate market,' Mr Callender says. Like London North, he is aware of the need to be conscious of his client's needs: 'Our principal aim is to get closer to the customer and structure the lease accordingly.' Leasing companies are therefore tetchy when accused of offering an inflexible package which will tie a client into an investment (echoed by dubious practices in the photocopier leasing market) that he or she has not really thought through. Rather, leasing companies - by developing sales forces - reflect the specific requirements of the client. 'The lessor can structure the risk on the residual so it is shared, with the risk on credit being taken by the financier,' says Hambros' Mr Mallin. Leasing companies now offer a tailor-made product which includes all elements of its services to the client in a single deal. But this does not mean you have to be big to offer a flexible product. ING Lease (UK) is one of a number of foreign leasing companies operating in Britain. ING's basic product area is in the block discount market, explains Mr Roy Royer, senior manager in charge of its market department in London. The company is run separately from ING Bank's London operations, reporting directly to Amsterdam. ING Lease opened its doors in London three years ago and has built the size of its UK portfolio to around Pounds 260m pounds. Mr Royer says his company's leasing business now covers the UK, with most of its clients coming through referral by intermediaries, vendors or other banks. As they are not restricted to a set package or rate charge, ING's 33-strong asset finance team (all skilled in every part of the leasing deal) can perhaps offer a total and less bureaucratic service than a big UK leasing company. But foreign banks are unlikely ever to become big players in the UK finance and leasing market since, says a lessor at another foreign bank: 'To have the UK tax capacity, the lessor has to be incorporated there.' However, it is not just the banks that are making the running in the leasing market, a number of manufacturing companies have also set up their own leasing operations to help sell their product. Two leaders major players have been Kodak and Rank Xerox. Both offer captive lease products and avoid using any dealer network in the niche photocopier market. According to Mr David Melville, manager of Kodak Finance, his leasing book is now worth around Pounds 50m since it started finance leasing in 1989. And like Kodak, Rank Xerox is offering a range of packages from straight rental, cost per copy to lease/purchase. Mr Roger Eves, general manager at Rank Xerox Finance, estimates that 80 per cent of his sales are now financed through leasing. Similar growth in the captive leasing market has also been happening in the automobile sector. Mercedes-Benz Finance, for instance, since it started operations in late 1990, now finances one in four of its passenger car and commercial vehicle registrations.</p>

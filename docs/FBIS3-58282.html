			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Einar Koch; </F> place and date not given: "Mr. Scharping, Should Poland Become a  NATO Member?"]    [Text] [Koch] Mr. Scharping, our East European neighbors  are pushing themselves under NATO's protective shield because  they are afraid of Russia....    [Scharping] The fear of the Central and East European states  that they will once again be dominated by Moscow as in the past  must be taken seriously. The supreme goal is security.    Therefore, it is useful to give states such as Poland,  Hungary, and Czechia, and perhaps even Slovakia and others, a  security policy prospect by using the existing instruments of  NATO and CSCE.    [Koch] Can this be done overnight?    [Scharping] No, one must also take the legitimate security  interests of Russia and the other CIS states into account.    We must not give any cheap excuses to the nationalist,  partly  fascist, and in any case antiwestern and antidemocratic forces  in Russia. Therefore, this will have to be a step-by-step  process, which particularly must not ignore the economic side.  There are large markets for us in the East.    [Koch] Should Russia also become a NATO member in the long  run?    [Scharping] I think Russia's accession to NATO is not  realistic from today's point of view.</p>

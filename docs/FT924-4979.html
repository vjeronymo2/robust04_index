			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Illustrating 'Once upon a time' - Michael Glover reflects on the story of children's picture books BY 1802, the year in which Wordsworth wrote his great 'Ode on the Intimations of Immortality', the notion that children were a unique species deserving of attention in their own right, and not merely dwarfish adults-in-the-making, was already in popular currency. And what better as a means of educating this species than books with pictures in them? The publishing of childrens' books with accompanying illustrations began in earnest in the 1840s and accelerated as the 19th century moved towards its close. Sophisticated methods of using engravings beside printed text were invented and refined; and the middle decades of the century saw the appearance of three great talents who were to revolutionise the world of illustrated childrens' books: Hans Hoffman in Germany, whose Struwelpeter of 1845, a ferocious tale originally devised for some hapless, cowering three-year-old, was rapidly translated into many other European languages, including English; Edward Lear, that morose painter of bird-life, whose nonsense rhymes were first published in 1846; and the Rev Charles Dodgson (better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll), the Oxford logician, whose partnership with the successful professional caricaturist (of Punch), John Tenniel, was to produce perhaps the greatest illustrated childrens' classic of all time, Alice in Wonderland. And then, as the capacity to print in colour developed, other great names appeared: Caldecott, Crane and Potter, for example. Some of the finest achievements in childrens' book illustration, spanning the period from 1840 to the present day, are on display at the National Gallery of Scotland until the end of December and they demonstrate how haphazard the process of writing and publishing books for this untested market must have been. So much seems to have depended upon relationships between illustrators and particular children, for example. Beatrix Potter's earliest tales developed out of her habit of writing letters to child friends, in which she would describe the antics of her own pet rabbits, with appropriate doodles in the margins. The Tale of Peter Rabbit was rejected by publishers so many times that she decided to produce it at her own expense in 1901, with a single black-and-white illustration as frontispiece. After its appearance, Macmillan offered to publish the book with colour illustrations and Potter was able to take advantage of the recent discovery of the 3-colour printing process to achieve the harmonious greens and browns of her now-so-familiar garden settings. The exhibition shows her studies of rabbits, minutely observed, and a watercolour of that garden in Wales where so many of the early stories were set. All this preliminary work demonstrates a remarkable capacity for prolonged and detailed academic preparation. Lewis Carroll, too, was a great perfectionist - and he, too, paid for the publication of the first edition of Alice in 1865, though Macmillan distributed it. His relationship with the equally pedantic Tenniel (some of whose Alice engravings are on display in the exhibition) was a stormy one, the artist on one occasion flatly refusing to illustrate 'a wasp in a wig'. Carroll withdrew the chapter altogether. The exhibition also enables us to compare how different illustrators have interpreted the same text - Stevenson's Treasure Island, for example. Ralph Steadman's remarkable depiction of Long John Silver in a tavern, surrounded by carousing piratical types, is full of violence and blood-lust; little, if anything, remains of Stevenson's description of Silver as a 'clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.' Mervyn Peake's wonderful pen-and-ink illustration of Billy Bones, which appeared in an edition of 1949, strips Bones back to his meanest essentials, grotesquely simplifying the features to such an extent that the character looks positively haunted by the evil in his heart. For every illustrator, it seems, there is a new Stevenson to be discovered. The exhibition's greatest and most pleasurable surprise is Randolph Caldecott, clerk by profession, whose marvellous watercolours of frogs and mice in motion, skipping and leaping about, or at supper, looking like bloated bon viveurs in their ridiculous 18th century costumes, accompanied his 'Toy Books' of the 1880s. Caldecott is scarcely in print these days and certainly not in editions that show his achievements off to any advantage; and that is a tragedy because, from the evidence available in this exhibition, he was perhaps the most influential illustrator of the 19th century. And evidence of that enduring influence is to be found in almost every new picture book for children involving anthropomorphised animals on the run. Once Upon A Time, an exhibition of children's bookillustrations, is on display at the National Gallery of Scotland, The Mound, Edinburgh, until December 27</p>

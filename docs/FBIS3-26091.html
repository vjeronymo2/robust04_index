Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of ARATS, and Chiao  Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary general of SEF, made the  remarks at a press conference right after their meeting here  this afternoon. It was the second meeting between the two side  since Chiao Jen-ho arrived here Monday. Zou Zhekai, vice  president and secretary general of ARATS, was also in attendance.    The name of the document, or the declaration, has not been  decided yet, the said.    The document will consist of two major aspects: first,  important understanding reached between the two organs during  this talk, including "to continue to insist on the  non-governmental nature of the discussions and that neither side  should force upon the other its political viewpoints in  discussions of such issues as the repatriation of plane  hijackers"; secondly, visible progress in discussion of the  issues of the repatriation of hijackers, the treatment of  maritime fishing disputes, and repatriation of other personnel  who have crossed the straits in violation of relevant  regulations.    Both sides regarded their meeting as being harmonious and  frank and sad that the gap between them is shortening after  exchange of views.    Deputy secretary generals of the two organizations will team  up two working groups and start to discuss concerned details  tomorrow.    Tang reiterated that the possibility of signing a  non-governmental agreement in the future to guarantee the  investment on both sides is not excluded.    The premise for realizing such an agreement is that Taiwan  must open its market for manufactured or partially manufactured  goods of the mainland, cancel restrictions on Taiwan  businessmen's investment on the mainland and open its labor  market, Tang pointed out.    He suggested that the two organs should discuss, as soon as  possible, such issues as the rights and interests of Taiwan  investors on the mainland and related issues, scientific and  technological exchanges and the sponsoring of non-governmental  economic fairs.    Economic exchange and cooperation has become an important  content of the relations between the two sides across the Taiwan  Straits, Tang noted.    The investment of Taiwan entrepreneurs on the mainland  played  a positive role in contributing to the economic prosperity of  the mainland and the trade between the two sides reached a new  level last year, he said.    In 1993, Taiwan's surplus with the United States declined,  and its trade deficit with Japan continued to rise. However,  its trade retained a rather large surplus last year. Tang  pointed out that this had much to do with the soaring trade  between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits.    Other sides agree that cultural and educational exchanges  between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits should be  broadened in principle.    ARATS will organize visits to the island by the mainlands  news media officials, senior journalists and students this year,  Tang aid.    At the same time, ARATS is ready to receive mass media  officials and senior journalists and students from Taiwan, he  said.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: French right in a tough mood - Serious clash of wills in prospect with President Mitterrand PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand will no doubt have some soul-searching to do in the next week or so after last night's crushing defeat of his Socialist party, its worst general election result for 25 years. The exact make-up of the national assembly will not be known until the results of next weekend's second round of voting. But computer projections last night indicated that the alliance of conservative RPR and centre-right UDF may win all but 100 of the 577 assembly seats, a record majority. The Socialists may get 10-12 per cent of parliamentary seats, on 19 per cent of the vote, thereby losing more than two-thirds of their present MPs. If voters go the same way in the second round, the new right-wing government will be able to exert its will against the weakened but still crafty Mr Mitterrand as never before. The right had a majority of only four seats in the last 'cohabitation' government of 1986-1988. This time, Mr Jacques Chirac, RPR leader, has promised that the president will be allowed no 'private domains', suggesting that a serious clash of wills is on the way. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president and current UDF leader, refused to be drawn on what action Mr Mitterrand should take as a result of last night's humiliation. 'It is a matter for him,' he said. Mr Alain Juppe, RPR secretary-general, was more blunt. 'To govern, you need continuity and unity at the head of state. My profound wish is that Mr Mitterrand draws the consequences if these results are confirmed in the second round,' he said. While the right would not govern aggressively, it would make no concessions. Mr Chirac, by contrast, warned his supporters against 'an excess of optimism'. He was perhaps sensitive to the fact that the UPF's (the UDF and RPR alliance) overall share of the vote, at around 40 per cent, was roughly the same as in the last general election in 1988, when the Socialists won a relative parliamentary majority with 37.5 per cent of the vote, which compares with the 19 per cent or so they were estimated to have gained yesterday. Even so, RPR officials were astonished at the size of their forecast victory. 'It is almost too much. It won't be healthy if there is no structured opposition in the national assembly,' said Mr Bernard Pons, the party's chief parliamentary whip. The next important battle will be between the RPR and UDF, for the choice of prime minister. By tradition, Mr Mitterrand chooses a prime minister soon after the end of the second round from the party with the most seats. Under the written constitution, he is free to choose whom he likes. Last night, with first round counting complete in more than 500 of the National Assembly's 577 constituencies, it appeared that the RPR and the UDF were running neck-and-neck and had each taken between 19 and 20 per cent of the vote. On this basis it was unclear which of the two parties would emerge with the stronger claim to provide the next prime minister. The other big surprise last night was the poor showing of the two ecology parties, Les Verts and Generation Ecologie, which appeared to have won a mere 8.5 per cent of votes, less than the extreme right-wing National Front, which took 12 per cent. In pre-election polls the ecologists were winning as much as 16 per cent of the vote. They could now end up with no seats, while the National Front could win two. Ecology leaders attributed this to the fact that many of their own candidates had joined the party as an experiment and therefore lacked conviction in voters' eyes. The signs are that their disillusioned former supporters swung right rather than left, another indication of the strength of last night's broad swing away from the Socialists.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE MAIN PARTIES: FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Communist leader Georges Marchais  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'We have always been underestimated since the start of this campaign ...   We invite the electors to vote Communist to say what is in their   hearts, rather than to commit themselves ideologically to all we stand   for.' Founded 1920 Once had 166 MPs (in 1946), but controlled only 26 seats in 1988. Want to tax speculation and control export of capital to promote   investment at home, and to move towards 35-hour work week without any   reduction in pay. Hostile to reform of EC farm policy and to Gatt negotiations. Generally against the Maastricht treaty, particularly to joint European   defence  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Verts leader Antoine Waechter  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Having despised us for 10 years, the Socialist Party has been courting   us for the past 10 months.' Founded 1984. No MPs. Campaigning on a common policy with Generation Ecologie, but is   ideologically more anti-nuclear and pro-conservation than its partner. Answer to unemployment to move directly to 35-hour work week and job   promotion (municipal clean-ups) in the non-market economy. Split on Maastricht, prefers 'a Europe of regions.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Generation Ecologie leader Brice Lalonde  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Responding to Michel Rocard's offer to form new leftwing coalition as a   political Big Bang;   'Rocard yes, the Socialists no. The Bang yes, the Gang no.' Founded since the last parliamentary election by Brice Lalonde, who   quit his job as environment minister in the Rocard government to set   up the party in 1990. No MPs. Supporters include many disillusioned Socialists. Same broad policy as the Greens, but more pro-EC  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Michel Rocard, former prime minister and Socialists' likely presidential candidate  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'What we need is a broad movement. . .embracing reformminded ecologists,   centrists faithful to a social tradition, truly renovated   communists. . .a political Big Bang.' Long history, but modern party dates from 1971. Their 1988 victory with 266 seats (including those of 19 allies) brought   them back in power. They have maintained a strong franc and a modest programme to sell-off   of companies they nationalised when they first entered government in   1981. Faced with mounting unemployment, they have proposed work-sharing. The government agreed to EC farm reform last year but has threatened to   veto a Gatt deal.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Union pour la Democratie francaise leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'The fact that there will be a coherent new team in government, with   clear ideas, will be a factor for confidence.' Founded in 1978 as a federation of five separate centre-right parties. Won 128 seats in 1988 election. Fighting current election on a common platform with the RPR under the   name of Union pour la France (UPF). The UDF is more free-market and pro-EC than its RPR partner, and more   favourable to decentralisation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rassemblement pour la Republique leader Jacques Chirac:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In warning President Francois Mitterrand not to try to thwart a future   conservative government:   'We will accept no obstacle of any kind to our action. Nothing and no   one will prevent us from applying our policies.' Founded in 1947 by de Gaulle but later renamed Won 125 seats in 1988. More nationalist and anti-EC than its UDF partner. The common platform of both parties calls for privatisation, budget   cuts, and autonomy for the Banque de France. Large majority of RPR leaders favour keeping the franc strong. But RPR, for which most farmers vote, is very hostile to both EC and   Gatt farm reforms.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Front National leader Jean-Marie Le Pen  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Immigration is the chief cause of rising unemployment, insecurity,   taxes and welfare payments.' Founded in 1972 by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen. Party currently has one MP. Extreme-right wing. Policies centre on immigration. Would give priority to French in jobs, housing and welfare, and organise   the return home of immigrants. Strongly anit-Maastricht.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

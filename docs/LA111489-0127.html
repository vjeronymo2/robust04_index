			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CLOSER COUNCIL TIES TO ADVISERS URGED  </P> <P> Communication is muddled between the City Council and its various advisory  boards and commissions, a blue ribbon committee warned Monday.  </P> <P> Council members indicated they plan to appoint a committee to help solve the  problem.  </P> <P> The blue-ribbon committee, which studied the situation for nine months, said  Mayor Wes Bannister should meet regularly with each board, should hold  quarterly round-table meetings with the leaders and should hold annual banquets  to honor them all.  </P> <P> Some board members "feel you're so far removed from them, you are the  untouchables," committee member Noble Waite told the council. Waite was a  councilman from 1958 to 1962.  </P> <P> The committee also suggested eliminating the youth board, which it found  largely ineffective. Council members agreed to study the idea.  </P> <P> Advisory boards and commissions are designed to help guide the council on  issues ranging from historic preservation to arts to transportation. After a  January meeting at which council members agreed they were displeased with their  relationship with these boards, Bannister called for the blue-ribbon committee,  composed of former council members Ron Shenkman, Norma Gibbs, Waite and Ruth  Finley.  </P> <P> Another committee will be named to implement the recommendations by June. JOHN  PENNER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 25 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador to Seoul  James Laney flatly denied Wednesday reports that Washington  pressed Seoul to buy Patriot Missiles.    He said the Patriots were brought here by the United States  for its own deterrence purposes as to send the message to  Pyongyang that the South's defenses are strong in a speech at  the Press Center sponsored by the Parliamentarians' Society of  Korea.    He also brushed aside reports that the United States was  exaggerating the situation on the Korean peninsula, saying  Washington was neither cooking nor imagining threat from North  Korea.    He cited reports by the safeguards team of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), now in Pyongyang for additional  nuclear inspections, that no spent fuel has been diverted since  1989 based on camera surveillance.    "This means there was no diversion since 1989," he said.    Laney, however, quoted U.S. intelligence which states that  diversion might have occurred during the discharge of fuel rods  in 1989.    He said the U.N. nuclear watchdog is now working to clarify  the history of the process before 1989 by taking samples.    Laney reiterated that North Korea must satisfy not only  South  Korea and the United States, but the whole world that it is not  pursuing a nuclear program.    "With this assurance (that Pyongyang has given up its  nuclear  ambitions), we will be prepared, in full consultation with South  Korea, to begin the process of normalizing both diplomatic and  economic ties with North Korea," he said.    "North Korea must open up to the point for their interests,  not for U.S. interests," he said.    To reduce tension, he said, "they (North Koreans) have to  make a move." "We (the United States) have our doors open...It  is not us isolating North Korea. North Korea has isolated  itself," he said.</p>

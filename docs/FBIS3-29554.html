			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from the Olympic market in Phnom Penh entitled: </F> "The National Assembly Member and Traders at Olympic Market  Expose the Two-Headed Government's Internal Dispute Over the  Personal and Family Interests"]    [Excerpt] Following the dispute between Thai Boon Rong  Company and the traders at Olympic market, there have been  comments that Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh should not have  sided with the puppet Hun Sen in opposing Sam Rangsi who is the  vice chairman of the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an  Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party  and finance minister of the two-headed government.    According to a National Assembly member from the FUNCINPEC  Party, after the vendors at Olympic market protested against the  Thai Boon Rong Company for greatly increasing the rent of their  shops, not only had Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh failed to  settle this problem as demanded by the vendors, but he sided  with the puppet Hun Sen and Thai Boon Roong Company against Sam  Rangsi, vice chairman of FUNCINPEC, who supported the protestors.    Phnom Penh residents know well that this Thai Boon Rong  Company has joined hands with the ringleaders of the Vietnamese  communist puppets, such as puppets Hun Sen and Chea Sim, in  amassing and embezzling the wealth of the Cambodian nation and  people worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. During the  elections organized by the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in  Cambodia], this company financed the Vietnamese communist  puppets' Cambodian People's Party [CPP] in competition with  FUNCINPEC and other parties.    Vendors at Olympic market said that if Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh had the courage to arbitrate, this problem  might have been settled. A dried fish vendor said that the  Prince Krompreah dared not do anything but side with the  Vietnamese puppets and this bloodsucking company because he is  so afraid of the puppets Hun Sen and Sar Kheng. As a matter of  fact, the prince is afraid of this Thai Boon Rong Company  because it bought a personal plane for the prince.    A National Assembly member from FUNCINPEC added that Prince  Krompreah should not have associated and curried favor with the  puppet Hun Sen and the CPP. He should not have associated with  Thai Boon Rong Company, which subsidized the puppets in carrying  out their election campaigns against FUNCINPEC and in killing  many FUNCINPEC members. Prince Krompreah's activity has led him  to a conflict with traders, the masses in Phnom Penh, and even  with his fellow FUNCINPEC members to the point that he even  wanted to drive out FUNCINPEC Vice Chairman Sam Rangsi as  finance minister.    According to reliable sources in the Finance Ministry in  Phnom Penh, in addition to Thai Boon Roong, there have also been  problems with the French oil company [name indistinct]. The  sources said that Sam Rangsi signed an agreement with this  company, but the Vietnamese puppets in the two-headed government  refused to recognize Sam Rangsi's signature. This is because  they want to deal with only a Vietnamese company [name  indistinct] through which they can monopolize the profits for  themselves and their CPP. Here, Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh also sided with the puppet Hun Sen against Sam Rangsi.    Almost all the masses in Phnom Penh, including students,  civil servants, and traders in market places, have said that  members of the two-headed government do not have any policy nor  have they done anything for the interests of the Cambodian  nation and people. They only want to serve the Vietnamese  communists and foreign companies and to gain profits for  themselves and their families. This is why all the problems have  not been resolved. Some have said that if they were not  protected by the Vietnamese police and the allies, these  two-headed government members would have been dead from the  outset. [passage omitted]</p>

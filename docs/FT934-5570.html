			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (33): Common standards essential The need for user education is not the only barrier to the acceptance of object-oriented computing, writes Philip Manchester. Like the open systems movement which it grew out of, object-oriented computing demands that rival manufacturers agree on fundamental standards, This has proved to be very difficult for the computer industry in the past. Despite paying lip-service to international standards, manufacturers have persistently found ways to lock customers into their software products. The effort to spread object-oriented standards is caught up with the battle to dominate the market for operating environments in client-server systems. The main contenders are Microsoft with its Windows NT system and the Unix faction backed by almost everyone else. The adoption of common standards by both contenders is essential if object-oriented computing is to succeed. The Unix faction is largely committed to the standards published by the Object Management Group (OMG). But despite its membership of OMG, Microsoft has, so far, failed to back the standards and has devised its own alternatives in some areas. Reliable industry sources suggest, however, that Microsoft is about to acquiesce and back certain important OMG standards publicly. This will be a significant breakthrough. Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer software market means that it has taken over IBM's role as the authenticator of new software technologies. Its backing of common standards for object-oriented computing will give millions of users the confidence to look at the object-oriented computing more closely.</p>

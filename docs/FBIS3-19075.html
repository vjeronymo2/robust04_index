			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still photographs of President </F> Demirel and German Chancellor Kohl]    [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that even  sympathizing with the separatist terrorist organization means  indirect support. Therefore, he added, western countries must  be careful about this point when they comment on lifting the  immunity of certain deputies in Turkey.    Demirel received (Mark Gali), the European Union special  envoy and cochairman of the Turkish-European joint parliamentary  committee. A statement issued by the Presidential Press Office  says Demirel recalled at the meeting that as recently as 1993  the separatist terrorist organization killed 1,800 persons, of  whom 1,100 were civilians. The president stressed that no state  can allow the foundations of its constitutional order to be  destroyed or its country to be divided. He pointed out that the  Turkish Grand National Assembly resisted lifting immunities  until very recently, but the attitude of some Democracy Party  [DEP] deputies toward the recent incidents infuriated the  public. That is why, Demirel said, the Assembly had to take  certain measures to open the way for the independent judiciary  in order to prevent certain deputies from using their  legislative immunity as armor.    Demirel pointed out that the deputies in question have full  means of defense under the guarantee of the Constitution, the  protection of the law, and before independent judicial courts.  Nobody should doubt the independence of the Turkish courts of  justice, the president stressed.    German Chancellor Helmut Kohl telephoned President Demirel  today, saying that the detention of some deputies has led to a  negative campaign against Turkey in Europe. Kohl told Demirel  that incorrect information and erroneous reports about the issue  are circulating that are tarnishing Turkey's image. Kohl said  he has absolutely no intention of interfering in Turkey's  internal affairs, and he only wants to express certain ideas as  a friend of Turkey and of the president.    During the telephone conversation, Demirel told Kohl that  certain circles in Europe are trying to portray Turkey as  unjustified in many cases where it is justified. Demirel  pointed out that the DEP deputies and party leaders were acting  as a branch of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist  organization. We have the documents to prove it, Demirel said,  adding that he repeatedly asked the DEP deputies to openly  denounce the terrorist acts perpetrated by the PKK. They always  refrained from doing that, he added.    Demirel recalled the remarks by the DEP leader, who had said  that the murder of five NCO cadets in Tuzla, Istanbul, by the  PKK was a normal thing and part of a war. The president stated  that these remarks infuriated the public, and the Assembly was  forced to take the measure it took. He stressed that this  measure is nothing but a step to open the way for the judiciary.  He also said that the Constitutional Court will soon announce  its ruling about the DEP application concerning the lifting of  the deputies' immunity.    The president stressed during the conversation that nobody  should doubt the independence of the judicial bodies in Turkey.  The measures taken in Turkey so far, he said, are not and will  not be any different from the measures taken or to be taken by  any European country against terrorism and separatism.</p>

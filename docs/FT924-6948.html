			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hollinger revenues rise strongly HOLLINGER, the publishing company controlled by Mr Conrad Black, has reported a substantial rise in revenues and a modest third quarter profit. The Toronto-based company, whose flagship is the 68 per cent owned UK Telegraph group, posted net earnings of CDollars 9.1m (USDollars 7.1m), or 13 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 7.8m loss, or 21 cents, a year earlier. Revenues jumped by 25 per cent to CDollars 218m. Mr Jack Boultbee, vice-president for finance, said that a third quarter profit was something of an achievement considering the normal slow pace of advertising sales in July and August. He said the results reflected an upturn in business in almost every part of the group, as well as the effects of cost-cutting programmes. Nine-month earnings were CDollars 63.2m, or CDollars 1 a share, up from CDollars 21.9m, or 18 cents. The latest figure includes a CDollars 34.2m net gain from the sale of a 9 per cent stake in United Newspapers, a recent Telegraph share issue and refinancing costs, all of which were reported in the first six months of the year. Besides its stake in the Telegraph, Hollinger publishes over 200 - mostly small - newspapers in North America and owns the Jerusalem Post. The Telegraph also has a 15 per cent stake in Australia's John Fairfax group. Earlier this month, Mr Black broadened his base in North American publishing by becoming the largest single shareholder, with a 23 per cent interest, in Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper chain. Hollinger is prevented by a Southam 'poison pill' from immediately buying more of Southam's stock. But the deal fits the strategy which Mr Black has favoured in the past - of gaining control of troubled companies by starting off with a minority stake.</p>

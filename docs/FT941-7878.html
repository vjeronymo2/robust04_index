			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / World Trade News: China, US end Gatt admission talks China and the US yesterday concluded two days of what officials described as serious discussions on Beijing's application to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But China, according to the officials, still has a 'lot of things to do' before satisfying requirements to rejoin Gatt, including further progress in removing tariff and non-tariff barriers. The two sides were preparing for the 16th session of the Gatt working party due to reconvene in Geneva next month. This will be the working party's first meeting since the end of the Uruguay Round late last year. China has made no secret of its wish to be a founding member of the World Trade Organisation, due to come into being in 1995 as a successor to Gatt. Western countries are pushing China to liberalise its markets, scrap trade curbs, take further steps to make its currency convertible and deal with issues such as intellectual property right infringement.</p>

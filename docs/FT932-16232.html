			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Vietnam gives go-ahead for Bank of Tokyo office THE Vietnamese government has given the Bank of Tokyo approval to open a representative office in Ho Chi Minh City which the bank hopes will be a go-between for the increasing number of Japanese companies interested in trade and investment deals in Vietnam. It will be the first Japanese bank to open an office in Vietnam if, as expected, the Finance Ministry in Tokyo also gives its approval. The bank wants to tap into the flow of investment from Taiwan and overseas Chinese communities, who are particularly active investors in Ho Chi Minh City, which has a large ethnic Chinese population. The Vietnamese decision follows a visit to Tokyo last month by Mr Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister, who told Japanese leaders that a rapid expansion of the Japanese business presence would aid the economic reform programme in his country. Vietnam has welcomed Japanese support, as the US has yet to lift an economic embargo, which has limited Hanoi's access to foreign aid and investment. Japan ended a 14-year ban on assistance last November, and plans to send a study team to Vietnam in May to devise a plan for infrastructure development. Japanese companies, which have a high regard for the quality of Vietnamese workers, have targeted the country as a medium-term, low-cost site for component supply to manufacturing industry. Most Japanese joint ventures signed in the past three years have been in fisheries, agriculture and the oil industry. China has chosen Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), the Japanese heavy equipment maker, to provide a Y8bn (Pounds 46m) polyethylene plant for a site in Jilin province, in the north, which will supply farmers with plastic film for greenhouses and plastic food wrap. Japanese heavy industrial companies have reported a sudden surge in demand from China, including steel orders running at three times the level of a year earlier, as a capital construction boom continues in coastal provinces in the north and south. MHI said the plant will be capable of producing the full range of polyethylene resins, and will have an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes. The new plant will constructed jointly by MHI and a Chinese engineering institute, in line with the Chinese industry's desire to become self-sufficient in the engineering of advanced chemical plant. It is scheduled to begin production in 1996.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Move to widen role of friendly societies A BILL to create a new legislative framework for friendly societies was published yesterday. The government bill would enable friendly societies - ranging from industrial assurance funds to those that are mainly social or philanthropic  -to provide a wider range of services. It should also allow them to compete on more equal terms with other financial institutions. It would establish a new regulatory framework including a Friendly Societies Commission. Societies would also be brought within the scope of the Policyholders Protect-ion Act 1975, the investor-protection scheme covering insurance policyholders. The bill would enable friendly societies to incorporate and establish subsidiaries to provide various financial and other services to their members and the public. These would include: managing unit and investment trusts and personal equity plans; arranging credit; long-term or general insurance business; insurance intermediary services; administering estates and executing will trusts; managing sheltered housing, homes for the elderly and hospitals; providing fund management services for pension-fund trustees. The investment funds of friendly societies are free of tax within certain limits. For instance, the amount an investor can put into a tax-free friendly society savings scheme is Pounds 200 per annum. The bill was welcomed by Mr Peter Gray, chairman of Tunbridge Wells Equitable, the largest friendly society, and secretary of the Friendly Society Parliamentary Committee. 'Our competitors have had a tremendous advantage over us and we need the same sort of fiscal incentives. The government has given them tax breaks such as tax-exempt special savings accounts and Peps. What do they give friendly societies? Pounds 200 a year.'</p>

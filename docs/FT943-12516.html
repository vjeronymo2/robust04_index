			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Panamsat raises stakes Panamsat, the private satellite operator which competes with Intelsat, earlier this month launched the first of three new satellites aboard a French Ariane rocket from Kourou in French Guiana. The launch of Panamsat II is a key step in the company's aim to establish itself as a global operator competing not just with Intelsat, but with smaller regional satellites such as Astra in Europe. In November Panamsat II will be followed by Panamsat III, which will cover the Atlantic, and next April by Panamsat IV, which will cover the Indian Ocean, acting as a bridge between Europe and Asia. 'The three satellites will give us between six and seven times our existing capacity,' says Fred Landman, chief operating officer, from Panamsat's headquarters in Greenwich, Connecticut. 'It will put us in a far stronger position to erode the hold of Intelsat on this market.' Panamsat boasts a cast of blue-chip clients, from international telecoms operators such as KDD of Japan to most of the main US broadcasters. It has already signed up 12 customers for Panamsat II, although the satellite will not be operational for another few weeks. What is the key to Panamsat's appeal? 'We are private enterprise in outer space,' says Landman. 'We are customer-oriented, and have a rapport with more than 300 users with specially-tailored services.' He expects the satellite market 'to explode' in the next two years. 'When we started as the first private international system in 1986, the world was one big satellite monopoly. But the telecoms and broadcasting industries upon which we depend have themselves opened up to greater competition since then, opening up an array of new opportunities for us.' Broadcasters account for two-thirds of Panamsat's revenue; the rest comes from telecoms operators. 'I expect that balance to continue,' says Landman. He sees significant telecoms opportunities in developing regions - Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia - where fixed infrastructure is either unavailable or not of sufficient standard to provide the quality of communications required by the corporate sector. The total cost of the three satellites will be Dollars 720m. It is a hefty sum to recoup, particularly with the launch of other private systems such as Orion. But Panamsat points to a committed investor base, boosted recently by the Mexican broadcasting company Grupo Televisa SA.</p>

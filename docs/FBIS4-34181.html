			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with deposed President Jean-Bertrand </F> Aristide by correspondent Carlos Agudelo in Washington; date not  given]    [Text] Jean-Bertrand Aristide is a small man with a slight  build, which at first glance veils the intense intuition he  expresses through his statements. One immediately becomes aware  of the great humility of this man, a main player in an  international drama. This humility is mixed with a sense of  confidence and conviction, a product of years of intense  internal as well as external struggle.    In a low but firm voice, he methodically expresses the hope  that someday, ideally soon, he will be able to return as  president of Haiti, and that his return will be accompanied by  democracy.    [EL TIEMPO] As you know, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria  was elected OAS secretary general as a result of, among other  things, Haiti's vote. How do you perceive the OAS'  participation in the situation in your country?    [Aristide] What is taking place in Haiti goes much further  than national borders and directly touches the soul of the  continent. The OAS has a critical role to play, and so far, it  has fortunately played a very positive role. There must be a  political willingness and a commitment for reestablishing  democracy, however. This is not easy because the OAS is not an  institution with the prospects and freedom to force the coupists  into honoring what they said they were going to do in the  Governors Island Agreement.    Along with this, we are in a race against time because each  time sanctions are strengthened more strains are placed on the  Haitian people.    [EL TIEMPO] Do you have an agenda for resolving the  situation, and what steps do you believe should be taken?    [Aristide] The entire world is certainly more powerful than  the coupists. And yet, there still is no political willingness  because if an embargo existed, the wait would have been  shortened. As long as we continue to move along with an embargo  that is not a complete embargo, suffering is going to continue  for long time.    The presence of ships could be used to transmit messages on  short and medium-wave radios to communicate with soldiers, poor  people, students, and liberal Haitian citizens. We should give  them the necessary information to unite and recover the security  that prevailed in the country for seven months. During that  time, refugees did not flee from Haiti; we fought poverty and  human misery, and we worked with dignity. Democracy is built  through the people and by respecting human dignity.    [EL TIEMPO] Do you still believe it is necessary to remove  the Haitian military leaders in an effort to find a solution?    [Aristide] That is the only way. The coupists are holding  the Army and the country captive. In Haiti, there is one  soldier for every 1,000 Haitians, while there is only one doctor  for every 10,000 Haitians. Less than 1 percent of the  population owns more than 45 percent of the nation's wealth.  This is why we have an illiteracy rate of 85 percent.    Because of this situation, the population understands the  need for an embargo. Even though they have seen that the Army  is making money from the embargo, they are still demanding the  implementation of a complete embargo because they know that  sooner or later the coupists will have to do something about it.    [EL TIEMPO] Is it true that the military leaders who are in  power are drug traffickers?    [Aristide] Are you asking me if they are drug traffickers?  (Aristide laughs) More than $1.2 billion enters Haiti from drug  trafficking, which represents a danger for Haiti and for the  United States. If we want to protect the families in both  countries, we must remove the traffickers who are in power.    [EL TIEMPO] What is your opinion regarding the current  situation in the Dominican Republic, and how could Balaguer's  possible reelection change this?    [Aristide] I believe we must talk to the Dominican Republic  on how to enforce the sanctions. If the United States  categorically expresses its political willingness to respect the  agreements, and if the UN and the OAS do the same, I do not  believe there will be any problem for that country in applying  the sanctions.    [EL TIEMPO] Do you still consider the Governors Island  Agreement the basis for a resolution to the crisis?    [Aristide] Yes, because it has not yet been complied with.    [EL TIEMPO] Would you support military intervention in  Haiti?    [Aristide] This would be problematic because Haiti's  Constitution prohibits military intervention. The Governors  Island Agreement, however, contains provisions for the presence  of international observers to help reconstruct the country,  separate the police from the Army, and create a fair legal  system, one without impunity. This would have to be done with  international cooperation.    [EL TIEMPO] Some sectors of the U.S. Congress have tried to  discredit you by claiming that you are mentally unstable. How  do you view this position by the U.S. right?    [Aristide] First, I have a psychology degree and I  understand  quite well what tarnishing a person's reputation entails.  Second, it would only take reading my three books to know my  beliefs well. Third, a racist policy and a cynical attitude  prevails in the United States. When Haitians and Cubans are on  the same boat, as I have seen on television myself, Cubans are  allowed to continue while Haitians are turned back. This is a  racist policy.    [EL TIEMPO] Considering that you do not have a majority in  the Haitian parliament, do you believe that conditions exist to  build a coalition that would enable you to govern if you are  indeed returned to power?    [Aristide] That I do not have a majority in the government  cannot truly be asserted. Two-thirds of the Senate and more  than 30 deputies attended a conference we organized in Miami.  More than 65 percent of Haitians voted for me, and they are  still committed to such a degree that 31 months after the coup  d'etat, they are still demonstrating. In this context, I  believe that currently more than 65 percent of the population  supports the democratization process.    In the parliament, there is a majority that cannot voice  their opinion because they have rifles pointed at their heads.  Many members of parliament have gone into hiding in order to  survive. In this sense, it is the power of the coupists'  weapons that rules the country. I am convinced that once the  coupists withdraw, we will free the Army and the country and  create unity and justice.    [EL TIEMPO] Some people view you as part of the problem  rather than part of the solution. Have you considered the  possibility of withdrawing from the process to facilitate a  solution in Haiti?    [Aristide] This view is part of that cynical attitude. The  truth is that after 31 months, currently more than 65 percent of  the population is still fighting for the return of democracy.  With this in mind, our fight is irreversible. We believe in  humanity and surrendering would be a lack of respect for those  who sacrificed their lives.</p>

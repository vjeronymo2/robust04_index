			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Jury trials for 248 anti-abortion demonstrators arrested on misdemeanor  trespassing charges in Sunnyvale last October could cost Santa Clara County up  to $1.8 million. The cost represents almost 10% of the Municipal Court system's  operating budget for 1988-89. The large number of defendants and their request  for speedy trials has already prompted a declaration of judicial emergency in  the county. The demonstrators are members of New York-based Operation Rescue, a  group whose protests nationwide have clogged jails and courts in more than 30  cities.  </P></p>

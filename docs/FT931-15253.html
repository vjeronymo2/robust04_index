			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / EC-Greek row over Macedonia worsens THE prospect of a rupture between Greece and her European Community partners over Macedonia drew closer yesterday after the Danish presidency of the EC called for the United Nations to resolve the status of the former Yugoslav republic. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, said he believed the UN Security Council could reach a solution as early as next week, in which case Denmark was ready to recognise Macedonia. 'We have a black spot on our conscience,' Mr Ellemann-Jensen said in Copenhagen. 'We have reached the point where we cannot keep the lid on this (in the EC). 'We have to look to the UN for a solution.' Greece has held up EC recognition of Yugoslavia for almost a year on the grounds that it undermines the status of the northern Greek province of Macedonia. Athens argues that the republic should choose a different name to avoid implying a territorial claim on Greek Macedonia. A Community decision to hand the issue over to the UN - thus allowing individual states to open diplomatic relations - would be viewed in Athens as a breach of EC solidarity. The Greek government reacted angrily yesterday to Mr Ellemann-Jensen's proposal. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Danish foreign minister 'should respect Community policy as defined at two EC summits on the preconditions for recognition'. Athens is also trying to delay UN recognition for Macedonia by arguing that the Security Council should be briefed on the Greek position before considering the republic's request for membership, which was formally submitted last week. The Danish foreign minister raised questions about Greece's support for UN economic sanctions against Serbia. An EC Commission report last year accused Greek companies of systematic sanctions busting. Mr Ellemann-Jensen also accused Athens of blocking an EC plan agreed at last month's summit in Edinburgh to send Ecu50m (Pounds 40.5m) of humanitarian aid to Macedonia. However, after a meeting of EC foreign minister in Paris late last night he said his Greek counterpart had promised to help EC aid reach the former Yugoslav republic. Peace reprieve, Page 19</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BP decision opens the way for disposal of agricultural side BRITISH PETROLEUM has decided that the agricultural interests under its BP Nutrition division are no longer a core asset, opening the way for the businesses to be sold. The decision to re-classify nutrition as a non-core activity was taken at the end of last year following an operational review of all BP's activity. The division will now have to be self-financing, with capital investment coming from internal resources rather than the parent company. A BP spokesman said: 'The business is not up for sale but we are looking for it to feed cash back rather than absorbing capital investment.' However, the decision has raised expectations that BP will be willing to sell the business should a suitable buyer come forward. Bankers estimate that the company could raise up to Pounds 600m from such a sale. BP Nutrition breeds poultry and other livestock, manufactures animal feed and markets meat products. In 1990, it turned in a profit of Pounds 48m on a turnover of Pounds 2.68bn. Capital investment totalled Pounds 152m. BP has trimmed total capital expenditure plans for this year by Dollars 500m to Dollars 6.5bn. This has been accompanied by a campaign of cost-cutting which has seen head-office staff reduced by 50 per cent and job losses elsewhere. Already this year, BP has announced the Dollars 125 sale of oil production assets in Egypt and pulled out of a big liquified natural gas project in Qatar. At the end of last year, bankers were appointed to secure the sale of BP Canada's loss-making mining business, which has a book value of CDollars 200m.</p>

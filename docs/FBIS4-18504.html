			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis made it  clear that President Glavkos Kliridhis considers any further  effort by the United Nations to reach an agreement on the  confidence-building measures as useless, because he believes the  Turkish side does not have the political will to reach an  agreement. The government spokesman stressed that the Greek  Cypriot side cannot keep accepting amendments that aim at  satisfying [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas. [passage  omitted]    In a statement, Democratic Rally [DISI] notes that the  Butrus-Ghali report is disappointing and a result of  intervention by third parties. The statement adds that the  spirit and contents of the report already raise serious  questions about the intentions and goals of the United Nations,  which, it continues, together with outside interests, serves the  Turkish demand for final division of Cyprus instead of the  settlement of the Cyprus issue. DISI calls on all political  forces to proceed with dialogue and cooperation to formulate a  common stance to deal with the situation.    Democratic Party [DIKO] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou describes  the Butrus-Ghali report as an unacceptable one, which, he adds,  seeks to satisfy the Turkish positions through the intervention  of third parties. Kiprianou added that this situation should be  put to an end, and our side should seek disengagement and  promote discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue, with  priority on the issue of the Turkish troops, settlers, and  security.    The Free Democrats Movement announced that even though  Turkish intransigence is more than obvious, the UN secretary  general refrains from blaming the Turkish side and asks for  extension of the process to reach an agreement on amended ideas.  The Free Democrats reaffirmed their position on the immediate  return to discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue.</p>

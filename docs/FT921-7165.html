			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Observer: Bush-whacked Judging the importance of the Institutional Investor magazine's annual ranking of London's stockbroker research teams is like assessing the outcome of the New Hampshire primaries. The results get everyone rattled but no one really knows what they mean. SG Warburg has dislodged James Capel from the top spot in the all-Europe research table which is in line with the outcome of last year's more thorough Extel Financial survey. BZW has held its number four position whereas it dropped from third to sixth position in the Extel survey. But the oddest performance is County NatWest's. It comes top in terms of UK equity research but drops from third to sixth position in terms of its overall ranking. Will it be enough to persuade Lord Alexander to drop his 'make a profit or we will close you down' ultimatum? Observer thinks not.</p>

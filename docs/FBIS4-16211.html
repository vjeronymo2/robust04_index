			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ruslan Ignatyev report on interviews with State Duma First </F> Deputy Chairman Mikhail Mityukov and State Duma Security  Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin; place and date of interviews  not given]    [Text] At a recent meeting with representatives of the  "Russia's Choice" faction, the Russian Federation president  reported that he had sent 41 draft laws to the State Duma for  consideration. But this drew the response that not a single  draft law had been received by parliament. Where exactly are  they? Your special correspondent put this question to Mikhail  Mityukov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma.    [Mityukov] All we have received is a list of priority  legislative acts scheduled for implementation in the first  quarter of 1994. These lists were sent from both the government  apparatus and the president's administration. But we have still  not received the texts themselves. True, we can find three  draft laws from the government on which the State Duma is  working.    [Ignatyev] What do you think, where exactly are the draft  laws sent by the president right now?    [Mityukov] They are in the Russian Federation president's  State-Legal Administration.... [Mityukov ends]    Maybe the draft laws went to State Duma committees? The  editorial office approached Security Committee Chairman Viktor  Ilyukhin for an explanation.    [Ilyukhin] Of the 60 draft laws included on the list of  priority legislative acts by the Russian Federation Government  (letter No. 0085 p-P-36 of 4 February 1994), the State Duma has  received only three draft laws. As regards the president's  administration, not a single one of the 54 draft laws scheduled  for consideration in parliament as of 5 April 1994 (letter No.  PR-266 of 4 March 1994) has been submitted. [Ilyukhin ends]    In our quest for draft laws requiring urgent consideration  we  telephoned the Russian Government apparatus' department for  collaboration with federal organs of representative power and  public organizations. The reply we got from there was that it  was impossible to give the exact number of draft laws sent to  the State Duma because it receives legislative acts via various  channels. Only Ruslan Orekhov, chief of the Russian Federation  president's State-Legal Administration can throw some light on  the situation that has developed. But owing to a lack of time  he communicated via an aide that he would be not able to give  the newspaper any time for several days.  <H5>  ...Meanwhile </H5>   The "Yuridicheskaya Literatura" Publishing House will start  publishing a single collection of Russian legislative acts in  the near future in accordance with the president's edict on the  procedure for publishing federal laws and bringing them into  force. The weekly collection will include laws, presidential  edicts, and government decrees. In addition, they will also be  officially published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, Sergey Filatov  reported.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman, Feb 25 (AFP)--Hardline Palestinian groups  vowed on Friday [25 February] to carry out revenge attacks for  the massacre of more than 50 Palestinians at a mosque in the  Israeli-occupied West Bank.    The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas put all its fighters  "on a maximum state of alert" and called on them "to retaliate  as hard as possible to avenge the slaughter in Hebron."    In a statement to AFP here, Hamas said that "emergency  military plans were put in place to strike at Zionist targets,  occupation soldiers and settlers."    It also declared that the peace process had been dealt a  "fatal blow" by the massacre. One or more settlers shot dead 53  Palestinians and wounded dozens more inside a mosque at the Tomb  of the Patriarchs in Hebron, and eight other Arabs were killed  in clashes with troops.    Hamas has been at the forefront of attacks on Jews in the  occupied territories since the PLO signed its peace deal with  Israel in Washington on September 13.    A group formed to oppose the deal, Black September 13, vowed  to "commit a series of attacks against Jewish institutions  inside and outside the occupied territories" until the collapse  of the autonomy accord.    The attacks will take place in the next few days, said an  anonymous caller to AFP in Beirut identifying himself as a  member of the group.    From now on "all settlers are legitimate targets" for  Palestinian militants, he added.    Black September leader Munir Maqdah, who is based in  Lebanon,  blamed Arafat's policies for the massacre and said that he "has  no other choice to shoot himself in the head and commit suicide."    In Damascus, the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine, two hardline PLO groups, denounced the massacre as a  "perfidious crime" committed with the knowledge of Israeli  troops.    They promised the "martyrs and the people" that the FDLP's  Red Star fighters and the PFLP's Red Eagles in the territories  will take revenge against settlers and Israeli troops.    The PFLP called an emergency meeting of the Damascus-based  "Alliance of Palestinian Forces" -- which includes the PFLP, the  DFLP, and Hamas -- in order to decide how to respond.    Syria -- along with the PLO, Lebanon and Jordan -- is  involved in the peace negotiations with Israel, but hosts the  hardline groups as a means to pressure the Jewish state with  whom it has made little progress in the talks.    Another group, the Revoltionary Army for the Liberation of  Palestine, threatened to assassinate the PLO leader.    As the threats flew, 'Arafat said he had told his UN envoy  to  request an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council "so as  to take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of our  people."    "This massacre will have very serious fallout, not only on  the (Israeli-Palestinian negotiations) but also at all levels  and in all fields," 'Arafat added.    'Arafat accused the Israeli army of "complicity, adding "how  can they allow settlers to bear arms and not our people?"    His organization declared three days of mourning and a  general strike in the occupied territories.    The PLO's West Bank chief Faysal al-Husayni warned that "the  peace process is dying."    Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and  Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali both warned  that the massacre threatened the negotiations.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin condemned the "odious  massacre" and called on "Jews and Arabs to show restraint and  not to become involved in provocative acts."    King Husayn of Jordan was among the leaders who joined the  chorus of condemnation.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Carey calls for commitment to urban renewal REPEATED government changes in funding arrangements for urban regeneration programmes need to be replaced by a sustained commitment, Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, said yesterday. Dr Carey, on a visit to Liverpool, said the regeneration of stricken urban areas was a long-term project, with hope and confidence gathering painfully slowly. 'The experience of too many voluntary organisations engaged in partnerships with government agencies in employment, training, self-help and other urban projects has been of the tap turning on and off,' he said. 'Funding regimes have chopped and changed. Programmes have been mounted, encouraged, cut and scrapped. Destabilising reviews of the Urban Programme have been carried out every couple of years.' Dr Carey said he believed many private companies would have similar complaints. All parties to urban regeneration partnerships needed patience and sustained commitment to a shared task. While recognising the financial and political pressures involved, it was difficult to have a steady relationship with a partner who was too restless and changeable. 'We need a more sustained and secure government contribution towards the long haul of turning round our deep urban problems,' the archbishop said.</p>

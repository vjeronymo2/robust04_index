			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Dedicated team in high spirits - Philip Rawstorne explains how United Distillers has attacked Europe's lucrative duty-free market For the past three years, United Distillers, the Guinness spirits company, has outperformed its rivals in western Europe's Pounds 2bn duty-free spirits market. UD's share of the world's biggest duty-free market has risen from 17.5 per cent in 1990 to 20.5 per cent this year, nearly nine points ahead of its nearest competitors International Distillers &amp; Vintners and Hiram Walker. Volume sales have grown from 1.44m nine-litre cases to 1.65m. Its Johnnie Walker Red Label Scotch whisky and Gordon's gin are the two leading brands. That performance owes a great deal to UD's development of a dedicated European duty-free organisation. UD's strategy has given it a sharper regional focus than its rivals in the market, which the EU has extended until at least mid-1999. UD's organisation grew from the recruitment in late 1987 of Gerd Biedenbacher, a German executive from Dunhill, to run the German and Austrian operations. He inherited a management system devised by the old Distillers Company which Guinness took over in 1986. Under it, the worldwide duty-free business was run from London through independent agents in each market. In Germany and Austria, Biedenbacher found five different agents, each with responsibility for one or two UD brands, competing against each other. He ended the agency contracts and put the brands together in one portfolio. The restructuring worked well. It was extended, first to Scandinavia, and by 1991 covered the whole of western Europe. Today, Biedenbacher runs the business from a converted warehouse in Hamburg with regional sales and marketing offices in London, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Antwerp, Paris, Milan, Madrid and Athens. He has a total staff of 70, comprising 16 different nationalities speaking 13 different languages. 'The only thing we insist on is fluency in English,' he says. The team's area director for the UK and Ireland, which accounts for a third of market sales, is a German; a Finn heads operations in Germany and Austria; and a Belgian is responsible for southern Europe. All products, formerly supplied direct from the UK, are distributed from warehouses in Hamburg's free port, Piraeus in Greece, and Hoddesdon in the UK. 'Lead times have been cut from five or six weeks to 48 hours,' says Biedenbacher. 'About 250 different product specifications are permanently in stock.' Faster delivery deserved faster payment, so with the help of Barclays, Biedenbacher set up the first cross-border business direct debit system. Legal hurdles prevent the use of the system in some countries but three-quarters of payments are now settled this way. 'One of the great advantages is that salesmen can concentrate on selling rather than chasing late payments,' he says. The closer UD has come to its customers in airport duty-free stores, airlines and ferries, the more it has become involved in trying to improve retail techniques. It collects market data to detect trends in sales of different categories as well as to assess the performance of its competitors' brands. Travellers' shopping behaviour is studied closely. Only about half of them visit duty-free shops. Japanese businessmen are the most assiduous shoppers  -88 per cent visit the stores and nearly all of them buy alcohol. But only about one in six American or French travellers buy drink. Considerable effort has gone into attracting more people into stores. 'Opportunities to influence consumer decisions are limited,' says Biedenbacher. 'There are so many different nationalities; no television advertising, no other media except airline magazines.' UD, therefore, seeks to influence shoppers in the few seconds they take to reach a decision by constantly improving in-store promotions and merchandising. Those who do not visit the stores at 10 European airports are being tempted to buy from 'last-minute' trolleys of goods in the departure lounge. A team has been established to help retailers achieve more effective space management - planning the lay-out of stores, the positioning of categories and brands, and the space allotted to them - to maximise sales and profits. The team uses confidential data supplied by its retail customers. 'The rest of us have no access to it,' says Biedenbacher. 'Our view is that, with a 20 per cent share of the market, we will benefit from any overall increase in sales that results from their work.' All these efforts have reinforced the trend among travellers to trade up to more expensive, better-quality brands of drinks. London Heathrow is now the biggest malt whisky outlet in the world. This year, the market has coped effectively with changes in its regulation giving retailers responsibility for enforcing allowance limits. Initial confusion hit sales at airports which were down 10 per cent in the first six months, according to UD estimates. But this loss was offset by a boom in ferry sales. Hordes of UK cross-Channel trippers, shopping for cheaper beer in France, have also been picking up their duty-free spirits. The big question hanging over the market, however, is what happens when the EU extension runs out? Biedenbacher believes abolition is unlikely. The British Airports Authority now makes more money from retail concessions than from landing fees. 'Without the income generated by duty-free, airport charges and the cost of airline tickets would have to rise,' he says. But even if travellers within the EU are denied duty-free, he remains optimistic about long-term prospects. 'Air travel worldwide is forecast to double in the 1990s - and long distance flights are the fastest growing sector. Eastern Europe duty-free sales are increasing. Airport shops will also have more to offer than duty-free bargains - and people at airports always have time to spare, and to spend.'</p>

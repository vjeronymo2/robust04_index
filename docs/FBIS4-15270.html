			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- "The Central Bank of Russia  [CBR] will not protect the rouble's rate against the dollar up  to the last cent in its reserves," CBR Governor Viktor  Gerashchenko said in an interview with BUSINESS-TASS after his  speech on finance and credit policy at a parliamentary hearing  on the Russian draft budget for 1994, which was held on Tuesday.    "I believe that the rouble's rate should be at a level which  would not force Russian exporters to leave foreign markets," he  continued. "If they are forced to do so, this will mean that the  rate is rigged."    The governor said that the CBR's hard currency reserves now  total 4.5 billion dollars. They somewhat dropped due to the  active policy of pegging up the rouble vis-a-vis the dollar in  January. The present task is to boost the CBR's hard currency  reserves to nine billion dollars by the end of the current year.    There were some 13,000 billion roubles in circulation in the  country, as of January 1, 1994. Gerashchenko noted that the  100,000-rouble bill "should not be put into circulation for the  time being".</p>

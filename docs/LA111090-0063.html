			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD, AZUSA MATCH UP WELL TODAY;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TEAMS' STRENGTHS WILL COLLIDE TODAY WHEN THE TOREROS PLAY AT  AZUSA PACIFIC.  </P> <P> The University of San Diego knows that Azusa Pacific quarterback Brian Hunt is  averaging 291 yards and 25 completions per game.  </P> <P> Azusa Pacific, on the other hand, is familiar with the fact that the USD  defense is yielding only 133.8 passing yards per game and has intercepted 13  passes this season.  </P> <P> Strengths collide at 1:30 this afternoon at Azusa Pacific, as both schools hope  to finish the season 7-2.  </P> <P> For USD, that would equal its record of a year ago, its best since 1981 when  the Toreros finished 9-1. The NCAA Division III playoffs, however, are probably  out of the question. Redlands (7-1) all but wrapped up the West Coast bid with  a 52-14 rout of Occidental last week.  </P> <P> USD is coming off a bye after defeating Menlo College, 28-14, in Atherton two  weeks ago. Senior Dave Bergmann, the top Division III kicker in the nation last  year, kicked three field goals in that game and needs one more to tie Robert  Lozzi (1981-83) for USD's career record (27).  </P> <P> Quarterback Brendan Murphy completed 14 of 26 passes for 146 yards and a  touchdown against Menlo. Murphy has yet to throw an interception in 134  attempts this season. He had 10 last year in 99 attempts. The school record for  fewest passes intercepted in a season is four, set in 1980 by Steve Loomis  </P> <P> Azusa Pacific, ranked 24th in NAIA Division II, is coming off a 27-23 loss to  UC Santa Barbara last week despite compiling 534 yards of offense. Derick  Williams, a freshman wide receiver, is second on the team with 27 catches for  318 yards. Brandon Leafblad has 33 catches for 394 yards. USD defeated the  Cougars, 24-6, in last year's season opener, but trails in the series 14-9.  </P> <P> "Physically, they are a little better than us in the skill positions," USD  Coach Brian Fogarty said.  </P></p>

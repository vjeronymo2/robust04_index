			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Counting the cost of trade impasse CONSUMERS worldwide are paying billions of dollars in higher prices for many goods and services because of governments' failure to conclude the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report published today. The report marks another step in the campaign by Gatt's new director-general, Mr Peter Sutherland, to convince political leaders and a wider public of the benefits of a swift conclusion to the long-delayed negotiations. The round, launched in 1986, is now due to end in mid-December, three years behind schedule. Commenting on the report, which draws together the results of independent research, Mr Sutherland said virtually all protection meant higher prices. 'It is high time that governments made clear to consumers just how much they pay - in the shops and as taxpayers - for decisions to protect domestic industries from import competition.' Gatt notes that European Community consumers each paid an average of Dollars 450 (Pounds 302) last year in higher prices and taxes to support EC farmers, according to the OECD. For the US, the cost was Dollars 360 per head, and for Japan Dollars 600. For clothing, Gatt estimates based on earlier studies suggest that protection may now be costing a family of four up to Dollars 420 a year in the US, Dollars 220 a year in Canada and Dollars 130 a year in Britain. High trade barriers imposed by the EC on imports of electronic goods cost consumers almost Dollars 1.3bn a year, according to Britain's National Consumer Council. Yet trade protection, which hits poor households hardest, cannot be justified as an effective way of saving threatened jobs, Gatt argues. The Uruguay Round, if successful, will cut tariffs by at least a third, eliminate quotas and many other restraints on trade, reduce farm subsidies and strengthen Gatt's fair trade rules.  ------------------------------------------------------------- GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR AGRICULTURE  -------------------------------------------------------------                      Dollars bn       Dollars per                           total              head  ------------------------------------------------------------- Australia                   1.6                89 Austria                     4.2               530 Canada                      9.1               330 EC                        155.9               450 Finland                     4.5               910 Japan                      74.0               600 New Zealand                 0.1                15 Norway                      4.1               970 Sweden                      3.2               370 Switzerland                 5.8               840 US                         91.1               360 OECD Total                353.7               440  ------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, reports its preliminary year-end results on Thursday, and pretty grim reading they will make. Hoare Govett expects the group to report fourth quarter pre-tax profits of only Pounds 27m, making a total of Pounds 550m for the year. That compares with Pounds 843m in 1991 and the peak of Pounds 1.5bn in 1989. The poor results will be immaterial compared with the announcement of the board's decision whether to sunder the company in two. The aim is to make Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities subsidiary, into a separately quoted company. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer products company, reports preliminary year-end results tomorrow. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to rise up to 13 per cent to between Pounds 1.11bn and Pounds 1.125bn, against Pounds 1bn a year earlier. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, is expected tomorrow to report that pre-tax profits for the full year break through the Pounds 2bn barrier, an improvement of 13 per cent on the previous Pounds 1.79bn. British Aerospace expects to see a revival in its fortunes during 1993 following a year in which its performance was undermined by Pounds 1bn of provisions. Hopes for a return to profit, however, will do nothing to soften the impact of its preliminary results on Wednesday. These are likely to show losses of about Pounds 1.1bn compared with losses of Pounds 81m a year earlier. Restructuring charges of Pounds 950m in the regional aircraft division have been blamed largely for the hole. The company is due to pay a deferred interim dividend of 3p on Thursday, and a further 3p dividend is expected in the final results. The mild weather and new regulatory regime imposed by Ofgas is likely to be reflected in the final results for British Gas. The company is expected to announce on Thursday that profits have slipped to around Pounds 900m compared with a Pounds 1.16bn last time. Increased competition and lower prices for domestic gas sales may also reduce the company's scope for a substantial increase in dividend. A pay-out of about 14p is expected, against 13.4p last year. Royal Dutch Shell will report its preliminary year-end results on Thursday when a small increase in profits is expected of up to Pounds 3bn compared with Pounds 2.89bn for 1991. The company is likely to raise its dividend in line with inflation to about 22p from 20.9p last time. Royal Insurance is expected to report a sharp fall in its pre-tax losses when it unveils its 1992 results on Thursday. Losses should amount to between Pounds 105m and Pounds 137m, compared with a deficit of Pounds 373m in 1991. A dividend of 5p is forecast.

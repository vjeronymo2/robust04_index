			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOWNS TURN OUT TO PICKET FENCE;  </P> <P> PROTEST: PARTY STORE OWNER SAYS MINI-MALL WALL BLOCKS ACCESS TO HIS BUSINESS.  </P> <P> There's the Middle East war. Then there's the San Gabriel war, centered on a  patch of pavement behind a mini-mall and by a warehouse housing a party  business.  </P> <P> But instead of bringing in armed soldiers, LA PartyWorks on Wednesday brought  in the clowns. Dozens of them: mimes in whiteface, a Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtle, Batman and his archrival Penguin, a stilt walker, a Merlin-robed  magician, clowns on skates and more clowns.  </P> <P> "Block Iraq. Not Our Dock," read one sign. It was a circus, complete with the  media.  </P> <P> The party folks claim the mini-mall operator has shut off access to the  PartyWorks warehouse, preventing big trucks filled with party gear from going  in and out.  </P> <P> Not so, said mini-mall owner Anna Dong. She has merely put up a fence along her  property line to protect her tenants and their customers from traffic generated  by the warehouse, she said. And LA PartyWorks still has a narrow public alley  that provides access, she said.  </P> <P> Police -- called to the scene three times in the last week -- were there again  Wednesday as the battle off San Gabriel Boulevard near Las Tunas Drive reached  fever pitch.  </P> <P> "We realize this isn't going to accomplish our objective," said PartyWorks  manager Jeff Bader. "But we thought we'd have a little fun with it."  </P> <P> But the jocularity was only on the painted smiles of the clowns, because nasty  words were exchanged by all.  </P> <P> "They're choking me out of business," said PartyWorks owner Eric Elkaim.  </P> <P> "A reasonable compromise could be reached," said Dong's lawyer, Gene Koon. "But  this demonstration is overdone and absolutely frivolous."  </P> <P> Maybe so. But that didn't stop some stilt-walking diplomacy by 10-foot-tall  Richard Shope, who bent down to shake hands with Koon.  </P> <P> "I don't think I ever had clowns to contest with before," Koon said.  </P></p>

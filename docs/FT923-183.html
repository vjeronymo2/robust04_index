			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / IMF concerned by direction of Russian reforms RUSSIA'S economic reforms are seriously at risk and inflation could reach 'dangerous levels by the end of the year', a senior official of the International Monetary Fund told Russian deputies yesterday, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Mr Hernando Cota, deputy head of the bank's European division, said that while the IMF supported the policy and many of the actions of the government, 'in recent weeks we feel seriously concerned that both budgetary and credit policies are going off track'. The Russian administration is to be overhauled soon, according to the official news agency Itar Tass. Almost 100 committees would be axed, together with six ministries, including the ministry of industry.</p>

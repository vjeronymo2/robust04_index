			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's Diet testimony over the purchase of 300 Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) shares is false, an  investment consultant said Tuesday [29 March].    Hosokawa has told the Diet that he only helped his  father-in-law buy the shares by putting up a condominium as  collateral to finance the purchase. But "the NTT share  transaction is what Prime Minister Hosokawa himself asked for.  His father-in-law only allowed his name to be used by Hosokawa  for the transaction," the 60-year-old consultant said on  condition of anonymity.    The consultant told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he himself  recommended  the NTT share purchase to Hosokawa via one of Hosokawa's aides.  He said he is willing to testify before the Diet about his  allegations.    Hosokawa's father-in-law, Shohei Ueda, the father of  Hosokawa's wife, Kayoko, died last May.    The premier has repeatedly told the Diet he merely complied  with his father-in-law's request to put up his own condominium  as collateral to secure a loan to finance the NTT share  purchase. He has said he financed the purchase of the  condominium in Tokyo's Motoazabu area with part of a 100 million  yen loan he borrowed in 1982 from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking  group, a company at the center of a money-and-mob scandal.    Japan Communist Party legislator Zenmei Matsumoto said he  would press Hosokawa during Wednesday's parliamentary session to  account for the inconsistency between the premier's statements  and the consultant's allegations.    Hosokawa's political office said, "the transaction is a  legal  economic activity taken by the premier's father-in-law and the  premier himself did not initiate the deal."    The consultant said he approached the aide of then Kumamoto  Gov. Hosokawa in the fall of 1986 with an offer to act as an  intermediary for acquiring NTT shares, before NTT solicited bids  for its shares for the first time on October 4, 1986. He said  Hosokawa expressed his willingness to tender his bids for the  shares after the aide explained about NTT share investment in a  conversation in early September of that year at the governor's  office.    The aide and the consultant introduced Masatoshi Miyama,  Hosokawa's top financial secretary, to a Tokyo-based stock  investment financing company, he said. Miyama offered to borrow  the money for the share purchase in the name of Hosokawa's  father-in-law, he said.    The financing contract called for putting up both the NTT  shares and the premier's condominium as collateral, he said.    The Hosokawa side succeeded in acquiring all 300 NTT shares  for which he had submitted bids. Six months after NTT floated  the shares on the Tokyo stock exchange in February 1987, Miyama  sold off 199 of the shares, raking in handsome profits, he said.    Even after Hosokawa repaid the funds borrowed for the share  purchase, he ended up securing a net investment profit of some  50 million yen, he said.    Miyama broke a promise to have the consultant dictate the  timing of any selloff of NTT shares, while giving the consultant  10 percent of the net profit from the sell-offs, he said. The  consultant obtained only part of what Hosokawa's camp had agreed  to pay to him, he said.    The consultant said he cannot identify who first conveyed  the  investment offer to Hosokawa "to prevent the publicity from  causing annoyances" to the aide.</p>

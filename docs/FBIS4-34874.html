			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Herold Jean Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 25 Jun (EFE) -- Haitian Army chief  Raoul Cedras continued visiting the country's military  installations while the economic sanctions against the Caribbean  nation remain in effect. General Cedras visited the Military  Academy, the Dessalines Barracks, and the Haitian Navy  installations on Friday.    Cedras, the leader of the coup d'etat that overthrew  constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, criticized the  international community for its "immoral" attitude toward Haiti.  The Haitian Army chief has called on the troops to be ready to  take action in case of any emergency or foreign intervention.    For the past few days, on Cedras' orders, security measures  have been tightened at the barracks, and "strategic zones" have  been established to which civilians may not get close.    Air traffic between the United States and Haiti should be  suspended this weekend as part of the tightening of sanctions  against the country's coupist regime following several weeks of  constant departures of foreigners from Port-au-Prince. Some  people, who were waiting to board a plane to leave Haiti last  night, could not do so despite having confirmed reservations  with Haiti's "Trans Air" airlines. Meanwhile, Haitian citizens,  who were in the United States, and some foreign journalists  arrived in Port-au-Prince aboard an "American Airlines" flight  coming from Miami.    The Center for Free Enterprise and Democracy (CLED) in  Haiti,  mostly made up of young businessmen, protested the new economic  sanctions imposed by the United States against the Caribbean  island. The CLED criticized the drafting of a list of  businessmen who would face sanctions without prior warning and  without the possibility of resorting to lawyers.    This week, U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to freeze the  bank accounts of all Haitians who have money in U.S. banks and  live in Haiti. According to the CLED, this is an "immoral"  measure. The CLED said the people adversely affected are not  responsible for the crisis in Haiti. In a communique, the CLED  stated it is unfair to punish people just because they belong to  such and such a family. The CLED also spoke in favor of the  restoration of constitutional order and state of law in Haiti.  According to the CLED businessmen, the attitude of the United  States and the international community is to "drown" Haiti. The  document issued by the CLED, dated 24 June, states that the U.S.  Government is acting in an "illegal and hypocritical" manner  against Haiti. The CLED believes the measures approved by the  United States seek to divide the private sector and inspire  society to go against the businessmen.</p>

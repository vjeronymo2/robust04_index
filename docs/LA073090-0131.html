			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> HORSEMEN DUCK CRUELTY QUERIES  </P> <P> Two members of the West German show jumping team today ducked questions about  their involvement in alleged cruelty to horses.  </P> <P> German champion Otto Becker said he "was not allowed to comment" on the  allegations against his employer, Paul Schockemohle, because of the police  investigation into whether the three-time European champion had violated animal  protection laws.  </P> <P> Becker arrived in Stockholm for the Show Jumping World Championships that open  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The organizing Swedish Equestrian Federation has called for the withdrawal of  Schockemohle as coach plus three nominated team members, including Becker. The  move was triggered by the release this month in the German magazine, Stern, of  a videotape showing Schockemohle hitting young horses legs' with a wooden stick  over jumps. The method is banned in international competition and some  countries, while allowed in others.  </P> <P> After the footage was shown on German television, Schockemohle was reported to  police for cruelty to animals and an investigation begun.  </P></p>

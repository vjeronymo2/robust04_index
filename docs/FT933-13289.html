			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Fresh boardroom row erupts at Hoskins A BOARDROOM row has further delayed a plan by Mr Adam Page, founder of Midsummer Leisure, to reverse some of his businesses into Hoskins Brewery, one of Britain's smallest quoted brewers. Completion of the deal to inject three Fatty Arbuckle theme bars into Hoskins in return for 41 per cent of its equity, had already been postponed three times because of calls for clarification from the Stock Exchange . The acquisition, announced in May, has blown into a row over Stock Exchange regulations and property valuation between Mr David Shaw, a director and MP, and the rest of the Hoskins board. The Conservative MP for Dover was last week removed from the company's board. Hoskins said there had been 'a breakdown in the relationship between Mr Shaw and the other directors of the company.' Mr Robert Hoar, estates director of Hoskins, said yesterday: 'I am still hopeful that the transaction will proceed to a successful conclusion.' However, further delays were likely because Mr Shaw had written to the Stock Exchange expressing concern that the accountants' report on the acquisition was incomplete. He had also questioned the property valuation of the bars. Hoskins said yesterday that 'an appropriate due diligence exercise is being conducted into the business to be acquired, including an accountants' report and an independent valuation.' Under terms agreed in May, Hoskins would pay Pounds 4.2m in cash and shares to buy the three freehold sites of the Fatty Arbuckle theme bars. Mr Hoar, and his brother Barrie, chairman, would sell more than half their 30 per cent stake in Hoskins. Mr Barrie Hoar would resign, as would the current financial director Mr Pankaj Shar. This would leave Mr Page with 41 per cent of the enlarged share capital. He would become the new chairman and chief executive, and bid 55p for the remaining shares.</p>

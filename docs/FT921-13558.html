			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Midland Bank considers mortgage securitisation MIDLAND BANK is considering securitising part of its Pounds 4.5m mortgage book. It has sent letters to some of its 150,000 mortgage customers to ask whether they would object to having their mortgages securitised. The bank said letters had been sent out, but it declined to give the numbers of customers approached, beyond saying that less than 10 per cent were involved. The bank said it was testing the water and that it had no commitment to do anything at this stage. Although Barclays and TSB have carried out experimental securitisation operations, so far none of the clearing banks has carried out a large-scale securitisation operation of the sort common in the US. Securitisation - taking a group of high quality mortgages and selling them as a bond on the financial markets - is attractive to financial institutions because it enables them to reduce the amount of lending on their balance sheet and so strengthen their capital ratios. In the UK, about Pounds 10bn of mortgages have been securitised by the centralised lenders.</p>

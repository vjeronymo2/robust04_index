			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Roh set to reshuffle cabinet after poll PRESIDENT Roh Tae Woo of South Korea is likely to reshuffle his cabinet and the leadership of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) following the government's narrow defeat in Tuesday's National Assembly elections. Mr Roh said the DLP's poor electoral performance was because of the 'intra-party conflict' that has plagued the party since it was merged with two opposition groups in 1990. The party needed 'a rebirth', Mr Roh said. The DLP lost control of the 299-member National Assembly by one seat, with 149 representatives elected. It is now negotiating with some of the 21 independents, who include supporters of former President Chun Doo Hwan, to obtain a majority. The Democratic Party, the main opposition group that is to the left of the DLP, increased its representation by 50 per cent to 97 seats based on a strong showing in the key Seoul region, where it captured 25 seats to the DLP's 16. Several of the newly elected Democrat members were leaders of the student movement that pushed the country toward democratic reforms in 1987. The new conservative party, the Unification National Party (UNP), established by founder of the Korean conglomerate Hyundai, made an impressive debut with 31 seats, giving it a pivotal role in the new Assembly. Some analysts saw signs of polarisation in the election result with the Democrats gaining on the left and the UNP and independent candidates on the right at the expense of the DLP, which has increasingly sought to occupy a moderate position in the political spectrum. The DLP received 38.5 per cent of vote, the Democrats 29.2 per cent and the UNP 17.3 per cent. The turnout at 71.9 per cent was among the lowest for the country.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ex-Secret Service Official Cites </F> Scalfaro, 100 Others"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 18 -- Former top secret service  official Maurizio Broccoletti plans to cite over 100 witnesses,  including former premiers and interior ministers, among them  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, when hearings open against him  on April 26 on charges of embezzling public funds and criminal  association.    As the top administrative official at Sisde, Italy's  civilian  espionage service, 51-year-old Broccoletti, who is going on  trial with his former boss Riccardo Malpica and five others,  held the purse-strings and decided what was spent where under  the interior minister's and the prime minister's guidance.    Malpica was arrested on October 29 last year after testimony  from Broccoletti claiming that interior ministers over the last  ten years, including Scalfaro during his spell at the ministry  from 1983-87, should receive the blame for any financial  misdeeds in secret service funding.    The charges claim that Malpica, Broccoletti and others  stashed away at least 40 million dollars through front companies  and a travel agency to accounts in Italy and San Marino and  elsewhere, buying real estate, yachts and other property in  Italy and South America. Later unconfirmed figures claimed that  even larger sums may be involved.    The investigations into the illicit use of secret funds  began  in 1992 and were shelved late that year, according to  Broccoletti's allegations because a cover-up had been organised  by Scalfaro and outgoing Interior Minister Nicola Mancino.    Broccoletti was finally placed in preventive custody on June  25 last year, and other top officials were placed in detention  over the next few weeks. They were all released as the  investigations continued. Then, at the end of October,  Broccoletti was called in for further questioning and submitted  a dossier formulating his charges against his former political  bosses.    The following day, he fled to Montecarlo as the prosecutors  once again denied his cover-up allegations. He was arrested in  Montecarlo on November 2 and extradited to Italy on January 5  and, on January 6, again claimed there had been a meeting  between Scalfaro, Mancino and others to organise a cover-up, an  allegation that was once more denied categorically by Scalfaro's  office.    A list of witnesses filed with the court here today  indicated  all the prime ministers who served from 1984 to the present day,  all the interior ministers who served from June 13 1978 to the  present day, and all the Sisde chiefs from April 27 1984 to the  present day.    Other witnesses on the list include members of the  judiciary,  bank officials and executives, and others who had dealings with  Sisde and its funds.    The prime ministers to be cited are, in chronological order,  Bettino Craxi, Amintore Fanfani, Giovanni Goria, Ciriaco De  Mita, Giulio Andreotti, Giuliano Amato, and Carlo Azeglio  Ciampi; the interior ministers, Virginio Rognoni, Amintore  Fanfani, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Antonio Gava, Vincenzo Scotti,  and Nicola Mancino.    According to Broccoletti's lawyers, the prime ministers  should be called for their role deciding areas of competence as  to the management of the secret funds and the criteria applied  for sharing them, deciding on bonus payments and so on.    Similar points were made as regards the interior ministers  and the ex-Sisde chiefs whom Broccoletti wants to see on the  witness stand.</p>

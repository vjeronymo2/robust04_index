			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Unclean hands in France Corruption in France does not appear to have been of the systemic variety revealed in Italy. The allegations of malpractice that have recently forced the resignations of two French ministers are more reminiscent of cases involving West German politicians during the 1970s and 1980s than those affecting large numbers of government personnel and businessmen in Italy in the past decade. And the latest evidence of malpractice within Britain's conservative party indicates that sleaze is a Europe-wide phenomenon. All the same, the steady flow of allegations of misdeeds by French politicians and company executives has added to concern about low ethical standards in public life in France, and this in turn has undermined the credibility and effectiveness of Mr Edouard Balladur's conservative government. A recent opinion poll indicated that 60 per cent of French voters lacked confidence in Mr Balladur's ability to counter corruption. The dents in the prime minister's image have set back his hitherto smooth-running campaign to win the presidency in the election due next spring. Following last year's collapse of electoral support for the Socialist party, partly as the result of revelations over abuse in collection of political contributions, there is a risk that, as in Italy, the mainstream French parties of left and right will end up squarely discredited by the taint of scandal. Fringe parties These developments are most unlikely to create the form of political upheaval seen in Italy. But they will strengthen support for fringe parties ahead of the presidential election. And they may weaken France's voice in the debate over the next stage of European integration, particularly vis-a-vis newly re-elected Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The electoral chances next spring of Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European commission and former Socialist finance minister, have been heightened by Mr Balladur's problems. However, the 'clean hands' advantage afforded by Mr Delors' 10 year absence from the French political scene may be offset by the public perception of the Socialist party. Anxieties about a lowering of France's international influence were almost certainly in President Francois Mitterrand's mind yesterday when he rebuffed recent suggestions in the French press about a threat to France's internal stability. The crumbling of Mr Mitterrand's personal authority near the end of his 14-year rule has no doubt added to the general sense of misgiving. But the president was right to warn against premature condemnation of people caught up in corruption investigations. Exaggerated judgements Some members of the French judiciary, emboldened by the high profile activities of Italian magistrates, may have overstepped the mark in their eagerness to publicise investigations into public figures. Exaggerated judgments about a sudden rise in French corruption have also been encouraged by a less forgiving climate in public opinion, itself influenced by what ordinary people have had to put up with during the recession. A range of unorthodox activities is now coming to the surface in diverse French investigations. Even though some of the cases which are attracting publicity date back to investigations started in the 1980s, important voices from the French corporate world now appear to believe that French business should clean up its act. Many of the cases focus on accusations that public contracts have been used to divert funds illegally into party coffers. Mr Balladur has bowed to public pressure by suggesting annual audits of the assets of ministers, parliamentary deputies and senior functionaries, along with external examination of public sector contracts. An outright ban on private donations to political parties, proposed by some French politicians, seems unlikely to be the right answer. Greatly increased transparency of the finances of parties and individuals involved in public dealings is a necessary condition for persuading French voters that the government's campaign on corruption can be successful. These are the kinds of reform which are needed elsewhere as well.</p>

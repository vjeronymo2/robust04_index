			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The purpose of Program Planning projects will be to create plans for state-wide, coordinated, technology extension programs in order to enhance the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized manufacturers. These projects will plan for the development and coordination of existing and/or newly formed services, such as state industrial assistance programs; workforce training; university-based industrial assistance programs; and management assistance programs; into a unified state-wide program. Plans will include providing access to a wide range of technology and services, such as technology deployment, workers skills development, technology transfer and commercialization, or export and market development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may conduct planning activities on multiple intrastate region basis, when regions are defined by the state. Regions should be clearly defined by the proposing organizations and it must be clear why the program is regionally oriented, versus state-wide, and how the multiple intrastate regions will be integrated into a state-wide plan or interact such that state-wide coverage is achieved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may include pilot testing activities as part of their planning process. If pilot testing of the proposed extension plan is included in the project, it should include methods of evaluating the pilot test's success in implementing the proposed extension plan. Any proposed pilot activity must be consistent with the program plan developed for the state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Program Planning Projects Evaluation Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Proposals from applicants will be evaluated and rated on the basis of the following criteria by an impartial competitive review panel. Each proposal should address all five evaluation criteria and evaluation criteria 1&hyph;3 will be weighted more heavily than criteria 4&hyph;5. Selection will be based upon total evaluation score as well as geographic distribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Target Population (25 points): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Potential applicants should specify a methodology for identifying a population of beneficiary companies (the target population) and their technology assistance-related needs. Factors that will be considered include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Methodology for defining the size and demographic characteristics of the target population to be served by the program plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Methodology for determining the target population's assistance needs, eg. technology, training, information, quality improvement, management, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Methodology to ensure that the plan is appropriate for addressing identified industry needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Resource Identification and Assessment (20 points): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applicants should describe the methodology for collecting information about the number, size, technical sophistication, type, and relevance of industrial assistance activities that will be part of the coordination effort. Factors that will be considered include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Methodology for identifying relevant assistance programs and other sources of expertise outside applicant's organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Methodology for assessing relevance and effectiveness of resources in addressing identified industry needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coordination with Existing Resources (25 points): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applicants should set forth a plan for interacting or coordinating with appropriate existing and/or newly-formed state and local technology-industrial assistance services, potential industry partners, and appropriate federal services, to develop a coordinated state-wide delivery system. Factors that will be considered include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Methodology and adequacy of plans for forming effective linkages and partnerships necessary to plan for and provide a coordinated range of services to meet the needs of the target population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Safeguards to ensure that planned activity does not duplicate existing services or resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management (15 points): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applicants should specify plans for proper organization, staffing, and management of the planning process. Factors that will be considered include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Appropriateness and authority of the governing or managing organization to conduct a state-wide (or regional) planning process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Qualifications of the project team and its leadership to conduct a state-wide (or regional) planning process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Appropriateness of the organizational approach for carrying out the planning activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Evidence of significant involvement and support by the state and by private industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

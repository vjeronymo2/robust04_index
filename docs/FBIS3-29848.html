The five men were detained during a search of the Min Shi  Liao 2753, a 127-ton fishing boat from China's coastal Fujian  Province, which had been anchoring some 1.2 kilometers southwest  of Yokoate- Jima, agency officials said.    The five are alleged to have come ashore on Yokoate-Jima, a  tiny uninhabited island in the Tokara Islands Chain south of  Kyushu.    A passing fishing boat had seen the men setting foot on the  island and reported them to the agency.    The suspects, who reportedly confessed to the allegations,  were sent to Naze on Amami Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, for  further questioning, the officials said. Crew members said the  vessel stopped near the island because of engine trouble.</p>

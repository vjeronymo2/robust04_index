			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / 'Warnings came thick and fast': Homes Assured retrial considered after two former directors convicted of fraudulent trading but jury fails to reach a verdict on one other HOMES ASSURED was the most cruelly ironic of names. The company was launched to capitalise on the sale of council houses to their tenants, and seemed poised to take advantage of one of the most powerful legacies of the Thatcher years. Within two years of its creation it had run up debts of Pounds 10.7m before going into liquidation in August 1989. The collapse left more than 1,500 creditors out of pocket and ultimately led to the convictions at the weekend of two of the company's directors. Homes Assured was established in 1987 by Mr Anthony Dobson, a man described by the judge as 'a Walter Mitty' and 'the ideas man rather than the administrator'. The idea was to tap the class of new homeowners emerging from Britain's 6m council tenants who had been given the chance to buy their properties under the 1980 Housing Act. Homes Assured intended making money in several ways: from selling commissions on endowment policies for mortgages, from top-up loans, from mortgage protection policies and from home improvement loans. The potential seemed enormous. The company used an aggressive commissions policy to encourage sales staff to win business. It also recruited to the board Sir Edward du Cann, the former Conservative party chairman, who resigned as a non-executive director of Homes Assured before liquidators were appointed. But economic conditions began to change. Mortgage rates rose and the housing market started to cool. Delays were caused by councils, which were unexpectedly swamped by applications or opposed the right-to-buy legislation. More significantly, the company ran into internal difficulties. It was created with enormous overheads, quickly spending large sums on computers, offices, cars, entertainment and other expenses. It expanded rapidly, operating four principal subsidiaries and 11 branches and employing up to 400 staff. The quality of the accounting systems varied widely. But Homes Assured's greatest failing was to underestimate cancellations on the endowments it sold. It had budgeted for only 20 per cent to 25 per cent, but 15,000 of the 20,000 policies were cancelled. Early in 1988 Mr Dobson received loans of Pounds 250,000 each from Bank of Boston and Anderson and Company. He failed to mention in his applications that he had reached a voluntary arrangement with his creditors to stave off bankruptcy - a factor which Bank of Boston said would have stopped it providing the money. As the year progressed, there were growing signs that the company was in financial difficulties. Mr Douglas Dunkley, an accountant appointed to the company in April 1988, expressed grave concerns over the quality of the accounting information. He was still struggling to prepare the 1987 accounts in the summer of 1988. Homes Assured was bombarded by creditors demanding the return of their money. Hundreds of reimbursement cheques bounced. In November 1988 Stoy Hayward, the auditors, wrote to advise the directors of the risks of trading while insolvent. 'It seems the warnings were coming thick and fast from every possible direction,' Judge John Rogers QC told the jury in his summing up at the trial last week. Mr Keith Woodward, an accountant who became a director, prepared a statement of the company's affairs which was presented to the courts to stave off an attempt to put it into liquidation in November. There was just one board meeting between November 1988 and April 1989. Yet the company continued to trade in spite of all the difficulties. It was not placed into liquidation until the end of August 1989. Two months later the police began an investigation into the collapse. That led to initial charges in May 1991 against Mr Dobson, Mr Woodward and Mr Michael Robinson. The jury was unable to reach a decision on Mr Robinson. None of the defendants gave evidence at the trial. Their counsels argued that they had acted not dishonestly, but ignorantly or in the belief that Homes Assured would be able to continue trading successfully. They blamed the collapse of Homes Assured on others - including the assurance company Legal &amp; General, which had a tied-agents agreement with the company - for inefficiency and 'poaching' of policies. The trial lasted four months, took evidence from more than 100 witnesses and required a huge number of documents. With the trial complete, the Department of Trade and Industry can proceed with the disqualification orders it is pursuing against seven of the former directors of Homes Assured - including Sir Edward du Cann. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has been monitoring the case closely and is likely to exclude Mr Woodward from membership. But the creditors of Homes Assured remain out of pocket.</p>

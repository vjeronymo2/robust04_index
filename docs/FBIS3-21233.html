The results of the design are outlined below.    COMETS seeks to develop the following three new  communication  and broadcasting technologies:    (1) Inter-satellite communication technology using a large  antenna of 3.6 m diameter with a gimbal mechanism;    (2) Advanced satellite broadcasting technology for  high-quality local broadcasting using a 21-GHz-band 200 W  amplifier;    (3) Advanced mobile satellite communication to meet  diversified mobile communication requirements. It will also  attempt to develop the following performance upgrading  technologies for large geostationary satellites:    (1) Multi-frequency-band satellite system construction  technology;    (2) Highly efficient power supply system;    (3) Propulsion system with apogee engine and reaction  control  systems integrated;    (4) Attitude control system which operate harmoniously with  large antenna drive control.    The major characteristics of COMETS based on the results of  the preliminary design are shown in Table 1. On-orbit appearance  and the appearance at lift-off are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.    The main results of the preliminary design are described  below.    (1) A structure with an antenna tower in the center was  designed to enable housing three large antennas effectively (see  Fig. 2).    (2) Engineers established the detailed specifications of the  frequency and performance for each of the three mission systems  verified by analysis that each development objective can be  attained. They also confirmed by analysis that there was no  mutual frequency interference problems. They will use the  development model test to validate the results.    (3) Various problems arose in integrating the large flexible  solar paddles with the satellite attitude control due to the  complex paddle flexibility, but engineers verified that it is  possible to attain the predetermined control accuracy by  revising the paddle design and optimizing the attitude control  system.    (4) Designers clarified that it is necessary to fold back  the  deployed solar paddle because of its problematic strength during  the apogee engine burning. They studied number of apogee engine  burning and redesigned the paddles to improve reliability. In  the paddle development model test, the engineers will validate  reliability fully by conducting folding and deployment test in a  simulated space environment.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-23A>           Fig. 2.

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Kevin Maxwell wins order on debts MR Kevin Maxwell, faced with an income-tax demand which he says he is unable to meet, was yesterday granted an interim High Court order that temporarily stops creditors bringing civil proceedings against him. At a private hearing before a Chancery Court registrar, Mr Maxwell, son of the late Robert Maxwell, won an order under Section 252 of the 1986 Insolvency Act allowing him time to seek an 'individual voluntary arrangement' with his creditors. Mr George Auger, of accountants Stoy Hayward, was appointed to act as his nominee in seeking the arrangement. Mr Maxwell said through his solicitors, Peters &amp; Peters: 'A demand for the payment of income tax by the Inland Revenue, which I was advised is due and owing and which I am unable to meet, has precipitated my application today for the interim order. 'I have taken this course solely to assist the realisation of my assets for the benefit of all my creditors. I shall do all I can to that end.' The order granted to Mr Maxwell today 'stays' all existing or pending civil proceedings against him, including those brought by creditors, for 14 days to give him time to prepare voluntary settlement proposals for consideration by his nominee.</p>

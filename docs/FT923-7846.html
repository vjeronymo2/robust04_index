			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Blagden at Pounds 6m thanks to all-round advance BLAGDEN Industries, the Hertfordshire-based packaging, chemicals and protective equipment group, bucked recessionary pressures in the six months to June 28 and lifted pre-tax profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 6m. Turnover rose from Pounds 109.7m to Pounds 118.1m. Mr Cameron Smith, chief executive, said he was particularly pleased that profits improvements had been across the board and not simply led by one division. In packaging, the core business, international operating profits rose to Pounds 4.58m (Pounds 4.47m) on turnover up at Pounds 62m (Pounds 59.4m), while the UK side made Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 1.29m) on turnover of Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 20.5m). Volumes in the division increased 6 per cent in the half as prices were reduced. Mr Smith said that, having made 85 per cent of profits a few years ago, the 45 gallon steel drum business now only accounted for 65 per cent. He said he was excited about the future of the new propellant for aerosols - compressed air, rather than flammable gases like butane, opted for after the CFC scare. In chemicals, 'distribution was hammered by recession', but manufacturing accounted for the rise in profits from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 2.14m on turnover of Pounds 25m (Pounds 23.3m). Protective equipment sales grew to Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 6.56m). Mr Smith said: 'Old companies made Pounds 500,000, new ones Pounds 300,000, minus Pounds 300,000 written off' in one-off obsolescence costs, where Blagden redesigned many of its ranges. Because of the international weighting of its profits, Blagden had to write off Pounds 600,000 of advance corporation tax, against last time's Pounds 250,000, of which Mr Smith said: 'With perfect hindsight, it should have been Pounds 500,000.' This lifted the tax charge to 42.5 per cent (38 per cent). Earnings were static at 7.3p per share and, because of the tax penalty, the interim dividend is held at 4.5p.</p>

It must now be realized that the Black  Sea zone is a zone of specific interests, both for Ukraine and  for Russia. The question of the Black Sea Fleet must be resolved  proceeding from that as well.    It seems to me, indicated Oleksandr Moroz, that we should  provide guarantees to the officers and warrant officers of the  Black Sea Fleet with regard to their treatment, and to all  Ukrainians with regard to their rights, while working  concurrently on the creation of our own fleet.</p>

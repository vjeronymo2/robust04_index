			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tbilisi January 26 TASS -- The political council of  the Georgian Social Democratic Party has called for  rapprochement with Russia, "Georgia's natural great ally."    "This approach is the only chance for Georgia to preserve  its  integrity and independence," the council said in an appeal to  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze on Wednesday.    The Georgian leadership should admit that for various  subjective reasons the social, economic, financial and credit  policy of the government has failed. The severance of  traditional ties caused by the sweeping disintegration of the  Soviet Union has resulted in the collapse of whole industries in  the republic, the appeal said.    Georgian Social Democrats disagree with the position of  political organisations which oppose the rapprochement with  Russia, "the only potential country whose powerful industry  makes it a desired partner not only for us, but for more  developed countries as well," the appeal said.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Go-ahead by BP for N Sea platform CONTRACTS for construction of the platform for the North Sea's Andrew Field were placed yesterday by BP Exploration, the operator. The company placed the contract for the steel jacket with Highland Fabricators of Nigg, Ross-shire, and for the deck with Trafalgar House of Teesside. The 25-month construction phase begins next summer. Development of the Andrew field, 140 miles north-east of Aberdeen, has yet to be given board approval, but construction work could also begin next summer. The two losers in the order battle are the UIE yard, at Clydebank, Glasgow, which bid for the deck, and the Italian company Belleli, which bid for the jacket. Highland Fabricators, which employs 800, said the order provided work equivalent to between 350 and 400 jobs. No figures were disclosed, but the deck order is thought to be worth Pounds 100m and the support structure Pounds 25m. The value of the UK's North Sea oil reserves fell by 7 per cent last month because of declining oil prices and a stronger pound, economists at the Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday in its monthly North Sea index. Output from production platforms in the North Sea was valued at Pounds 21.2m a day, compared with Pounds 22.9m in August. But gas production rose by 23 per cent to a four-month peak as more gas fields came on stream and output rose to meet winter demand. The gas was worth Pounds 8m a day, giving a total oil and gas production value of Pounds 29.1m.</p>

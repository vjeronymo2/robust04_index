			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA CAN SHOW IT REALLY HAS A HEART  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa City Council has an opportunity Monday to salvage the city's  reputation as a community with a heart. It should rescind its decision to evict  the Share Our Selves charity from a community center until a new location can  be found.  </P> <P> SOS plans to ask for a 2- to 3-month extension on its lease to give it time to  negotiate purchase of a new site, an action made possible only last week by the  generous outpouring of donations that have come in the wake of publicity over  SOS's plight. The council majority, responding to neighborhood complaints about  SOS, ordered the charity to move its food, clothing and financial assistance  operations. Although the city offered to help SOS find another location, it  balked when faced with the cost of helping it move to an industrial building  the city had located. SOS's fate hung in the balance.  </P> <P> But pressure has continued to build on the council, with Orange County  religious leaders jumping into the fray. Summing up the matter, Father Michael  P. Driscoll, the vicar of charities for the Diocese of Orange, said, "It  strikes me that if Jesus lived today, the city of Costa Mesa would find him  undesirable." Meanwhile, SOS supporters vowed to fast this weekend and Monday  to try to get the council to reconsider its order to start eviction proceedings  Thursday.  </P> <P> On Friday, Mayor Peter F. Buffa made a new proposal to move SOS to Community  Development Council offices in another part of town, well away from residential  areas. Whether or not Buffa has the two votes needed to win approval of his  plan is unclear at this time; it calls for the city to subsidize the lease by  $177,658 over five years, with SOS paying slightly less.  </P> <P> While that would be money well spent, the city should instead give SOS an  extension on its current lease to give the charity the time needed to purchase  its own building. This would not only relieve the city of financial  responsibility but give SOS the autonomy it needs. The latter is important  because there are City Council members who want to exclude illegal aliens from  receiving SOS services, a restriction that cannot be tolerated.  </P> <P> Two council members who voted against SOS in the past have accused the charity  of dragging its feet and playing politics in order to get its way. Frankly,  it's good to see SOS employing political pressure to save itself. We only hope  it is not too late.  </P></p>

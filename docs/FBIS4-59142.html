			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Umaymah 'Abd-al-Latif: "Controversial Conference </F> Moves to Cyprus"]    [Text] In a last-minute change, the organisers of a  forthcoming conference on the ethnic and religious minorities of  the Middle East decided to shift the parley to Cyprus after it  triggered opposition from the bulk of Egyptian  intellectuals--both Christian and Muslim.    "We have decided that we cannot work under pernicious  conditions and make this conference a success," Sulayman Shafiq,  a member of staff at the Ibn-Khuldun Centre organising the  conference, told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY.    The conference, scheduled to take place between 12-14 May,  first came under fire from the renowned political analyst and  writer Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal for including on its agenda a  discussion of the problems of Copts in Egypt.    Other intellectuals followed suit, and Pope Shanudah III of  the Coptic Orthodox Church issued a statement in which he  rejected the designation of Copts as a minority and insisted  that they were part and parcel of the Egyptian nation.    "We have striven to hold this conference, which deals  specifically with the Middle East and the Arab world, in Egypt  in order to acknowledge its regional role and to challenge any  misconceptions about domestic security," Shafiq said.    But, he added, organisers had to reconsider and decided to  move the conference to "another country where freedom of  expression does not come under severe attack".    Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi, head of the Shura [Consultative]  Council, was quoted on Monday as saying the state opposed the  convening of the conference on Egyptian soil because Copts and  Muslims make up one nation, share the same history and coexist.    But Shafiq denied that the organisers were aware of any  government objection. "We have not been informed of any  governmental opposition to holding the conference," Shafiq said.    Shafiq disclosed that even before the storm was triggered  the  organisers had considered a number of alternative  host-countries. Cyprus was a strong option and Lebanon also  offered to play host.    "We chose Egypt because we wanted to challenge the image  that  is being projected of Egypt as an unsafe country," he said.  "But it seems that intellectual terrorism is much more powerful  than armed terrorism."    State Councellor Sulayman Qiladah thinks the decision to  move  the conference reflects the success of Egyptian public opinion  in rejecting a gathering that includes on its agenda the  possibility of international interference in the region under  the guise of protecting minority rights.    "This is a major achievement of the unified stand made by  all  Egyptians who refused to discuss a topic that should only be  discussed within an Egyptian framework," he said. "The good  thing about this conference is that it showed how strong our  national unity could be at times of crisis."    Shafiq said the Egyptian delegation to the conference will  be  made up of 20 prominent personalities, including Dr Mahmud  Hafiq, head of the Shura Council's services committee, Prof.  Mahmud al-Juhari, president of Hilwan University, Jihad 'Udah a  political analyst, and seven Coptic figures led by Dr Wasim  al-Sisi.    A discussion of Coptic "problems" is still on the agenda but  Shafiq was not sure whether it would actually take place.    Fahmi Huwaydi, a writer on Islamic issues who turned down  an invitation to attend the conference, said that shifting the  conference from Cairo to Cyprus will not solve the complicated  problems of Middle Eastern minorities.    "The conference remains a defence of the minorities' cause  more than a serious and true attempt to put an end to their  grievances and problems," he said. "The situation of the  minorities is far too complicated to be discussed through such a  modest institution as the Ibn-Khuldun Centre."    Another writer on Islamic affairs, president of al-Zaqaziq  University Dr Muhammad 'Imarah, expressed dissatisfaction with  the removal of the conference from Egyptian territory. He said  that certain lines should not be crossed or even approached by  research centres and this conference seems to have gone far  beyond these lines. It was time, he said, that it was stopped.    "Now it is not, as some would claim, the freedom of  expression and thought we should protect; it is a whole nation  that should be protected, before they divide it into minorities  and majorities and produce a climate ripe for sectarian strife,"  'Imarah said.    Huwaydi pointed out that the topic was first studied in the  '70s by the Arabic Studies Centre of which Sa'd al-Din Ibrahim,  the chairman of the Ibn-Khuldun Centre, was also a member.    "This centre had its effective presence in the Arab world at  the time and had no connections with any foreign  associations--which could cast doubts on the credibility of any  institution."    A side-result of the controversy was the resignation of  Jamal  Badawi, editor-in-chief of the newspaper AL-WAFD, after Wafd  Party Chairman Fu'ad Saraj-al-Din gave last minute orders to  lift Haykal's article lambasting the conference.    Shadin Shihab reports, however, that Badawi appears ready to  withdraw his resignation. "The problem between Badawi and Fu'ad  Pasha has been resolved and I am very optimistic that Badawi  will resume the functions of his post very soon," Yasin  Saraj-al-Din, leading Wafd member and brother to the party  leader, told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY. He said that if Badawi  contributed his weekly article for publication, "then we must  conclude that the problem has dissolved into thin air".  Badawi's name continues to appear on the newspaper's masthead  despite the reported resignation.    Yasin Saraj-al-Din explained that Badawi had given him, and  not Fu'ad Saraj-al-Din, his letter of resignation which was to  be passed on to the party leader. "I am the closest person to  both of them and Badawi found it too embarrassing because of his  great respect for the Pasha," Saraj-al-Din said. "I never gave  the letter to the Pasha. It is still in my pocket. I decided  to resolve the dispute and not to widen it further."    Badawi was not available for comment.</p>

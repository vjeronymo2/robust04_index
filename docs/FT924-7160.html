			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Curtain set to fall on Gatt drama - Since the Round began, critics agree it is worthy but tedious ONE of the world's longest-running theatre productions, the Uruguay Round, may be nearing its final curtain at talks in Washington tonight and tomorrow, as the EC and US try to settle rows over competing food exports, and clear the way for far-reaching trade reform. Since the Round was first staged six years ago, critics agree it is worthy, but tedious to watch. But in its final scenes, the dramatis personae have sparked flashes of melodrama, enlivening the tale for those who sat through the monotony, and those wanting a happy ending. The Americans woke the audience by introducing trade war into the plot: a battery of Dollars 300m (Pounds 198.6m) punitive tariffs on EC food exports from December 5 unless the Europeans please US soyabean farmers by agreeing a ceiling on EC oilseeds output. Another Dollars 1.7bn of US sanctions could follow, with the EC hitting back over US goods. The chemistry of relations either between US negotiators, or US negotiators and their EC counterparts, has probably influenced the Round less critically than the volatile relationships at the EC's highest echelons. Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, has said negotiating with the EC is like doing so with the Keystone Cops; US officials have said differences of opinion at the top of the EC have led to paralysis. Mr Madigan and Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, draw their authority from President Bush, and have always entered talks with a clear brief defined with his agreement. Mrs Hills has been as subject to the lobbying influence of US farmers as Mr Madigan, and has apparently not disagreed with him over the 'bottom-line' positions the US should adopt to a farm trade deal. The transatlantic chemistry has helped progress to a deal. As two Irishmen, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Madigan appear easy with each other. Mr Madigan's complaints have never been pointed at Mr MacSharry, although US and EC bottom-line positions remain frustratingly irreconcilable. It is yet to be seen if these positions can come closer. The chemistry has helped, too, in the relationship between Mrs Hills and Mr Andriessen. The two have come to know each other well, and caused Mrs Hills' rather humourless, lawyerly qualities to soften. Mr Andriessen is seen to have has played a role in counselling Mrs Hills on French obsessions, encouraging her to moderate retaliation over oilseeds. Mrs Hills' legal background must help explain her indignation over EC refusal to bow to two Gatt panel rulings against its oilseeds subsidies. She believes she fought and won fairly two legal battles, and is outraged at EC prevarication. Mr Dunkel, who entered the frame for the first time this year when mandated by Gatt to mediate between the US and the EC, has spent the 11 months as a spectator, his patience and conciliation tested to the extreme. He knows his intermediatory role has limited effect. He hovers at the margins, reminding negotiators more is at stake than farm trade, and more countries' interests are involved than just the EC and US. If he thinks important negotiating time has been spent on the US-EC farm row, he has been successful, veiled as normally in a cloud of Gitane smoke, in hiding it. The Europeans, coming from 12 wrangling nations, offer a more numerous cast, leading to US complaints that Washington never knows who speaks for the EC: the European Commission, the Council of Ministers, France, Germany, or the UK. This is a trifle disingenuous, since the US administration often appears to European eyes as an archipelago of agencies acting out competing sub-plots. The Americans have a point. There are a lot of Euro-players, frequently seeming to read from different scripts. The main ones have been: Mr Ray MacSharry; Mr Frans Andriessen, external affairs commissioner; Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president; and Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, Mr John Gummer and Mr Ignaz Kiechle, agriculture ministers respectively of France, the UK and Germany. Mr MacSharry, the bruiser in the Euro-cast, sticks obstinately to his line when he has made up his mind. The Americans like dealing with him because of this consistency. 'The first thing I do when I go into talks is put myself in the other fellow's seat,' he said a year ago, as he started bludgeoning 12 unanimously opposed EC agriculture ministers into agreeing the farm reform, ostensibly the basis for the Round's negotiations. Mr MacSharry's public row with Mr Delors 10 days ago helped force the EC camp into deciding if it would (more or less) unite to try to negotiate a deal, or prepare for transatlantic trade hostilities. Mr Delors, whose vision relaunched Europe to greater integration, was accused of siding with France on the farm question. Some of his colleagues suspect he nurses ambitions to be its president. His attempts to restrain Mr MacSharry from reaching what he sees as a deal too favourable to the US partly reflects a desire for Europe to stand up to its 'big brother', and a romantic attachment to rural France which he fears will erupt in ire if French farmers feel sold out. The dispute with Mr MacSharry has damaged him in Europe, but may end by enhancing his reputation in France. Mr Andriessen has guided the other strands of the Round towards its end. Ranging from services to intellectual property, they are more important but less contentious than the farm issue. Mr MacSharry has clashed with him frequently, believing him too accommodating to the US. The Commission negotiates on behalf of the EC, mandated by national ministers who appear further down the acting credits. The ministerial mandate comes from their national leaders, often making it hard to distinguish between their performances for the gallery and their underlying role in the plot. Pivotal is Mr Kiechle from Bavaria. The central problem of EC agriculture is that its prices have been set to match the high costs of a long-standing German farm structure. When he was cajoled by his divided German coalition partners to agree sharp price cuts in May, farm reform was in the bag. hard Mr Soisson is the unhappiest member of the cast. Given the farm job barely a month ago with explicit instructions to stop any deal inimical to French farming, he fast found any deal would be worse than what French farmers have been told. But his suggestion that Frenchmen should drink more white wine targeted by US sanctions has added farce to the plot.</p>

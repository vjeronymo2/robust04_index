			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, January 12 (TANJUG) -- The Russian  Government's humanitarian delivery to the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia which arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday [11 January] is  only the first in a series of planned humanitarian actions,  Russian Government official Yuri Badrov told a press conference  in Belgrade on Wednesday. The shipment includes 20 tonnes of  baby food and two tonnes of medicaments.    Head of the Russian ministry for emergency situations Valery  Shuykov said the action was a manifestation of the Russian  people's wish to help the Yugoslavs at their time of need. The  hospitality and gratitude which we felt from the moment we  stepped on the ground of your great country is indescribable, he  said. This was a second humanitarian delivery which the United  Nations Sanctions Committee has lately approved without delay,  in only six days. The first was sent by the Greek government.    The committee has so far prevented this kind of assistance  and we are grateful to the Russian government and the embassy in  Belgrade for investing great efforts to ensure that the  humanitarian supplies reach our country, said commissioner for  refugees of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia Dobrica Vulovic.  Humanitarian supplies are exempted from the regime of sanctions  which was imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in  May 1992 because of its alleged involvement in the civil war in  the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina but  humanitarian deliveries sent to Yugoslavia have nevertheless  been delayed owing to petty bureaucracy practiced by the  sanctions committee.    As a result of the tough economic sanctions, the population  of Yugoslavia and over 700,000 refugees are currently on the  verge of total poverty because the country lacks the most  essential products, medicaments and fuels for heating  apartments, schools and refugee centres during winter months.</p>

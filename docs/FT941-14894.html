			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Carclo advances to Pounds 5.19m - Existing businesses decline but Arthur Lee buy exceeds forecasts Carclo Engineering Group yesterday announced a 41 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profit, reflecting a better than expected performance from Arthur Lee, the engineering group it acquired in June 1993. Mr John Ewart, chairman, said that order books were significantly fuller than last year, although margins remained under pressure in its core card clothing division. Turnover for the six months to September 30 advanced to Pounds 65.6m (Pounds 40.7m) with a contribution of Pounds 23.8m from Arthur Lee. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 5.19m (Pounds 3.68m). Earnings per share increased by 0.6p to 6.9p and an interim dividend of 1.9p (1.8p) is declared. Arthur Lee's operating profit during the period more than doubled to Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 1.35m), of which Pounds 1.47m related to the period before acquisition, leaving a contribution of Pounds 1.87m to operating profits. Mr Ewart said the result was 'better than any pre-acquisition forecasts'. This contrasted with the performance of the existing businesses. The card clothing division suffered a 12 per cent drop in operating profit to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.53m), primarily due to the economic downturn in continental Europe, where it operates three factories. General engineering contributed a lower Pounds 928,000 (Pounds 1.16m); wire division profits, however, increased to Pounds 868,000 (Pounds 754,000). The RSR division improved to Pounds 390,000 (Pounds 353,000). Bruntons, the wire manufacturing subsidiary which is being reorganised following the merger with Arthur Lee, has picked up contracts worth more than Pounds 4m for the Tsing Ma bridge linking Hong Kong with its new airport. Carclo also announced it had sold its 16.6 per cent stake in Bombay-listed Indian Card Clothing for Pounds 1.2m. COMMENT The merger with Arthur Lee has proven well-timed, as it has coincided with stagnant earnings from the core businesses. By comparison, Lee had a strong performance in all three divisions, particularly Lee Steel Strip, which helped steel profits jump from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 2.15m. There should be more to come, as the synergistic benefits from the acquisition have yet to come through into group earnings. The companies are merging head offices and restructuring their wire manufacturing divisions. Lee will remain the engine for growth for the current year, but in 1994-95 the core Carclo businesses should benefit from an estimated Pounds 7m in capital expenditure during the current financial year. Full-year profits are likely to top Pounds 12m, for a prospective p/e of 19. This suggests that the extent of the current earnings upswing is written into the share price.</p>

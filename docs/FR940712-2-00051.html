			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Recipient Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Conduct a retrospective evaluation of medical and laboratory records to obtain histories of CD4+ and HIV testing, the occurrence of opportunistic infections (OIs) among persons reported to AIDS surveillance, and the number and type of sites that provide care for HIV-infected persons to determine the sensitivity, validity, and timeliness of AIDS surveillance and the ability to effectively monitor the epidemic using the 1993 AIDS surveillance definition and reporting system. As needed, conduct personal interviews with all, or a sample of, persons who are reported with AIDS to retrospectively collect data on dates and results of all prior CD4+ and HIV tests, OIs, receipt of treatment and prophylaxis, and degree of access to the health care system. If the cases being investigated received treatment in multiple health facilities, as many records as possible should be pursued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Propose alternative surveillance methods to increase the cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of case-finding. For example, areas with provider-based surveillance can pilot a laboratory-initiated reporting system and compare this activity to existing surveillance methods. For areas with both provider and laboratory-initiated case-finding methods, evaluative methods may include comparing data from these sources to alternative data bases. The alternative data bases used for evaluation should not currently be linked to case-finding activities, and may vary by State (e.g., death certificates are used for case-finding in most areas, and are therefore not useful for evaluation activities). Other methods to increase efficiency may be explored in comparison to existing case-finding methods, including: sampling for risk information; reporting only from laboratory and alternative data bases, such as death registries; and conducting active surveillance for preventable opportunistic infections only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Collect data in the treatment and services referral section of the adult HIV/AIDS confidential case report form on all or a representative sample of persons reported to AIDS surveillance, describe the data sources, the collection methods, and determine resources needed to obtain these data. Develop measures to assess the usefulness of these data for the planning of prevention activities by the local health department and community planning bodies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Participate in meetings to plan and develop standardized evaluation protocols and to discuss progress and methodologic issues. If travel is needed it will be supported through specific funds awarded in this cooperative agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Ensure confidentiality of information collected from persons with AIDS and persons with confirmed or suspected HIV infection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Maintain responsibility for analysis and presentation of data collected for local purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Demonstrate coordination with existing HIV/AIDS surveillance activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Identify and select appropriate staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. CDC Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Provide oversight and technical assistance as the project progresses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Assist the participant in planning and implementing the evaluation, including providing technical guidance in the development of data collection instruments, outcome measures, reporting protocols, training, and pretesting methods. Coordinate activities among project participants to promote information sharing and ensure comparability of data collection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Compile, analyze, and report results of aggregate data in collaboration with participating sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

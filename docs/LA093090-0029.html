			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT PROPERTY: IT'S CIAO TO SINGER'S ITALIAN-STYLE VILLA  </P> <P> Pop singer KENNY LOGGINS -- who is working on a new album, "Leap of Faith," to  be released early next year before he goes on tour -- and his wife, Eva, have  put their nearly 20-acre Montecito home on the market at $14 million.  </P> <P> The couple is selling because they filed for divorce, sources say. They have  been married for 12 years and have three children.  </P> <P> They had the home built two years ago after touring Italy with their architect,  Barry Berkus. Berkus designed the compound to take advantage of the ocean and  mountain views and to capture the 8th- through 16th-Century Tuscan hill town  architecture.  </P> <P> The idea was to make the Loggins' home seem as if it had evolved over time,  like a town through the ages. Centuries-old beams and timbers were used to  create the villa, along with antique pavers, handcrafted iron, blown glass and  hand-made bricks.  </P> <P> The home has nine bedrooms, 10 1/2 baths, five kitchens, three laundry rooms,  seven fireplaces, a four-car attached garage and a two-car detached garage/work  shop with toy storage.  </P> <P> There is an 8,500-square-foot main house, guest house or nanny's quarters, pool  house, caretaker's cottage, sports complex and kennel.  </P> <P> The home also has a well, stream, pool, spa, pond, two waterfalls and  fountains. There is a tree house in the yard, an orchard, vineyard bearing  Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, and rose, vegetable and herb gardens.  </P> <P> Penelope Williams of Prudential Rodeo Realty, Montecito, has the listing.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Hills home of the late politician EVELLE YOUNGER has been sold,  and his widow, Mildred, has purchased a smaller home in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Younger, who died of heart disease in the house in May, 1989, was Los Angeles  County district attorney during the prosecutions of mass murderer Charles  Manson and Sirhan Sirhan, assassin of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Later, as state  attorney general, he ran for governor, losing to Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr.  </P> <P> His widow, the daughter of a politician, shared his lifelong bent for politics  and was once a candidate for the Legislature.  </P> <P> "They didn't live in the Hollywood Hills home very long," said Jack Hupp, who  represented her with Betty Kelly, also of his Beverly Hills realty firm. "They  bought it in 1987. Then Evelle Younger passed away very suddenly, and she was  left alone in a rather large house; she felt like she wanted someplace a little  smaller."  </P> <P> The Youngers' Hollywood Hills home was described as about 4,000 square feet in  size. The new house is a little smaller, one story with a pool, sources said.  </P> <P> She paid $1.5 million for her new home, according to public records, and sold  her Hollywood Hills home for $2.1 million through Jan Smith of Rodeo Realty.  Her new Beverly Hills home had been listed by Ron de Salvo of Douglas  Properties.  </P> <P> BEVERLY SASSOON, former wife of hair-expert VIDAL SASSOON who has her own  cosmetics/skin-care line and published her first novel, "Fantasies," last  February, has listed her Holmby Hills home at $1.75 million.  </P> <P> "Her four kids (from her marriage to Sassoon) are all grown and moved out, so  she's shopping for a condo on the Wilshire Corridor," said Carrie Winston,  Sassoon's spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The four-bedroom, 4 1/2-bath Holmby house was remodeled and expanded about six  years ago, according to Pat Meder, who has the listing with Fred Sands' Century  City/Holmby Hills office.  </P> <P> "They added a second story then and redid the house from stem to stern," she  said. The contemporary-style home has skylights, an office and a fireplace in  the master suite.  </P> <P> The original house was built about 50 years ago. Sassoon has owned the property  for four years.  </P> <P> Actor SIDNEY TOLER, who appeared in 22 movies, mainly during the 1940s as the  detective Charlie Chan, planned to build a palace on a Hollywood hilltop but  died in 1947 after starting the grading, sources say.  </P> <P> The 14-acre site, in the area known as Mt. Olympus, stood barren until George  Hillinger, a retired importer/exporter, and his wife, Vera, bought the tract  and subdivided it, selling four acres and keeping three. The other seven are on  the market.  </P> <P> Now the Hillingers are building a 14,000-square-foot mansion on the hilltop.  </P> <P> "It's their dream house," said architect Rick Schwartz about the Hillingers'  estate, which he estimated will cost almost $2 million to build, not including  site development and other expenses, by the time the place is completed next  spring.  </P> <P> The seven-bedroom, 10-bath home will have an interior/exterior swimming pool,  two-story entrance with a dome and a skylight, a cantilevered dance floor to  accommodate 200 guests, a small lake with a waterfall, a fire pit with a  sitting area and a view of Mt. Baldy to the ocean.  </P> <P> The Hillingers have no children. "But they like to entertain," Schwartz said.  </P></p>

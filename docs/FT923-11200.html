			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Big powers taken to task over Somalia THE UNITED Nations secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, last night proposed a greatly expanded international peacemaking and relief role in Somalia, where famine and civil war have claimed thousands of lives, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent in New York. His written recommendations to the Security Council followed remarks in which he contrasted its preoccupation with Yugoslavia against minimal UN involvement in Somalia, although casualties in both places were comparable. He proposed a consolidated UN operation in four zones for humanitarian relief, ceasefire monitoring, security, demobilisation and disarmament and the promotion of national reconciliation.</p>

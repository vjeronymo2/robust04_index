			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNCIL'S ETHICS BILL  </P> <P> For our council members to suggest that, if given the same salary as Superior  Court judges, they will be ethical is patently ludicrous. The requirements in  education and experience to become a judge go far beyond those needed to become  a council member.  </P> <P> So what it boils down to is "if you pay us enough we will follow our own code  of ethics!" Should we raise the salaries of all city employees who will also  adhere to the same code?  </P> <P> To have to pay elected officials extra to maintain a standard of ethics  includes the implication that if they do not get the money, they won't be  ethical.  </P> <P> I find I am not alone in decrying the sleazy tactic of tying the raise to the  ethics code, and submitting it to the voters as a "take it or leave it package"  when the council knows full well that, if separated, the pay raise would be  resoundingly defeated. This subterfuge in itself shows a complete lack of  ethics on the part of the council members who voted for it. We should be  thoroughly ashamed of them.  </P> <P> WAYNE LINCOLN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

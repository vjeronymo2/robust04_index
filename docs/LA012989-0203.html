			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 250,000 EXPECTED FOR LITTLE SAIGON'S 3-DAY TET FESTIVAL  </P> <P> With only 6 days left before the beginning of the Tet festival celebrating the  lunar new year, the offices of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Orange  County's Little Saigon resemble a war room.  </P> <P> Gone are the sedate pictures of lakes and scenic countryside that adorned the  walls. In their place, Tet festival coordinator Tony Lam has hung maps,  bulletin boards, flow charts and the names of an army of volunteers.  </P> <P> A telephone rings, and Lam answers it: "Hello? Hello? Yes, this is Tony Lam.  Yes, yes, I know the bunting was the wrong color. Yes, I agree, the lettering  doesn't show up enough. But what am I to do? They're up already! We're doing  all we can."  </P> <P> "Next year," he mutters to himself, after putting the telephone down. "Next  year, we're going to start organizing right after Tet. None of this 3-month  stuff. It's killing me."  </P> <P> More than 250,000 people are expected to visit Little Saigon during a 3-day Tet  festival that will begin Friday to usher in the Year of the Snake. Although  Feb. 6 actually is the first day of the lunar new year, the celebrations begin  days in advance.  </P> <P> After months of bickering about which Vietnamese organization would coordinate  Tet activities, a tug-of-war ended with the chamber winning because it was  backed by the Vietnamese business community of Westminster's Little Saigon,  said Westminster Mayor Charles V. Smith.  </P> <P> For many Westminster officials, it was their first taste of ethnic rivalry. But  for the most part, Smith said, "we only acted as intermediaries after  complaints came in from different agencies wanting to take over and control the  festival."  </P> <P> Now that the plum assignment has gone to the Vietnamese chamber's festival  committee, it has had to ensure the festival's success by borrowing more than  $150,000 to help pay for a performance stage, parking shuttles, security,  lighting and special shows.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Little Nervous'  </P> <P> "We're confident we can pay the bank back, but it has made us a little  nervous," said Chuoc Vo-Ta, the chamber's executive director.  </P> <P> "After all," Lam added, "it is bad luck if you still owe people money on the  first day of the new year."  </P> <P> Bolsa Avenue will be cordoned off from Moran Street almost to Magnolia Street  for the festival. Events will take place within a fenced area, and admission  will be charged to help reduce costs, Lam said.  </P> <P> Admission is $3 for adults, and $1 for children ages 3 to 10. Children under 3  are free.  </P> <P> The area is where the chamber's office is located and where Lam and 150  volunteers have planned what is expected to be the largest Tet celebration  since the first wave of Southeast Asian refugees arrived in Orange County in  1975.  </P> <P> In Westminster, Vietnamese businessmen took over an aging commercial strip on  Bolsa Avenue and revitalized the area with new shopping malls housing grocery  markets, fabric shops, bookstores and restaurants.  </P> <P> "For our city, it's meant an improved tax base," Mayor Smith said.  </P> <P> "What is significant about Little Saigon is that the businessmen built the area  on their own, independent of the city," he said.  </P> <P> There are more than 320,000 Vietnamese in California, about 120,000 of them in  Orange County. Vietnamese neighborhoods have started in Central Los Angeles,  Cerritos and upscale areas of Costa Mesa. But nowhere are they more visible  than in Orange County's Little Saigon.  </P> <P> In the past 14 years, the commercial area along Bolsa Avenue in Westminster and  Garden Grove -- designated a tourist zone in 1988 -- has gained a reputation as  the center of Vietnamese business and culture.  </P> <P> For many Vietnamese residents, the eve of the new year will be traditionally  spent giving offerings to the God of Prosperity.  </P> <P> The area's Buddhist temples will be open, and many Buddhists have altars at  home and customarily prepare a bounty of food for their ancestors or deceased  family members so that they can share in the new year's prosperity, Lam said.  </P> <P> The Chinese lunar calender has a 12-year cycle. The 20th Century, according to  the cycle, opened with the Year of the Rat. The Rat was replaced by the Ox,  then the Tiger, the Hare, the Dragon, the Snake, the Horse, the Sheep, the  Monkey, the Rooster, the Dog and the Wild Boar. Each of the 12 animals  supposedly has both positive and negative qualities.  </P> <P> The Vietnamese New Year festival begins at the first new moon after the sun  enters Aquarius. The day may fall between Jan. 21 and Feb. 19.  </P> <P> "With each new year," Lam said, "we believe that life is a continuing hope. My  father's hope, for instance, is to see my brother and my sister being able to  get out of Vietnam next year."  </P> <P> But some families, such as that of Dr. Co Pham, a Fountain Valley surgeon, plan  a less traditional Tet, one more oriented to the children.  </P> <P> "For us, and other professionals, it's a chance for our children to see where  our roots began," Pham said. "Although my children are able to speak a little  Vietnamese, they're growing up in a Western culture. They need to see and hear  Vietnamese customs like Tet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parade With Bands  </P> <P> Bakeries will be busy making such traditional foods as banh chung, a square  gelatinous cake made of rice, mung beans and pork, wrapped in banana leaves,  and a type of Vietnamese fruitcake called mut.  </P> <P> New this year, organizers said, is a parade with marching bands, shuttle buses  to ease parking problems, Vietnamese string bands and several entertainment  shows directed by Hoang Thi Tho, who was well-known in South Vietnam's  entertainment industry before the Communists took over the country in 1975.  </P> <P> "In our first year of organizing Tet, we only had one martial arts group. Now  we have four. And in addition, we will have Buddhist and Catholic folk dances.  But this year, more than any other, we've made room for many different ethnic  communities," said Lam, noting that Koreans, Cambodians, Latinos, Chinese and  Anglos will be represented in the parade or other activities.  </P> <P> "For us, it's a proud time to be Vietnamese," Lam said.  </P> <P> Related story: Part I, Page 1.  </P></p>

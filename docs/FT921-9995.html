			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: A lifeboat for your old age - How to. . . . pay for long-term car / Do not forget that a long life can leave you dependent on others PEOPLE live longer nowadays. That's the good news. The bad news is that because of this many more of us now face a period of dependency, or long-term care. Private residential care is not cheap, particularly if you stay there for a long time. It can eat up a lifetime's savings. It might, therefore, be worth taking financial action to prepare for it. The same thought has occurred to insurers. Over the last year, a series of insurers have dipped their toes into the water of long-term care (LTC) insurance. The need, for all of us, is obvious - but so are the risks, on both sides. Big changes in the UK's demography have created the need for LTC insurance. These are still a long way from the fixed actuarial certainties which life insurers use when doing business. Instead, they rely on survey evidence and claims experience from other countries. A few more significant medical advances over the next two decades, and the insurers could see a sharp increase in claims. This means that premiums are high. There is also a risk for the consumer. If you regularly pay out premiums, on top of all your other insurance payments, from the age of 40 through to 80, and then die suddenly in your sleep, the insurance will not look like good value. Add to this the fact that direct comparisons between the schemes on the market are impossible, as none of them are identical, and life for the consumer gets even harder. Apart possibly from experienced medics and far-sighted actuaries or underwriters, it is difficult for anyone to tell what is good value and what is not. Once you have taken all these strictures on board, the guidelines should still help you to find at least the most appropriate provisions for you. There are three times when you might want to take action: While you are still working These are the most ambitious schemes. Commercial Union, MGI Prime, Aetna and PPP are the four companies to have entered the market thus far. All start paying once you can be shown to need long-term care. CU, Aetna and PPP use a scale of 'Activities of Daily Living' (ADLs). For example, PPP lists six: Mobility (the ability to get in and out of chair or bed), washing, dressing, feeding, toileting, and continence. Once you have failed tests for a certain number of them, you are eligible for pay-outs. Policies also pay out on diagnosis of mental illness. MGI Prime has a more ambitious method of measurement, and a scale of 19 qualifying disabilities, including blindness, deafness and loss of dexterity. MGI and PPP aim to take a 'hands-on' approach to care provision, and fees are paid direct to the care providers which they help to choose. CU, which does not have such a strong background in health insurance, still offers a 'care consultant' counselling service, and will arrange for you to be cared for at home as long as possible. Aetna's Generations plan, unlike the others, has an investment element, so you can stop paying the premiums and still receive some money. Your heirs can receive the bulk of what you have paid in after you die. However, the policy should not be used as an investment in its own right. You choose a level of income for which you wish to insure, and then pay the premiums. Within 90 days of your failing the ADL tests, Aetna starts paying you the income. The problem with all of these is the premium. These are not directly comparable, but for example, take the following research, from the magazine Moneywise. For cover of Pounds 300 a week, inflation-proofed, a 50-year-old woman would need to pay Pounds 70.70 monthly to Aetna, Pounds 127.30 to CU, and Pounds 53 to MGI Prime. By the age of 70, these figure increase to Pounds 339, Pounds 263.26 and Pounds 160 respectively. When you retire One product is on the market. Cannon Lincoln offers the Oasis Plus annuity on retirement. This gives you a 10 per cent worse initial annuity rate than you would normally have, but then increases substantially in the event that you need long-term care. The pension escalates by a factor which will vary according to your sex, and the age when you started drawing the pension, 90 days after you fail an ADL test. The factor can be as high as 400 per cent. Those who do not have much retirement income provision apart from their pension will probably have to give this one a miss. But if you are reasonably comfortable about the strength of your investments, and there is reason to believe that you might be needing long-term care - if your parents had a lengthy old age, for example - this adroitly thought-out product could make sense. It may not be long before other companies, with better annuity rates, imitate it. When you need to move into residential care Now the choice is much simpler - you know the costs, and the need is just to make paying them easier. Three companies have offered tailor-made products, all based on an annuity. Remember that at this late stage, any method you choose is going to cost either you, or your children. These schemes will ease financial pain to an extent - but they are unlikely to pick up all of the bill. However, annuities can offer value in these circumstances, because they will normally be taken out by people with a very limited life expectancy. Another possibility, for those anxious to preserve their estate intact for their heirs, is to use a variation on the 'back-to-back' annuity deals popular in estate planning. You take a lump sum, put half of it in an annuity, and the remainder in an investment vehicle which aims for capital growth. This then attempts to make good the shortfall in the estate caused by buying the annuity. That explains the general principle, but you need to do very precise sums to make it work. You might also be happier if you buy an annuity which is 'capital-protected'. This guarantees to repay any remaining original capital when the annuitant dies. Another option is to take out a temporary annuity, with a fixed term of five or ten years. The possibilities for the 'growth' investment should be familiar to Weekend FT readers. Unit or investment trusts, ideally held within a PEP, make sense, as, possibly, would a with-profits bond. Given the difficulty of the sums involved, there may be a case for choosing one of the two 'packaged' long-term care payment plans, from Clerical Medical and Pearl. Clerical offers a five-year temporary annuity, into which a third of the funds should be paid. The remainder goes into a unit trust PEP. The plan's minimum investment is Pounds 15,000 and it is open to anyone under the age of 95. Pearl offers a ten-year capital-protected annuity, back-to-back with a with-profits bond. Eagle Star offers the most ambitious scheme, which could be of use if you have a lot of capital. You pay a large sum to Eagle Star, which then promises to pay your care fees for life. Payments increase by the RPI plus 2 per cent each year, and rates are better if you are in particularly bad health. There is a return of capital if death occurs within six months (or within a longer period, if you are prepared to pay more). This plan is expensive, but does effectively guard against the risk of living a long time in costly care. Finally, beware of buying insurance you do not need. A fee-charging adviser might offer you better value, given the high commission levels of many of these products.</p>

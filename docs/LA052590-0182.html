			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAMPBELL SOUP PLANS SELLOFF OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN FOOD UNITS  </P> <P> Campbell Soup Co. said today it plans to sell several of its European food  units in an effort to focus on its more profitable businesses.  </P> <P> On the auction block are D. Lazzaroni &amp; C. SpA of Italy; Campbell Seafoods  Division, which operates in the United Kingdom and Belgium; the vegetable  division of Campbell Foods PLC in England; and Campbell Irish Foods Ltd. and  Mallow Foods Ltd., both of Ireland.  </P> <P> The latter three companies were acquired when Campbell took over Freshbake  Foods Group PLC of Britain in 1988. Total sales of all the businesses to be  sold exceed $200 million, the company said.  </P> <P> Campbell said it expects the sale to result in a $55-million charge against  fourth-quarter earnings.  </P> <P> Campbell has faced increasing problems over the last year and has been  frequently rumored as a takeover target because of its sluggish performance and  depressed stock price. Some members of the founding family have urged a sale of  the entire company.  </P></p>

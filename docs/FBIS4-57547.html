			<p>BFN     [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy yesterday received  Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. Later the president  said that Paraguay will place a list of national products at the  disposal of Romanian authorities in order to begin trading with  that European country. Vacaroiu has begun a four-day official  visit to the country that will end at 1240 on 21 May.    "This is the first time a Romanian prime minister has  visited  us. Borders are opening, the world is getting smaller, the  economy is becoming global, and it is important for these people  to get acquainted with our country," President Wasmosy said at  Silvio Pettirossi International Airport. Vacaroiu arrived at  1450 yesterday.    Wasmosy said the government had prepared a draft of  agreements to be analyzed by the two presidents' ministers and  advisers. Among the documents that are scheduled to be signed at  1030 on 21 May are agreements on cultural exchange, the  elimination of visas for diplomatic and official personnel,  documents on cooperation between the two countries' foreign  ministries, and a trade agreement.    Wasmosy said the purpose of the trade agreement is to start  trade relations with Romania, because we want Romanians to know  what the country can produce. The president added that it is  also important to know what products Romania can sell to our  country.</p>

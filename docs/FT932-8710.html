			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory Euro-sceptics plan tactics after Danish poll TORY EURO-SCEPTICS were last night putting on a brave face ahead of today's Danish referendum on Maastricht while acknowledging that the poll will probably result in a Yes vote. If the Danes do vote Yes, the Maastricht bill will return to the Commons for its third reading on Thursday before moving on to the Lords. The government is assured of a large majority in Thursday's vote largely because Labour has decided to abstain. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to give an initial response to the referendum in a speech tonight at a Confederation of British Industry dinner. It is widely expected that a No vote would result in Thursday's business being changed. Some Euro-sceptics were yesterday keeping their spirits up by looking forward to obstacles that the government still has to cross. These include the bill's passage through the Lords and the possible judicial review of the assertion by ministers that failing to incorporate the protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out into UK law had no effect on their ability to ratify the treaty. Mrs Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay, forecast difficulties in store for the government if a motion on a Maastricht referendum was selected for debate at the Conservative party conference this autumn. 'If conference votes yes for a referendum, the government would have a hell of a problem,' she said. The Maastricht issue was 'by no means dead', Mrs Gorman added. 'We are not talking about the vicarage tea party, after all, but the way this country is governed.' Others drew encouragement from the way the hard core of 26 Euro-sceptics has held together for almost a year since the bill's second reading. Still others were buoyed by a sense of having performed a valuable public service with their opposition over Maastricht. 'There is a feeling among the group that we can say 'we told you not to believe Neville Chamberlain,'' said one MP, en route to a prayer meeting outside the Danish embassy. Another prominent Euro-sceptic referred to the remarks made this weekend by Sir Edward Heath and said he regarded it as the 'pinnacle' of his political career to be told that he would be hated by the former prime minister. In Thursday's vote, Euro-sceptic leaders will be aiming to beat their 'high-water mark' of 38 Tory rebels who defied the government last month by supporting a Maastricht referendum. They say that some waverers may well be tempted into their ranks by the virtual certainty of a government victory. They plan to meet tomorrow to discuss the way forward. They are expected to tell government whips not to count on their support on Europe-related issues even after Maastricht has completed its Commons passage. The government, meanwhile, is expected to take pains to minimise the rebellion on Thursday. One MP who supported a referendum but is not among the Euro-sceptic hard-core said yesterday that he would vote with the government on the third reading.</p>

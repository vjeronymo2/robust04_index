			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Recent drug launches help SB advance 9% - Strong performance from clinical laboratories SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare company, reported pre-tax profits for its third quarter to September 30 up 9 per cent from Pounds 267m to Pounds 291m. The results were helped by currencies, a strong performance from the clinical laboratories operations and recently-launched pharmaceuticals. Group sales were up 16 per cent, from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds 1.48bn, including Pounds 11m (Pounds 61m) from discontinued activities. Operating profits improved from Pounds 270m to Pounds 280m, including Pounds 3m (Pounds 16m) from discontinued activities. Profits on continuing activities rose 9 per cent. At comparable exchange rates, sales and trading profit increased 6 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. Turnover at clinical laboratories increased 39 per cent from Pounds 144m to Pounds 200m, while operating profits rose from Pounds 17m to Pounds 20m. At constant exchange rates, they rose 15 per cent and 18 per cent. Pharmaceuticals division trading profit rose 11 per cent from Pounds 171m to Pounds 189m on sales of Pounds 821m (Pounds 709m). Excluding currencies, operating profits improved 8 per cent on sales up 2 per cent. US turnover improved 1 per cent while European sales were up 3 per cent. German sales grew 1 per cent thanks to a strong performance from antibiotics in the former East Germany and in spite of healthcare reforms. Italian sales fell 21 per cent, although the overall market dropped only 7 per cent. Mr Robert Bauman, chief executive, declined to detail his strategy for defending Tagamet, the ulcer treatment on which US patents expire next May. American sales represent about two thirds of Tagamet revenues, which were Pounds 614m last year. During the third quarter this year they were up 2 per cent, although this was due mostly to a US price increase in September. The group was still discussing with the US Food and Drug Administration its possible status as a non-prescription product to be sold over the counter at chemists, said Mr Bauman. He added it remained unclear whether further data or clinical trials would be necessary. Mr Bauman explained the group would differentiate OTC Tagamet from its Tums brand, which now has 46.8 per cent of the US antacid market. 'Tagamet will be the first antacid with proven clinical efficacy. Tums will be targeted at the mild end of the market. There may be some cannibalisation, but we will do our best to minimise it,' he said. The animal health division benefited from restructuring and sales improved 19 per cent from Pounds 85m to Pounds 101m. Excluding currencies, turnover was up 4 per cent and trading profit 6 per cent at Pounds 17m (Pounds 14m). Sales of continuing operations at the consumer brands division rose from Pounds 277m to Pounds 342m, while trading profits fell from Pounds 52m to Pounds 51m. Excluding currencies, sales were up 11 per cent. Operating profits dropped 2 per cent because of increased advertising and promotional support and restructuring costs. Earnings per share rose to 7.5p and 11.3 cents per equity unit. A third quarter dividend was declared of 2.533p per share, 4.718 cents per equity unit and 23.59 cents per equity unit ADR. See Lex</p>

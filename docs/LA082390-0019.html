			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT JOINS RECYCLING PROGRAM  </P> <P> In a continuing effort to ease the flow of garbage into landfills, the Simi  Valley City Council has voted to include the Simi Valley School District in its  office-paper recycling program.  </P> <P> Rita Williams, the school district's recycling coordinator, said she first  talked with city officials about participating in the program about a month  ago.  </P> <P> The council approved the district's participation on Monday. Williams said it  would be easier for the district to join the city's program than to start its  own.  </P> <P> "There's no point in us reinventing the wheel," Williams said.  </P> <P> She said that the program will be limited to district offices and that  collection services are expected to begin in a few weeks. The district may  decide later to expand the office-paper recycling program to its schools, she  said.  </P> <P> Diane Davis-Crompton, director of the city's Department of Environmental  Services, said the city will ship 200 cardboard collection boxes with  instructions about the program to the school district.  </P> <P> Davis-Crompton said the district's participation will not cost the city extra  money and will benefit everyone.  </P> <P> In May, the Simi Valley City Council approved the pilot program for  office-paper recycling at City Hall. City officials said the program cost  $1,200 to start and about $2,300 to operate annually.  </P> <P> But savings in trash collection charges and the sale of recyclable paper are  expected to generate $2,850 a year for the city, which will more than  compensate for the operating costs.  </P> <P> Recyclable paper constitutes about 90% of the trash generated by City Hall  offices, according to a city staff report. Fax paper, computer paper and  envelopes make up a large portion of the materials.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Government Center and Ventura and Thousand Oaks have similar  recycling programs.  </P> <P> A recent state law requires that cities devise plans by the end of the year to  reduce the flow of trash into landfills by 25% by 1995 and by 50% by the turn  of the century.  </P> <P> As part of its effort to meet that goal, the Simi Valley City Council voted to  expand its curbside recycling program in July from 13,000 households to include  all 26,000 single-family residences.

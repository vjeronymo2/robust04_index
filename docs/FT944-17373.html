			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bluebird founder pockets Pounds 2.5m Polly Pocket and Mighty Max are pocket sized and mighty small - but they mean Big Money. Yesterday, Mr Torquil Norman, founder and chairman of Bluebird Toys, cashed in on their success with the world's children and halved his stake in the group. He sold 1.08m ordinary shares at 207p each, while his wife sold 120,000 shares, netting the couple almost Pounds 2.5m. The Bluebird shares, which closed yesterday unchanged at 213p, were placed with institutions through SG Warburg. Mr Norman, whose lifelong hobby is flying classic aircraft, retains 1.03m shares, or 2.3 per cent of the shares in issue. He last sold shares in June, placing 275,000 through Smith New Court Securities, the group's broker at the time. He is not proposing any further sales for a year. Earlier this year Mr Norman, who founded Bluebird Toys in 1980, stood down as the company's chief executive. He said he would retain the chairmanship and concentrate on new product development. Mr Christopher Burgin, who spent 18 years with Hasbro, the US toys and games group, was appointed chief executive with a brief to concentrate on marketing the group's toys. Last week Mr Burgin purchased 15,000 shares at 237p, taking his holding to 25,000 shares. The biggest shareholder in Bluebird remains Fransad Investissements &amp; Gestion, ultimately owned by UBS. Fransad's shareholding has been reduced from 29.6 per cent two years ago to 18.8 per cent. Last month the group announced interim pre-tax profits more than trebled from Pounds 1.99m to Pounds 7.19m and declared its first interim dividend. Turnover increased from Pounds 23.7m to Pounds 40.7m, with overseas sales 84 per cent up at Pounds 28.7m and UK sales ahead 49 per cent at Pounds 12m. City analysts are expecting full-year profits for Bluebird of about Pounds 19m, and earnings per share of 26p.</p>

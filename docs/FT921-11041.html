			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Labour accuses Tories of 'smears' against Kinnock THE UK pre-election campaign yesterday slid into acrimony as Labour protested that Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, had been outrageously 'smeared' by newspaper stories about a meeting with the Soviet ambassador in 1984. The Tories reacted almost as strongly to the charge from Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, that Mr John Major had authorised 'the dirtiest Tory election campaign of the century'. The row follows publication in The Sunday Times of reports in the KGB's archives of contacts in the early 1980s between Soviet diplomats and Labour politicians. Mr David Mellor, the Treasury chief secretary, fuelled opposition allegations of a conspiracy between the Tories and some of the press when - according to the story - he condemned the 'craven and cringing' approach shown by Labour to the Soviet Union. Senior figures from the two parties clashed angrily on BBC radio. Mr Roy accused Mr Mellor of bringing Mr Kinnock's patriotism into question as part of a Tory technique. It enabled Mr Major 'to keep his hands clean' while 'the intentional damage over patriotism is done by the rougher, tougher members of the cabinet'. Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, said the material revealed no more about Mr Kinnock's views than what he had been saying publicly at the time and raised no questions about his patriotism. His judgment, however, was in question. The documents were a reminder that the Labour leader had been wrong in his reaction to the deployment of SS-20 missiles and the abuse of trade union power, Mr Patten said. The bitter exchanges undermined the expressed desire of all the main parties to fight the election on the political issues. Although Labour and the Tories plan a full week's campaigning, the weekend's furore is likely to affect the atmosphere at Westminster, where the prime minister will today make a statement to MPs about his meeting with Mr Yeltsin and the United Nations summit. Labour will today launch a fresh offensive on education, at the start of a week in which it will seek to move the political debate into the areas of education and health which are traditionally stronger ground for it. But the party is still keeping up the pressure on the Tories over value added tax, and yesterday seized on remarks made by Mr Mellor as being a hint that the tax's scope might be widened. In an interview on TV-am, Mr Mellor emphasised that the commitment made last week by Mr Major that there would be no increase in VAT was for the lifetime of a parliament. On the possibility of broadening the scope of tax, he said that the government had 'no plans' to extend it. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary, called on Mr Major to give a categorical pledge that its scope would not be widened.

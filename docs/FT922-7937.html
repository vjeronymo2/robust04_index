			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVE markets were very active yesterday as the Footsie future was traded down to fair value for the first time since the general election, writes Peter John. The FT-SE contract for June delivery was around 20 points above the underlying market for most of the morning. However, a large programme trade on the sell side in the cash market and poor figures from conglomerate Hanson led to a swift turnround at midday. June was then sold down steadily and hit 2,702 shortly before the official close. That is around the contract's current estimated fair value - the premium that takes into account dividends and carrying costs - of 8 points. The drop of more than 40 points on the day meant that opportunistic buyers were bound to be tempted back. Sure enough, June was squeezed up to close at 2,710 with turnover high at 10,183 contracts. In the traded options market, Hanson dominated the stock options with 6,111 lots dealt, as dealers responded to disappointing first-half figures. The May series was being traded in lieu of underlying stock and the August series saw around 2,500 lots dealt. British Aerospace was also popular, with 2,507 contracts traded. On the day, the market saw 36,576 contracts dealt, compared with Wednesday's 31,759.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nusa Dua (Bali), Jun 13 (OANA-ANTARA) -- State  Minister for the Mobilization of Investment Funds who is also  chairman of the Coordinating Board for Investment (BKPM) Sanyoto  Sastrowardoyo noted here on Monday the six ASEAN member  countries will not compete each other in inviting foreign  investors.    "On the contrary, they will even cooperate either in  inviting  foreign investors or investment among the ASEAN member  countries," he told the press after inaugurating the ASEAN  working group on the promotion of foreign direct investment here  on Monday.    He expressed the hope that the meeting would yield a  mechanism for foreign investment among the ASEAN member  countries aside from the foreign investors.    "We need a certain promotion campaign among the ASEAN member  countries in a bid to invite foreign investment since the  competition is getting tougher," he said.    He reminded the ASEAN countries on the need for them to  anticipate the development of the world economy which tends to  the regional groups such as North America Free Trade Area  (NAFTA), the Unification of the Europe, the Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) and ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).    "We should also anticipate the implementation of the General  Agreement of Tariff and Trade (GATT) agreed last April," he said.    Queried about the ASEAN's view on the government regulation  No. 20/1994 which provide greater access for foreign capital in  company ownership, geographical spread and sectoral business  lines, he said that ASEAN welcomed the economic deregulation  package.    "The package can not be avoided, meaning that Indonesia  should issue such a package, otherwise it will be left behind,"  he said.    Indonesia should increase its competitiveness in the current  globalisation era if it wants to be survived, he said.    "The government regulation is one of our ways in  consolidating with others to attract more foreign investors," he  added.    Speaking on the future composition of foreign investment, he  said that Japan stood at the first position followed by Taiwan  replacing Hong Kong which has been in the second position since  1967 to May 1994.    He attributed to the impressive performance of Taiwan to the  country's aggressive efforts to improve investment in Indonesia  by among others sending business leaders who accompanied their  president during his visit here recently.    He also said that Taiwan's improved investment climate was  also as a result of "go south action programme" which promoted  investment to its neighboring countries in the south such as  Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.    Deputy Chairman for Foreign Investment Affairs at the BKPM  Sugihono Kadarisman said that a number of developed countries  still exerted non-economic pressures such as human rights issues  and the most favoured nations (MFN).    Kadarisman said that the country will discuss a strategy to  counter such pressures confronting Indonesia's serious efforts  to promote foreign investment.    Some 50 participants from ASEAN member countries are  attending the two-day meeting.</p>

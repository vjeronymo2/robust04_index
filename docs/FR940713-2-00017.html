Sam Houston Pkwy E., Suite 2020, Houston, Texas 77060, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94&hyph;636&hyph;000 requesting that the Commission declare that, following Newfield's purchase of certain offshore facilities from Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), that those facilities are gathering facilities exempt from the Commission's Regulations pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Newfield states that the facilities consist of one currently-certificated supply line owned by Texas Eastern along with an associated metering facility. It is indicated that the supply line consists of a 4.8 mile, 8-inch lateral that connects Newfield's oil and gas production platform in the Eugene Island Block 182&hyph;A area to the facilities of Sea Robin Pipeline Company (Sea Robin) in Eugene Island Block 197 in offshore Louisiana. It is indicated that on June 16, 1993, Texas Eastern ceased purchasing the Newfield production gathered by the facilities to be purchased, but did continue transporting Newfield's production through the facilities for redelivery to the transmission facilities of Sea Robin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Newfield asserts that the primary function of the facilities to be acquired is gathering as set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Farmland Industries, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  23 FERC &para; 61,023 (1983), as later modified by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amerada Hess Corp., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 52 FERC &para; 61,268 (1990), ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amerada Hess <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). It is indicated that under that test the Commission applies six criteria to determine the jurisdictional status of a facility: (1) the diameter and length of a facility; (2) the extension of facilities beyond a central point in the field; (3) the geographic configuration of the system; (4) the location of compressors and processing plants; (5) the location of wells along all or part of the facility; and (6) the operating pressure of the line. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amerada Hess, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Commission indicated that it would consider other factors, in addition to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Farmland <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  criteria, especially for offshore facilities, including the changing technical and geographic nature of exploration and production, the purpose, location and operation of the facility, the general business activity of the facility, and whether the jurisdictional determination is consistent with the objectives of the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Newfield asserts that there can be doubt that the primary function of the facilities is gathering. It is stated that the facilities connect directly to producing wells and were constructed to gather gas produced from those wells for delivery into transmission facilities currently owned by Sea Robin. Newfield also states that the facilities are short in length and small in diameter, do not extend beyond the production area, and are located upstream of processing or dehydration facilities and therefore are gathering facilities. Newfield also points out that an application of the non-physical factors set out in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amerada Hess <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  demonstrates that the facilities should be classified as gathering facilities. It is stated that the sole purpose of the facilities is to gather gas produced by Newfield as the sole working interest owner in the wells for delivery to transmission facilities owned by Sea Robin. Newfield also states that its general business activity is the exploration and production of natural gas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Newfield requests that the petition be considered contemporaneously with Texas Eastern's application in Docket No. CP94&hyph;567&hyph;000 to abandon the facilities to be sold to Newfield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  July 27, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

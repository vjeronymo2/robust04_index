			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News and Press Review" program] </F>   [Text] Speaking yesterday [24 April] at the 1994 work  conference of the state economic information network, Chen  Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission,  noted: The state economic information network should seize the  opportunity to deepen reform, play its role, harness its  potential, and better serve the twin information needs of the  government and society.    Chen Jinhua said: The state economic information network was  established in 1984 with the State Council's approval. In the  eight years or so since its inception, the network has expanded  to cover the entire country. More than 30 provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities directly under the central  government; all cities with provincial-level economic  decisionmaking power; 280 key cities and regions; and 1,500  counties have become information hubs sufficiently outfitted  with technology and equipment, and staffed by professional teams.    The network has played an important role in serving the  party  and government in macroeconomic policy-making, macroeconomic  regulation and control, and macroeconomic management, as well as  in providing information to enterprises and people in society.    At the conference, Gao Xingmin, director of the State  Information Center, reviewed last year's achievements, discussed  new problems, and laid down several key tasks for this year.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE BOTTOM LINE  </P> <P> Arnold Ale, listed as a possible starter on the defensive line for defending  national football champion Notre Dame, has dropped out of the university, a  spokesman said today. "He left for personal reasons," said Jim Daves of the  university's athletic department. "I think we was a little homesick and wants  to get back to the West Coast." A 6-foot-4, 211-pound sophomore from Carson,  Calif., Ale had reported for fall practice and was competing for a spot at  defensive end.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin  today called for attention to socialist ethics, discipline, the  need to take national interests into account and the necessity  to take the road of common prosperity.    "The further reform is carried out, the more extensively the  pattern of interest sharing is adjusted, and the greater the  market role is, the more vigorously we should advocate socialist  ethics, discipline, attention to national interests as a whole,  and common prosperity," he said.    Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese  Communist  Party Central Committee, attended a group discussion on Premier  Li Peng's government work report by Shanghai deputies to the  National People's Congress (NPC), of which he is one.    Joining the discussion, Jiang said that under the current  good situation at home and abroad, it is imperative to seize  opportunities for economic development.    "Meanwhile," he said, "we must keep sober-minded and be  fully  aware of challenges faced by China in the international  community, as well as problems that have arisen at home amid  continuous progress."    Jiang Zemin stressed the need to work even harder and more  diligently.    He asked governments at all levels to devote their major  attention to seizing development opportunities, deepening  reforms, opening China wider to the outside world, promoting  economic development and maintaining social stability.    The central authorities have decided on the focus of work  for  this year in order to achieve "a sustained, rapid and sound"  development of the national economy, he said.    The key to successfully fulfilling the task, he said, is to  correctly handle relations between reform, development and  stability.    "We must pay close attention to maintaining a stable social  and political environment, promote reform and development amid  stability, and ensure long-term social stability through reform  and development," he said.    The president described reform, development and stability as  three closely interrelated "strategic pieces" on a chess board,  saying that it is a leadership art to correctly handle relations  among the three.    On agriculture, he stressed the importance of adhering to  the  following principles:    -- To strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the  national economy;    -- To steadily increase the output of major farm products  such as grain, cotton and cooking oil;    -- To alleviate farmers' financial burdens while increasing  their incomes;    -- To vigorously develop rural enterprises;    -- To stabilize the household-based system of farming; and    -- To improve the work efficiency of village-level  organizations led by village party branches.    Jiang praised large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises  for their vital contributions to China's economic growth.    "These enterprises serve as the backbone of China's economy  and will continue to play a leading role in expanding a  socialist market economy," he said.    "Therefore, no matter what difficulties we may face, we  should make every effort to improve the performance of  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises," Jiang said.    Speaking of difficulties being faced by many state-owned  enterprises, Jiang said it is a major task of the party, the  government and the society as a whole to help them overcome  their difficulties and help invigorate them.    The fundamental solution is to deepen reform and  unswervingly  separate the functions of the government from those of the  enterprise, accelerate a change of their operational mechanism  and build a modern enterprise system, he said.    It is imperative to push such enterprises onto the  marketplace where they should seek new ways to overcome  difficulties.    State enterprises, in different types and with different  conditions, can have diversified operational approaches and  varied ways to invigorate themselves, Jiang said.    However, he said, it is a must to preserve and increase the  value of state assets.    He expressed the hope that Shanghai will accumulate more  valuable experience in state enterprise reform.    Jiang also emphasized the importance of socialist cultural  and ideological progress.    Both material civilization and cultural and ideological  progress are important aspects of China's modernization program,  he said.    It will be a dangerous deviation for a country, a nation and  individuals to emphasize only the material side to the neglect  of the spiritual side, he said.    Jiang expressed his appreciation of remarkable achievements  made by the people of Shanghai.    He reiterated that development of Pudong is a major policy  decision of the central authorities, that development and  opening of pudong is a firm strategy and that the central  authorities' policy towards Pudong will remain unchanged.    Jiang also expressed the hope that Pudong will become a real  "dragon head" for the Chang Jiang River valley.    Shanghai's development can never be separated from the  support of other parts of the country and the latter's  development also needs Shanghai's support.    Shanghai's working class and people should make continuous  and fresh contributions to the development of other parts of the  country, especially central and western regions, he said.    Rong Yiren, Chinese vice president and an NPC deputy in the  Shanghai delegation, also spoke at the group discussion.</p>

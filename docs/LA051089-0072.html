			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH CUTBACKS OF $55.7 MILLION PROPOSED IF STATE AID FALLS SHORT  </P> <P> Dozens of pediatric facilities, outpatient health centers and family planning  clinics would be closed as a result of $55.7 million in cuts proposed Tuesday  by Los Angeles County health officials to offset anticipated losses in state  revenue.  </P> <P> The cuts would be made only if state funds cannot be found to bail out the  health care programs, officials said.  </P> <P> In recommendations to the Board of Supervisors, the Department of Health  Services proposed $25 million in reductions at County-USC Medical Center, $6.6  million at Olive View Medical Center and reductions totaling $10.1 million at  Harbor/UCLA Medical Center and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center.  </P> <P> In addition, health officials recommended slashing $4.9 million from family  planning, $3.6 million from comprehensive health centers, $4.1 million from  other health clinics and $1.4 million from other services.  </P> <P> In his report to the board, Health Director Robert Gates traced the budget  problems to a proposal by Gov. George Deukmejian cutting the county's current  allocation for medically indigent patients from $204.2 million to $56.2  million. Although some of that revenue will be made up from other state  sources, Gates said that total is expected to fall far short of what the county  needs.  </P> <P> "In considering the necessity for service reductions totaling $55.7 million, it  must be recognized that (the department) will still be left with a remaining  operating budget sufficient to meet only minimally acceptable levels of health  care practice," he told the supervisors.  </P> <P> Specifically, Gates recommended:  </P> <P> * Closure of pediatric facilities and a reduction of general health services at  the County-USC Medical Center and Women's Hospital. As a result, all  non-communicable disease and emergency room services at the Pediatric Pavilion  would be eliminated and other services cut after Sept. 1.  </P> <P> * Reduction of outpatient clinic services at Harbor/UCLA Medical Center. These  program cuts would affect 2,774 patients a month and would begin July 1, health  officials said.  </P> <P> * Elimination of acute outpatient care at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in  Downey. Nearly 1,800 people a month now use the services, and the change would  mean patients would be forced to rely on other county facilities and other  health providers after Sept. 1, officials said.  </P> <P> * Drastic cuts in services at public health centers throughout the county.  Current patients, many of whom are low-income minorities, now rely on such  centers for immunizations, prenatal care, pediatric services and AIDS testing.  Under the planned cuts, more than 24,600 people would be affected.  </P> <P> "To the extent we can, we've tried to focus on elective kinds of health  services, although we provide very little truly elective services," Gates told  The Times.  </P> <P> "We desperately need an infusion of money, hard money," he said.  </P> <P> The supervisors set a June 12 public hearing date to comply with the Bielenson  Act. That state law requires supervisors to hold a public hearing to assess the  impact of the proposed health care cuts on the county's poor. Gates said that  $36.2 million of the planned $55.7 million in proposed cuts would fall under  the Bielenson statute.  </P> <P> "I don't think health services should be cut, and hopefully, we won't have to  cut," said board Chairman Ed Edelman. "But if we can't get the state to help  us, this gives us one of the options."  </P></p>

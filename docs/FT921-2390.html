			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Budget targets black issues THE government yesterday presented a budget for 'equity through growth and stability', with a commitment to higher spending to improve economic conditions for blacks. Total expenditure for 1992-93 will rise by 16.5 per cent to R100.7bn (Pounds 20.1bn), a 2 per cent growth in real terms. Revenue is budgeted to increase by 15.8 per cent from the revised estimate for 1991-2 to R84.8bn. Mr Barend du Plessis, the minister of finance, described the budget as 'exceptionally difficult', in the light of the demands which had to be financed from stagnant revenues. " Considerable progress is made towards equalising pension payments, with the gap between different racial groups narrowing by 40 per cent. After the changes monthly pensions will be: Whites - R345; Coloureds and Indians- R318; Blacks - R293. The remaining discrepancies will be removed next year. There were also large increases in expenditure on education, housing and health. Defence spending is cut by 9 per cent in real terms, but most of the monies released are taken up by a 22 per cent increase in the police vote. The burden of financing the increased expenditure falls on the individual taxpayer, who will pay 26 per cent more in tax than in 1991-92, largely as a result of fiscal drag, whereby wage increases for inflation have pulled more earners into higher tax bands. There is some relief for middle and lower income taxpayers, who are taken into lower tax bands by a simplified income tax banding structure. Individuals will pay 40.3 per cent of tax in 1992-93, compared to 33.1 per cent as recently as 1990-91 and 26.8 per cent in 1977-78. Customs and excise levies are to be increased, and the petrol price will rise by 8 cents a litre. A negative trend is the large size of the deficit which is estimated at R15.9bn for 1992-93, or 4.5 per cent of GDP  - the same size as the eventual deficit in 1991-92; R1.6bn of the deficit would be financed from sales of strategic stockpiles, mainly oil. Finance department officials said the size of the deficit was a 'temporary" but acceptable diversion from the IMF norm of a 3 per cent deficit. Economists, however, have expressed concern at the implications of such a large deficit for the size of the government debt. Debt servicing will account for about 16 per cent of spending in the budget.  ----------------------------------------                   %      %      Number                  Yes    No     of votes  ---------------------------------------- Roodepoort       52.4   47.6   237,882 Johannesburg     78.3   21.7   414,643 Kimberley        54.5   45.5    61,286 Bloemfontein     58.6   41.4    99,083 Beaufort West    61.6   38.4    30,739 Cape Town        84.9   15.1   418,852 George           65.4   34.6    61,497 Port Elizabeth   74.5   25.5   117,125 East London      78.3   21.7    85,173 Pietersburg      43.0   57.0    87,432 Pretoria         57.4   42.6   501,545 Germiston        65.4   34.6   250,869 Kroonstad        51.5   48.5   105,810 Durban           85.0   15.0   240,346 Pietermaritzburg 76.0   24.0    87,523  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DIGITAL FIRM SHAPES STAFF CUTBACK  </P> <P> Digital Equipment Corp., with a partial hiring freeze already in effect, today  said it has an internal contingency paper that asks overhead departments to  propose cuts and transfers.  </P> <P> Although a company spokesman declined to estimate how many employees might be  affected, the document reportedly calls for reductions of as much as 25% in a  wide range of "overhead" departments that could translate into a reduction of  as many as 7,500 employees over two years.  </P> <P> The reductions and related transfers that might result would be aimed at the  company's estimated 30,000-member support staff and thus likely would most  severely affect the areas around its headquarters. But a spokeswoman said  "these are global decisions" and suggested the plan would affect employees  worldwide.  </P></p>

The source  added: This is a principled stand adopted by the Jordanians and  Iranians.    In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, the source, who preferred  anonymity, added that this issue is a technical issue and comes  within the framework of organization and acknowledged diplomatic  actions.    The source said that the number and names of the diplomats  affected by the reduction measure, as well as the date of their  departure, have been communicated to the Jordanian Foreign  Ministry. However, he said he preferred not to divulge details  of this matter to the press.    The Iranian source said that the Jordanian Government's  request to reduce the number of Iranian diplomats is neither new  nor unusual, but has been under discussion for some time. He  said that relations between the two countries will develop under  the leaderships of His Majesty King Husayn and Iranian President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    The source emphasized his country's eagerness to have  delegations from both countries exchange visits since this will  enhance bilateral relations, which is part of the Jordanian and  Iranian officials' approach.</p>

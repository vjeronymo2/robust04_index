			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> AST RELEASES MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE COMPUTERS  </P> <P> AST Research Inc., the Irvine-based maker of personal computers, is revealing  more details about its plans for future computer products.  </P> <P> AST plans to introduce its first notebook computer at the Comdex computer show  in Las Vegas this November.  </P> <P> Safi Qureshey, AST president and chief executive, said the high-end computer  will fit in a briefcase and have features such as extended battery-power life  and the latest in display technology.  </P> <P> The company will also introduce a multi-processing personal computer for the  high end of the PC market later this year, Qureshey said. AST hopes that the  computer, which will simultaneously use two super-fast Intel Corp. i486  microprocessors, will compete for business with larger, more expensive  minicomputers.  </P> <P> Not to be outdone, Advanced Logic Research in Irvine is also planning to launch  a multi-processor machine at the Comdex show in November, said Dave Kirkey,  Advanced's vice president of sales and marketing.  </P> <P> AST also said it may sell computers in Japan under its own name if a recent  deal with Sharp Corp. to distribute AST computers in that country does not  materialize. Under the Sharp proposal, the Japanese electronics firm would  market AST computers compatible with NEC Corp. machines under the Sharp name.  AST said it has been approached by several Japanese distributors who expressed  interest in selling the products in Japan.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Summary] Dear friends: The fifth session of the National  Assembly entered its 14th day today.    "In the morning, the National Assembly held group  discussions  on the ratification of the United Nations's 1992 Convention on  the Law of the Sea. All the deputies favored the ratification  of the convention by our country." They regarded this  convention as an international legal basis for our people's  struggle to safeguard their national sovereignty and territorial  integrity.    Many deputies called for increased propaganda on the  convention and for efforts to instill in the people a sense of  awareness about the need to safegard the country's territorial  sea.    "In the afternoon the deputies held group discussions on the  draft law on the admendment of and supplement to a number of  articles of the law on corporations and private businesses.    "All those who spoke unanimously agreed to amend various  articles of these two laws in such a way as to suit the actual  situation at present." They added: Major revisions of these  two laws will be considered when conditions permit.    As for the amendment of Article 16 of the Law on  Cooperations  and Article 10 of the Law on Private Busines, many deputies  favored the idea of allowing people whose applications for the  establishment of corporations have been turned down to appeal to  the prime minister, if they see find the refusal unacceptable.    "Given that the State Economic Arbitrator will cease its  activities beginning 1 July 1994, the drafting committee for  these draft laws has suggested that the powers to license  various coporations be transferred from the economic arbitrator  of provinces and cities under central authority, or from  corresponding administrative units, to the planning committees  of provinces and cities under central authority. It has also  been suggested that the powers to license private firms be  transferred from the economic arbitrator who is equal in status  to the people's committee granting licenses, to the planning  organs which are equivalent in status to the people's committee  granting licenses."    Some deputies also asked what they should do if somes  districts and town have no planning organs?    "All the deputies unanimously agreed with the draft law's  suggestion that the declaration of bankruptcy by a corporation  or a private firm must be carried out in accordance with the law  on the bankruptcy of enterprises.    "Tomorrow, the National Assembly will hold group discussions  on the situation regarding the implementation of the National  Assembly resolution on socioeconomic tasks for the first six  months of 1994."</p>

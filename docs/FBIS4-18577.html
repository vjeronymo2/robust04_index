			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The embargo Greece imposed on The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), a citizen's protest  against it, as well as Athens' refusal to participate in a  peacekeeping force that would include Turkish UN troops elicited  commentaries from the Greek press.  <H5>  Embargo Protest Discussed </H5>   An article in the 25 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI by  Athens University alternate professor of political  communications Khristos Lirintzis discusses the public  denunciation of the embargo on the FYROM by 21 Greek  intellectuals, who asked that Greek foreign policy on this issue  be reviewed. While one can disagree with the writers' message  and its publication, writes Lirintzis, the initiative of three  Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) deputies, who called the  denunciation "treason" and demanded that the professors involved  be barred from teaching, is "an unprecedented attempt to  prohibit freedom of expression and foster alignment with  official policy." Fortunately, the deputies' request had no  resonance in the Chamber, and about 300 individuals have  defended the "group of 21" and the Greeks' right to free opinion  and dialogue. While most of the press did not publish the full  text of the professors' denunciation and some newspapers'  comments were "relatively low-key," others termed the "group of  21" and its supporters "a fifth column, Skopje agents, or  antistate elements," an example of Greek "unfortunate" populist  practice, according to which disagreement on important national  issues turns the protester into an "enemy, a traitor, and an  organ of foreign interests." By rejecting a dialogue, this  practice abolishes discussion, depicting disagreement as a  "black and white conflict in which the choice is between the  good guys and the bad guys." Lirintzis concludes that things are  usually more complex, and a society that tends to simplify  political issues significantly restricts knowledge of self and  the control of power.    Mikhalis Moronis, writing in the 21 March Athens daily  ELEVTHEROTIPIA, contends that by following a purely  nationalistic policy in the area, Greece, with its more robust  economy, strong democratic institutions, and membership in the  European Union (EU) and NATO, is forfeiting the opportunity to  play an important role in the post-Cold War Balkans. However,  the "golden opportunities of 1990 are turning into disastrous  prospects in 1994." By-passing Greece, our allies and partners  have created strong diplomatic conduits for regional  intervention with our neighbors and the countries that emerged  from the former Yugoslavia, he writes. Even the development of  ties between the United States and Serbia is a possibility, as  Belgrade openly wishes and Washington cannot afford to ignore,  given that Serbia, the strongest state in the former Yugoslavia,  holds a key position in the Balkans, Moronis continues. Finally,  Greece's European card is losing its significance, since the  development of ties between Greece's neighbors and the EU is  occurring in our absence. Meanwhile, Athens continues to create  the impression that we are still living at the beginning of the  century with the Balkan wars, we are the area's "troublemakers"  and our "nationalistic explosions are just a cover for the sense  of insecurity that pervades us. Such `phobias' derive from the  Greek practice of foisting responsibilities on others and  refusing to assume our own by paying the price for our national  and individual survival," Moronis comments.    A brief article in the 29 March daily TA NEA contends that  by  asking that Athens give in to Skopje's demands about the name,  symbols, and irredentist propaganda issues promoted by Skopje  President Kiro Gligorov, Greece's EU "partners" prove they are  "openly inimical" to us and fail to understand the problems they  are creating. Additional proof lies in the fact that they are  threatening to remand Greece to the European Court of Justice  over the imposition of the embargo even while negotiations are  continuing. With Germany in front, Greece's "partners are  pushing for more confrontation as if their role in the collapse  of Yugoslavia were not enough," the article contends.  <H5>  UN Peacekeeping Force </H5>   According to Potis Paraskevopoulos writing in the 27 March  Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA, the UN Security Council  decision to dispatch Turkish troops to Bosnia is "thoughtless"  and will undermine peace in the wider Balkan area. It is also a  studied move by certain interests to modify the region's  geopolitical map and impose a new order, Paraskevopoulos  contends. Turkish troops are unrelated to peacekeeping  activities, since peace in Bosnia was imposed solely through  NATO ultimatums and air power. This "positive development"  should have been followed by an attempt to dissolve the Bosnian  Serbs and Serbia's mistrust of international peacekeeping  initiatives. Instead, the dispatch of Turkish troops to Bosnia  compounds the Serbs' lack of confidence and constitutes a  "provocation" against Serbia, Greece, and other Balkan  countries, as well as against the UN, whose Security Council  repeatedly condemned the Turkish invasion of Cyprus,  Paraskevopoulos comments. Turkish troops will not be in the  region to monitor peace between Bosnian Muslims and Croats,  since the two sides have agreed on a federal state, or to  enhance the Bosnian Muslims' sense of security, ensured through  other UN blue helmets. Moreover, as Slavs, Serbian Muslims do  not feel especially close to Turkey. Those who do are Albanians,  and Kosovo and Skopje Albanians, Paraskevopoulos affirms. While  Turkish UN troops are sent to the North, they will be used in  the South, where their presence will encourage the separatist  tendencies of Kosovo Albanians and the Albanians' expansionary  views. Herein lies the threat against peace in the Balkans,  Paraskevopoulos contends. The "troublemaking and provocative"  role of a Turkish military presence in the former Yugoslavia  masks a punitive plan for the territorial diminution of  [President Slobodan] Milosevic's Serbia by using Kosovo as a  target: Turkish UN troops are the "lance in the attack and the  Skopje U.S. blue helmets are its shield." While this scenario  may be considered a "figment of the imagination," the goal of  the UN decision is unquestionably "crafty" and portends threats  of war. The choice the Greek Government faces is clear,  Paraskevopoulos comments. Athens must not send troops to the  area and should not get involved in "war games," even if the  principal actors are UN troops. Greece should play the role of  "firefighter and arbiter" in support of a peace that obviates  the expansion of military activities to southern Yugoslavia.  Athens should not be swayed by the threat that Turkish troops in  Bosnia upgrade Ankara's regional role, for the "damage is small  compared to ensuring peace at all costs," Paraskevopouios  concludes.    A different view is expounded by Kostas Iordhanidhis in a 27  March I KATHIMERINI article. While it is clear that through a  military presence Turkey will share in a settlement in the  Balkans, from where it was expelled after the 1912-1913 wars, it  is "naive" to expect that Greece can play a role in the area by  watching local developments from the outside simply as a member  of the EU, writes Iordhanidhis. It is "self-delusion" on the  part of some Greek politicians to think that participation in  the EU geographically moved the country to Central Europe and  modified the nature of its problems. These are still related to  major political instability on its northern borders and the fate  of Hellenism in the Balkans, he continues. If Greece is to be  the vector of the EU's Balkans policy, it will only do so  through active intervention, as Ankara has consistently done.  Iordhanidhis concludes that while a rejection of the Turkish  offer of troops would have been preferable--as would have been a  UN refusal to dismember Yugoslavia in 1991--and Greek  participation in peacekeeping activities may entail human  losses, Greece should nevertheless enter the fray, notably in  view of the fact that this is requested by Serbia, with which  Greece maintains strong ties of friendship, Iordhanidhis  concludes.</p>

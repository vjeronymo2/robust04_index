			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A social side to business (3) - Samuel Brittan's views on the legitimacy of the social elements of corporate responsibility, reported on September 2, generated a large number of letters. This is a selection Sir, Samuel Brittan is out of touch with the times if he thinks business and the community should keep their distance. In the Co-operative Bank (and movement) we have a natural relationship going back a century and a half with the community which created us, but today most businesses are rediscovering ethical and community values. There has been a distance between business and local activists which needed to be bridged. Now, for example, we - and many other local businesses - are working with Manchester and neighbouring authorities, supported by the prime minister, to bring the Olympics to the north-west and new prosperity to east Manchester. Through that, we are all learning how much more we can achieve working together for the community and for our businesses. Economists say that in the long run ethical businesses prosper. Few of Britain's biggest and best businesses today would not claim to be part of their communities. It is not a fashion - it is the long-term recipe for success. Terry Thomas, managing director, The Co-operative Bank, 1 Balloon Street, Manchester M60 4EP</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Wall Street steels itself for long wait - New York It is a disheartening irony, but until the economy shows unmistakable signs of cooling, the share prices of those companies best positioned to benefit from steady growth - and lead the market to a sustained rally - are likely to continue falling. In the aftermath of Friday's news of a surprising jump in April employment levels, a sense of resignation is hanging over Wall Street this morning. After flirting with the notion that the worst was over, many investors are now convinced the market has a long way to go before hitting bottom. 'We don't have much leadership, we've got a very weak bond market and very good potential that stocks are going to be under pressure in the near term,' says Mr Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte. 'We are probably going to stay in a corrective phase until there is some solid evidence the economy has slowed,' agrees Mr Thomas McManus, stock strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Consumer and producer price data, due out later in the week, could help, but it is doubtful, regardless of the actual numbers. A look back at last month's price trends is hardly instructive for investors seeking to gauge inflation a year from now. Ever since the Federal Reserve last raised rates on April 18, economists have warned that a fourth increase was only a matter of time. Yet Wall Street had been growing confident that the next tightening, when it came, would satisfy the Fed's intention of establishing a 'neutral' monetary policy, although that remains undefined. Amid this cautious optimism, the blue chip index showed a net gain of 14 points in the first four sessions of last week, despite the dollar's unsettling weakness and its depressing implications for an already soured Treasury market. However, the April payroll number has forced investors to rethink their positions. It showed non-farm employers taking on 267,000 more workers last month, against forecasts of a 160,000 gain. Stocks dropped on the news, recovered and lurched downward again after it became apparent that the Fed would not make its move before the weekend. 'The two greatest foes of stocks are rising rates and uncertainty,' points out Mr Eugene Peroni, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Both bogeymen loomed larger on Friday and the Dow was 26 points down on the session. Wall Street is betting heavily on the Fed striking this morning. The reaction may depend on the bank's aggressiveness. A fourth 25 basis point increase is likely to be a disappointment to a market hoping against hope that the tightening sequence is to be completed soon. The tribulations of the dollar, meanwhile, remain a distracting sideshow. Further declines are possible today, analysts say, especially in view of the currency's steadiness as bonds plunged on Friday. As with monetary policy, the stock market's concern over the dollar is based more on the shifting landscape than its actual value.</p>

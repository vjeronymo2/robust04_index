In a statement issued today, the Arab League said:  At a time when all international and Arab efforts are being  devoted to establishing permanent and just peace in the Middle  East on the basis of the implementation of the UN Security  Council resolutions, Israel is defying the international will by  continuing to establish settlements in the Arab territories.  The latest was the establishment of a new settlement on the  Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.    The Arab League affirmed that this settlement is considered  a  link in the chain of Israeli attempts to Judaize the Arab  territories. It also comes in the wake of the Israeli Supreme  Court's decision on 23 September 1993 to regard the al-Aqsa  Mosque as part of Israeli territory.    The statement said: While strongly condemning this Israeli  measure because it constitutes a grave violation of the will of  the international community and the resolutions of international  legitimacy, particularly UN Security Council Resolution 252, the  Arab League Secretariat General views this measure as an attempt  to impose a fait accompli. It also views this measure as a big  obstacle in the way of the current peace talks to implement the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which stipulates that the  Jerusalem issue will be discussed within the framework of a  final solution.    The statement called on the international community and all  the effective forces in the world to put an end to the  deliberate Israeli violations in the occupied Arab territories  in implementation of the principles and resolutions of  international legitimacy and to safeguard the unique character  of Jerusalem as a city where the heavenly religions and human  civilizations coexist.</p>

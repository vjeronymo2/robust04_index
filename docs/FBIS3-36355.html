			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Azerbaijan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Gasan  Gasanov gave a news conference today on the results of his talks  with Vladimir Kazimirov, special envoy of the Russian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs. Before the talks, Kazimirov visited Armenia  and Nagorno-Karabakh with a new Russian peace initiative on the  Karabakh conflict. Yesterday, our correspondent Islam Kuliyev  asked Gasan Gasanov to explain this especially for Mayak  Panorama listeners.    [Begin recording] [Kuliyev] Gasan Azizovich, several days  have passed since your talks with the Russian president's  personal envoy, Vladimir Kazimirov, but unfortunately we have  not yet received exhaustive information about the fate of the  new peace initiative proposed by the Russian side. Could you  please tell us about this in more detail?    [Gasanov] In fact, what one means by the Russian initiative  is an initiative on settling this conflict by peaceful political  methods. In this respect we totally and fully support the  Russian initiative and believe that Russia must, without fail,  participate in this settlement process. The point is that in  addition to this overall settlement process, Kazimirov also had  the idea that a ceasefire should be concluded immediately.    We gave our consent to Azerbaijan and Armenia urgently  concluding a truce on a cease-fire. [sentence as heard]  Azerbaijan was even willing not to place any terms on the  cease-fire. However, the Armenian side set the condition that  Nagorno-Karabakh should also sign this, as an equal partner.  For Nagorno-Karabakh to sign as an equal partner would, in  practice, have meant that they were, so to speak, a third party  in this conflict even though they are not an equal third party.  We very much regret the failure to persuade the Republic of  Armenia to sign a cease-fire agreement with us.    [Kuliyev] As you see it, is there a chance that they might  agree to the Armenian community in Nagorno-Karabakh playing some  part in this whole talks process?    [Gasanov] That is precisely how we understand it, namely  that  Nagorno-Karabakh has two communities -- the Azerbaijani  community and the Armenian. Of the 150,000 population living in  Nagorno-Karabakh, 100,000 are Armenians and 50,000 are  Azerbaijanis. The Republic of Armenia totally ignores the  rights of the 50,000 Azerbaijanis of Nagorno-Karabakh.    [Kuliyev] How do you see this conflict developing in the  future?    [Gasanov] I see only one path, the path of a peaceful  political settlement. We need to sit down at the negotiation  table and to talk and talk and talk and not to expect instant  results from these talks. We reckon on them being long-term but  successful talks. Moreover, of course, I do not rule out the  possibility that when we do sit down at the negotiation table,  the Armenians will realize that talking from their position of  strength does not have the effect it used to. And and having  realized that it is not as effective to speak from a position of  strength as it used to be, they will probably behave more  realistically at the negotiation table.

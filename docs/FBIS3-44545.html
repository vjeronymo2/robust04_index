The State Administration for Inspection of Import and Export  Commodities said that it examined nearly $61 billion worth of  goods during the first 10 months of last year, 29 percent more  than during the same period in 1992.    Starting last year, the administration began tightening  inspection to make sure that goods entering and leaving the  country met required standards.    Officials found nearly $241 million worth of export products  and nearly $1.3 billion of imported goods to be substandard.    Last year, imports hit $100 billion and exports $90 billion,  with foreign trade volume increasing 15 percent over 1992.    The administration said that despite increased inspections,  the percentage of substandard exports last year dropped from  1992, indicating an improvement in the quality of domestic  products.    During the first 10 months of last year, 8 per cent of  inspected exports failed to meet standards, a .52 percentage  point drop over the same period in 1992.    The inspection authority also noted that its efforts have  been conducive to the smooth development of China's foreign  trade.    The country's machinery products that were sold abroad were  among China's top quality exports, it said.    Some domestic chemical products, however, were banned from  being sold overseas, officials said.    Rapidly growing imports last year burdened inspectors who  checked nearly $30.7 billion worth of foreign goods bought by  the mainland during the first 10 months of 1993.    This was an increase of nearly 40 percent over the same  period in 1992.    The administration said the quality of imports has improved.  Only 41 per cent of inspected goods were substandard last year,  versus 47.9 percent the year before.    During the first 10 months of last year, farm and sideline  imported products had the biggest quality control problems,  officials said.    According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-  operation (Moftec), growing domestic demand for industrial and  agricultural products spurred China's imports last year.    The government's investment in fixed assets, which was 1,150  billion yuan ($113 billion) last year, stimulated Chinese  companies' demand for foreign industrial products mainly in the  transportation, telecommunication and energy sectors.  Meanwhile, a 500,000-ton decrease in domestic cotton production  and fast-growing demand for foodstuffs also helped boost the  country's purchases of foreign farm products.    According to Customs figures, major imports covered  machinery, electronics, light industrial, minerals and  agricultural and animal by-products.    Among exports, Customs said that goods going overseas  improved in quality and included farm and sideline products,  textiles, machinery and minerals.    China also made a breakthrough in tapping new overseas  trading partners, although it kept key commercial relations with  Japan, Hong Kong, the United States and the European Community.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Arts: An eager throng for Lieder winner - Recital The Wigmore Hall was packed on Tuesday, for a young German baritone who has never sung here and whose recordings have not reached Britain. The fact that he was a winner in some important Lieder competitions four and five years ago would hardly explain the eager throng. Rather, what drew them was the Wigmore's advance brochure, with the vital information that Gorne has been the chosen pupil of both Fischer-Dieskau and Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, master-artists who do not take on apprentices lightly. Sure enough, he proved to be a marvel in late Schubert songs - the Schwanengesang collection, amplified by other songs on Seidl verses. The words were utterly limpid, and thoughtfully penetrated. The voice has a potent individual appeal: essentially a high baritone, with lovely ascents into head-voice but with the manly weight of a deeper instrument. (It was only in 'Der Atlas', of which he made a very good fist, that we noticed his toneless bass.) In detail, the joining of note to note was exquisite. There was never a lapse in the stream of cultivated tone, nor any unconvincing musical phrase, nor yet any German consonant fudged for the sake of smoothness. In short, Gorne was a rare pleasure to hear. Not exactly 'mature beyond his years' as a performing artist - he never attempted the sharp dramatic thrusts that lit up Schwarzkopf's and Dieskau's interpretations; but a prodigy, beyond argument, of fluid musico-technical perfection. He was born in Chemnitz, and trained originally in Leipzig; like his older compatriot Olaf Baer, he is the product of a thorough, old-fashioned training which put a premium on solid musicianship and still left a kind of innocence intact. His sophisticated polish was surely acquired through his famous Western teachers. At the moment, he seems temperamentally most at home with Schubertian melancholy, as in 'Kriegers Ahnung', 'Ihr Bild' and 'Die Stadt'  -winning performances, every one. His accompanist here was the veteran Irwin Gage, intent upon leaving the young singer the spotlight and all the room he wanted. Lighter and brighter songs were a bit tame: the pigeon go-between in 'Die Taubenpost' was plainly ambling, not flying. All in all, however, Gorne sets an extraordinary standard which very few young Lieder singers now can hope to match.</p>

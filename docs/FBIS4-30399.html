			<p>BFN     [Text] At the lower house diplomatic committee meeting on  22 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa commented on resumption  of the 3d round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks. Regarding the  DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development plan, he said that  Japan will not necessarily insist on the need to carry out  inspections on the DPRK's application of plutonium for military  purposes in the past.    So far, the foreign minister has been saying that it is  important to find out whether or not the DPRK ever tried to  develop nuclear weapons. On 22 June, however, Kakizawa  commented on the U.S. Government's view, saying: "It seems that  the U.S. Government plans, for the time being, not to force  inspections on the DPRK over its history of nuclear reactor  operation but to seek, at the high- level talks, complete  implementation of [nuclear] inspections, including special  inspections." He then said: "In this way, the suspicions over  the DPRK's nuclear issues, including the doubts about the past,  will be dissolved. We will ask the United States to keep our  views in mind as it holds U.S.-DPRK talks." He made these  comments in response to a question by Shouzou Harada (of the  Liberal Democratic Party).</p>

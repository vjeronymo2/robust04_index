			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Solutions to Chinese puzzle - The challenges posed by listing mainland companies on Hong Kong's stock exchange AN experiment in marrying China's socialist civil law system to Hong Kong's version of UK common law is nearing completion, with the listing this month of the first mainland Chinese state-controlled company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Tsingtao Brewery, shares in which will be traded from this Thursday, is the first of nine companies being brought to market. Incorporated in Tsingtao's articles of association is an attempt to codify common law on matters such as the role and responsibilities of directors, protection of minorities, and accounting standards. Corporate law in China is still in its infancy. It was only in May last year that the Chinese government published a set of regulations governing companies, known as the Standard Opinion on Joint Stock Companies. The Standard Opinion applies to mainland Chinese companies which have issued, or plan to issue, shares to employees, the public or both. It is an interim set of regulations that has the force of law, and will stand until officials have drafted a comprehensive companies law - currently undergoing its fourth revision. A Hong Kong Stock Exchange team, led by Mr Anthony Neoh, QC, and incorporating outside legal experts and representatives from the Securities and Futures Commission, the colony's corporate watchdog, worked for nearly a year with mainland Chinese counterparts on the terms under which the Hong Kong exchange would accept a mainland company listing. The Hong Kong exchange and the SFC were concerned to ensure that minority shareholders in Chinese companies would have a level of investor protection comparable with that of shareholders in companies registered in Hong Kong. Hong Kong companies are subject to the colony's Companies Ordinance, stock exchange listing rules and regulation by the SFC. The most difficult issue they had to overcome was the difference between Hong Kong and Chinese law. In China, law is found only in written codes. Case law, where it exists, is used merely for reference. By contrast, Hong Kong's law, as with other common law jurisdictions, is based on statute and principles developed in the courts, and so is found only in case law. 'The whole law on the fiduciary responsibilities of directors or the rights of different classes of shareholders has been built up by our courts since the 1850s and 1860s,' says Mr Neoh. To ensure that mainland Chinese directors and managers would be subject to the same legal constraints as their counterparts in Hong Kong, 'we had to go back to the cases to extract the principles', he adds. The mainland companies are issuing class 'H' shares in Hong Kong. These shares differ legally from class 'A' shares, which will be issued to mainland shareholders, much in the same way as ordinary shares differ from preference shares. The question of class rights - between holders of 'H' and 'A' shares - was solved by adopting Canada's codification of common law on the subject, as enshrined in its Business Corporations Act. Other factors, such as the duties and obligations of directors, were derived from Hong Kong case law. China's Standard Opinion says the duty of directors is to act 'honestly and sincerely'; it is silent on a director's obligations. The articles of association of Tsingtao incorporate standard 'duties and obligations' familiar to any western director, such as: 'To observe obliga-tions of a fiduciary not to place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict.' Another potential difficulty was shareholders' right of redress in the courts. This was solved by incorporating in the articles of association a provision for disputes to be adjudicated - at the choice of the claimant - in either the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission or the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre. Judgments in either tribunal are enforceable in either jurisdiction, because China and the UK (and by extension Hong Kong) are party to the New York Convention for the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards. The mainland companies have also accepted that their directors can be sued personally. Under Hong Kong corporate law only the company can sue its directors. If a shareholder can prove oppression by a controlling shareholder, an individual can sue a director on behalf of other minority shareholders in what is known as a 'derivative action'. A derivative action, however, is an unknown legal concept in China. So, through a series of interlocking contracts signed by the directors and the company, shareholders in the nine state companies will be able to sue a director personally. Mr Neoh concedes that it is difficult to predict how this provision will develop, but says: 'This provision will put pressure on non-defaulting directors to act against the defaulting director to avoid their being embroiled in a legal dispute.' The talks between the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong officials were facilitated by the fact that many of them had western legal training, says Mr Neoh. He says, for example: 'I asked them what their conception of a limited company was. One senior official said a limited company was one where the company was liable only to the extent of its capital. Another, giving the correct answer, said a limited company meant shareholders were not liable for more than their initial subscription.' At that moment, says Mr Neoh, one mainland official piped up: 'Salomon against Salomon' - a reference to a US case from 1897 which established the limitations of liability of shareholders to their subscription of capital. The initial Chinese confusion stemmed from the definition of a company in the Standard Opinion, says Mr Neoh. It says a shareholder 'must, within the limits of his contribution, be responsible for the company's debts'. In spite of recent developments, modern law in China - only 14 years in the making - remains in a state of flux. It is a land where the rule of man has always prevailed over the rule of law. From imperial times to the present, the obiter dicta of the emperor or the Communist party chief has been accorded the force of law. In 1988, Mr Peng Zhen, a senior Communist party elder who, in UK legal terms, held the twin responsibilities of home secretary and Lord Chancellor, was asked if the law was more important than the Communist party. 'I'm not very sure about that,' Mr Peng said. The codified common law written into the articles of association of the Chinese companies being listed in Hong Kong does not recognise the Communist party. Duties and obligations are framed solely in terms of a company's relationship with its owners. Mr Neoh is cautiously optimistic. 'We have spent a lot of time with these companies - I have visited three of them myself - and they are very keen to comply with our rules,' he says. 'There are two forces working in our direction: management have a boss to report to; and there is market discipline. Their share price will fall if they break the rules.' But he concedes he cannot forecast how successful the changes will be. 'I can't predict anything; I'm just hoping. We should know within the next six months or so.'</p>

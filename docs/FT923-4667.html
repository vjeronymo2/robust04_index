			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Carrefour chairman quits after sharp fall in profits MR MICHEL Bon, a leading figure in French retailing, yesterday resigned as chairman of the Carrefour hypermarket group following the news of a sharp fall in net profits. The group's profits dived to FFr277m (Dollars 57.9m) in the first half of this year from FFr593m in the same period of 1991. The fall was due to Carrefour's problems in intergrating the Euromarche chain of supermarkets acquired in a FFr5.22bn deal last year. Mr Bon was the architect of the Euromarche deal which triggered a series of similar takeovers by other companies in France's increasingly concentrated food retailing sector. Carrefour was clouded by speculation about its interim result, and by rumours of Mr Bon's resignation, for most of yesterday. Carrefour's shares fell sharply during the morning until they were suspended on the Paris stock market at FFr2,300, down FFr179 on the previous day. Mr Bon's resignation marks the end of a period in which Carrefour has emerged as one of the most dynamic forces in French retailing. He will be replaced in the short term by a supervisory management committee which will be formed to run Carrefour. The Euromarche acquisition formed part of the on-going consolidation of the food sector, in which the larger players have expanded to counter the maturity of the French market and the growing power of multinational food manufacturers, such as BSN of France and Nestle of Switzerland. Earlier this summer Casino, another big player in French food retailing, followed the precedent set by Carrefour by buying the Rallye chain. Carrefour has spent the past year merging Euromarche's operations with its own management and buying systems. The merger has, however, run into problems although it said yesterday that it was still on course for an increase in net profits for 1992, probably 10 per cent higher than 1991 when it made FFr1.21bn on sales of FFr100bn.</p>

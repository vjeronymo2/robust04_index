			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO KEEP U.S. IN THE CHIPS, MODIFY THE ANTITRUST LAWS  </P> <P> Formation of U.S. Memories Inc., the consortium of U.S. computer and  semiconductor firms to make state-of-the-art DRAM chips, indicates that U.S.  firms are finally beginning to use cooperation as a tool for competition.  Unfortunately, the consortium is born under the shadow of outdated U.S.  antitrust law that will restrict the company's ability to compete with foreign  producers. The new company must endeavor to obtain full value from technology  it acquires or generates, while avoiding antitrust policies adopted in a  different era for different problems.  </P> <P> U.S. Memories, which apparently will receive equity contributions from seven  firms (Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Advanced Micro Devices, Digital Equipment Corp.,  Intel, LSI Logic and National Semiconductor), will establish facilities to  manufacture DRAMs, some fraction of which the investors will be obligated to  purchase. Its initial technology will be licensed from IBM.  </P> <P> This is a novel arrangement for U.S. industry, and it indicates a recognition  of common interests between semiconductor users and producers, and also among  the users. The competitive disadvantage that many U.S. computer manufacturers  face vis-a-vis their Japanese competition may be softened by this venture.  </P> <P> But the new firm is already affected and impeded by U.S. antitrust laws. More  bad news may be in store if the new company is successful. We see several ways  that this venture is affected by antitrust law.  </P> <P>  -- While the need for such an enterprise has been clear for years, it has been  slow in coming in part because managers and lawyers had to wind their way  through a thicket of antitrust concerns and constraints. Even preliminary  discussions among competitors create antitrust concerns, because it may be  illegal for competitors to discuss future investment plans.  </P> <P>  -- The new venture is exposed to possible lawsuits from other U.S. chip  producers. If it wants to migrate into related products like static RAMS, it  could face treble-damage lawsuits from specialist firms.  </P> <P>  -- Investors will not have access to the venture's proprietary memory  technology. We see no sound economic reason for this stance; it may stem from  antitrust concerns.  </P> <P>  -- U.S. Memories' decision to build new facilities, rather than use the  capacity of several of the co-venturers, may also be driven by antitrust  uncertainty regarding cooperative contractual arrangements.  </P> <P> Finally, a key reason why firms want to be part of U.S. Memories is because  DRAMs are "technology drivers." Producing them generates new skills and  capabilities relevant in other areas. To imprison this technology for antitrust  reasons is to handicap the company's position to contribute to U.S.  competitiveness.  </P> <P> Before the patience of U.S. Memories' partners wears thin, and before they  compromise the enterprise in order to steer around antitrust concerns, Congress  should modify antitrust laws to ensure that arrangements like this are legal.  Antitrust reform is no panacea for the problems facing U.S. industry, but it  could lower a major barrier for high-technology firms, particularly small and  medium-sized ones.  </P> <P> Bills recently introduced in Congress would reduce treble-damage antitrust  exposure now faced by firms that enter into cooperative agreements and  consortiums created to develop and commercialize new technologies. Both the  "registration" approach of one bill and the "certification" approach of another  are desirable.  </P> <P> A registration procedure operates with modest government involvement, but  provides modest relief as well. It would reduce antitrust exposure to single  damages instead of treble damages.  </P> <P> The proposed certification procedure would involve review by the Department of  Justice or Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Department of  Commerce, to ensure that the cooperative arrangement does not create  substantial market power. A cooperative innovation arrangement among firms  whose combined market shares are less than 20% would be automatically approved.  When combined shares are greater than 20%, the arrangement would be approved  only if it improved competitive performance, and the combination was warranted  on the basis of scale, complementary capabilities and a demonstrable need for  operational and strategic coordination. If a certificate of exemption is  obtained, the threat of antitrust damages is eliminated and private antitrust  challenges would be limited to injunctive relief.  </P> <P> Certification is a necessary companion to registration because it provides a  mechanism for evaluating and approving cooperative arrangements and consortiums  involving firms with large market shares. Registration alone will not provide  the certainty needed to encourage large-scale consortiums. If Congress adopts  only a registration approach, it can expect to see a continuation of the  present case-by-case, industry-specific petitioning for antitrust exemptions,  which is expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable.  </P> <P> These antitrust law changes are not going to remedy America's relative decline  in key technologies. But at least they will bring the United States closer to  the policies of Europe and Japan, and in time, will encourage successful  cooperative commercialization of innovation.  </P></p>

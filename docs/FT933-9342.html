			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Upturn may be jeopardised by more competition The upturn in the fortunes of the insurance industry could prove short-lived if the conclusions of a recent analysis by McKinsey &amp; Company, the management consultants, are borne out, writes Richard Lapper. Writing in the latest issue of The McKinsey Quarterly, Mr Michael Muth says that competition will increase sharply following the deregulation of the European market next year in line with European Commission directives. He predicts that new specialised insurers, which have simplified and lean cost structures, will grab market share from established multi-line insurers. Increasingly insurers will be competing for fewer customers as both domestic and commercial customers opt to self-insure and predicts a 20 to 25 per cent fall in premiums. 'Households and industrial corporations alike are opting for self-insurance much more frequently.' Mr Muth adds that insurers will be forced to make more efficient use of capital in order to invest in systems and marketing. 'It is likely that the profitability of the European insurance industry will continue to decline until a thorough shake-up has occurred and both survivors and newcomers have redefined their roles in the market,' he says. 'The majority of today's players will therefore have to exit the business - a shake-out like the one that occurred in the United States in the 1980s.' Mr Muth says that the poor results experienced by most of Europe's main companies in 1991 and 1992 did not 'reflect a temporary dip in the underwriting cycle . . . but marked the onset of an unstoppable transition.'</p>

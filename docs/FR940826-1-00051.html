HCFA makes this payment directly to the ESRD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. The facility must accept the allowance determined by HCFA as payment in full. Payment for these drugs is made as described below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hospital-based facilities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Central bank action boosts Chinese yuan THE Chinese yuan rose 18 per cent against the US dollar last week after the central bank poured more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) into the money market. The yuan closed on Friday at Yn8.65 to the dollar; last month it had been trading at almost Yn11 to the dollar at China's semi-official swap centres. Chinese efforts to encourage people to save with banks, rather than concealing money at home, is paying off. Banks say that since interest rates on savings and fixed-term deposits were lifted on July 11 they have been so overwhelmed that hours have had to be extended. Lending and deposit rates were lifted by an average 1.38 and 1.72 percentage points, and the one-year fixed-term deposit rate moved up to 10.98 per cent in an attempt to encourage cash-strapped companies to repatriate hard currency to obtain yuan liquidity. The interest rate increase was in tandem with a nationwide campaign to attract greater savings deposits from the population, historically suspicious of state financial institutions and believed to be hoarding millions of yuan in tea caddies and mattresses. China has recently admitted that banks are short of cash. The Beijing branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China had its busiest day on record the day rates went up, according to the official China Daily newspaper, when new savings hit Yn61m (Pounds 7m). The interest rate rise was one of the first steps taken by Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier, when he took on the extra role of governor of the Bank of China. In an attempt to cool the overheating economy and control inflation now running at 20 per cent in urban centres, Mr Zhu has taken steps to curb bank lending. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-based Ming Pao Daily News said the central bank was determined to strengthen the yuan to Yn8.3 to the dollar 'and will pay any price for it'. Quoting a Chinese finance official, the pro-Beijing newspaper said China aimed to achieve its target rate within the next six months - which would bring the yuan one step closer to the final target value of Yn8 to the dollar. The black market price remains at about Yn9 to the dollar, while the official rate is Yn5.7 to the dollar.</p>

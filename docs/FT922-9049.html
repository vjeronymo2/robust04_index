			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Property: Town and gown don't mix much - John Worrell finds that Cambridge has too many cars and not enough residential roads THERE IS a touch of oil and water about Cambridge. This flat Fenland city, on a quiet tributary of the river Great Ouse, has among its 103,000 residents 14,000 university students, 2,000 polytechnic students and, at any one time, an indeterminate number of transitory foreigners learning English. Its student population is the highest per capita in the UK. Including teaching staff, and the staff to service them, the academic fraternity accounts for nearly a fifth of the city's population. But the academics barely mix with the indigenes. In the last decade or so, another globule has appeared in the form of new industries drawn in by the university's cerebral power. This section of Cambridge's population is slightly more assimilatory, because its members tend to be there longer-term. But a good number of its higher paid workers drive in each day from elsewhere, thus contributing minimally to the city community and massively to the city traffic. According to the city planning department, Cambridge now provides 80,000 jobs within the city, and a further 36,000 jobs in the immediate hinterland which includes Cambridge Science Park. That is more than enough employment to support a community twice its size. It also means 30,000 inward daily commuters to the city itself. The effect on the city's housing market is complex and difficult to quantify. Relatively high wages from an inherently strong local economy, with a largely recession-proof educational element at the heart of it, would seem to be a plus. Cambridge has weathered recession relatively well so far. But it is a two-edged sword for the community as a whole. At the bottom end, relatively affluent students can usually outbid low earners for private rented accommodation. To the average householder, Pounds 50 or Pounds 60 per head per week for bed and breakfast from people who are otherwise hardly in the house is preferable to tenants on income support or housing benefit who may be there most of the time. Last year Cambridge City Council accepted 307 statutorily homeless families. That comes close to 1,000 people; a very significant proportion of the non-academic community, and one which has grown from almost nothing in 10 years. Such families accounted for 75 per cent of council housing allocations in 1991, and their numbers are expected to increase. The demand for rented accommodation stems not so much from the university (92 per cent of its undergraduates and 30 per cent of its postgraduates live in college residence or in rooms in university-owned houses), but from the more recently expanded polytechnic and language colleges which are less able to house their students. By the same token, you would suppose that demand in the renting sector would offer an opportunity to hard-pushed mortgagors on the lower and middle rungs of the housing ladder to let out a bedroom or two. There are no reliable figures on how many actually do so, because most people do not inform their lender that they do so - though they are supposed to. Estate agents say that repossessions have increased (the first question from cheerful potential purchasers is often whether any repossessed houses are available); but most agree that Cambridge seem to have avoided the worst effects of the housing downturn. Cliff Verrill, assistant general manager of the Cambridge building society, confirms this: 'There has been a slight increase in arrears, but we do not have a problem. Cambridge as a whole is certainly not as bad in that respect as other parts of the country.' He adds that where problems do occur, his building society is naturally keen to do everything to help borrowers in any way possible. 'We do not actively promote the renting ethic, but if borrowers are in trouble, renting is certainly one option they could look at.' Although there was a substantial drop from the peak of 1988, a price survey by the society showed that average city centre prices were holding up reasonably well. At the end of December 1991 they ranged from Pounds 65,000 for a small terrace to Pounds 102,000 for a modern detached house. While that generally represented a small drop over the preceding year, small terraced houses had actually risen in value, somewhat against the trend elsewhere in East Anglia. To some extent this may be explained by captive demand in a relatively buoyant city. 'City properties are easier to sell than country properties,' says Martin Green of Catlings, the house agents. 'That has always been the case. And there is always a demand for correctly priced first-time buyers' houses.' But as Ian Purkiss, of estate agent Hockeys, points out: 'A healthy letting sector means that there are always small speculators who will try to buy with a view to letting. A house worth Pounds 65,000, let to four students, would probably produce about Pounds 650 per month, which isn't a bad return.' At the upper end of the market, much of the quality housing in the central area is already owned by the colleges of Cambridge University - constantly in the market for more housing to accommodate their students and staff. Anything of the right quality in the right place with the right planning profile (the city council is not always willing to see large houses divided into small units) is usually snapped up. Most vendors are aware of this specific demand, and properties often sell without reaching the open market. But supply is limited. For the fact is that beyond the Backs along the river Cam, the colleges, and the ancient streets of the centre, Cambridge is a surprisingly bland city, with rows of Victorian, Edwardian and inter-war property, and a very limited supply of distinctive housing. As Jock Lloyd-Jones of Bidwells puts it: 'Cambridge is not blessed with its fair share of prime residential roads. One could perhaps name half a dozen good roads, and after that one is struggling. What has been proved time and time again throughout this last year in Cambridge is that location counts more than anything when it comes to a difficult market.' No one presumes to know where the market will go from here. Economic uncertainty and election prospects are invoked as reasons for not giving a view. What is clear is that the new industrial base which the cerebral power resources have attracted and nurtured is a resilient creature in the face of the present economic malaise. Despite its share of casualties, it seems to be self-regenerating; it looks set to grow as much as economic conditions and planning considerations will allow. Its demand for housing for its highly paid employees tends not to be directed at the city so much as at Cambridgeshire's outlying villages - hence the commuting problem. Most local feeling is that the further out housing is pushed without curbs on employment, the worse will the traffic problem become.</p>

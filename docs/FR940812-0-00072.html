			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public policy, record of past performance, and financial and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to detail the significant history of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following: Rationale for the method of procurement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection of contract type, contractor selection or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejection, and the basis for the contract price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type contracts only_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) After a determination that no other contract is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractor exceeds at its own risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative issues arising out of procurements. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues include, but are not limited to source evaluation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the grantee or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subgrantee of any contractual responsibilities under its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts. Federal agencies will not substitute their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State, or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurements and shall in all instances disclose information regarding the protest to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awarding agency. A protester must exhaust all administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies with the grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protest with the Federal agency. Reviews of protests by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agency will be limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of this section (violations of State or local law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be under the jurisdiction of State or local authorities);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Violations of the grantee's or sub-grantee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protest procedures for failure to review a complaint or protest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protests received by the Federal agency other than those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in this paragraph (b)(12)(ii) will be referred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the grantee or subgrantee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Competition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition consistent with the standards of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition include but are not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bonding;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between affiliated companies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retainer contracts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

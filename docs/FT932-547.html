			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: Use of derivatives on the increase in developing countries THE USE of derivatives for risk management is becoming more wide-spread in developing countries, according to a report by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank. Until now, many of the techniques open to companies functioning in developed economies have been unavailable or unfamiliar to companies in developing countries, which often have to cope with greater, and less predictable, risks. Typically, inflation is a far more serious risk in developing countries. In practice, it forces firms to shorten their planning horizons, and reduces the maturity range of financial instruments available. Along with inflation risk comes greater currency risk. Companies may borrow money in foreign currencies because they are attracted to the lower interest rates, but a company raising funds in dollars at low interest rates could face insuperable problems, if its currency exposure was not hedged and its currency was subsequently de-valued. Companies in developing countries are also likely to be more susceptible to political risk - not only because a volatile political climate may affect the attitudes of their counterparties, but also because more protectionist governments may, for example, impose restrictions on foreign exchange. The IFC has performed a dual role in helping such companies make use of derivatives: first, in educating them about the techniques available and how to use them, and second in acting as an intermediary with banks. Many companies in developing countries are not considered sufficiently creditworthy by banks to access the derivative markets in their own right. Even if they can gain access, almost all are severely restricted in the maturities available. Typically, companies may have access to derivatives with a duration of 18 months, but, with IFC intermediation, this can be extended to five or seven years, to match their needs. Mr Rene Karsenti, treasurer of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has a similar programme, said many companies could, in theory, access the swaps market by posting collateral against swaps, but banks were not always prepared to do the necessary paperwork for small transactions. Since the IFC's first risk management project in June 1990, the board has approved 19 projects enabling clients to hedge around Dollars 1.5bn of liabilities, in countries ranging from Mexico and Bolivia to Ghana and Egypt. Mr Jack Glen, the IFC economist who wrote the report, says Brazil is the most advanced of the developing countries in its use of derivatives, largely because the government has allowed the financial sector to develop more freely than in many other developing countries. In Brazil, interest rate swaps have been allowed since last year, and currency swaps have recently been authorised. Other more sophisticated markets are Mexico, Chile and India, which have hedging instruments available in their own domestic markets. In other countries, firms are beginning to turn to markets in the major financial centres. 'Lack of sophistication in the local financial markets has so far translated into a lack of derivative securities for dealing with local currency exchange risk and interest rate risk,' the report says. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development also advises its clients - in this case eastern European companies - on risk management. The Bank's loans to companies incorporate 'conversion options', allowing them, at a fee, to change the currency of the loan. 'We discourage clients from taking foreign exchange and commodity risk,' said Mr Karsenti. For example, if a company exports to Germany, it may wish to pay interest out of its cash flow in D-Marks, but if its profile changes, it can change the currency of the interest payments accordingly. The Bank can also offer loans which have interest payments linked to the price of a commodity, which allows any company producing that commodity to link its payments to expected earnings.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Betting on the upturn This week, two rather different institutions - the UK government and Orange County in California - paid a heavy price for guessing wrong. A year ago they made essentially the same bet: that growth in the Anglo-American economies would continue to be modest. Underestimating the recovery's strength will not be the forecasting error of winter 1994. Financial markets are betting that the entire world economy is heading for a year of strong and inflationary growth. Likely as not, that will be wrong too. Last year the UK chancellor made a judgment call on the strength of the recovery. Mr Clarke decided to stick with a phased increase in value-added tax on fuel, rather than impose it on consumers all at once. It was a sensible enough decision. An economy expected to grow 2.5 per cent, after a long recession, needs to be treated gingerly. And the public finances were likely to be scary enough in spring 1995 for tax increases to be easily defended. As it turned out, Mr Clarke was wrong on both counts. The country prospered from his mistake, but this week the error temporarily cost the exchequer Pounds 1bn in voted-down tax revenues. The damage to the government's credibility will be permanent. Taxpayers in Orange County are facing a Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn bill for a similar misjudgment by their local authority. Mr Robert Citron, its treasurer, invested on the expectation that the 1993 pattern of steady US growth and stable or falling short-term interest rates would continue through 1994. Unfortunately for him, the economy raced onward. Mr Alan Greenspan raised US interest rates six times, eventually losing the county so much money that on Tuesday it filed for bankruptcy. Less obvious Those who remember the past make sure that they do not repeat it. The steep yield curve in markets around the world indicates that investors are discounting strong economic growth, higher inflation and sharp rises in short-term interest rates in 1995. Some of these ingredients are already present in the US and UK. The case for all three, in all of the world's industrialised economies, is less obvious. Mr Greenspan's November rate increase dispelled some fears that he had fallen behind in the race to slow the economy before inflationary pressures emerge. He improved his hawkish credentials further on Wednesday, testifying to Congress that inflation fears may mean another rise in federal funds rate  -now 5.5 per cent - in the months ahead. The US economy has yet to show clear signs of slowing from the real growth rate of roughly 4 per cent recorded over most of the year. Investors appear to expect US interest rates to rise further. Other things being equal, that is the simplest way to lower the gap between long and short-term interest rates. But markets have to co-operate, by lowering their expectations for inflation. Before Orange County's losses disturbed them, the signs were that bond traders were at last beginning to trust Mr Greenspan's judgment. US 10-year bond rates fell briefly to 7.7 per cent on Tuesday, compared with over 8 per cent three weeks ago. Same effect Mr Eddie George of the Bank of England will be hoping to get the same effect out of the half-point rise in UK interest rates which he won from Mr Clarke on Wednesday morning. The gap between regular and index-linked government bonds fell slightly after the rise, but investors are still betting against them achieving their medium-term inflation target. Rising short-term interest rates to accompany strong real growth seems the most probable recipe for a continued flattening of the yield curve in the US and UK. But is it sensible to expect a similar outcome elsewhere? German money markets took Thursday's higher-than-expected rise in third-quarter west German GDP as another reason to expect higher interest rates from the Bundesbank. The gap between actual and potential German GDP is currently only about 1 per cent. Companies may well come up against capacity constraints relatively quickly as production picks up, so the Bundesbank can fairly reliably be expected to try to pre-empt inflation in the coming months. The Bank of France, as ever, may be forced to follow the same path, although the French output gap is a good deal larger. Oddest of all is the current betting on Japan, where short and long-term interest rates are about 2.8 per cent apart, the same as in France and Germany. Although a slow and fragile Japanese recovery is finally under way, prices are still more likely to rise than to fall. Part of the explanation lies in the mistakes of the past: Japanese banks need artificially low interest rates to deal with the loans made when they expected the late 1980s inflationary boom to continue. It will be governments, not investors, who suffer if today's high nominal bond rates turn out to have overstated inflation. But if this week taught anything, it is that someone pays for surprises, even a pleasant one like strong, non-inflationary growth.</p>

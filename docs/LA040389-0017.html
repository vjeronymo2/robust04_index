			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WHERE A NICKEL PAYS OFF'  </P> <P> I was dismayed to read that SB 1221 proposes to raise the redemption value of  bottles and cans.  </P> <P> If your editorial writer had the misfortune to live in an apartment overlooking  an alley (as I do) he would never have endorsed this bill. We are awakened  every morning at dawn, sometimes earlier, by the first of a daylong procession  of scavengers going through all the garbage cans in the alley. Twenty people a  day is about average.  </P> <P> The sound of supermarket baskets rattling down the alley, of cans and bottles  being thrown out of garbage bins as the scavengers rummage around inside the  bins, and the shooting-gallery effect of cans being stamped on to flatten them  are enough to drive one mad. The fact that this routine ransacking of garbage  is illegal is beside the point; the law is never enforced. And now, it seems,  this madness is to be intensified and abetted, if the scavengers' monetary  incentive is increased.  </P> <P> JILL RENTON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

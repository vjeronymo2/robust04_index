			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Ansi, secretary general of </F> the Yemeni Reform Group and member of the National Accord  Committee, in Sanaa, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo; date not  given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Good morning, Mr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-  Ansi. Several dates have been mentioned for the signing of the  Pledge and Accord document between the Yemeni president and his  deputy. As a member of the National Accord Committee, can you  tell us if a date has been agreed on for the signing of the  document?    [Al-Ansi] Contacts were held with officials in the fraternal  Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan. It was agreed in principle that  the signing will take place on 20 February and that the final  confirmation will be made on Saturday, God willing. This is the  date agreed on in principle.    [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. al-Ansi, who will attend this signing?    [Al-Ansi] The signing will, of course, be witnessed by the  Political Dialogue Committee and the former presidents of North  and South Yemen, that is Marshal 'Abdallah al-Sallal, Judge  'Abd-al- Rahman al-Iryani, and 'Ali Nasir Muhammad.    [Abu-al-Majd] What are the most important clauses in this  document, which has taken a long time to formulate?    [Al-Ansi] The most important thing in it is its reference to  the bases for building the modern Yemeni state, the state of law  and order. This is manifested by the bases on which this state  will be established. Then there are the state's establishments  and structures as represented by the Presidential Council, the  government, and the Chamber of Deputies. A council has been  established, the Shura Council. It also refers to the economic  and administrative structures and lastly to the issue of  building the armed and security forces. We regard these to be  the important bases for building the state.    [Abu-al-Majd] Does this document satisfy the ambitions and  requirements of the two sides, that is, the president and his  deputy?    [Al-Ansi] This document represents the common denominator  that binds all the influential forces in Yemen. As I told the  Voice of the Arabs previously, the issue is not about the  president and his deputy but about the country. It is the issue  of developments in Yemen that might not have been understood and  that probably have not been handled properly. Therefore, these  developments expressed themselves in this crisis. It is true  that the president and his deputy are regarded as the face of  the crisis, but the latter is much deeper than this. Everyone  involved in this document was motivated more by a patriotic  feeling than by partisan calculations. It does not represent a  specific party or specific political force but the common  denominator binding all the forces that want what is good for  Yemen.    [Abu-al-Majd] But Mr. al-Ansi, Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid has said that this document might be submitted to a  referendum. Could this be done?    [Al-Ansi] It took us a long time to deal with this issue. We  completed studying the constitutional, legal, and procedural  guarantees for implementing this document yesterday. Discussion  of what is required from the existing constitutional  establishments took us a long time. There was a view that these  establishments should support this document and that they should  not be involved because implementation will be carried out  through them. Their role will come after the document is signed  and implementation begins. The Chamber of Deputies will have its  turn when it comes to the constitutional amendments and the  draft laws. The government's role will come when it lays down  the plans and timetable for implementing the document. We  concluded in our discussion that there is no need for a  referendum.    [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. al-Ansi, you said that a consultative  council has been set up. Does this mean that the existing  parliament is not performing its role as required or that you  felt the need to create this council?    [Al-Ansi] This is an extremely important question. I am  glad you gave me the opportunity to explain what this  consultative council is. First, regarding the name of this  council, perhaps one could have found a better name than this.  Discussions in this consultative council have focussed on dual  legislation in Yemen. The answer from everyone was no because  there is no justification for this duality. Agreement was  reached from the very beginning that this council does not have  any legislative responsibilities. The current parliament is the  sole body responsible for legislative and administrative  matters. The objective of this council is to sponsor the local  government or local administration experiment and to express an  opinion over the laws and judicial matters of the local  government. Its main function is advisory. It has no  legislative duties at all. Therefore, there is no contradiction  between it and the parliament. Its existence does not mean that  parliament is not performing its role as it should. This is not  the case at all. The objective of this council is to represent  the governorates, first and foremost, in development matters and  in activating the administrative units so that they protect the  interests of these units and supervise their activities. It has  no legislative duties at all. It is a purely consultative  council.    [Abu-al-Majd] Will the assassinations that have taken place  recently stop after the Pledge and Accord document is signed,  and what is the fate of the Armed Forces command? Who will  command the Armed Forces? This topic has been raised many times.    [Al-Ansi] Regarding the Armed Forces, there is a  comprehensive agreement; there are measures stipulated by the  document. These urgent measures include relocating the camps  that were in what was called [word indistinct] before the unity  to border areas and areas that need protection. This is the  first step. After that, the comprehensive step of merging the  Armed Forces completely will take place, after which they will  be deployed in areas where they are needed. There is total  agreement among all political forces in Yemen to make the Armed  Forces neutral and turn them into a force that protects  constitutional legitimacy that stems from the parliamentary  elections.    [Abu-al-Majd] Dear brothers, at the end of this dialogue, we  thank you and Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Ansi, secretary general of  the Yemeni Reform Group and member of the National Accord  Committee. Thank you.    [Al-Ansi] On our part, we always thank the employees of  Voice of the Arabs and express through this radio station our  greetings to the Arab people in Egypt and through them all the  Arab and Islamic nations.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo The implications of high bond issuance following the government's plan to reduce income tax will continue to weigh heavily on bond prices this week. Although politicians are still haggling over the financing of the tax cut after the first three years of its implementation, it is likely that the first few years will need to be funded by short-term government bonds. The Socialist Democratic Party's opposition to a rise in the sales tax in 1997 may mean that the period where the tax cut will be funded by government bonds may be longer than expected. Aside from the tax cut, the Y9,100bn spending by the government will increase bond supply. If long-term yields remain at current levels this week, the long-term credit banks are expected to raise long-term prime rates, or long-term lending rates for first-tier clients. A sharp sell-off of bonds may be limited by the Bank of Japan. In order to prevent long-term yields from plunging, the central bank last week led short-term money market rates lower through its money market operations. However, with only six weeks left until the March year-end, institutional investors are unlikely to increase their positions, and the market is expected to fluctuate on light trading within a narrow range.</p>

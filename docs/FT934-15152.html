			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Roxboro predicts sharp upturn ROXBORO, the Newmarket-based manufacturer of specialist electronic components which is coming to the market later this month, yesterday forecast sharply higher trading and pre-tax profits for the current year. The group, which issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday, said trading profits after central costs but before exceptional costs of Pounds 500,000, related to the closure of a factory, would more than double to at least Pounds 6.5m in the year to December 31. This compares with Pounds 3.1m last year. Pre-tax profits after net interest costs of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 500,000) were forecast to increase to Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 3.8m). The profit improvement mainly reflects the positive effects of a restructuring programme undertaken by Mr Harry Tee, Roxboro's chief executive, after he led a management buy-out of the electronic components division of Cambridge Electronic Industries (now Graseby) in mid-1990. Since then Mr Tee has improved productivity and refocused Roxboro away from low-margin commodity components and towards production of higher-margin value-added devices through its two core businesses, BLP in the UK and Dialight in the US. As a result, trading margins have risen from 7.6 per cent in the year of the buy-out to 16.4 per cent in the 1993 first half. The offer for sale and placing with institutional investors is expected to raise about Pounds 50m and value the company at about Pounds 80m. Some 35 per cent of the shares on offer will be available to the public. Schroder Ventures, which backed the management buy-out, will receive Pounds 25.5m gross of the proceeds and retain a 20 per cent stake in the enlarged group. Roxboro's management will also retain a 20 per cent stake after raising Pounds 10.5m from the offer. The offer will also raise up to Pounds 15m for the company itself which will be used to repay debt and other borrowings and to fund the group's plans for expansion. After the flotation Roxboro will have about Pounds 5.1m of net cash. Pricing is set for October 26 and is expected to reflect a prospective multiple of about 18 which would represent a moderate discount to comparable stocks like Bowthorpe and Telemetrix. The sponsor is Samuel Montague and dealings are expected to begin on November 10.</p>

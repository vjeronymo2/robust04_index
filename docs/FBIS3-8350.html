			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Soljic, newly appointed defense </F> minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, by Mario  Marusic; place and date not given: "The Soldiers Do Not Mind  `The Herzegovinian Lobby'"]    [Text] With the many changes that have occurred in the  Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna in the past month -- including  that concerning the establishment of the Presidential Council,  which, in the established state of emergency and until further  notice, is to carry out the duties of president instead of Mate  Boban -- public attention was particularly aroused by the  appointment of Vladimir Soljic, the former minister of energy,  mining, and industry, to the position of defense minister. We  talked to him about the present situation in Herceg-Bosna, the  tasks of the ministry of defense, the Croat negotiating  position, the future of the Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  many other issues.  <H5>  A Long Chess Game </H5>   [Marusic] Mr. Soljic, there have been many changes following  the session in Livno, Herceg-Bosna. Do these only concern new  people who should improve the former positions, or a fundamental  change of Croatian policies in and toward Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Soljic] Many reporters attended the session of the Chamber  of Representatives in Livno, and public reports of the  Presidential Council sessions and the sessions of the Government  of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna are regularly issued.  There are no other facts whereby I could give a more complete  answer to your question than what the aforementioned bodies have  already said about it. I see this whole issue as a chess game  that will be played for a long time, and I cannot give a final  assessment on the basis of one or several moves. The basic aims  of the policies of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, I  believe, Croatian politics as well, will not be questioned. The  Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be certain that every inch of  Croat land is taken into consideration, as is each Croat in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it is simply impossible to satisfy each  individual interest here -- as not all Russians will live in  Russia, all Germans in Germany, or all Serbs in Serbia, so not  all Croats will live in the Republic of Croatia or in the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna, but, with the existence of the Croat  state and the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, the freedom and  the rights of all the Croats outside these areas will be  guaranteed. We will achieve the maximum possible in this  situation.    [Marusic] Let us summarize: The Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna (after all) remains the foundation-stone of  Croatian policies in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Soljic] That is our orientation, and it will not change.  There is no sovereignty without territory.    [Marusic] Nevertheless, many, particularly the opposition,  which has been especially hard on the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna policies, have assessed the placing of Boban's  mandate "at the disposal of the present" as the defeat and ruin  of a policy -- the policy of the "Herzegovinian lobby," as they  like to say. Mr. Budisa's [president of the Croatian Social  Liberal Party] comment was that "the Herzegovinians do not  realize that Yugoslavia has fallen to ruins, but that they will  still not live in Croatia."    [Soljic] I would like to send all those who disagree with  the policies of Herceg-Bosna, and who question this idea, to  central Bosnia, so that they can ask the Croats there if they  support Herceg-Bosna and if they mind the "Herzegovinian lobby."  As far as Budisa's statement is concerned, it is possible that  Herzegovinians will not be in Croatia -- it is one of the  realistic variants. However, if the Croatian state exists, they  will be freer than they have ever been. Otherwise, the  positions of part of the opposition is quite unfair, whenever  the Croats in Herceg-Bosna are at issue. If they do not  appreciate the contribution of the Croats of Herceg- Bosna and  Bosnia-Herzegovina to the fact that the Croatian state exists,  and that it will exist, then there is nothing to discuss there.  We have shown how much we love Croatia at the referendum, when  we simply voted against our common sense -- for Bosnia-  Herzegovina, just so that Croatia could exist. It is sad that  whoever does not bear that in mind, appreciate and respect it,  should declare themselves a Croat.    [Marusic] You have been elected defense minister from among  very strong competition. Certain circles were somewhat  surprised by your nomination. What is your position on that,  and what is the truth about your appointment to the position of  defense minister? Can a successful businessperson be a  successful defense minister?    [Soljic] I would not like to talk about the reasons for my  appointment -- those who elected me should talk about that. I  can only say that I am honored. Both those who held this  position before me, and those who could have been appointed  instead of me are people who are implementing a program. I am  certain that I will find a way to have all of them help me in  carrying out this task, which, at the moment, is the most  important one for all of us. I belong to neither a formal  party, nor to any non-formal group. I do not agree with any  division of Croats on a regional or any other basis, other than  that concerning whether a person supports our general policies,  whether they work and want to work, and nothing else. The  answer to the second part of your question is yes -- I will do  my best, and let others talk about the results. If I or someone  else decides that I am not carrying out my duties  satisfactorily, there will be ways of solving that. I will  accept it as reality, because any job in politics is a seasonal  one: Everyone who is elected will either be replaced, or their  mandate will expire.   <H5>    More Rights Than the Mojahedin </H5>   [Marusic] What do you intend to do when you begin your  duties -- will you start from where your predecessor left off,  or with something completely new? What has not worked so far,  and how should it be corrected?    [Soljic] I never start from the assumption that the world  starts with me, and I respect what has been done well, but I  will try to improve what has not been done well. Reorganization  is under way, and I believe we will complete it successfully. I  do not want to analyze the causes of certain mistakes -- I can  only say that many of them were made for objective reasons --  from entering the fight spontaneously to certain people growing  tired and the fighting becoming complicated.... I cannot say  that it has been bad, it is just that the circumstances have  changed, and a new organization needs to be found for the new  circumstances, for which we will need new people.    [Marusic] How do you view the frequent accusations in the  past several months concerning open military involvement of the  HVO in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Soljic] I have not met either a formation or an individual  whose superior is anyone other than myself. Defending the  territories of Herceg-Bosna is the moral right of the citizens  of the Republic of Croatia -- our citizens did the same at the  beginning of the war in Croatia. However, we are not asking  them to, and we will not do so, because there is no need. There  are enough Croats who are originally from Herceg-Bosna and want  to come to Herceg-Bosna from Croatia and defend their homeland.  They have much more right to do so than, for instance, the  Mojahedin. Let the same hold for us and the others.    [Marusic] What are the chances of peace in Mostar? Whose  city will it be, and what about the establishment of a  protectorate?    [Soljic] For, when the question arises what the capital of  the "Serb republic" is, or what the capital of the Muslim people  is, there are not many dilemmas, I would like to ask everyone  who has a different opinion what the capital of the Croats in  Bosnia- Herzegovina is indeed. There is no other possible  answer than the city of Mostar, since the Croats, too, have the  right to a city that has a university, an airport, and the rest  of the city infrastructure. Therefore, Mostar will remain the  capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. As far as  concerns the citizens of Mostar who are of Serb or Muslim  nationality, I believe that Mostar can offer them more as  capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna than as a city in  any other republic. We will try to find a satisfactory solution  for the coexistence of all three peoples in these areas. There  will be no coexistence on the basis of brotherhood and unity,  but only on the basis of partnership. In all this, the  establishment of a protectorate represents another goodwill  gesture on the part of the Croats.    [Marusic] Lately there have been many meetings of the Croat  and Muslim representatives (Frankfurt, Washington), and the  ceasefire agreement has been signed by generals Roso and Delic.  However, reports from the ground still talk of new Muslim  attacks.    [Soljic] There have been many cease-fire agreements.  Judging by experience, I am not sure this signature will be the  right one. Nevertheless, one cease-fire must be the right one.  However, the situation in which there are three players is very  complicated, and in these areas there is also the conflict of  interest of the superpowers and the neighboring countries. Try  as we might, it is not only up to us to decide. However, much  depends on our power. There is no such criterion, if applied the  same way to all, that would leave the Croats unsatisfied. The  Croats simply never had the intention to take what does not  belong to them.    [Marusic] Under the pressure of the United States, the  existence of Bosnia-Herzegovina is viewed exclusively through  the alliance of Croats and Muslims. It seems that the  international community is prepared to acknowledge the results  of the Serb aggression. Do you believe in the restoration of  the Croat-Muslim alliance?    [Soljic] Generally speaking, it is wrong to talk of a single  solution in politics. As far as the international community is  concerned, it simply recognizes force or power to a greater or  lesser extent, and this will be the case with the results of the  Serb aggression. That is certain already. It will perhaps not  be to the extent the Serbs expect, but as soon as aggression is  acknowledged, it is a bad sign. Regarding the latest proposals  for a federation/confederacy, I think that the representatives  of the Croat people will be able to find a satisfactory  solution. Indeed, when there is a war, it is difficult to  discuss an alliance or friendship. However, a way will have to  be found of living one next to another, or one with another --  that is a matter of politics. The Croat experience of life in a  community has mostly been bad. However, I think that a way will  be found that will suit the Croat people best and that is  possible in this situation.  <H5>  We Will Stop All Offensives </H5>   [Marusic] If these peace initiatives fail, it is certain  that in the next few weeks the great spring Muslim offensive,  which has been announced, will follow. Will the HVO be able to  defend the Croat territories if this offensive occurs?    [Soljic] There should be no doubt about the defense of the  Croat territories. We were able to stop one of the most  powerful armies with hunting guns and tanks at Siroki Brijeg  with our bare hands, and there should be no doubt about whether  we can stop a Muslim offensive. We are certainly capable of  doing so. The weakness that occurred at the beginning of the  conflict with the Muslims, when we entered it unprepared for a  classic Muslim betrayal, cannot happen again. The Croat people  can be certain that these territories will be defended.</p>

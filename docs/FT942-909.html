			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Airtours' prospects on the line - Other Companies Airtours, the tour group, is due to report first-half results today, with pre-tax losses expected to be about Pounds 18m after a profit of Pounds 3.5m from disposal of fixed assets. This compares with a loss of Pounds 6.9m last time before the expenses of Airtours' failed bid for its rival Owners Abroad. The loss will occasion no surprise as travel companies usually make seasonal first-half losses. Nor will the size of the loss be unexpected: Airtours said it would not exceed Pounds 18m when it launched a rights issue in April. The increased loss will largely reflect the winter losses of acquisitions. More significant will be what the group has to say about summer bookings and the prospect of a price war.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Arts: Successful music in Montpellier - Ronald Crichton finds that the concert performance of Reyer's opera 'Sigurd' provided the climax to the Radio France Festival Each summer Radio France alights in Montpellier with an array of musical offerings to enhance the already well-stocked musical programme of this city  -ancient, handsome and thriving, so successfully blending old and new. Unlike some British towns which are forced to house the arts, in or out of festival time, in unsuitable buildings, Montpellier is well furnished. Tucked away in the Corum, a modern complex built partly on a slope and consisting largely of different levels with wide foyers faced and floored with pink granite, connecting escalators and staircases, is the two-seasons-old opera house, the Salle Berlioz. Large, friendly, relaxing, it is used for concerts as well as opera. There is a smaller theatre, the old Comedie, proudly sited at the end of a wide boulevard. This year Radio France brought enough material for 20 broadcasts spread over five weeks. Concerts included a cycle of Beethoven piano concertos with Brendel and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under Marriner. Among the less familiar things I caught a strange concert given in the Cour Jacques Coeur, a useful open-air space behind the prestigious Musee Fabre. Strange, because the two organisations which joined forces to give it, the Montpellier-Moscow Soloists and the New European Strings, both anxious to widen their repertories, chose two works either one of which might have added the spice of novelty but together made an unenlivening evening. Not the fault of the sound, well founded string playing, quite free of the wispy undernourished scrape often associated with string tone in the open air. Bernstein's Serenade is a series of platonic dialogues for solo violin, strings and percussion based on the Symposium. The five movements, worked with Bernstein's usual skill, cannot, for all their eclectic pleasantries, fail to remind one that after-dinner speeches are usually too many and too long. Dmitry Sitkovetsky was the soloist, Leo Winland conducted. After the interval Sitkovetsky reappeared as conductor, to introduce the Carmen Suite for strings and percussion by Rodian Shchedrin, composer of the ballet The little humpbacked horse. The Carmen Suite is also a ballet, written for the dancer Maya Plisetskaya, whose formidable technique and flamboyant personality may well have distracted attention from the tiresome tweakings and reshufflings of Bizet's tunes strung out in 13 movements, and from the banal percussion writing. Operas this year included an open-air staging of Morlacchi's Barber of Seville and several concert performances, among them Rienzi, Strauss's Daphne, Puccini's Le villi and, as a climax in the last week, Reyer's Sigurd. The last-named will be repeated during the coming season, not in concert but staged, with a partly different cast. Heralded by broadcasts and a good recording under Rosenthal, Sigurd's time seems to have come again. By now the old, misleading label 'Frenchified Wagner' stuck on during the years of neglect that succeeded initial, prolonged success, must surely have been replaced. And neglect was never total: as record collectors know, the main soprano and tenor arias turn up again and again. As for the Wagner question, Reyer's librettists, who started first, worked from a different version of the Scandinavian legends drawn on by Wagner for The Ring. The main musical influence is not Wagner but Berlioz, of whom Reyer was a loyal disciple and friend. One notable feature of Sigurd is the amount of magic spectacle, recalling the palmy day of Lully and Quinault. The spectacular element can easily be overlooked in a concert performance. Librettos were available but with house lights too low for easy reading, I wonder how many of the large audience learned about the three Norns, not singers, but dancers, transformed into swans to draw in a crystal skiff the hero Sigurd and Odin's daughter Brunehild (whom he has awakened from magic sleep) all the way from Iceland to Worms on the Rhine, where she will wed Gunther, King of the Burgundians. A dancing throng of elves, pixies and kobolds bids them farewell. The conductor, Gunter Neuhold from Karlsruhe, replaced the deceased Gianfranco Masini. Reyer's first act is leisurely, in need of firmer propulsion. Indeed the whole opera needed an extra dose of conviction - this will no doubt come with the staging later on. Meanwhile Neuhold and the Montpellier Philharmonic showed how much delightful, romantic orchestral writing there is in Sigurd The title-role was sung by Chris Merrit. The readiness and address with which this artist undertakes one after another of the great 19th century tenor roles compels admiration. On this occasion, alas, the top of the voice was not obedient and the steadiness demanded by Sigurd's clarion phrases was not always forthcoming. Lower down the stave one could hear how well Merritt understands the style. The much-praised Valerie Millot sang Brunehild. She has a lovely presence and a lovely, lyrical voice without, so far, the declamatory grandeur of, say, a Lubin or a Crespin. Deeper experience of the role will surely bring what was lacking. The most polished singing came from the baritone Monte Pederson as Gunther - every word clear, shaming some of Reyer's compatriots. As his sister Hilda (confusing name for the character we know better as Gutrune), Michele Lagrange was warmly sympathetic. As Hilda's witch-like mother Uta, Helene Jossoud produced pinched, ugly tone with no understandable words. Marcel Vanaud and Alain Vernhes sang the Priest of Odin and Hagen. As the Bard, Woytek Smilek made the most of his single scene. The combined choruses of the Montpellier Opera and the Operas du Rhin made a hearteningly sonorous contribution to an evening for which, in spite of weaknesses here and there, one was grateful. Radio 3 will broadcast this Sigurd during the coming autumn.</p>

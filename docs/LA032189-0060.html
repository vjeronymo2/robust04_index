			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP CALLS GOVERNOR'S ENVIRONMENTAL VETOES A RECORD  </P> <P> There was a substantial increase last year in the number of environmental  protection bills passed by the Legislature, but more than 60% of those bills  were vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, a leading environmental lobbying group  reported Monday.  </P> <P> The California League of Conservation Voters, after consulting with the state's  largest environmental organizations, gave generally high marks to the  Legislature, which passed 20 bills supported by conservationists. That was more  than double the number of environmentally oriented bills passed in 1987.  </P> <P> Among last year's successful bills was a landmark overhaul of California's  Clean Air Act, granting wide authority to local air pollution control districts  to reduce emissions from cars and industry. Other measures cited by the group  were aimed at strengthening the motor vehicle inspection program and  identifying the causes and effects of acid rain.  </P> <P> Although Deukmejian signed these bills, the league called 1988 a "record year"  for vetoes of environmental legislation.  </P> <P> Of the 20 environmental bills passed by the Legislature, 12 were vetoed by the  governor. These include measures to prohibit oil drilling in state waters off  Mendocino and Humboldt counties and ban chlorofluorocarbons, a group of  chemicals found in aerosols and other manufactured products, which are linked  to the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer.  </P> <P> "At no point had we seen a year when 20 (environmental) bills reached the  governor's desk," said Lucy Blake, the league's executive director. "We  consider the Legislature quite prolific, perhaps in response to the tremendous  public concern over the environment." But, Blake added, Deukmejian "really has  not been much of an ally in Sacramento."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Record Defended  </P> <P> A spokesman for the governor did not dispute the league's figures, but defended  Deukmejian's environmental record. "If the governor vetoes a bill, there must  be a good reason," said Deukmejian Press Secretary Kevin Brett. "The record  speaks for itself. We consider this Administration's record on environmental  issues to be one of the great untold stories."  </P> <P> In a radio address broadcast on Saturday, Deukmejian cited a recent report by a  national environmental organization, Renew America, which ranked California  first in the nation for the quality of its environmental programs. And he took  a swipe at the press, contending that environmental "good news often gets  little coverage."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Report Card'  </P> <P> In coming up with its environmental "report card," the league considered bills  dealing with air pollution, land use, coastal protection, solid waste disposal,  timber harvesting, toxics, water pollution and wildlife. Other votes were  considered as well, including confirmation votes on Deukmejian's unsuccessful  nomination of then Rep. Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach) as state treasurer.  The league considered Lungren to be an anti-environmental lawmaker.  </P> <P> The league is one of many groups that ranks lawmakers and the governor on a  variety of issues. But unlike many of the others, the league's study is  distributed to an estimated 100,000 Californians during door-to-door  canvassing. The group also takes a direct hand in legislative election  campaigns.  </P> <P> According to the league's tally, Deukmejian vetoed four of nine environmental  bills sent to his desk in 1987, five of 13 passed in 1986, six of 11 in 1985,  six of 12 in 1984 and two of eight in 1983.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Environmental Awareness  </P> <P> Blake said the record shows California's reputation for environmental awareness  stems more from policies put in place by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. than  from any initiatives taken by Deukmejian. "Many of these programs actually have  managed to sidestep efforts by the Deukmejian Administration to roll back on  the environment," she said.  </P> <P> The league also issued ratings for state legislators, based on their votes on  environmental issues. In the Assembly, 14 members, all Democrats, were given  100% scores, including Los Angeles County lawmakers Terry Friedman of Tarzana,  Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, Richard Katz of Sepulveda, Burt Margolin of Los  Angeles and Lucille Royball-Allard of Los Angeles. The lowest score went to  Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Signal Hill), who scored 4%.  </P> <P> In the Senate, six members, again all Democrats, received 100% scores. Half of  those were from Los Angeles County -- Herschel Rosenthal, Art Torres and Diane  Watson. Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield) received the lowest score in the  Senate, 39%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL RATINGS OF O.C. LEGISLATORS  </P> <P> The California League of Conservation Voters on Monday rated the members of the  state Legislature for their votes on 34 issues of interest to environmentalists  during 1988. Here is how the 13 members of Orange County's delegation were  ranked:  </P> <TABLE CWL="5.08IN:3.21IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> % of Time Voted  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Member  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> "Pro-Environment"  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> SENATE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marian Bergeson(R-Newport Beach)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 74%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> William Campbell(R-Hacienda Heights)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (see note)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cecil N.

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Arts: Sympathies with the Soviet - A look at the current exhibition at MOMA, Oxford For the Museum of Modern Art at Oxford to call its latest exhibition, Engineers of the Human Soul, is to pitch it a shade too strong. It may catch the eye, but it can hardly be held to signal a unique and isolated phenomenon. What, after all, do we imagine religious art, or any official or publicly commissioned art, was trying to do in every age? This does not make this exhibition any the less interesting or worthwhile: only the more particular. The subtitle, 'Soviet Socialist Realist Painting 1930-1970', supplies the particular gloss. Here are characteristic examples of the art that was officially acceptable in the Soviet Union, from the time that Josef Stalin first imposed his dreadful rule, continuing on through the comparative thaw in official attitudes in the years following his death, and so on into the early years of Brezhnev's regime. But even so, what we have is not altogether what we might have expected. There are indeed some odd and awful things, dire enough to fuel any prejudice: the usual hagiographies of Lenin and Stalin; the workers in field and factory happy in the service of the workers' state; the image of parenthood as public duty; and the lovers who stride out so confident into the socialist future. Most sinister of all we have Grigori Shegal's 'Leader, Teacher, Friend' of 1937, a modestly smiling Stalin slipping quietly onto the podium behind the speaker, at the very time of the show trials and the greatest terror. But even here we must be careful to distinguish between the form and the content, and face the awkward truth that the most dreadful lies and blackest politics may be propagated rather well. Some of the works are frankly bad, 'They are writing about us in Pravda', as it were picnic-time on the collective farm, is as crude and mawkish in execution as in sentiment. If mockery is what one enjoys, there is plenty to mock. The truth is, however, that even that sinister Stalin is done - within its terms  - with creditably competent panache. Vruir Mosesov's somewhat later and larger composition of Stalin leading a demonstration in 1912 (1949) is technically as sound a history painting as we might have had from any Salon or Academy of the 19th century. Intense and alien though her actual commitment may seem to us, Vyacheslav Mariupolski's 'Young Leader of the Pioneers' (1949), reading out her lecture with all the seriousness of youth, is as well observed, well executed and touching an image of a girl as any from more politically acceptable a hand, as though Millais had lived on to paint a Girl Guide in her best uniform. It is not quite that it is old-fashioned, but there attaches to so much of the work a decided flavour of the past, yet still active and vigorous. This is especially true of the greater portion of the work that is political, that is to say socialist, only in the broadest sense. Much of the work on show dates, in any case, from the 1950s and the milder, post-Stalinist cultural climate. None of these artists were dissident: all accepted the constraints imposed through their union, most of them never knowing any other dispensation. No matter that they had no choice: the fact is that, cut off from the later developments of modernism, they remained active within the broader encompassing realism of the western tradition, extending through a generalised post-impressionism to incipient expressionism. So it is that with 'Pushkin meeting Kyukhelbeker' by Aleksei Merzlyakov (1957), we have something neither more nor less histrionic than, shall we say, Lady Butler's Crimean 'Roll Call', or any other romantic Victorian reworking of history. 'The Gingerbread Arcade' by Vladimir Stozharov (1956) carries no historic nor political charge at all, but is simply a painting of a provincial market-place in muddy mid-winter that we might take as easily as by one of the masters of the Hague School, or a Scottish social realist of the 1870s and '80s. Mai Dantsig's girl hanging out the washing in the sun (1965) and Aleksei and Sergei Tkachev's 'Postgirl' (1951) are vigorous and engaging examples of academic post-impressionism. Eduard Bragoviski's woman by the river, 'Logging on the Vetluga' (1964), she foursquare in her scarlet coat against the red landscape, is far more honest and straight-forward a composition than anything of our western neo-expressionism of the 1980s. (It is just such stuff, straight-forward, well-crafted, variously academic in the best sense and for the most part quietly apolitical, that Roy Miles has been bringing onto the London market at his Bruton Street Gallery, and his latest show is no exception.) But even were it to be overtly political, there is not necessarily a problem. Our luck has been that no significant art came out of Nazi Germany, and it has too-long been fashionable to laugh socialist realism out of court, similarly high-minded and utopian propaganda as it is. The virtue of this serious and fascinating loan exhibition at Oxford (30 Pembroke Street, until March 15: supported by Visiting Arts and what was the Artists' Union of the Soviet Union) is that it makes us address ourselves to a central feature of our own art in the 20th century. What, really, is the difference in principle between Ekaterina Zernova's 'Tank-driver Kuznetsov' (1933) and a portrait by Eric Kennington of a British Airman of the Second World War: what between the furnaces of the Stalin Factory by Mikhail Kostin (1949) and Stanley Spencer's paintings of the war-time ship-builders on the Clyde, or Laura Knight's 'Ruby Loftus screwing a breech-ring'? Can it be that what is bare-faced propaganda to one side is no more than cheer and encouragement to the other in difficult times? The moral dilemma remains, but it is only fair to admit as much when it is well done.</p>

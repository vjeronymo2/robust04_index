			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- The Israeli and  Ukrainian foreign ministers, Shim'on Peres and Anatoliy Zlenko,  held a joint news conference today at Ukraine's Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. Zlenko, in particular, said the development of  relations between the two countries has deep roots. "To many  sons and daughters of the Jewish people, Ukraine has become a  homeland encouraging the evolution of their talent. We regret  that some of the best and most highly qualified professionals  are leaving Ukraine. Our country does not object to the natural  process of Jewish emigration as long as it proceeds in a  civilized manner," Anatoliy Zlenko said.    The Ukrainian foreign minister underscored his country's  readiness to contribute to ending confrontation in the Middle  East region on a multilateral basis within the framework of the  United Nations.    Shim'on Peres said this was his first visit to Ukraine and  he  could see differences between the situation in Ukraine and the  way it is described by some of the mass media. He expressed the  opinion that cooperation in the sphere of culture and business  could be particularly fruitful.    As for Ukraine's role in settling Middle East issues,  Shim'on  Peres emphasized that Israel would welcome Ukraine's possible  participation in the peace process in the Middle East region.    As far the Crimean issue is concerned, the Israeli foreign  affairs minister underscored that Israel has already expressed  its support for the Ukrainian Government's policy and that  position remains unchanged.    Shim'on Peres also said that he will stay in Ukraine for one  more day and on 17 June will visit Odessa where, he said,  Israel's consulate is to open in the very near future.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Chile's President Augusto Pinochet said his lame-duck military government and  the opposition have agreed on democratic changes in the nation's constitution.  The accord came after two months of unprecedented negotiations and paved the  way for a national referendum, probably in August, to approve the amendments.  Patricio Aylwin, leader of a 17-party opposition coalition, said the reforms  "open the road for an orderly transition to a fully democratic regime."  Pinochet, who was defeated in a plebiscite last October, would say only that  the reforms include changes that will make it easier for the new Congress to  approve further constitutional alterations.  </P></p>

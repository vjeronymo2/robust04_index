			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Foreign Affairs: Europe's teetering pillar - The French are resisting Nato leaders' efforts to modify the continent's defence arrangements The French government, I discovered on a recent visit to Paris, is strongly against building a 'European pillar' of Nato, and is determined to thwart British efforts to use the Western European Union (WEU) for that purpose. Although it has joined in discussions on the Nato strategy review, it does not like the way these discussions are going and has no intention of joining any integrated Nato command structure, still less any of the 'multinational corps' promised by Nato leaders in their London Declaration last year. For President Francois Mitterrand, it seems, only two things are important. One is the Atlantic alliance, which he sees as the essential reality of European security today. He believes it works well as it is. France's performance in the Gulf war showed, according to French officials, that you do not need to be part of the integrated command in peacetime to function as a good ally in war. France, they point out, has always accepted that, in a war with the Soviet Union, the US would take command. Without that, in their view, there would be no US nuclear guarantee - and therefore France is against the idea, sometimes canvassed by Americans, of having a European as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (Saceur). But, they say, the only rationale for having an integrated command in peacetime was to enable Nato to respond quasi-automatically to a surprise attack. The proposal for multinational corps tends to reinforce this 'automaticity' at the very time when the diminution of Soviet conventional forces, and their withdrawal from eastern Europe, are making a surprise attack impossible. In future crises, the French argue, there will be time for political consultation, and it will be absolutely necessary. As an example, they cite the German experience in January, when German aircraft were called on, as part of the joint mobile force permanently assigned to Allied Command Europe, to defend Turkey against possible Iraqi retaliation for US attacks from Turkish bases, about which Germany had not been consulted. France does not want its political options to be foreclosed in this way by the 'automatic' involvement of its forces. So France's ideal alliance, in theory, would be one with no integrated military command in peacetime. Nato's military committee (composed of national chiefs-of-staff) would 'resume its preponderant place', with the task of proposing military solutions to the North Atlantic Council. The military command would be adapted to the particular solution chosen in any given crisis. This arrangement would give all Nato members the same freedom of action that France now enjoys. Whether the French would really welcome it, one may doubt. Had the US, Britain and others not been used to working together in Nato - indeed, had France not been used to liaising with Nato command for practical purposes - the allied performance in the Gulf might have been very different. However, the French know their suggestions are in no danger of being accepted, and they insist that France is not demanding anything: if others want to reinforce the integrated command that is their affair. France is quite happy with the alliance as it is. The other thing Mr Mitterrand cares about is, of course, Europe: the future European Union. He accepts that this cannot be implemented today, but insists that when finished it must have competence in defence as well as foreign and security policy. France wants this written into the treaty on European political union, since to leave it out would imply 'a Europe of limited sovereignty'. If WEU can be gradually developed into the defence arm of the European Union, well and good. But the French will not accept it as a 'pillar' of Nato, nor yet as a 'bridge' between Nato and the EC. 'To build a bridge you need two banks,' they say, 'and the European bank does not yet exist.' The Dutch and British are accused of wanting to 'absorb Europe into Nato'. But the main argument is seen as being between France and Britain. The French are confident that the Germans, Italians, Spanish and Belgians are all on side; they consider that Portugal will go along with whatever Britain decides; and they speak with scorn of the Dutch desire to have things all ways at once: pacifism, a supranational Europe, and defence run by the US. On one point, at least, France and Britain are agreed: foreign and security policy is too important to be handed over to supranational institutions. These aspects of European Union will be kept firmly inter-governmental, much to the disgust of Mr Jacques Delors. As might be expected, the French bristle with indignation at the round robin sent to European governments in February by Mr Reginald Bartholomew, a senior US state department official, warning Europe not to set up any kind of caucus which might pre-empt Nato decisions. In general, the French reject as 'childish blackmail' any argument that Europeans should abstain from a given course of action in order not to isolate or alienate the Americans. They stick to the old Gaullist view on this point: the US is in Europe for its own interests, not out of sentiment. Any conceivable US president will want to keep it there, and Europeans should not be taken in by any threats. Yet in the same breath they say that Europe must eventually be ready to assume its own defence, because it would be unwise to count on the Americans being here for ever. This contradiction is reconciled by reference to the US Congress, which in French eyes seems to be a mysterious, elemental force, unpredictable and quite unamenable to European influence. Here, no doubt, lies the key to Franco-British differences. The British see, or think they see, the US from inside, and believe their actions can have some effect on its political processes. The French think, or pretend to think, that this is quite pointless, and that Europe should be prepared for the worst even while hoping for the best. Ironically enough this attitude brings the French very close to the US position on the substance of the immediate point at issue: they don't want any 'European caucus' within Nato either. Senior military figures in France are even sceptical about the idea, fashionable in some European circles, of a WEU 'rapid reaction force' for use outside the Nato area. Talk of 'double hatting' this force, to make it available also for use by Nato in an appropriate context, arouses French suspicions that it is yet another British wheeze to inveigle them back into the Nato structure. From all this I deduce that the prospects for any concrete manifestation of Europe's much-touted 'defence identity' are less good than they looked a month or two ago. While Britain and Holland drag their feet for fear of upsetting the Americans, the French will drag theirs for fear of setting up something which would reinforce American hegemony. Probably Britain will compromise to the extent of allowing some vague phrase in the treaty on European political union to the effect that defence is not excluded, on the understanding that nothing will actually be done. Meanwhile Nato will restructure itself in some diminished and rather undramatic form; the WEU will confine itself to co-ordinating marginal European contributions to American-led operations outside Europe; and nothing much will happen until the next crisis. But of course that could be tomorrow.</p>

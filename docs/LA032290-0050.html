			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> UPLAND;  </P> <P> NO CHARGES FILED IN BOY'S DEATH  </P> <P> Citing insufficient evidence, prosecutors on Wednesday said they will not file  criminal charges against two young men who had been suspected of killing a  9-year-old boy.  </P> <P> Wayne O. Hobbs, 19, and Richard LaLonde, 18, had been suspected in the murder  of Jason Matthew Lea of Upland, whose partly decomposed body was found last  Aug. 4 at the bottom of a cliff near the Mt. Baldy ski area. "While witnesses  place the suspects in the company of the victim earlier in the evening of his  disappearance, there is no evidence linking the suspects to his death," Pomona  Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Hearnsberger wrote in a memo. Jason disappeared July 29  after leaving home on his bicycle.  </P></p>

Fedorenko, Dnepropetrovsk Scientific Research Institute  for the Recovery and Analysis of Ability to Work Among the  Disabled; UDC 617.7-053.5/477/-072]    [Abstract] In order to identify the contingent of students  from senior classes in Ukraine who have eye pathologies and need  special medical and social care, the researchers here used  traditional clinical and ophthalmological methods to examine  5,786 eighth- and ninth-grade students from 11 public education  schools, seven special schools for the blind and vision  impaired, and two schools for the deaf and hearing impaired in  11 oblasts. Their examinations indicated that 89 percent of the  school children have essentially healthy eyes and no  contraindications for any of various kinds of production work.  Such students included those with uncorrected visual acuity of  0.6-0.8 and corrected acuity of 1.0. Only a small percentage of  students in the public schools (0.2 percent) had pronounced  visual problems, i.e., corrected visual acuity of 0.5 or lower  in the better eye. That represents some 1,500 students  graduating from the ninth grade each year. In all, 6.3 percent  of those who graduate need some correction of their vision.  Myopia is the pathology most frequently encountered among the  public school students; those with severe myopia, however,  account for only 0.2 percent of the graduating students.  Virtually all the students found to have severe eye problems  were from the special schools. References 10: 9 Russian, 1  Western.</p>

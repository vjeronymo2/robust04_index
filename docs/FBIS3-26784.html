			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] President Li Teng-hui began an eight-day Southeast  Asian tour Wednesday [9 February] despite a warning against the  trip by Beijing. The diplomatically sensitive trip, which takes  Li to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, is designed to  strengthen Taiwan's economic and political ties with the three  countries in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.    An official statement released by the presidential office  Wednesday said the main purpose of the president's unofficial  visit is to learn from other's experience as the reference for  the ROC economic development in the 21st century, adding that Li  will have unofficial contacts with leaders in the region  touching [on] views on regional economic cooperation and matters  of major concern.    Li arrived at the former U.S. naval base at Subic Bay in the  Philippines at 1045 where he made a three-hour visit and held  informal talks with the Philippine President Fidel Ramos over a  luncheon, the semiofficial CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY reported.    The tour is Li's second overseas trip since assuming office  in 1988. He visited Singapore in 1989, the first time a  president of the Republic of China had gone abroad in 12 years.    After leaving the Philippines, the president's chartered  plane landed in Indonesia's resort island of Bali Wednesday  evening where he planned to discuss the development of natural  gas and oil reserves. Among other projects was President  Suharto of Indonesia and tour Indonesia's aerospace center.  [sentence as received] During his visit in Indonesia, he will  also meet with Indonesia's Research and Technology Minister  Habibie for talks focusing on the development of Bantam, an  island south of Singapore which Jakarta is developing as an  industrial zone, the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY reported. Li was  accompanied by the ROC First Lady Tseng Wen-hui and about 40  officials including Frederick Chien, minister of foreign  affairs; Vincent Siew, chairman of the Council for Economic  Planning and Development; Raymond Tai, presidential spokesman;  Jeffrey Wu, an adviser to the Executive Yuan; and Liu Ta-yi, an  adviser to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, according to  officials.    The presidential delegation will then travel to Phuket, in  Thailand, on 14th February to meet with Thai prime minister, the  local press reported.    Taiwan is already one of the biggest foreign investors in  Southeast Asia, pouring in more than $10 billion so far. Li's  trip is also seen by local analysts as a part of the  government's recently-announced southward policy designed to  promote economic and trade ties with ASEAN countries in order to  release Taiwan's dependence on Mainland China.    The Philippine President Fidel Ramos said Thursday that  meeting with the ROC President Li Teng-hui does not violate the  one-China principle practiced by his country, and the meeting  with President Li was a very valuable time when the ideas and  issues were discussed informally in the meeting, he said, and  they were able to discuss further proceedings for the ROC  investment in the Philippines. Ramos was also able to verify  the date for the construction work to begin in the Taiwanese  industrial zone within the Subic Bay. Ramos emphasized this  project is of great importance to the development of the Subic  Bay. The two sides have also consented to have the third  economic cooperation meeting taking place in Subic Bay in June  this year.    Meanwhile, as President Li arrived in Bali island in  Indonesia, great interest was also aroused among the local  media. Indonesia's newspapers quoted words from Indonesia's  Foreign Minister Alatas that the ROC President Li Teng-hui as a  Ph.D. in agricultural economy and not representing his official  position as the president of the Republic of China. [sentence as  received] Indonesia therefore is not violating the one-China  policy with the Mainland China.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GETTING OUR GOATEES -- AS THE BEAT GOES CHIC  </P> <P> Tufts of fashion whimsy are sprouting on the faces of Los Angeles'  men-about-town. Goatees, those small, carefully crafted beards popularized by  such disparate characters as Mephistopheles and Maynard Krebs in the 1960s TV  show "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," are making a comeback. Mixing beatnik  and biker chic, they've become a definite fashion look.  </P> <P> Traditionally, a goatee resembles a goat's beard in its pointed shape that  covers only the chin area. But this basic form has been widely interpreted over  time. Hairdresser Steve Renteria, who works at the Hair Loft, says the most  popular variation is the Van Dyke, where mustache and beard connect. And, he  notes, maintaining a goatee requires a close, daily shave as well as a weekly  trim.  </P> <P> Photographer John Ragel, assistant to celebrity portraitist Annie Leibovitz,  says his goatee has a certain gritty appeal, but "women hate it."  </P> <P> A quick survey confirms his claim that women dislike goatees. But local gossip  columnist Janet Charlton disagrees. "There's something infinitely wicked about  goatees," she says. "A well-clipped goatee is so refined. It shows that a man  takes care in how he looks."  </P> <P> Ken Sylvester, a self-described jack-of-all-trades whose beard was inspired by  Vincent Price, says his girlfriend is a major supporter of his look but adds,  "It's weird, she hates beards but loves goatees." The object of his hairy  affection, magazine editorial assistant Suzi Joi Kiefer, explains: "It makes  him look so sinister."  </P></p>

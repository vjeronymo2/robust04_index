			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: Set free from its tomb of lava - Susan Moore on an exhibition which opened in London this week ON THE morning of August 24 in 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted. Pliny the Younger, living in nearby Misenum, left a harrowing account of the awful darkness that 'came rolling over the land after us like a torrent'. Hit by showers of volcanic debris, earthquakes and asphyxiating gases, Pompeii, together with Oplontis and Stabiae to the east, were submerged under pumice-stone and ash. To the west, Herculaneum was engulfed by volcanic mud that solidified to form a stone cover 10 metres thick. These provincial coastal towns and cities of the Roman empire were transfixed in the first century. They remained more or less undisturbed until 1709 when a chance discovery in Herculaneum prompted the Bourbon kings of Naples to start excavations to recover antique sculpture to adorn their palaces. When Goethe visited Pompeii and Herculaneum, the passages dug by the Bourbon miners could be explored by lamplight, and the discoveries made there were fuelling neo-classicism. Goethe wrote in 1787: 'Many a calamity has happened in the world, but never one that has caused so much entertainment to posterity as this one.' Archaeological research, restoration and maintenance at the Vesuvian sites had been in decline since the 1950s. Walls were crumbling and wall paintings deteriorating. The sites would have deteriorated further if an earthquake in 1980 had not jolted the Italian government into action. In 1981, an special archaeological administration was instituted for the Pompeii area. By 1984, it had substantial - although still insufficient - funds and an energetic soprintendente in Professor Baldassare Conticello. He has masterminded what he describes as a new philosophy for Pompeii; it involves the collaboration of archaeologists, geologists, biologists, botanists, geotechnicians, physicists and even a climatologist. The bonus of computer expertise came when IBM Italy and Fiat Engineering joined forces in 1987-89 to form the Neapolis consortium. It transformed the project by setting up one of the largest ever information technology systems for archaeology, to address the task of preserving, restoring and interpreting Pompeii. First, the whole 140 square-mile area was electronically mapped, to produce a grid on to which other data could be added. That information included over 12,000 catalogue entries of individual finds, and over 8,700 digitised colour images of wall paintings, mosaics and artefacts - thus preserving, electronically at least, Pompeii's most fugitive and precious treasures for posterity. Excavation notebooks dating back to 1862 were committed to disk and, like the Herculaneum papyri, made more legible on the computer screen in the process. Imaging techniques were developed to simulate restoration of damaged wall paintings, allowing restorers to experiment without touching the frescoes themselves. Data on the function of each building has shed light on Pompeii's ancient social, political, religious and commercial life. At the touch of a button, the computer reveals, for example, the existence and whereabouts of a red light district, the distribution of shops and workshops, or even take-aways. On site meanwhile, Conticello inaugurated a systematic restoration of Pompeii from east to west, further excavations and a new museum. A series of publications, exhibitions and concerts raised awareness of the area and brought more visitors and, with them, public funding. Publishing the finds has also protected them. The entire collection of bronze and gold stolen from the deposit at Herculaneum in 1990 was recovered last November, because thieves were unable to find a buyer. The most ambitious and critical consciousness-raising exercise to date is the spectacular travelling exhibition, 'Rediscovering Pompeii'. It comes at a time when digging has stopped and the computer is silent, awaiting a second phase of funding. The show features 200 treasures and artefacts - some only recently brought to light - and demonstrates the role of the Neapolis technology in making the classical world more accessible. After showing at New York, Houston (where is attracted over 350,000 visitors) and Malmo, it opened in London at the Accademia Italiana this week. Ironically, the disaster that totally extinguished life in two days and two nights in the first century also ensured a kind of immortality. Voices resound in streets, houses, baths and open public spaces. Graffiti and inscriptions record sporting triumphs and forthcoming fights, political propaganda, and fierce expressions of love, hate and undying friendship. Casts made from the cavities left by the fugitive Pompeiians make for chilling death masks. Most poignant are those of a family found sheltering in its home. Recently excavated just outside Pompeii's city walls, they show a man raised up on his elbow to shoulder the roof timber that has fallen, cupping his hands to cover the nose and mouth of his pregnant wife beside him. In the exhibition, we find the highly defined contours of a lady from Oplontis who took flight clutching a purse full of coins, rings and gems. That little purse, and other items such as bone dice, a bronze colander, bowls of carbonised olives, figs and prunes, speak as eloquently as any fine marble, bronze or mosaic. A surprising amount survives of gardens as well as houses. Botanists working on the recent excavation of the House of the Chaste Lovers at Pompeii have been able to determine the precise layout and planting (through pollens, seeds and roots) of its formal inner garden. In time this will be reconstructed; meanwhile a larger programme of replanting is under way. The Pompeiian love of greenery is most vividly apparent in the enchanting frescos of a recently excavated garden room that form the centrepiece of the show, richly adorned with luxuriant naturalistic flora and fauna. Pompeii was a thriving commercial city. Oplontis and Herculaneum, in contrast, were graced by the villas of the rich. The former boasts the only surviving ancient wooden furniture (patterned by elaborate geometric marquetry), and the fine wall painting at the supremely elegant villa thought to have belonged to Nero's second wife Poppea. A sequence of open-air rooms, frescoed with abundant foliage and lined with flower beds, eases the transition between garden and house. The garden of Herculaneum's grand Villa of the Stags has supplied much of the finest marble statuary in the show. Its 'Drunken Hercules' is characteristic in its robust earthiness. This Hercules is no conventional hero. He is portrayed peeing, legs spread wide in a desperate attempt to remain vertical.

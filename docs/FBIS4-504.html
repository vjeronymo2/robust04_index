			<p>BFN     [Text] Five-hundred members of the ANC's armed wing,  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; MK], and the PAC's  [Pan-Africanist Congress] military wing, APLA [Azanian People's  Liberation Army], have set aside their differences to undergo  joint training. The soldiers are in the Zimbabwean capital,  Harare, where they are being trained for their incorporation in  the South African Defense Force with the knowledge of the South  African Government. This report from the BBC in Harare.    [Begin recording] [BBC announcer] In the bush of Zimbabwe,  this is the kind of training given to the future members of  South Africa's unified defense force. Five-hundred men and  women have been transformed from the guerrillas of yesterday to  the regular soldiers of tomorrow. Bush fighters who spent their  lives executing hit-and-run raids into South Africa have been  taught how to foil their acts of sabotage which were their stock  and trade. Members of the rival African National Congress and  Pan Africanist Congress have buried their differences to train  side by side.    [MK Commander Siphiwe Nyanda] Well, it's not easy, but it's  something we have to do. At the political level there is  reconciliation, and at the military level as well. We have to  work with our former adversaries. We found that in discussions,  which have been going on up to now, that it's possible that they  are also officers and professionals, and in the near future we  will have to form one defense force.    [APLA Commander David Romero] Yes, there is political will,  more especially on the part of the PAC, and I believe on the  part of the ANC there's also that political will. That's why we  are confident that we will ultimately reach a solution in our  country.    [BBC announcer] They graduated early. Four months' training  was squeezed into three to be ready in time for the elections.  These are the elite -- future senior officers who will command  key posts and confront the difficult task of integrating  soldiers, their former enemies.    [Constantine Chiwange of the Zimbabwe Defense Force] Working  with members of the past regime is not a problem, as long as  they have accepted change, and they accept the fact that a black  majority rule is inevitable. That is not a problem at all. And  of course, once they have outgrown racism, that's not a problem.    [BBC announcer] Many white Zimbabwean soldiers fled their  ranks after independence in 1980, taking their valuable  experience with them. One lesson the Zimbabwean trainers have  taught the South Africans is how to rebuild that knowledge. [end  recording]</p>

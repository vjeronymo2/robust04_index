			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Support for role of unions grows As many as 89 per cent of people surveyed in an NOP poll commissioned by the Trades Union Congress believe trade unions 'are necessary to protect people's interests at work'. This represents a substantial increase on the 79 per cent who agreed with that statement last year. Fifty-eight per cent opposed any further government laws 'to restrict the powers of the trade unions' with 35 per cent backing that suggestion. The survey was based on 1,004 interviews by telephone between August 19 and 21. In a second NOP survey of 500 trade unionists, also commissioned by the TUC, 58 per cent said their job had grown less secure in the last two years and 42 per cent said they were being treated worse by their employer than two years ago. However, 62 per cent of the trade unionists said their colleagues were 'fairly well' treated by their employer and 12 per cent 'very well' treated. The trade unionists' poll found considerable support for the TUC's new campaign agenda. Ninety-two per cent believed the TUC should invite ministers to debate the issues and 93 per cent agreed the TUC needed to seek support from employers' organisations. Fifty-two per cent thought the trade unions should 'make more effort to influence government policy than they do now' and 86 per cent wanted the TUC to lobby MPs of all parties.</p>

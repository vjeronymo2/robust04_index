			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSE SIMPLY BETTING HE'LL BE REINSTATED; PUBLIC DESERVES MORE  </P> <P> A hearty thank you to Ross Newhan for having the guts to say he will not vote  for Pete Rose's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> I had hoped there would be more than one sportswriter who would speak out  before waiting to see how strong public opinion was swinging.  </P> <P> Newhan is right, Rose could have made it easier on himself by showing a little  bit of humility. The fans were ready to give him the benefit of a doubt until  that final inning in front of the TV cameras.  </P> <P> That's when Pete made his last strikeout.  </P> <P> ALLAN BENJAMIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / All-day rail peace talks end TALKS between British Rail and the RMT, the main rail union, to resolve the conflict that has closed the railway network for two one-day strikes in the past fortnight ended last night after nine hours of intensive negotiation. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said that he intended to reflect on BR's final position overnight and report to his executive today. BR described the position last night as 'delicately poised'. 'We believe we have done enough. There has been a flexibility on both sides but the situation remains in the balance,' BR said.' The RMT's leaders have been seeking a guarantee from BR that none of their members will be made compulsorily redundant and that there should be a moratorium on the future use of contract labour. After protracted discussions yesterday evening it appears the two sides have moved much closer together. Details of any final settlement of the dispute were not released last night but BR is hoping that the RMT's executive will agree to what it is proposing. Much depends on how the union's executive responds to what Mr Knapp will tell them today. Pressure for a settlement of the increasingly bitter dispute has grown more intense since Monday's deal between the rail drivers' union Aslef and BR over the issue of the future of the national agreement. The RMT leadership is aware that public opinion - which has so far been sympathetic to the union case over redundancies - could turn hostile if the union does not display a willingness to make a compromise.</p>

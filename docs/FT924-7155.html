			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / MoD to seek Pounds 300m saving THE MINISTRY OF Defence is planning to save between Pounds 250m and Pounds 300m over the next four years by placing contracts in the private sector. Mr Jonathan Aitken, the defence procurement minister, said yesterday that the intended savings would come from improved efficiency as the companies bid for work now conducted in-house by the MoD. Without the contracting out, the MoD would have spent Pounds 1.2bn on these areas, which include vehicle maintenance and accounting. The scheme is about 10 times the size of previous plans to put contracts out to the private sector, a process called 'market testing' by the government. The bidding process has already started for the overhaul of armoured vehicles. Other areas earmarked for market testing include payroll, helicopter maintenance, computer and workshop management, and ship repairs at Portsmouth. 'If it goes well, there are good prospects in the medium and long term for more contracting out,' said Mr Aitken, who presented the scheme to more than 600 industry and union executives in Birmingham yesterday. He said he envisaged the companies which won the contracts using the staff who currently carry out the work. He added that foreign companies might be excluded by UK and European Community rules on defence contracts. Companies that might benefit include FR Group, Hunting, Vickers, GKN and British Aerospace. The MoD's previous efforts at market testing produced savings of up to 25 per cent but were severely criticised in July by the National Audit Office, the spending watchdog. Observer, Page 19</p>

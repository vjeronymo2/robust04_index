			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION LAW SPLIT IMPERILS GERMAN TALKS;  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION: IN THE EAST, THE PROCEDURE IS AVAILABLE ON DEMAND EARLY IN  PREGNANCY. BONN APPLIES RESTRICTIONS.  </P> <P> Differences on the sensitive issue of abortion law in united Germany threatened  Monday to torpedo negotiations on a treaty setting out the political conditions  for unification, which is scheduled for Oct. 3.  </P> <P> Because any agreement at this stage is likely to be only temporary, these  differences, mainly in West Germany, mean that abortion will almost certainly  be one of the hotly debated moral issues in the post-unity years.  </P> <P> Other differences are still to be resolved in the treaty talks, but the  abortion issue is the most problematic, according to some of the people  involved.  </P> <P> After a marathon session broke up early Monday, leaders of the major West  German parties agreed to meet again today. They hope to complete the  negotiations by the end of the week.  </P> <P> The problem centers on how to reconcile East Germany's liberal law, under which  abortion is provided on demand in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with the  West German law, which permits abortions only on limited social and medical  grounds.  </P> <P> All parties agree that both laws should remain in force, at least for a time,  but they disagree sharply on how.  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, under the influence  of the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches, wants the law applied on the  basis of a woman's legal residence, and many West German women believe this to  be highly discriminatory.  </P> <P> They say that a woman in Hamburg, in what is now West Germany, who went to  Dresden, in what is now East Germany, for an abortion could be subject to  criminal prosecution when she got home, although a woman living in Dresden  could have an abortion legally.  </P> <P> Christian Democrats admit that there are contradictions in their stand but  argue that any other compromise would dilute the strength of the law as it  applies in what is now West Germany.  </P> <P> West German Social Democrats, who are the main opposition party, take a harsh  view of the Christian Democratic position.  </P> <P> The Social Democrats propose that both laws continue to stand in the regions  where they now apply, regardless of where an abortion patient lives.  </P> <P> "This is what the majority of women want, it is what the majority in the (West  German) Bundestag want, it is what a majority in the (East German) Volkskammer  want," said Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democrats' candidate for chancellor.  </P> <P> The Social Democrats have said they will veto the unity treaty if Kohl insists  on including the residence rule.  </P> <P> The Christian Democrats have drawn no such line.  </P> <P> Failure to approve the treaty would not stop unification, but it would make the  process messy. Instead of a formal, bilateral accord on the conditions for  merger, there would be a hastily drawn West German law on such matters as  finance, education and property.  </P> <P> Such a bill would need only a simple majority, but it would add to the  impression that the unification process has become more of a West German  takeover.  </P> <P> The East Germans want to keep their liberal abortion law.  </P> <P> There is widespread agreement that a united Germany needs a complete overhaul  of the abortion legislation.  </P> <P> In East Germany, abortion on demand has become commonplace, but the question of  health risk has been raised. About 73,000 abortions were performed last year,  in a country of 16 million people.  </P> <P> In West Germany, a country with four times as many people, the number of legal  abortions was roughly the same.  </P></p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / France unhappy with allies on Algeria France yesterday accused Britain, Germany and the US of failing to crack down on fundamentalist opponents of the Algiers government on their soil. The Dutch, meanwhile, closed their Algiers embassy and Belgium urged its nationals to leave the country after the killing of five French police and consular officials on Wednesday. As the bodies of the French victims were returned home, Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, said Britain, Germany and the US had failed to act when tipped off about the activities of fundamentalists. 'They have within their borders people who claim to be official representatives of the FIS (Islamic Salvation Front),' he said. 'We have already made diplomatic representations to these countries and we will make more.' Mr Pasqua said seven Moslem militants in France had been moved to a remote eastern village. The seven are reported to have been brought together in the village of Folembray, after having been under house arrest in various parts of France. In The Hague, the foreign ministry said the Dutch embassy in Algiers, where staff had already been reduced to three, would close temporarily because of fears for their safety. Belgium strongly advised its nationals to leave the former French territory and said all travel there should be postponed because of the worsening security situation. Violence has grown since the Algerian authorities in January 1992 suspended elections that the FIS was poised to win. More than 50 foreigners and thousands of Algerians have been killed since then. Mr Anwar Haddam, a FIS representative in Washington, yesterday denounced France's support of Algeria's 'military regime'. Mr Pasqua said the Algerian government was 'not a model of democracy', but said that France would help it in its fight against 'terrorism' and that there was no such thing as 'good and bad terrorists'. The US State Department said the latest killings 'only reinforce the concern we have that the (Algerian) government should broaden its political dialogue' to opposition groups that reject violence. France, like the US, has been urging Algeria's military-led government into dialogue with its moderate opponents. But France has found itself sucked further into the crisis in its former colony than the US and less able to articulate its policy of reluctant and conditional support for the Algerian government as a 'lesser evil' than emergence of a fundamentalist Islamic state. Le Monde newspaper yesterday suggested that France and the west use economic aid as a lever to force the Algiers government into political concessions. But the IMF, which gave Algeria a standby credit in May, and the Paris Club, which rescheduled its official debt in June, are not readily suited to such political bargaining.</p>

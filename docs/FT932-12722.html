			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / BA buys additional USAir stock and maintains 24.6% holding BRITISH AIRWAYS will exercise its option on Dollars 86.3m (Pounds 54m) worth of USAir stock to maintain its current 24.6 per cent equity stake in the sixth largest US carrier. The UK flag carrier is also in advanced negotiations with the Danish AP Moller group over the future of their joint interest in Brymon European Airways, the UK regional carrier formed last year by the amalgamation of Brymon Airways and Birmingham European Airways. BA's decision to exercise its rights to buy additional USAir stock follows the US carrier's plan to sell 10m new shares to investors to raise about Dollars 260m to improve its debt-laden balance sheet. The move will increase BA's financial investment in USAir to Dollars 386.3m. The UK carrier acquired its minority stake in USAir last January for Dollars 300m. Under its investment agreement with USAir, BA also gained certain rights to buy shares of preferred stock convertible into USAir common shares to maintain its underlying interest if the US carrier proceeded with a new equity issue. BA's decision to subscribe to the new issue confirms the UK flag carrier's commitment to the partnership with USAir, which it regards as an integral part of its strategy to become a global airline. BA said yesterday the USAir convertible preference share stock it was subscribing to were convertible into 3.27m common shares at Dollars 26.40 a share. BA also said it would subscribe a further Dollars 12.9m should underwriters to USAir's offering exercise options to take an additional 15 per cent above the offering. While consolidating its partnerships in the international market, BA is also continuing to reorganise and rationalise its domestic operations. The latest rationalisation is expected to involve the loss-making Brymon European Airways, the regional carrier owned by The Plimsoll Line in which BA has a 40 per cent stake. The AP Moller group, through its Maersk Air subsidiary, also owns 40 per cent of The Plimsoll Line with the remaining 20 per cent held by Jim Harris Holdings. Mr Harris is a former BA marketing director and a former chairman of the London Ambulance Brigade.</p>

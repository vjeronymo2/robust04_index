			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Observer: Sporting life US sports hacks are having a bad time. What with industrial disputes prematurely ending the baseball season and scrapping the ice hockey, what do they cover? In place of the World Series, Sports Illustrated splashed the Japanese baseball championship. Better than a previous edition, packed with 11 pages of . . . rodeo clowns. Television is hit hardest. ESPN, the sports network, has been reduced to dog shows, ten-pin bowling and surfing from Hawaii. The barrel has now been scraped, with the American Double Dutch Rope Jumping championship. What's left? Goldfish racing from El Paso?</p>

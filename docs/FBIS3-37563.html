			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today's briefing at the General Staff of the Navy  was devoted to the Navy's nuclear safety. Rear Admiral Yurasov,  head of the Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, said that nuclear and  radiation safety norms were revised after the Chernobyl  catastrophe. According to Yurasov, these norms are being  observed in the majority of atomic installations, atomic subs,  and ships.    [Begin Yurasov recording] Considerable financial means are  required to maintain the operation of these atomic subs. These  atomic subs are a potential source of radiological  contamination. [end recording]    A serious shortage of personnel to man nuclear installations  is another problem of the Navy. There are not enough sailors,  warrant officers, and officers. Touching upon the issue of  sunken submarines--specifically, the Komsomolets sub--it was  noted that it would be more expedient to mothball rather than  raise them. The radioactive contamination around the  Komsomolets is local and does not represent an ecological  disaster. The marines do not regard as necessary the  Gosatomnadzor's [Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation  Safety] supervision of certain installations; they believe that  departmental monitoring of the Navy's nuclear safety is  sufficient.    [Begin V. Makarov recording, deputy director of  Gosatomnadzor] What they are proposing runs counter to the  approved amendments introduced in the provision on  Gosatomnadzor. These amendment were agreed upon with the chief  of the General Staff, and I cannot change the list of  installations to be monitored. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: North Peko eyes Chile copper NORTH Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining group, has joined with Sociedad Minera Pudahuel (SMP), the Chilean copper producer, to evaluate the El Abra copper prospect in Chile. North is the second Australian company to participate in a joint evaluation of El Abra, offered for tender by Codelco, Chile's state-controlled mining company. About 20 international companies are believed to have registered an interest. In June, BHP, which already operates the Escondida copper mine in Chile, announced it would join with Magma Copper, the US miner, to consider a tender for El Abra. North directors indicated yesterday the company would manage the joint evaluation with a view to lodging a tender by September 20. If successful, SMP, which has experience in leaching copper ores for the solvent extraction process, would have an option to purchase a 5 per cent stake. Resolute Resources, the Australian mining group, has bid for Equity In Industry, offering 16 shares for seven Equity In shares. The bid values Equity In at ADollars 140m (USDollars 93m), Reuter reports. Resolute currently has 13 per cent of Equity In.</p>

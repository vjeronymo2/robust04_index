			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: SOVIET DEFECTOR ARRIVES IN BUFFALO; SABRES DENY ACCUSATION OF  'PIRACY'  </P> <P> Alexander Mogilny, the first member of the Soviet National team to defect to  the West, arrived in Buffalo, where he hopes to continue his career with the  Sabres in the National Hockey League.  </P> <P> Sabre General Manager Gerry Meehan accompanied Mogilny from Stockholm after the  the 20-year-old Soviet player decided to defect following the recent World  Hockey Championships.  </P> <P> Meehan denied an accusation made by the official Soviet news agency Tass that  the Sabres were guilty of "piracy."  </P> <P> "The Buffalo Sabres were totally open and above-board" in dealing with Mogilny,  Meehan said Friday night, adding that the Sabres began talks with Mogilny "at  the specific request of the player. It was a voluntary departure."  </P> <P> Meehan would not say whether Mogilny had signed a contract and also declined  comment on published reports that indicated a romantic relationship with an  American woman may have been involved in the defection.  </P> <P> Meehan admitted there are potential problems with international ice hockey  officials, the NHL and American immigration officials that could keep Mogilny  from playing for Buffalo.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say they (his chances of playing with Buffalo) are pretty good or  pretty bad," he said. "There are hurdles that have to be resolved."  </P> <P> Vyacheslav Koloskov, head of the soccer and hockey department of the State  Sports Committee in the Soviet Union, indicated he expected no serious  repercussions in relations between the Soviets and the NHL.  </P> <P> Mogilny was in his third year with the Red Army team and had played in 11  international matches with the national team before this season. He was voted  the world's best junior player earlier this year by NHL scouts in a poll  organized by the Hockey News.  </P> <P> But he had his troubles with Soviet hockey authorities. He was suspended for 10  days before the World Championships after a fight in a Soviet league game.  </P></p>

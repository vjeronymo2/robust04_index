			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 3 May article: "The Ideological Position of </F> Our Socialism Is Impregnable"]    [Text] The genuine value and historic significance of  great events or achievements are to further effloresce with the  lapse of time. Twenty years have passed since the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il published the historic 7 May document  following the publication of the program of modeling the whole  society after the chuche idea.    In this period, during which a glorious and brilliant era  was  unfolded in the accomplishment of the chuche cause, changes of  which we can be proud of with dignity have been effected and  abundant fruit has been produced in socialist press construction.    The press plays a great role in the development of society  and in the struggle for the revolution. In the war of  confrontation without sounds of guns between socialism and  capitalism in today's international arena the ideological war,  the war of the press, has formed a most acute and fierce  struggle front.    Destroying the imperialists' reactionary ideological and  press offensives and firmly defending the ideological position  of socialism is a serious problem related to the destiny of  socialism. Socialism, ever since its beginning, has pioneered  its road and has been victorious amid the struggle against  capitalism and reactionary ideological trends. The imperialists'  slandering and false propaganda against socialism and their  reactionary ideological and cultural offensives against it have  become more cunning and vicious with each passing day.    What should we do in order to check all sorts of reactionary  sophistries and corrupt and bourgeois ideology and press and,  thus, to firmly lead socialist press construction to the road of  victory? The press of our times and the socialist cause are  faced with this historic question today.    Let us listen to the voices ringing from chuche Korea for a  while. Ideology is life in socialist society. Attach great  importance to pen and microphone. Reporters and journalists are  vanguard standard bearers who are standing at the first line of  the party's ideological front.    When and where has this resolute and revolutionary voice  ever  rung nobly in the history of socialist press construction? This  voice with regard to the important mission of the socialist  press and the vanguard roles of reporters and men of the press  is a solemn declaration that can be rung only in the country  upholding the great leader [widaehan yongdoja].    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the prominent, great  man [kolchurhan wiin] who has unfolded the great golden age of  the socialist press on this land. This is the dignified shouts  of Korean reporters and men of the press who are conducting  publication and press activities, upholding the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-chol as the master of the press.    The new golden age of the socialist press construction in  our  country was unfolded by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. In  the middle of the 1970's when our party and the revolution  entered an era of great change again the dear comrade leader,  who had brilliantly inherited the tradition of publication and  press created by the great leader and wisely led publication and  press work, published the 7 May document, the immortal work, and  ignited the flames of the newspaper revolution, the press  revolution, and the publication revolution. This was an occasion  of revolutionary changes that opened up a bright vista for  socialist press construction.    Recorded in every page of the 20-year-long history in which  our Korean reporters and men of the press have carried out the  newspaper revolution, the press revolution, and the publication  revolution along the road elucidated by the 7 May document is  the truth that only when one upholds the great leader [widaehan  yongdoja] can one brilliantly realize the cause of socialist  press construction.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the great ideologist  and theorist who has brilliantly elucidated the ideology of  socialist press construction. The chuche-oriented publication  and press ideology was created by the great leader and has been  brilliantly embodied by him.    The dear comrade leader inherited the tradition of the  revolutionary publications such as SAENAL, VOLSHEVIK, [word  indistinct] WOLGAN, and SOGWANG founded by the great leader in  his anti-Japanese struggle period and has resolutely safeguarded  and defended the tradition and given sagacious explanations to  the new ideological and theoretical problems arising in the  practice of the press of our times.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Our  party's publications, communications, and broadcasts have  inherited the brilliant revolutionary tradition created by the  great leader. They take the leader's chuche-oriented publication  and press ideology as its only guiding principle. They also take  it as their lofty purpose to consummate to the end the glorious  revolutionary cause pioneered by the leader [suryong] generation  after generation.    The 7 May document, which our reporters and journalists  always and kindly call and regard as a guideline, is a powerful  ideological weapon [sasangjok mugi] that makes it possible for  our media to actively contribute to modelling the whole society  on the chuche idea.    In the 7 May document, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  has defined the character and basic mission of our party's  media. He has maintained that the basic principle of the press  and publication activity is to strongly establish the party's  monolithic leading system by regarding the chuche principle as a  cornerstone of the party's media and to vigorously carry out the  speed battle by making a good choice of cores in literary works.  Also, he has fully solved all problems arising in effecting a  revolutionary upsurge in press and publication propaganda by  bringing about a revolutionary change in the areas of the  newspaper [sinmun], press [podo], and publications [chulpan].    All these ideologies, theories, and policies expounded in  the  7 May document have been a valuable press program that opened  the golden age of the socialist press today. The dear comrade  leader's press ideology fully expounded in his many works,  including the historic 7 May document, has an originality based  on his profound speculation and new discoveries [saeroun  palgyon]. He has not regarded old practices and experience as  absolute but rather has creatively solved new problems arising  in socialist press construction in conformity with the demands  of the current times, the developing revolution, and the rapidly  changing situations.    The dear comrade leader's press ideology is a weapon of  omnipotence, as well as an encyclopedia, enabling us to fully  solve all problems in the press and publication activity. He is  well-versed in all the sectors and units of the press and  publication works, including newspapers, communication  [tongsin], broadcasting [pangsong], books, magazines, and  photos, and, also, has more profound knowledge of them.    Ranging from the general direction and basic mission of the  press and publication work to the characteristics of all kinds  of articles -- including editorials, special articles, political  essays, and news reports -- the method of writings, and the  method of editors' and reporters' activities, everything has  been expounded in the dear comrade leader's press ideologies and  policies.    The dear comrade leader has talked on many occasions about  the press and publication works and has clearly solved all  problems in a timely manner. Whenever we receive teachings from  the dear comrade leader, we cannot but truly express our  admiration for his keen wisdom and multisided talents. Even  functionaries -- who contribute their whole life to the press  and publication works -- esteem and respect him as the great  master [kojang] of the press, thus expressing their admiration  for him.    The dear comrade leader's press ideology is based on the  chuche idea and, also, its kernel is a revolutionary outlook on  the leader [suryong]. Therefore, in the 7 May document, the  dear comrade leader has defined the character of our party's  media in relation to the great leader's [suryong] esteemed name  and has enabled our media, communication, and broadcasting to  always and mainly propagate the greatness of the leader  [suryong].    In the world there is no other media except our party's  media  -- which regards the dear comrade leader's press ideology as a  guideline -- that gives the greatest reverence and loyalty to  the leader [suryong] when it reports, even one time, on his  picture or revolutionary activity, overflowing with his idea.    Truly, the dear comrade leader's press ideology -- which is  the highest peak [choegobong] in the socialist ruling party's  press ideology -- is a leading guideline that enabled our  party's media to be established, strengthened, and developed  based on the most correct way without the slightest deviation  and vicissitudes, as well as an invincible and ideological  weapon that has been monolithically systemized in a great press  practice [oron silchon]. The might of his press ideology has  been fully proved as well.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the great leader  [yongdoja] who is victoriously leading the press and publication  work to embody the chuche press ideology with his seasoned  organizational power and his energetic activities. The history  of 20 years -- since the 7 May document was published -- has  been brilliantly recorded by the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il's practical activity that has outstandingly effected a  great innovation in all the press and publication sectors, along  with the ideological and theoretical activity in which he has  fully elucidated the socialist press ideology.    Ranging from the revolution, construction, social  development  to the struggles against (? enemies) and the concrete conditions  of life, all the sectors and units have been affected by the  press. The leadership on the press is the most sensitive and  creative activity that must deal with, by the minute, a great  number of the complicated and sharp problems arising in the  country, as well as abroad.    The energetic activity and work of the dear comrade  leader--who correctly settles all problems in a timely manner,  personally shouldering all heavy responsibilities arising in the  practice of the press despite his busy work in leading party  work, state work, military work, and external work--are indeed  astonishingly vast.    The high-toned voices which rang in the site of the seventh  meeting of the Korean Journalist Union held last year are still  vivid in people's minds. The voices stated: The dear comrade  leader is the genius of newspaper and press information. The  dear comrade leader is the commander of the war of  communications and radio waves who makes the chuche-oriented  radio waves sweep all over the world. The dear comrade leader is  the prominent leader who has elucidated the lifeline of the  chuche-oriented broadcast work.    The voices of participants and debaters in the meeting were  the dignified shouts of their boundless fortune of upholding the  dear leader as the great lodestar of the press whom mankind has  ever met. They were also an expression of the infinite praise of  his energetic activity as the great press activist who wisely  leads the work of newspaper, communications, broadcast, and  publication organs.    The dear comrade leader gives precious ideological and  theoretical provisions which form the contents of our  publications and press information and solves all important  policies arising in press and publication work. He often  personally checks the main subject and theme of articles. He  reviews reporters' poorly written manuscripts and personally  corrects and completes them. When he finds materials on laudable  communist virtues, which are efflorescing throughout the country  today, he sends them to the press organs in order to see to it  that they are propagated and generalized among the people.    Articles and editorials, including special articles and  political essays, which have moved the hearts of millions of  readers and made a big sensation in the world thanks to such  guidance of the dear leader, are countless. The dear comrade  leader has seen to it that the immortal works that he personally  wrote are published in NODONG SINMUN, which is the party's  newspaper, and KULLOJA so that our press and publications will  not only widely propagate the party's ideology and position  internally and externally, but also enhance by all means the  party's prestige and influence.    The dear comrade leader's energetic leadership in the  socialist press finds expression in his on-the-spot guidance to  press and publication organs.    On 19 August 1993 cadre functionaries, reporters, and  editorial staff members of NODONG SINMUN greeted the dear  comrade leader who arrived at the newspaper company for a visit  without prior notice. At this time, their joy was indeed  infinitely great. The dear comrade leader looked around modern  editing process facilities for a long while and gave guidance to  functionaries of NODONG SINMUN, the party's newspaper. The dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who had ignited the flames of the  editorial revolution in the party's newspaper and energetically  led the editorial revolution, brilliantly elucidated the road on  which NODONG SINMUN can outstandingly perform its mission and  duty as the authoritative party's newspaper of the Workers'  Party of Korea and indicated: To safeguard and defend our  country's socialism and to consummate the socialist cause under  the complicated and tense situation it is imperative to more  firmly rally party members and the working people around the  party and to vigorously accelerate socialist construction. The  party's newspaper occupies a very important position in this.    Overflowing in his remarks--which were full of infinite  energy and vigor--were the sharp and thorough analysis of the  prevailing domestic and international situation, the iron-like  will to resolutely defend the socialist cause, and the matchless  courage to sternly smash the enemies' vicious, reactionary  ideological offensives by firmly arming and uniting all of the  people ideologically.    History has shown that the imperialists and reactionaries  perpetrate all sorts of frantical maneuvers at home and abroad  to aim at the party's newspaper first and to degenerate it in  order to destroy the party and the socialist system and to  disarm the people ideologically. If the party's newspaper shakes  and changes in quality the press circles are reduced into yellow  and gray, all sorts of reactionary ideologies are infiltrated,  and eventually a tragic event of swallowing the gains of the  revolution attained in blood is created. This is a bitter  lesson shown by the realities of those countries in which  socialism has collapsed.    On that historic day, the dear comrade leader made  programmatic remarks on needs for the party's newspaper to give  priority to indoctrination and strongly arm the party members  and workers with the party's idea, the socialist idea, in  compliance with the changing environment, correctly handle  various editing materials, carry articles that arouse curiosity  among readers, enhance roles of reporters and editors, and  further modernize the newspaper company's operation. He also  taught a need to give spiritual nutrition [chongsinjok yangsik]  to coal miners working in underground deadends and fighters  waging struggles under difficult environments to ensure that  they maintain their belief and fidelity.    The dear comrade leader's words gave all officials,  reporters, and editors of the party's newspaper the belief and  will that they will share the same destiny with their party and  socialism no matter how many times the world may turn upside  down.    He, feeling sorry to part with journalists-fighters [munpil  chonsa] whom he personally raised, stopped his limousine and  left the compound of the party's newspaper after waving his  hands to their enthusiastic applause.    He kindled flames to further strengthen the party's  newspaper  and score revolutionary upsurges in the overall publication and  press work in compliance with the demand of the new environment  in which our party and the party's newspaper had the heavy  historic mission of defending and advancing the socialist cause.  Therefore, the dear comrade leader's on-the-spot guidance to  the NODONG SINMUN company will be of greater historic  significance as time goes by.    In the vortex of the ever-changing situation, the war of  communications and electronic waves [tongsin chonpajon], as well  as newspapers and broadcasting stations, plays a very important  role in the press war [ollonjon] to defeat the imperialists'  reactionary ideological and cultural offensives.    The footsteps of the dear comrade leader's on-the-spot  guidance can also be traced to the Korean Central News Agency  [KCNA] company. On 5 October 1980, a few days before the  historic sixth party Central Committee congress, the dear  comrade leader visited the KCNA company though he was very busy.  It was very surprising. He elucidated the path which the news  agency should take and took all necessary measures to ensure  utmost promptness and correctness in the coverage of the party  congress. He stayed with the reporters and editors of the news  agency for a long time that day.    All people were filled with great joy and deep emotion when  they saw the sacred image [korukhan yongsang] of the dear  comrade leader, who appeared at the podium of the historic party  congress a few days later, in newspapers and on television. At  the time when every minute and second of his was very valuable  because he was in charge of the important work of successfully  holding the party congress, he examined each and every task of  the news agency even on the podium of the congress and promptly  resolved each task. No other party leader [yongdoja] in the  world has done his utmost to carry out the press work.    He sometimes gives teachings on several occasions a day.  Because of his prudent guidance, KCNA fulfills its mission as  an important ideological weapon that deals a strong blow to all  reactionary ideas and utter trash that haunt the space on  diverse frequencies and waves and that makes our party's  independent positions and just voices resound throughout the  world.    Throughout the days when he made the publication and press  work lead the party's ideological front and made every effort to  strengthen and develop this work, he spent numerous nights to  review articles and editing materials for newspapers, the news  agency, and publications and strove to develop the publication  and press work. He even made these such efforts to develop the  work of publication and the press alone. Therefore, he surely  has no time to take a rest because he is personally in charge of  party and state affairs, military affairs, and the grand  historic task of winning victories in the Korean revolution and  mankind's cause of independence.    The new era of chuche-oriented television broadcasting  opened  because of these sleepless and tireless efforts by the dear  comrade leader. The dear comrade leader earlier proposed  starting television broadcasting and energetically led the work  of implementing this initiative. The first chuche-oriented  television broadcasting started in our country because of his  careful and energetic leadership, and the work of spreading the  television network across the country was carried out  successfully.    Each segment of television programs boundlessly ennobles  and enriches the ideological and spiritual lives and cultural  and emotional lives of all party members and workers and is  filled with the dear comrade leader's intention and concrete  guidance to highly display the superiority of our-style  socialism.    When the party and the revolution were entrusted with heavy  tasks and when the situation at home and abroad was grave, the  dear comrade leader paid deep attention to the militant role of  publications and mass media and led them to launch large-scale  ideological offensives. In this way, he strongly armed the  entire party, all the people, and the entire Army with the  party's ideology and will, consolidated the single-hearted unity  of our revolutionary ranks, and vigorously inspired all party  members and workers into carrying out socialist construction,  the cause of achieving the fatherland's reunification, and the  cause of achieving independence throughout the world.    Even under present circumstances in which the imperialists  are frantically trying to inspire the people with reactionary  ideas and spread decadent and corrupt [toepyejogigo  malsegijogin] (?bourgeois) life-styles, every newspaper, news  agency, broadcasting station, or book in our country upholds the  banner of the chuche idea, the socialist banner, without shaking  and fulfills its heavy mission as an important media  organization that correctly represents and defends their party's  ideology and position and propagandizes and implements the  party's policies. This is unthinkable apart from the dear  comrade leader's wise leadership.    Today, our party's publications and mass media have a  reputation and a great influence in international journalism  circles, and the people of the world pay attention to voices  resounding in Pyongyang. This is a valuable result achieved by  the tested leadership art and powerful press war tactics  [yuryokhan ollon chonbop] of the dear comrade leader, who firmly  adheres to the chuche-oriented position and revolutionary  principle in the ideological press war [sasang ollonjon] and  resolves all issues in a matured and sagacious manner.    In the history of the working class' prolonged struggle for  socialism, there are many parties and leaders [yongdojaduri]  that founded revolutionary publications and media organizations  and utilized them. However, no other political leaders  [yongdoja] in the history of the development of the journalism  of the world and in any party attached greater significance to  publications and mass media, more positively utilized them, and  further strengthened their might than our dear comrade leader.    The dear comrade leader, a [word indistinct] of the press of  our era, set a world-class example in the leadership of the  publications and mass media. Our dear leader General Kim  Chong-il is a great leader [yongdoja] and a teacher who built a  large unit of revolutionary journalists who are boundlessly  loyal to the party and revolution and the fatherland and people.    In countries where socialism has collapsed, reporters and  journalists have changed in ideological terms and degraded in  moral terms because they had no great leader [yongdoja] at the  head of their party and eventually turned into trumpeters for  the enemy's antisocialist maneuvers. At such a time, reporters  and journalists in Korea have upheld the red banner of the  revolution and shared the same destiny with the party without  shaking or changing their minds.    The Korean reporters and journalists have been able to take  the lead in the party's ideological front and excellently  fulfilled their heavy mission and duty before the era and  history. This is because they have been indoctrinated and  raised under the care of great General Kim Chong-il.    The relationship between the leader [yongdoja] and  reporters and journalists in our country is not simply a  relationship of being led and receiving leadership, but it is  also formed of a relationship between the great teacher and  pupil and a benevolent father [chaaeroun opoi] and blood  children. Here, the blood-tied relationship and an impregnably  complete unity exists in which there lies the greatest happiness  and glory of our Korea's reporters and journalists, and the  invincible might of our press.    The dear comrade leader who attaches just as great  importance  to the role of the pen and microphone in the revolution and  construction and social development, as the might of a  million-strong force, indoctrinated and trained the reporters  and journalists not just as writers, but as those who love  justice and truth and as resolute fighters and enthusiastic  patriots unhesitatingly devoting their lives for the revolution.    The revolution of the newspaper, the press, and publications  which was kindled by him was a glory of ideological training and  a school of the revolution, fostering our reporters and  journalists into chuche-type communist revolutionary and  competent literary fighters.    On 6 April 1974, the dear comrade leader highly assessed the  reporters and made the following impressive talk: Those who  write in accordance with the party's intention are heroes.    Even when the political and ideological level and literary  skills of the reporters and journalists were in their infant  stage, Comrade Kim Chong-il, our benevolent teacher, led them  hand in hand and step by step, thus embracing such valuable  glory to them.    Reporters and journalists have been called comrade and  eternal companion by their leader [yongdoja] and even received a  reply letter from the leader [yongdoja] after sending a letter  containing a do-or-die pledge toward the leader [yongdoja] when  they were faced with an arduous trial before the revolution.  Such an impressive fact has not been recorded in the history of  the development of the press for all ages and countries.    The dear comrade leader's high political faith and love  toward the reporters and journalists are truly endless. Amid  the bosom of the great father [widaehan opoi], the reporters and  journalists were rendered distinguished services with gold  medals and became people's reporters and people's journalists.  Also, reporters and journalists who performed meritorious deeds  for a long time received benevolent birthday tables, and bear  the honor of being laid in the patriotic martyrs tomb after  their deaths.    Korea's reporters and journalists truly cannot live even for  a minute and cannot elucidate the honor of the party's literary  fighters apart from the bosom of the great General Kim Chong-il.  The dear comrade leader exerted such great efforts and energy to  foster and present the reporters and journalists. Even so, he  is an endlessly humble and benevolent father who turned all the  meritorious deeds and glory toward the reporters and journalists.    We cannot forget 19 November 1993. On this day, the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a letter to the participants of  the seventh congress of the Korean Journalists Union. It was an  inspiring event in which it manifested to the whole world the  relationship of complete harmony among the leader [yongdoja],  reporters, and journalists.    In the past, our reporters and journalists were endlessly  loyal to the party, and today they are unchangeably sharing the  fate with the party as in the past. Where are such highly proud  reporters and journalists who are carrying out press and  publication activities with their pens, microphones, and cameras  amid the great leader's [yongdoja] great faith and love?    Only the chuche-type blood embraced by the party is flowing  in the bodies of our reporters and journalists who have been  fostered and trained by enjoying such great glory amid the  protection of the great leader [yongdoja]. Also, they are  highly praising only their party and the leader [suryong] and  are writing and carrying out broadcasts advocating their  fatherland and system.    Our Korea's reporters and journalists have a firm view of  the  revolutionary outlook, have a firm stand on socialism, do not  want any comfort or worldly fame, but are gathering news,  writing, and carrying out broadcast activities with the spirit  of a war correspondent.    Today, all the People's Army officers and men with rifles  and the 5 million young vanguards who desire to be guns and  bombs are firmly united around great General Kim Chong-il.  Ranks of faithful reporters and journalists who are firmly  grasping pens of the revolution are also firmly united as one  around him in strong faith and will.    There is no force in the world that can break the rank of  our  reporters and journalists who are death-defyingly defending  their leader [yongdoja] politically, ideologically, and  theoretically with absolute worship of, loyalty, and filial  obedience to him. As long as this iron-firm rank exists, our  party's press and publications will shine forever as the great  Comrade Kim Chong-il's press and publications.    The 20-year history of our party's press and publication  that  has advanced along the road elucidated by the historic 7 May  document! The days of the past 20-year history and the brilliant  reality of today vigorously demonstrate the justness and might  of the great comrade leader's original press ideology and the  greatness of his leadership achievements.    As we uphold the great leader [yongdoja] at the top of the  party, the revolution, and the press, our Korean reporters and  journalists have indeed been able to walk along the glorious  road of victory, and our party's press and publications have  been able to accumulate historic accomplishments that will shine  forever all over the world.    What enables us to look back on the past days, filled with  dignity and pride? Our party's press and publications,  reporters, and journalists have the greatest pride and honor in  the fact that they have actively contributed to the brilliant  solution of the question on the succession of leadership in  implementing the socialist cause.    Our party's press and publications have firmly defended the  stronghold [chinji] of the socialist ideology by concentrating  all efforts on broadly propagating ideologies and theories of  the dear comrade leader, who is leading the socialist cause  along the single road of victory, and on firmly guaranteeing his  leadership through generations.    Whether the stronghold the socialist ideology can be  defended  or not, greatly depends on the role of the press. The  degeneration of the press results in the degeneration of  society. This is why imperialists and reactionaries are trying  to destroy the party and the socialist system, to degrade the  people ideologically, and to degenerate the press by all means.    All of our newspapers, news agencies, broadcasting services,  magazines, and books broadly explain and propagate the  superiority of socialism of our own style that has embodied the  chuche idea, and they prevent any strange ideology [chapsasang]  or voice that has no relation to the party's ideology and  position, the working class-oriented position, or socialist  principles from infiltrating into our society.    In printed columns or on screens, our press and publications  make features of the dear comrade leader's immortal achievements  and his greatness as a great ideological theorist, a great  politician, a great military strategist, and the people's father  so as to have all people and the People's Army officers and men  bear deep in their hearts the will and faith that they can  complete the socialist cause only by following him.    Thanks to the great contribution of our party's press and  publications, our entire party, all people, and entire Army are  resolutely defending the stronghold [poru] of socialism, united  as one around great General Kim Chong-il today.    The Korean reporters' and journalists' contribution to the  sublime cause of solving the question on the succession of  leadership by upholding great General Kim Chong-il -- the  destiny of socialism -- at the top of the party, the revolution,  and the Army will shine forever as their greatest exploit that  they can squarely brag about in the present and before history.    As long as the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great man  of the socialist press, and the rank of faithful reporters and  journalists who share their destinies with him exist, our  party's ideological front, the ideological stronghold of  socialism, is impregnable forever.</p>

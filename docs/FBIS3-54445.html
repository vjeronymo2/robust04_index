			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pakistan has expressed its disappointment on the  contents of six nonpapers [as heard] it received from India, as  they missed the core and fundamental issues of Jammu and  Kashmir. In his preliminary reaction to the nonpapers, the  foreign secretary, Shaharyar M. Khan, told newsmen in Islamabad  today we feel Indian policy is to talk on relatively less  important issues to show the world that it is engaged in  negotiations so that pressure of the public opinion and the  governments is deflected from the core issue. He said none of  these nonpapers really goes to the depth of the core issue.  However, he said, we will consider these nonpapers very  carefully and with the seriousness they deserved.    About the contents of these nonpapers, he said the first one  related to Line of Control, suggesting to make it line of peace  and tranquility. This proposal, he said, virtually asked  Pakistan to accept status quo at the Line of Control. We have  already indicated that it is not acceptable to Pakistan. The  foreign secretary said the Indians did not refer to the question  of repression which, in our opinion, is the real reason for  tension in occupied Kashmir. He said in the fifth nonpaper on  confidence-building measures, India has referred to peripheral  issues, whereas we want to engage with India on important issues  like nuclear proliferation -- regional or global, control of  mass destruction weapons, control of ballistic missiles which  India has been indigenously manufacturing, and our proposal for  a regional nuclear nonproliferation regime in South Asia.</p>

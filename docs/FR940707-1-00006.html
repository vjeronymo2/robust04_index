These rules do not apply in instances in which DOE regulations themselves contain procedures governing OHA proceedings conducted under authority of those particular regulations. e.g., 10 CFR part 708 (DOE Contractor Employee Protection Program).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=3 --> &sect;1003.2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=3 -->  Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) As used in this part:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Action <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means an order, interpretation, ruling issued, or a rulemaking undertaken by the DOE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aggrieved, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for purposes of administrative proceedings, describes and means a person who is adversely affected by an action of the DOE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conference <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means an informal meeting, incident to any proceeding, between the Office of Hearings and Appeals and any person aggrieved by that proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Director <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or duly authorized delegate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOE <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the Department of Energy, created by the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub.

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / North Koreans rally to protest military exercises in South Korea More than 100,000 North Koreans held a rally in Pyongyang yesterday as the country went on a 'semi-war' footing in response to a huge military exercise in South Korea, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The (North) Korean central news agency said Workers' Party official Choe Tae-pok addressed the rally, called in support of an order by military chief Kim Jong-il putting the communist nation on heightened alert. 'No one can vouch they (Seoul and Washington) will not go into a real war against North Korea while staging the manoeuvres,' Choe said. Washington and Seoul say the annual Team Spirit joint military exercise is a purely defensive exercise. On Monday Kim Jong-il said he was acting because 'war may break out any moment'.</p>

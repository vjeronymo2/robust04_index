			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ALLA BREVE MEDLEY: GLASS: "SONGS FROM THE TRILOGY."  </P> <P> Douglas Perry and Paul Esswood, countertenors; The Philip Glass Ensemble; N.Y.  City Opera Orchestra &amp; Chorus, conducted by Christopher Keene; Stuttgart  State Opera Orchestra &amp; Chorus, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. CBS MK  45580 (compact disc). The juxtapositions on this collection of greatest hits  from "Einstein on the Beach," "Satyagraha" and "Akhnaten" put the changes in  Glass' style in high relief, and underscore the different philosophical bases  of the three operas. It will probably change few minds about the music,  although only the most confirmed Glassiphobe could resist the otherworldly  beauty of the modal close-harmony in the Akhnaten/Nefertiti duet. The sounds  have transfered well from their original formats. John Henken  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A need for cooperation between Latvia and Poland--  countries brought together both by their similar past and by  common problems they face today--was emphasized by President  Lech Walesa speaking in the forum of the Latvian parliament.  According to the Polish president both countries are natural  allies along the road to European integration.    Walesa emphasized that there were no historical burdens  between the two countries. He recalled that the Polish  government had never recognized Latvia's annexation by the  Soviet Union, thanks to which Polish-Latvian relations could  simply be resumed in the autumn of 1991.    The basis for good Polish-Latvian cooperation is the  inter-state treaty signed in July 1992, but according to Walesa  this needs to be filled with concrete substance. In his view  there is need for direct contacts between people. The president  stressed that Poles resident in Lithuania were our country's  natural ambassador in Latvia. He expressed his satisfaction  with the fact that the Latvian authorities have guaranteed the  possibility of unrestricted development and preservation of  national identity for the Polish minority.    Among others Walesa met were parliamentary chairman  Anatolijs  Gorbunovs. The schedule of the Polish president's visit to Riga  calls for further meetings with the ministers of defense and of  foreign affairs, and another meeting with President Guntis  Ulmanis.</p>

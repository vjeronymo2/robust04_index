			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Dewhirst rises 37% to Pounds 4.1m DEWHIRST GROUP, the clothing and toiletries company, yesterday reported a 37 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 4.13m, for the year to January 17. The increase was helped by the acquisition last year of the Slimma womenswear business and the recovery from a poor group performance in 1990. The company, which sells 82 per cent of its production to Marks and Spencer, reported its first improvement in profit margins since the early 1980s. 'At 3.6 per cent, we are starting now to go the right way, and this was achieved despite worsening trading,' said Mr Scott Beattie, finance director. He said the recovery had come largely because the heavy cost-cutting and closures of the previous year had 'done their duty'. Turnover recorded a small recovery to Pounds 130.5m (Pounds 121.6m) and the proposed final dividend of 0.43p was a 23 per cent improvement on last time and makes a total of 0.72p (0.64p) for the year. This should be set against the halving of the dividend in 1990, the first time it had been cut in the company's 72-year history as a quoted concern. The company was positive on current trading. 'Sales for the first 10 weeks are ahead of the equivalent period last year,' it said. The shares firmed 1/2 p to 28p. The acquisition of Slimma from Coats Viyella last September had been slightly earnings enhancing, said Mr Tim Dewhirst, chief executive. The company had made a Pounds 7.7m rights issue at 26p a share to pay for Slimma, and the broader shareholder base limited earnings per share to 2.71p (2.14p). The company was cash generative and ended the year with Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 2.8m) net cash. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 711,000 (Pounds 920,000). In July, Dewhirst made an abortive takeover attempt for Kingsgrange, the toiletries supplier. It cost Pounds 240,000 and was expressed as an extraordinary item, much less than the previous year's Pounds 1.85m in closure charges. COMMENT Dewhirst has not been among the star performers in the textiles sector for many years. Yesterday's results hold out a glimmer of hope that the good times might return in the form of a strong balance sheet and the progress of the Slimma acquisition. Slimma has done Dewhirst a power of good in the shape of new management blood, a reduction in the company's dependence on the depressed menswear market and yet closer ties with Marks and Spencer. This should help profits continue their recovery in the current year, perhaps as far as Pounds 6m. The stock is on a prospective multiple of 9.3, a tempting discount to the market of about 20 per cent. The company imports only about 16 per cent of its clothes and has the option of increasing this to boost margins. If Dewhirst stays in M and S' good books, and shoppers remain loyal to the retailer, the shares look good value.</p>

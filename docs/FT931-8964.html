			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Ex-Soviet Union grain debts to US mount RUSSIA'S mounting defaults on its US agricultural loans are promising to add to the cost of US farm subsidy programmes and make them a more visible target for the Clinton administration's effort to cut the budget deficit. The states of the former Soviet Union, including Russia, have piled up defaults of Dollars 305.5m (Pounds 215m) on US-government guaranteed grain loans, having stopped paying interest in late November, the Department of Agriculture said yesterday, With little sign of movement in multilateral debt negotiations, the payment gap could widen to Dollars 4.2bn, the total in short-term grain and foodstuffs loans the US Department of Agriculture has extend to CIS countries. To date, most banks writing the guaranteed loans have been willing to carry the defaults on their books, hoping debt restructuring would bring full payment. Only one, Banque Indosuez, has filed claims with the department to recover lost interest payments on Russian grain loans. The amount, Dollars 354,000, is tiny compared to outstanding defaults and, because not all of the interest was guaranteed, the department has paid out only Dollars 187,000 to the bank. However, with US farm subsidy payments promising to top Dollars 17.1bn in fiscal 1993, double the 1992 outlay and the highest seen by Washington in several years, Russia's loan problems will only add to the farm-support debate. Lawmakers from urban areas argue that farm subsidies have grown as farm population has fallen, propping up the income of a rural elite.</p>

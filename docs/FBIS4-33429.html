			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Orestes Perez Perez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (PL) -- Cuba is respected, it is  listened to, and its proposals are taken into consideration  because of the prestige, the authority, and the role it has  played throughout the years in the Nonaligned Movement [NAM],  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said in a telephone  interview with PRENSA LATINA.    Robaina said this can be verified by how the Cuban  delegation's suggestions were taken into consideration in the  drafting of the final document, which will be submitted  tomorrow, the last working day of the meeting of the foreign  ministers of the NAM, which is being held in Cairo, the Egyptian  capital.    The minister described the meeting as positive "not only  because of its results but also because of the high number of  foreign ministers present and their almost unanimous commitment  to strengthen the movement." He also noted the consensus in  guaranteeing the continuity of the NAM and in drafting a  document that can reinforce the progress attained in Jakarta,  Indonesia, in 1993, as well as making progress in the  reinforcement of the role that should be played by this group of  109 countries in these complex political times.    "These have been the priorities we have all had during these  intense working days, and we are still working at this moment in  the economic and political commissions, in which Cuba is playing  an important role," he said. The foreign minister noted that  the amendments presented by his delegation were incorporated  into the final document, in which there is also recognition of  the role played by Indonesia while leading the movement.    Commenting on the possible designation of Colombia as the  next host of the NAM in 1995, he insisted that in the face of an  increasingly unipolar world the most important thing is the  collective commitment of those of us who represent two thirds of  humanity in having a voice and sufficient well-earned authority.    "I believe that that is what has motivated us in this forum.  There is an understanding of these things, and we have made  progress in drafting the documents in the meeting and in holding  a unilateral meeting with all the delegations present here," he  said. He noted, however, that this opportunity is also part of  the strategy that the NAM had been pursuing in a systematic  manner, having the Presidency rotated throughout the regions of  the world.    "It is a big commitment, and we do not have the slightest  doubt that Colombia can play an important role in the  development of the NAM. I believe it is a big commitment for  Latin America at a difficult time for the movement, and it will  be especially up to Colombia to guarantee the movement's  reorganization, strengthening, and increasingly important  presence at the international forums," Robaina said.    Asked about the acceptance of the Cuban proposal to  democratize the United Nations, Robaina said it was widely  supported by the majority of the participants. "We have the  authority to say that if democracy is demanded of the peoples  and countries, it must also be demanded of the United Nations.  We can no longer be fooled with the false concept of a  democratization process; we have to achieve a transparency in  that international forum," he pointed out.    He also said that the Cuban delegation wanted not only to  denounce this situation but also to present proposals. Speaking  about the upcoming Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia, he said these meetings continue to be "an opportunity  to hold discussions without receiving orders from the United  States.    "It is particularly threatened by the hemispheric summit  convened by the U.S. Government in Miami with the clear purpose  of discrediting it (the Ibero-American summit), and, in view of  this intention, it is necessary for Cartagena to come out  stronger," he said.    As for the meeting in Colombia, he pointed out that with  independence in carrying out their actions, the Latin American  peoples are increasingly more independent and will continue to  find their own roads. "I have trust in the way the Colombians  will prepare the summit and in the peoples' response. I believe  that in Cartagena we are going to have an important forum and an  opportunity for debate without prewritten speeches. "I prefer a  summit of actions and not of intentions," said the Cuban foreign  minister, who met in Cairo with most of his counterparts  attending the ministerial conference of the NAM.</p>

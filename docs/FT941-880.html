			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Silver price set to top Dollars 6 this week Silver's price this week is virtually certain to go above Dollars 6 a troy ounce for the first time since March 1989, driven up by the large speculative commodity funds which are targeting the market. The funds already have helped push up the price from this year's low of Dollars 4.90 in January to Dollars 5.70 in London on Friday. Their first target, according to dealers, is Dollars 6 an ounce. The same funds, including the Quantum Fund operated by Mr George Soros, the high-profile financier and currency speculator, successfully tackled the gold market about this time last year and manoeuvred the price up from a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce to more than Dollars 400. They are rumoured to have recently spent Dollars 1bn to buy physical silver which they have moved from the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) to vaults in Delaware to give the impression that Comex stocks are falling because of heavy demand. Dealers suggest the funds are willing to spend another Dollars 1bn in this effort. Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at the Lehman Brothers financial services group in New York, said that, whereas the funds' attack on the gold price came when there was record demand for physical metal, this was not the case with silver. 'I talk to consumers every day and they are not buying more silver. There has been no genuine pick-up in industrial demand,' he said.</p>

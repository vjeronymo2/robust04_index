			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said here today that Japan will  develop its relations with China with an eye on the future and  on contributions to the world.    He made the remarks at a press conference here this  afternoon.    During his current visit, he said, he exchanged views with  Chinese leaders frankly and meaningfully.    Hosokawa said that he has always regarded Japan-China  relations as one of the most important pillars of Japan's  relations with foreign countries and have attached great  importance to them.    He described the bilateral relations as having entered a new  period of development.    He said the two countries have developed their relations  very  well.    "China's reform and opening policy is of great significance  not only to China itself, but also to peace and prosperity in  this region," he said, "so we should support it as far as  possible."    The two countries will continue their cooperation on the  fourth batch of loans offered by Japan to China and on the  restoration of China's status as a signatory party to the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Hosokawa said.    The signing of the agreement on environmental protection  cooperation between the two countries during the visit is a  concrete move to strengthen the bilateral cooperation in this  area, he noted.    Recent years have witnessed great expansion of the bilateral  trade and Japanese investment in China, said the Japanese prime  minister, adding that he was pleased to see the broad prospects  for further development in the economic relations and trade  between the two countries.    The prime minister said that the two sides reaffirmed the  necessity to expand cooperation in culture. He said that the  two sides have decided to cooperate in protecting the Kaiyuan  Palace, a famous ancient Chinese building constructed in the  capital of Tang Dynasty, Changan city (now Xian city, capital of  northwest China's Shaanxi Province).    Hosokawa said that the two sides have agreed to further  their  cooperation in order to make positive contributions to world  peace and prosperity.    The leaders of two countries also frankly exchanged views on  the nuclear issue of the Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK),  cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, military budgets and  disarmament and human rights, he said.    Hosokawa said that Japan and China shared the view that the  DPRK nuclear issue is an important one that concerns the safety  of northeast Asia and the two sides promised to keep close  contacts with each other in order to solve the problem.    The Japanese prime minister reaffirmed Japanese serious  attitude toward history, saying that Japan will make greater  efforts to develop Japan-China relations with an eye on the  future on the basis of introspection of the past.    He said that he saw with his own eyes the great changes that  have taken place in China and that he was deeply impressed with  the confidence of the Chinese people in the future.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> A proposed rule, including a notice of public hearing was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59978). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Need for Final Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Containerized air and ocean cargo has become the paramount means by which both live wildlife and wildlife products are transported into and out of the United States. The use of containerized cargo by the airline and shipping industries has compounded the problems encountered by the Service and by wildlife importers and exporters in the Boston area. In many instances, foreign suppliers will containerize entire shipments and route them directly to Boston. If, upon arrival, the shipment contains any wildlife, those items must be shipped under Customs bond to a designated port for clearance. In most cases, this has involved shipping wildlife products to New York, New York, the nearest designated port, but reshipment has been both time consuming and expensive. To alleviate this problem, Boston importers and exporters have attempted to direct entire shipments, even though they contain only a small number of wildlife items, to a designated port prior to their arrival at Boston. This method of shipment meets the current regulatory requirements of the Service; however, it is again time consuming and entails additional expense. It is also contrary to the increasing tendency of foreign suppliers to ship consignments directly to regional ports such as Boston. In addition, time is a key element when transporting live wildlife and perishable wildlife products. Without designated port status, business in Boston cannot import and export wildlife products directly, and consequently may be unable to compete economically with merchants in other international trading centers located in designated ports. With airborne and maritime shipments into and out of Boston steadily increasing, the Service has concluded that the port should be designated for wildlife imports and exports. Conferring this status on Boston serves not only the interests of business in the region, but will also facilitate the mission of the Service in two ways. First, clearance of wildlife shipments in Boston will relieve inspectors at the port of New York who are now handling cargo for both ports. Second, it will eliminate the need for the administrative processing of permits by the Regional office that are issued to Boston area importers who are able to qualify for those permits on the basis of demonstrated economic hardship. Also, Boston's growth as a major east coast port of entry combined with modernization of shipping routes, make it an essential commercial link to the New England area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Results of Public Hearing and Written Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9(f) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1538(f), requires that the public be given an opportunity to comment at a hearing prior to the Secretary of the Interior conferring designated port status on any port. Accordingly, the Service held a public hearing on November 8, 1993, from 9 a.m. to 12 Noon. The hearing was held in the Massachusetts Port Authority, Maritime Department, Fish Pier East II, Northern Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Seven persons presented oral and/or written testimony at the hearing, representing Maritime Department at the Massachusetts Port Authority, Advance Brokers, Boston Customs Broker and Freight Forwarders Association, Tower International, International Cargo Systems, and Liberty International. Most of the witnesses stated that shipping to New York or another designated port for inspections when small numbers of wildlife items are involved is detrimental to the economic well being of their clients. They felt that designation would allow their companies and their customers to become more competitive on both time and cost. The Boston Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association had reviewed port inspection statistics and felt that the volume of shipments in Boston justifies designated port status as they are larger than some currently designated ports. International Cargo Systems, is a freight forwarder whose primary business involves seafood, is anticipating a 30 percent increase in business if Boston becomes a designated port. Liberty International complained about the application process necessary to obtain a designated port exception permit. In their opinion, it is so time consuming that many potential importers will not deal in wildlife products simply to avoid the delays. The witnesses felt that designated port status would increase the numbers of potential users at the port of Boston. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One additional written comment submitted by MONITOR, on January 10, 1994, was received by the Service during the public comment period. The commenter opposed the designation of Boston as a port of entry because in the commenter's opinion the designation of a twelfth port for the importation and exportation of wildlife would spread the staff and finances of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service even thinner, diminishing the Service's effectiveness in wildlife law enforcement. The Service believes that this rule will not have a negative impact on other wildlife enforcement efforts nor reduce the detection of illegal shipments elsewhere by the placement of a wildlife inspector at Boston. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service also receives requests for wildlife identification assistance from other Federal Agencies such as U.S. Customs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (APHIS) at Boston and Canadian border ports. While many of these locations are not part of the designated port area, it is important for wildlife inspection services to be available at such major international facilities when the need arises. This also relieves the burden of Service Special Agents in the Boston area who must take time from other investigational priorities to address inspection needs. This is particularly important during the migratory bird hunting season as waterfowl resource protection in the regional flyway is a priority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Required Determinations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The Department of the Interior (Department) has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .). As discussed above, opening Boston as a port of entry will have a slight economic benefit to the Boston area businesses. This action is not expected to have significant taking implications, as per Executive Order 12630. This rule does not contain any additional information collection requirements which require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This action does not contain any federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. These final rule changes in the regulations in Part 14 are regulatory and enforcement actions which are covered by a categorical exclusion from National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 516 Department Manual and an Environmental Action Memorandum is on file at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office in Arlington, Virginia. A determination has been made pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act that this revision of Part 14 will not effect federally listed species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

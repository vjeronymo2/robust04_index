			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Miners in radical S African accord A radical agreement signed by labour and management at the Harmony gold mine in the Orange Free State opens the way to more co-operative labour relations in the South African gold-mining industry, writes Philip Gawith from Johannesburg. The agreement, between the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Harmony, the biggest gold mine in South Africa and a member of the Rand Mines group, includes a pay increase of less than 2.5 per cent, profit-sharing, reduction of the effect of absenteeism on production, and the introduction of a 'collective bargaining fund'. It also provides for negotiations with the NUM on new work practices and new technology to improve efficiency, negotiations on skill training and an improved production bonus.</p>

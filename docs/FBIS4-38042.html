			<p>BFN     [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that the Syrian leadership has  offered to host the leadership of Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] in Damascus and said it can stay for as long as it  wants, just like other Damascus-based Palestinian opposition  factions.    Informed sources said this Syrian offer was welcomed and  appreciated by Hamas. The offer was made during meetings by  Hamas leaders last week with a number of Syrian leaders,  including Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, Foreign Minister  Faruq al-Shar', and Sami 'Atari, member of the Ba'th Party  National Command.    The sources said the Hamas delegation -- which comprised Dr.  Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the Hamas Political Bureau; Ibrahim  Ghawshah, Muhammad Nazzal, and Abu-Muhammad Mustafa -- preferred  to wait before it makes a decision until it studies the offer in  the light of the future political developments, particularly the  development in the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations.</p>

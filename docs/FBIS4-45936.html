			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Mar. 18 (PTI)--A standing parliamentary  committee on energy today said that India has "not isolated"  itself from the other nuclear countries of the world, though it  remains a non-signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty  (NPT).    In its fourth report on nuclear plant safety and spent fuel  management, tabled in Parliament today by its chairman Mr  Jaswant Singh, the committee said that despite the imposition of  technology control regimes in force, India holds the status of a  developed country in the field of nuclear science and technology.    Besides, India's willingness to share its experience with  others bears testimony to the transparency programmes, even as  India often keeps reminding members of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) that promotion of peaceful applications of  atomic energy is its primary goal.    The committee finds that India enjoys international  reputation as a `developed' country in the field of nuclear  science and technology. Safety standards in Indian nuclear  reactors follow global standards and their safety is constantly  monitored by the atomic energy regulatory board (AERB) which  observes current international regulatory norms, it said.    Stating that India continues to be playing a prominent role  among the nuclear community inspite of not signing NPT, the  committee said units of the department of atomic energy (DAE)  hold dynamic links with some of the leading professional  international organisations dealing with peaceful applications  of nuclear energy.    The committee said India has been a member of the board of  governors of the IAEA since its inception and was one of the ten  members considered `most advanced' in the technology of atomic  energy in the world and therefore got nominated to the board  every year along with other countries such as the United States,  UK, France, Russia, China, Japan, Germany, Canada, Brazil and  Argentina.    Referring to the country's nuclear power programme, the  committee said that the entire process of nuclear power plant  design, construction, commissioning and operation is covered by  a systematic quality assurance programme to provide assurances  about meeting of all safety requirements.    It said India's long-term nuclear power programmes is a  three-stage one and the first stage is based on pressurised  heavy water reactors (PHWRS) using indigenously available  natural uranium as fuel. It said indigenous natural uranium fuel  resources would sustain a nuclear power programme of 10,000 MWE  in the first stage.    The second stage of the programme is based on fast breeder  reactors (FRRS) using plutonium as fuel reprocessed from the  spent fuel of the first stage. In this stage, with blanket  material of depleted uranium, more plutonium would be bred to  set up additional FRBS. Also at a later part of the second stage  thorium as blanket material would breed U-233 from thorium, the  committee said.    In the third stage, the programme is based on U-233  thorium-based reactor systems by which U-233 could be bred to  set up a number of reactors.    The committee said that the first stage programme is not an  end in itself but a route to the second stage programme of FBRS  and is ultimately aimed at utilising the thorium resources.    It said India has moderate reserves of uranium whereas  thorium reserves are vast. Under the circumstances and if a  long-term view of energy resources is taken, it is imporant to  push through PHWR programmes at a fast pace.    The committee has also found that for funding of nuclear  power, there are no avenues for resources from overseas  financial institutions, unlike in the conventional power sector.</p>

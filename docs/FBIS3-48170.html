			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Berlin] </F>   [Text] David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], said on 21 January that the IAEA and North  Korea had agreed to the basic principle of holding limited  inspections [chehan sachal]. Spokesman Kyd expects North Korea  will officially give the IAEA a "diplomatic-level" answer, not a  working-level one, sometime next week.    Spokesman Kyd said: "North Korea and the IAEA agreed during  the third contact on 17 January that future inspections will be  held to see if there have been any abnormal change  [pijonsangjogin pyonhwa] in North Korea's nuclear status [haek  hyonhwang] since the last inspection in 1993 and that it will be  a one-time only inspection."    He stressed: "The IAEA is not demanding overall inspection  of  North Korea." He added: "The two sides have agreed to include  the targets [taesang] being discussed in the current  working-level contacts in the one-time-only limited inspection  to ascertain any abnormal change."    Regarding the scope and method of inspection to ascertain  abnormal changes of North Korea's nuclear status, he said the  IAEA insists on inspecting all items of technical requirements,  while North Korea insists on limiting the targets considerably  and reducing the scope. This difference in opinion is  generating conflict.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee rally continues as pact negotiations labour on LONDON'S ROBUSTA coffee market continued to gain ground yesterday, taking heart from an overnight close above 60 cents a lb in New York's March contract. At the same time delegates to the International Coffee Organisation talks on a possible new agreement laboured on, with little sign that concrete progress will be announced when they close on Friday. ICO delegates were dismayed by the March New York contract's 6.75 cent tumble to 56.05 cents a lb last week. But the plunge appears not to have fuelled any burning desire to reach agreement during the present round of negotiations. 'I can't think of one thing that we have actually agreed in the last few days,' one consumer delegate said yesterday. In late trading New York was almost 3 cents ahead, while London's May contract closed Dollars 38 up at Dollars 945 a tonne, well above last week's low of Dollars 801. The recent volatility of the coffee market has been caused not by news from the ICO talks, which has followed much the same pattern as the last few meetings, but by the weight of investment fund money being moved around in New York. But the fundamental supply and demand factors suggest that prices should be beginning to move ahead. In a briefing paper headed 'Who needs a coffee pact?' GNI, the London futures broker, suggests that even without the help of an agreement, coffee should bounce from its current oversold condition back to around 75 cents a lb on tight supply alone. GNI points out that the Brazilian crop for the 1992-93 year (ending in April) of below 20m bags (60 kg each) represents a 25 per cent reduction on the three previous years. . . 'and a 25 per cent fall in production from the world's largest producer is enough to scare any commodity market'. Yesterday a separate report from ED &amp; F. Man estimated Brazil's crop for 1993-94 at 21.52m bags - slightly below most trade estimates, which have ranged between 22m and 23m bags. The news helped to support yesterday's price advance. According to GNI, the fall in Brazilian output will leave consumer stocks at the end of this season 25 per cent below the 1990-91 peak of 19.7m bags. 'By the end of the 1993-94 season, consumer inventories should be close to more normal levels of around 12m bags.' GNI believes that if good progress is made at the ICO, 'then it is possible that a major rally back to Dollars 1 a lb is on the cards.' However, the ICO has already fixed a further meeting for the last week of March. The agreement runs out on March 31. Yesterday producers and consumers were still locked in negotiation over 'selectivity' - which would determine whether three or four different sorts of coffee would be exported under a future ICO quota scheme. Producers favour four, while consumers prefer three.</p>

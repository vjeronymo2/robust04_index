In April 1992 the NRC developed an ``Action Plan'' (57 FR 13389) to ensure timely remediation of SDMP sites. In the action plan, NRC staff identified inadequate site characterization as one of the technical issues that has delayed the timely approval and implementation of site-specific decommissioning actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The main objectives of the site characterization for decommissioning include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To quantify the physical and chemical characteristics of radiological contamination and to assess the extent of contaminant distribution including the rate(s) of migration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To quantify environmental parameters that significantly affect potential human exposure from existing and potential future radiological contamination under unrestricted use conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=3 -->  <DOCTITLE>Public Workshop To Exchange Information and Lessons Learned in Site Characterization for Decommissioning of Radioactively Contaminated Sites</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <AGENCY> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> AGENCY:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </AGENCY> <ACTION> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ACTION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of public workshop. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=59 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <SUMMARY> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUMMARY:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This notice is to inform the public of a workshop to exchange information and review lessons learned in the characterization of radioactively contaminated decommissioning sites. The workshop will discuss the NRC draft guidance on site characterization for decommissioning and address generic issues related to NRC's decommissioning sites, such as characterization of sites and associated environmental media, types and extent of contamination, and environmental impacts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES AND LOCATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The workshop will be held on November 29&hyph;30, 1994.

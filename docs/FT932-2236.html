			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE EXPIRY of the June series in both the FT-SE futures and the traded options provided the main spur for trade in the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100, having opened at 2884, squeezed forward to 2890 before mid-morning expiry at 2882 on volume of 3,439 lots. The September contract then took over as the near month contract and having opened at 2,904, traded at a strong premium to cash for the rest of the session, with heavy arbitrage between the September contract and cash. Nomura International bought the contract aggressively but enthusiasm eased later and September finished at 2,905, 10 above estimated fair value of 15. Volume was 8269. In traded options, June index options expired, but total volume at 22,477 was below recent levels. Some 9,070 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,005 in the Euro-FT-SE. Sears was the most active option with a total of 1,963 contracts.</p>

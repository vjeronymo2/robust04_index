A lawyer  with a length of service of almost 40 years. He has risen to his  present very high position from the lowest rung, having missed  none. He tells a good joke. He does not respond to criticism in  the press but does not shun meetings with correspondents.    [Skvirenko] Let us begin the discussion with a most general  question: What impression of the present would you note as being  characteristic of today's crime situation?    [Barbalat] I have tried several contrasting criminal cases  in  succession recently. In Yedinets a son killed his father. In  Stefan Vode a father killed his child. I recently took part in a  trial in Kahula in which there should have been in the dock  instead of the young man accused of having killed two persons  his mother, perhaps.... You know what frightens me? The  severance of the ties between the generations. The ties that  hold together the moral health of both the family and society.    [Skvirenko] You spent two days in Kahula, I believe?    [Barbalat] Four. It was a very serious business.    [Skvirenko] Describe it in more detail, if you can.    [Barbalat] It is essentially a graphic example of the tragic  consequences of the disintegration of the family. Husband and  wife did not get on. The man had been free with his fists, for  which he had done time, and once at liberty, he left is wife and  two sons and went away. In her search for consolation the woman  took to liquor. And she turned her home into a den of iniquity,  collecting drinking companions aged 17 to 70.    [Skvirenko] And what about the sons?    [Barbalat] The elder went into the army and is serving as a  warrant officer. The younger one--he is 31--also earned a  living. But things were harder for him. He would hear  continually from people: There's your mother cavorting around  drunk--come and get her. Or he would be called to come and  restore order in the house--the drinking companions would be  letting themselves go once again.... So it was on this occasion  also. He went to his mother's, there were two others there. One  was about 60, the other, 40. The 40-year-old, bare to the waist,  had struggled into his mother's winter coat, with a fur collar.  The young man suggested that they cut it out, they set about  him. With language and threats. And he then threw them out onto  the street and then beat them up such that one died on the spot,  the other, in hospital.    [Skvirenko] A karate expert, perhaps?    [Barbalat] Not to look at. He is puny in appearance. Those  two were far bigger and healthier. But he gave them such a  thrashing--something fearful. And here he is in the dock. I  asked the mother: Have you any understanding that it is  primarily you who are to blame for the fact that those two were  killed, for the fact that your son is on trial, for what  threatens him?..." "Yes, I am to blame, please do not pass  judgment on him...." But a life has already been maimed, and the  people cannot be brought back. And all because people have lost  their human qualities.    [Skvirenko] There is more freedom, but we are not seeing  that  it has been to everyone's benefit.    [Barbalat] No, we proclaim freedom of the personality. But  note: freedom of the personality, not freedom of the animal. The  personality is a product of culture, it means respect for other  personalities. Oversimplification is very dangerous here. But  that which is simpler is very much in vogue with us. People say:  Let us restore the economy. Once people are living better, they  will become kinder of their own accord.    [Skvirenko] We have already been through this, it would  seem....    [Barbalat] Or even to boast that adolescents are washing  cars  and selling cigarettes--just like in the West, where the  children of millionaires deliver newspapers. But it is clean  forgotten here that socioeconomic conditions with us have as yet  undergone merely superficial changes and that our tenor of life  is changing as yet merely in the sense that it is being  destroyed. And destruction is always a very painful process.    [Skvirenko] With unclear prospects, what is more.    [Barbalat] And the result is that from whatever side the  problem is viewed, it is a problem of people's relationships.  How to resolve it? By education? Compulsion? For several years  our educationists pushed the idea of the establishment of the  responsibility of the parents for their children's incorrect  behavior.    [Skvirenko] There is something in this, it would seem....    [Barbalat] Exactly as much as there was in another idea,  when  in the years of the punitive measures children paid for their  convicted parents.    [Skvirenko] But there was another proposition also: "I am  responsible for everything!"    [Barbalat] A handsome declaration. But it is in fact  necessary for everyone to be responsible primarily for his  conduct. Before both his conscience and the law. Only on this  basis are normal human relationships possible.    [Skvirenko] But there should, after all, be some principle  of  the creation of this basis?    [Barbalat] There is just one principle: People need to be  made accustomed to order not by talk, not by declarations, but  by order. By the precision of demands and rules. By the clarity  of the structures and the logic of their functioning. It is from  such an approach, incidentally, that the principle of the  separation of the branches of power ensues.    [Skvirenko] I was looking for an opportunity to ask about  this--about what the feelings of the third, judicial, estate  are. Journalist colleagues of mine call themselves the fourth  estate, incidentally, but this sounds nothing more than a joke.  Is this not the way it is with you?    [Barbalat] I would call our situation satisfactory.    [Skvirenko] You feel no pressure?    [Barbalat] There has been no intrusion upon our competence  on  the part of the official legislative and executive authorities.  But on the part of certain persons, among the deputies  particularly, there have been such attempts. Futile, of course.  We have official forms of interaction, after all: an appeal or  inquiry, in respect to which we examine a fact or problem and  give the proper answer.    [Skvirenko] Quite so. But there is a need for the  development  and improvement of the mechanism of the third estate itself. Do  you sense this need?    [Barbalat] I will go further. We have sent parliament, I'm  afraid to name this figure even, a whole package of bills on  questions of our activity, on judicial and legal reform. And I  would like to emphasize the profound meaning of these proposals,  which is directly connected with the subject of our  conversation: They are all ultimately dictated by an aspiration  to the fuller observance of human rights. Let us take, for  example, the structural question. We still have a two-tier  judicial system: the people's court and the Supreme Court. And  that's it. The result is that the Supreme Court is continually  acting the part of court of original jurisdiction handling the  more complex cases. Whereas its function is summary, analytical,  generalizing. But we have no courts of appeal, nor is there a  Supreme Court itself essentially. It is hard to avoid violations  of human rights in such a situation.    [Skvirenko] And the actuality of the court's independence  becomes an important facet of this problem....    [Barbalat] Of course. Although in this respect also there is  a simplistic approach, when the problem of independence is  reduced merely to the court being subordinate neither to  parliament nor the government.    [Skvirenko] But there was the instance of parliament wanting  to hear you render account of your work!    [Barbalat] Yes, and several parliamentary commissions  presented such an initiative simultaneously, incidentally. I had  to respond: If you insist, I will present a report. But I will  feel ashamed in front of my foreign colleagues. Not for myself  but for parliament, which has displayed before the world  community such a lack of respect for the fundamental principle  of democratic arrangement. In sum, I persuaded them to drop this  idea. But, I repeat, the problem of the true independence of the  court is not exhausted by such satirical-article collisions. The  main questions are rooted within the judicial system itself. For  example, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Code of Civil  Procedure with us record: Directives of the superior authority  are binding on the lower authority. But where is the  independence here, pray? At the present time there is none. I do  not want to say that the current model is necessarily fraught  with malfeasance. But... there are instances of even the judges  beginning to strike a balance. He has rendered a judgment, and  this judgment has been countermanded. Aha, the judge gets the  point, since the decision to satisfy the suit was countermanded,  we now need to deny the suit. But the Supreme Court reversed the  ruling not because the judge was wrong. But because there were  insufficient grounds for the ruling. But the judge reacts in  accordance with the rule: Since it came from the superior  authority, it is, consequently, an order. And this is wrong.    [Skvirenko] You speak so self-critically about this. We do  not hear this that often.    [Barbalat] We recently received expert findings from our  colleague on the U.S. Court of Appeals. He literally tore to  shreds our celebrated Article 54 of the Code of Civil Procedure.    [Skvirenko] And what article is this?    [Barbalat] It requires the court to assist the plaintiff and  the defendant in obtaining additional and, from the court's  viewpoint, necessary evidence. The American writes: What kind of  court is this if it may, as it chooses, assist one party in  obtaining additional evidence? There should be one rule in  court: Whatever a person has brought to court he uses as  evidence. And nothing doing, as they say, no trial either.    [Skvirenko] Strict, but fair. A deforming influence on the  judicial process is also being exerted, incidentally, by the  inequality in the position of prosecutor and attorney, which is  traditional here.    [Barbalat] There was a time when the prosecutor, generally,  exercised supervision of the activity of the court--this is now  called supervision of the legality of the adopted judicial  decisions. Such supervision is alien to normal civilized  countries. If a judicial error has been made, it is rectified  with the aid of the judicial mechanism. So the nonequivalence of  the position of prosecutor and attorney is a continuation of  that same outdated trend. Yes, all participants in the legal  process should, of course, be placed under equal conditions.  And, of course, the real independence of the court should be  assured also--then it could be said that our judiciary was  reaching the level of the world standard.    [Skvirenko] And now the most topical question. What effect  is  the election campaign, which is just getting under way, having  on your activity?    [Barbalat] It is known that we have delegated to the Central  Electoral Commission seven justices, who constitute its legal  nucleus, as it were. The Election Act made provision for five  justices, incidentally, but parliament decided to enlarge the  size of the "brigade of justices." To Lucinschi's question  concerning our attitude toward this quota, I honestly replied:  with misgivings. For it seemed to us that an opportunity to  involve us in some political games would emerge. But since this  is the decision that has been adopted, we will do everything in  our power for the strictest compliance with the requirements of  the law.    [Skvirenko] And are your misgivings being justified?    [Barbalat] As yet, no. We are not taking part in any  political or social actions even. We recently had an awkward  discussion on this subject with a television official--he  demanded in a tone of voice implying an order almost that our  representative take part in a session of a roundtable on  election matters. I categorically prohibited this. But, on the  other hand, the judges are prepared, in accordance with the law,  to examine most promptly locally all citizens' complaints on  questions of this violation or the other in the course of the  preparation and holding of the elections. And in accordance with  the law, of course, the Supreme Court has to make a final ruling  on the legality of the parliamentary elections of 27 February  1994. Generally, such a ruling should be made by a  constitutional court, but inasmuch as we do not have such,  parliament has entrusted this mission to us--in the person of a  plenum of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Moldova.    [Skvirenko] With what would you yourself like to end our  interview?    [Barbalat] I would like to return to the beginning to stress  that the court is not an organ of struggle against crime, as  certain journalists and public figures are attempting to  maintain. The idea of the court is the idea of justice ensuring  the health of the social and state organism by means of  unswerving respect for human rights. As far as the fight against  crime proper is concerned, I remember well, you know, the  programs that were drawn up in party bodies and oriented us  toward the phased eradication of crime--in terms of timeframe  and percentages, by nature and category.... Such programs do not  work! As long as civilization exists, most likely, it will be  dealing with this problem. Nonetheless, its scale and  seriousness will undoubtedly depend on all of us. And will  result primarily from our attitude toward the problems of the  youth, adolescents, and children. Let Minister for Youth Affairs  Sandulachi not be offended with me, but it seems to me that  these problems have moved somewhere toward the periphery of our  attention. For instance, adolescents left fully to their own  devices are busy with self-education in far from the best forms  and traditions.... And what do the schoolchildren do during  vacations? The camps and holiday hotels are empty, and even  passes to children's playgrounds are beyond the reach of the  majority of parents.... Where are we leading our children, our  youth?    [Skvirenko] Where are we pushing them, it would be more  correct to say.    [Barbalat] The answer to this question, unfortunately, has  to  be drawn from judicial practice. And we need, like the air we  breathe, a different practice--one of normal, valuable, healthy  relations between people. Without this nothing good with us will  result. Neither in the economy nor in policy. Neither in the  family nor in the country. For we will always get what we  deserve. No less. But no more either.</p>

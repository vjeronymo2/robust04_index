			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Q: I'm watching the stock of Wendy's. It appears to have been forming a base at  about $4 a share. Is this company a sound investment or am I just too fond of  burgers? -- Glenview, Ill.  </P> <P> A: Wendy's did bounce off the $4 level and was recently selling for nearly $5.  But don't interpret that to mean that this company isn't still in a pickle  trying to compete with the likes of McDonald's. Edward M. Tavlin, an analyst  with Josephthal &amp; Co., has a neutral opinion on Wendy's right now. "Wendy's  is a survivor involved in a continuing struggle in a very competitive market,"  says Tavlin.  </P> <P> Wendy's earned 25 cents a share in 1989, plus it had 7 cents in extraordinary  gains for a total of 32 cents. It will probably come close to that performance  in 1990, according to Tavlin.  </P> <P> Q: My inquiry has to do with Safeway Stores' 1996 warrants. A friend of mine  told me to buy them. Since Safeway has announced its intention to issue stock,  are my warrants being called? Should I buy more warrants? I'm neither a widow  nor orphan, so I don't worry about the risks involved. -- Larkspur, Calif.  </P> <P> A: You didn't give any details about the warrants, so it took some digging. But  here goes:  </P> <P> The warrants are callable by the company only after 1991. But after you wrote  your letter, Safeway indeed issued 10 million shares, representing 10% of the  company. They were priced at $11.25 a share on April 26 and closed that day in  New York at $12.375. The warrants you hold can be converted into stock at your  option. As you probably know, each warrant represents the right to purchase  approximately 0.279 common shares.  </P> <P> Q: Executives of Ames Department Stores have been buying a lot of the company's  stock lately, starting at around $12 a share. Now it sells for just above $4.  Can all these insiders be wrong? Or is Ames a smart buy? -- Grand Island, N.Y.  </P> <P> A: If Ames executives have been buying a lot of their company's stock as you  say, it just proves that insiders can be as dumb as anyone else. Since you  wrote, Ames stock has halved in price. It's now selling for just $2 a share.  And even that may be too expensive.  </P> <P> The Connecticut-based retailing company has lots of problems that began with  its 1988 acquisition of Zayre Corp. for $800 million. It couldn't turn the  discount store chain around and has been closing stores ever since.  </P> <P> Q: My question involves Skyline Corp. Why are its assets so liquid and its  stock value so low? -- Skokie, Ill.  </P> <P> A: Robert Curran, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., says Skyline's stock  has never really reflected the fact that the company has a lot of cash and very  little debt. And he can't explain why.  </P> <P> According to Curran, Skyline -- which makes recreational vehicles and  manufactured housing -- has more than $9 a share of cash on its books. Even so,  its stock was recently selling for a little over $14. Curran says the same  relationship between the amount of available cash and the stock price has  existed for years. Not too many years ago, some enterprising corporate raider  would have had his eyes on all that cash. But today, as you've probably read,  the raiders have all been put to sleep.  </P> <P> One factor that's been weighing heavily on Skyline's stock is slipping profits.  The company earned $1.53 a share in the fiscal year that ended in May, 1989.  Curran is estimating that profits will be down to 85 or 90 cents this year.  Institutional Brokers Estimate System says the most optimistic analyst is  predicting a 25-cent decline.  </P> <P> Skyline's business has been hurt by tax law changes in the mid-1980s, which  promoted the construction of apartments in suburban areas. These apartments  proved attractive competition for mobile homes. Also, when mortgage rates  declined from their peaks a decade ago, many consumers opted to splurge on  houses rather than buy mobile homes. And now, with home prices declining in  many parts of the country, the conventional single-family dwelling is an even  more attractive alternative. JOHN CRUDELE  </P></p>

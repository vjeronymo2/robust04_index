			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: THE RAIDERS: BACK TO OAKLAND;  </P> <P> LEAVING TOWN WITH AN EMPTY FEELING  </P> <P> From now on, any L.A. Coliseum games played by the Raiders belong on "America's  Funniest Home Videos."  </P> <P> The inside of the stadium is going to be as empty as the inside of a football.  Tickets will be scalped for 50 cents. The Lakers will out-draw the Raiders. The  Lazers will out-draw the Raiders. Attendance won't just be announced, it will  be identified by name. "The Raiders would like to thank our fans for coming  today -- both of them."  </P> <P> The place will look like one of those New England college gymnasiums  quarantined by an outbreak of measles. Some referee will penalize the Raider  crowd five yards for not making enough noise. John Elway will be able to  whisper his audibles. Each cheerleader will pick out one fan, and personally do  a cheer: "Gimme an R -- come on, mister, gimme an R!"  </P> <P> Until 1992, when Football's Fabulous Males officially move back to Oakland,  they are going to be persona non grata in greater metropolitan Los Angeles. The  exit ramps at Exposition and Martin Luther King on Sunday morning will be  lonelier than a country two-lane blacktop. Those parking-lot people who have  gouged you for years will pay you to park there now.  </P> <P> There won't be enough fans in the stands to work up a decent wave, which might  be the best aftermath of all of the Raiders' leaving. Marc Wilson can come back  now -- there'll be nobody left to say boo. If crowd noise affects momentum, the  Raiders had better pipe some canned noise through the loudspeakers, the way pro  wrestling does on television.  </P> <P> I can picture it now -- 15,000 people at the Raiders' 1990 home opener. Five  thousand are fans of the visiting team. Five thousand come carrying bedsheets  bearing stupid slogans that begin with the letters NBC, so they can be seen on  TV. Four thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine have nothing better to do. And then  there's that one guy with his "John 3:16" sign, who ought to go to church on  Sunday and leave us alone.  </P> <P> Lines at restrooms will be shorter than the lines outside the Hard Rock Cafe.  Steve Beuerlein will interrupt a huddle to shout at some fan to turn down his  radio. NBC, concerned about appearances, will place cardboard cutouts of fans  throughout the Coliseum. Coaches in the press box will discard their  walkie-talkies and just yell down to Art Shell.  </P> <P> "Yo, Art! Art! Cornerback's too deep! Corner's too deep!"  </P> <P> It'll be quieter than a public library. No, quieter than a Seattle Mariner  game. Construction workers could erect luxury boxes during a Raider game now,  not disturbing anybody. They ought to install parking spaces with private  speaker boxes, like a drive-in movie. Just drive right up to the sideline and  watch the game.  </P> <P> When fans yell, "Down in front!" it'll be at a player. No nets will be  necessary behind the goal posts. The security force will be reduced to four  rent-a-cops and that guy who got slapped by Zsa Zsa Gabor. Postgame garbage  detail will take about six minutes. How long does it take to pick up 18 empty  cups and two Twinkie wrappers?  </P> <P> Or, maybe we're wrong. Maybe we've got this thing backward. Maybe Raider  telephones are ringing off the hook today with requests for season tickets.  "Good morning! Thank you for calling the Los Ang . . . uh, the Raiders! All  circuits are presently busy, so please hold. Your call will be answered in  whatever order Mr. Davis receives it."  </P> <P> Season tickets, get 'em while they're cold. You say you live in the San  Fernando Valley and you don't care to make the 22-hour drive to Anaheim on  California's fun, fun, fun freeways? Then come on down to the Coliseum,  America's ghost park. One hundred thousand seats, no waiting. Bring the kids.  Bring the neighbors' kids. Drag every kid out of every mall in the whole  Valley.  </P> <P> Sorry, every Ram home game is going to be sold out until the year 2001, but the  Raiders? Hey, Good Seats R Us. It's our September Going-out-of-Business Sale!  If you need a place to meet, go see Al! If you want a better seat, go see Al!  </P> <P> Raider fans understood some of the risks of not buying tickets last season.  They chose not to buy out the stadium, except for a Bronco game and maybe one  other. They decided that if Al Davis was going, he was going no matter what  they did. They decided it was up to the politicians and stadium big shots to  save the franchise, not up to them.  </P> <P> Well, I don't know. Maybe sellout crowds, week after week, would have swayed  Al. He's big on loyalty, remember. He's sorrier than anybody that the Raiders  weren't one of the powers of the NFL these last four seasons, but then again,  they didn't exactly go down the tubes, the way the Dallas Cowboys did.  </P> <P> When St. Louis lost the NFL Cardinals, there was an argument over who or what  was responsible. The owner was upset that the team wasn't selling tickets to  enough fans. The fans were upset that the owner expected them to buy tickets to  an inferior product. The fans considered it emotional blackmail -- Give us your  money or else. Give us something to watch, the fans said, and we'll watch it.  </P> <P> Southern California's fans didn't chase away the Raiders, but they didn't  exactly fall to their knees and beg them not to go. Well, it's Northern  California's worry now. Be seeing some of you at the Coliseum next season.  Don't bother wearing black.  </P></p>

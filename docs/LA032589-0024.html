			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ANDRE PREVIN COMES BACK TO PHILHARMONIC  </P> <P> Was there just a hint of guilt in the splendid performance the Los Angeles  Philharmonic gave Thursday night, when music director Andre Previn returned to  the podium at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center?  </P> <P> Like a guilty spouse who has had a little fling while the marriage partner was  out of town, our Philharmonic seemed on terribly good behavior at this reunion  with its recently absent leader.  </P> <P> Was that merely because the players were happy to see Previn back at the  podium? Or was it an afterglow from the carryings-on with a guest conductor for  the past two weeks? Will we ever know?  </P> <P> The program that Previn is conducting this week (ending Sunday afternoon) is a  bread-and-butter agenda, beginning with Beethoven's Overture to "Fidelio" and  First Piano Concerto and culminating in Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony.  </P> <P> What made it special at this performance was the solidity and jauntiness in the  music director's bracing approach to Beethoven and the clear conviction he  brought to the manic-depressiveness of the "Pathetique" Symphony. And the  orchestra's willingness to give Previn near-complete cooperation in bringing  these scores to life.  </P> <P> Not all of the turgid textures in Tchaikovsky's emotional Sixth emerged  clarified, or transparent. But the sweep of feeling, and many of the  corroborative instrumental details, held it all together, even with occasional  blatting of tone in the climaxes. And the lush string sounds one wants and  expects at the lyric heights of the work materialized handsomely and  eloquently.  </P> <P> Celebrating the 35th anniversary of her Philharmonic debut, Alicia de Larrocha  gave as well-spoken and elegant a reading of Beethoven's C-major Concerto as  one might ever wish to hear.  </P> <P> The Spanish musician -- who made her first United States appearances here in  February, 1954, with then-music director Alfred Wallenstein and the  Philharmonic -- continues to serve as a role model for thinking pianists who  believe in the power of the instrument to produce myriad shades of color and  specific qualities of tone. She is as much an inspiration today as she was at  that long-ago but well-remembered series of debut appearances.  </P> <P> Previn and the orchestra provided stylish and attentive support, particularly  in a generously laid-out and richly songful slow movement.  </P></p>

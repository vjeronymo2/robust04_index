			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / US Money and Credit: Contrasting views fuel bullishness ARE THE US capital markets suffering from a bad bout of split personality? The question is prompted by the bullish behaviour of both stock and bond markets over the past few weeks, with the equity rally apparently underpinned by an optimistic view of the US economy, but the fixed-income rally by a pessimistic one. The stock market surge which began just before Christmas took the Dow Jones Industrial Average through the 3,200 barrier on Friday for the first time - a level which is assuming a lot of good corporate news in 1992 and 1993. A year-long upswing also continued in the bond market, where prices tend to rise on bad economic news, which implies a diminution of the inflation which undermines the value of fixed-income securities. Yet the most recent rally in Treasury prices lost a little of its momentum, yielding to a bout of profit-taking. The short and medium-term sectors suffered small price declines, with the 10-year Treasury note ending the week down  1/8 . However, the benchmark 30-year bond gained about half a point on the week, dropping the yield from 7.51 to 7.47 and helping to flatten the extremely steep yield curve. The spread between the 30 and 10-year issues narrowed from 70 basis points to 65. The primary stimulus behind the equity and bond market rallies was the dramatic easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve on December 20, when the discount rate was dropped by a full point to 3.5 per cent in an effort to jump-start the economy out of its prolonged recession, with the target for the key Fed funds rate dropping to 4 per cent. The Wall Street consensus is that while the first two quarters of 1992 could see little economic upswing, by the middle of the year the US may begin growing again at an annual rate of around 3 per cent - extremely modest by the standards of past recoveries. The recovery will be impeded by a deteriorating international economic outlook, high levels of personal and corporate debt, and severely undermined consumer confidence. However, while the stock market is focusing on the apparently better - although still highly uncertain - prospects for the second half of 1992 and 1993, the bond market is concentrating on the problems likely over the next six months and prospects for yet Certainly the economic indicators released over the past week have done little to dispel the economic gloom. The index of manufacturing activity produced by the National Association of Purchasing Managers dipped below 50 per cent in December for the first time since June. This suggests the sector is contracting again. This Friday will bring employment figures for December, and these are expected to show a further deterioration. Against this background, many analysts are expecting further Fed easing during the current quarter, with the Fed funds rate dropping to 3.75 per cent or even 3.5 before its monetary stance begins to tighten. That in turn should feed through to much lower rates at the long end of the maturity spectrum, since two of the factors which have most unsettled the bond market recently now seem less of a threat. One is politics, where talk of stimulative fiscal packages by Congress repeatedly unsettled Wall Street last autumn. Given that this is a presidential election year, some action is inevitable in Washington. However the market is growing increasingly confident that this will involve more showmanship than substance, with neither President Bush nor Congress willing to significantly increase the already bloated federal budget deficit. The other benign factor is the trend of inflation, which is likely to decelerate further over the next few months, thanks to the continued economic stagnation. And it is in their expectations for low inflation, coupled with some kind of second-half economic recovery, that the bond and equity markets find some common ground for their collective optimism. Whether this is justified is another matter. The bond market team at brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette argues that the inflation rate will be no less than 4 per cent over the next few years, on the grounds that capacity utilisation is already relatively high, the unemployment rate is not that low by past standards, and the top concern of the monetary authorities is a restimulation of economic activity. Certainly, inflation is likely to seem more of a threat as the year proceeds, and the yield on the long bond, which some expect to touch 7 per cent in the first half, could be back on a rising trend by mid-year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Last    1 week   4 wks  12-month  12-month                         Friday    ago     ago      High      Low  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fed Funds (weekly average)   3.75    4.00     4.37    11.00     2.00 Three-month Treasury bills                    3.93    3.93     4.34     8.29     3.76 Six-month Treasury bills 4.00    4.01     4.37     7.70     3.95 Three-month prime CDs    4.12    4.35     4.75     7.17     4.12 30-day Commercial Paper         4.20    5.00     4.90     7.12     4.20 90-day Commercial Paper         4.10    4.50     4.70     5.02    4.10  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Last      Change           1 week    4 wk                          Fri.      on wk    Yield     ago     ago  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Seven-year Treasury    103 13/32   - 7/32   6.48     6.44    6.74 20-year Treasury       119 9/32    + 5/8    7.17     7.24    7.50 30-year Treasury       106 7/32   + 15/32   7.47     7.51    7.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Money supply: In the week ended December 23, M1 rose by dollars 0.1bn to dollars 898.5bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

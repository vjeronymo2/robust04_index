			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Staff are bearing cost of higher education changes Several features of the chancellor's statement on pay in the public sector are worthy of further exploration ('Unions warn of 'chaos' over public pay stance', September 15). First, we have argued that a specific element of additional direct taxation should he spent on higher education. The Treasury has always replied that it is opposed in principle to hypothecated taxes. The chancellor has now decided to introduce what is a bizarre form of hypothecated taxation applied to higher education staff. Their employers have received increased income because of growth in student numbers and despite 'efficiency savings'. They are being told not to spend any of this money on staff pay increases and I can only assume that it will be spent on current or future provision in each institution. In short, the staff have been taxed specifically to provide for any changes in provision in their place of work as an alternative to doing so through general taxation. And so it will be for nurses, doctors and health ancillary staff. They will be 'taxed' to provide for change in their places of work. Second, the chancellor has drawn attention to payment in return for productivity. While that is not easily measured in some areas of public provision, I can report that in six years the number of higher education students has grown by 50 per cent, the number of staff by only 10 per cent, and the decrease in the unit of resource is 20 per cent. The FT might find it interesting to identify a single area of British industry which competes with this success story. I suspect, unworthy though the thought may be, that we will not be offered a pay settlement which reflects these productivity accomplishments. Some reason for denying the chancellor's proposition will be pleaded in aid and he will do the pleading.

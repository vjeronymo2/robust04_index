			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENTS OFFER HOUSING ASSISTANCE  </P> <P> Families, particularly first-time home buyers, are increasingly unable to  afford a home at current prices. The California Assn. of Realtors estimates  that only 18% of Los Angeles County households can afford to purchase the  county's median-priced home, which cost about $205,000 in September.  </P> <P> For that 18%, affordability requires that a family earn at least $67,000 a  year, can afford to pay 30% of their income toward their mortgage and can  scrape together a down payment of about $41,000, association spokesman Jeff  Hershberger said.  </P> <P> Because high home prices threaten to destroy the American dream of home  ownership for many, government at all levels has debated stepping in. In the  Nov. 6 election, voters had to decide on housing assistance plans that would  use tax dollars. Potential sources of government help have included the  following:  </P> <P> Federal Government: The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act.  </P> <P> Status: Passed by both houses of Congress. President Bush has until the end of  November to sign the legislation.  </P> <P> Amount of Money: $27.5 billion for fiscal 1991 and $29.9 billion for fiscal  1992.  </P> <P> Details: Creates a revolving loan fund to buy down interest rates for  first-time home buyers who earn up to 95% of the median income where they live.  Assists families in public housing to buy their units. The bill also provides  for government-subsidized private apartments to remain affordable.  </P> <P> State Government: Proposition 145.  </P> <P> Status: Defeated Nov. 6 by California voters.  </P> <P> Amount of Money: $325 million in general-obligation bonds.  </P> <P> Details: Would have provided about $200 million to assist moderate-income,  first-time home buyers. Plans for the remainder of the money included making  affordable rental housing earthquake-safe and providing shelter and  transitional housing for the homeless.  </P> <P> City Government: Proposition K, a bond issue in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Status: Passed Nov. 6 by Los Angeles voters.  </P> <P> Amount of Money: $100 million in municipal bonds.  </P> <P> Details: Establishes a $10-million revolving fund to provide loans to  first-time home buyers and allocates $10 million to create short-term,  transitional housing for homeless families. The proposition also provides funds  to make buildings earthquake-secure.  </P> <P> City Government: Redevelopment funds.  </P> <P> Status: Available now in many cities.  </P> <P> Amount of Money: At least $121 million in Los Angeles County, according to the  Southern California Assn. of Governments.  </P> <P> Details: City redevelopment agencies are required to set aside a certain amount  of their revenue to fund low- and moderate-income housing projects. Much of  this money, which continues to accumulate, has never been used by city  governments. HOWARD BLUME  </P></p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a Glance): With-profits bond from CU Commercial Union Life is launching a new with-profits bond, which will initially offer an annual bonus of 9.5 per cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, with a front end charge of 5 per cent. CU has maintained the right to make 'market value adjustments', which means that there could be penalties for early surrender. CU is making the second highest pay-outs on 25-year endowments of those offices which have so far announced their bonuses, and hopes to profit from the current popularity of the bonds - for example, Norwich Union's with-profits bond, now largely withdrawn from the market because the office was suffering capital strain, raised Pounds 700m last year alone.</p>

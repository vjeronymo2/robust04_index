			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Entirely Just Compatriotic Step" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN  analyst today says it is an entirely just compatriotic step both  from the humanitarian and national point of view that the North  side recently proposed to the South side through a telephone  message that Kim Chi-hyon, now an inpatient of the hospital  attached to Hanyang National University in Seoul, be brought to  the North for medical treatment.    Noting that Kim Chi-hyon, the first-born daughter of Kim  Pyong- chu, an unconverted prisoner who died a few years ago  after his release from prison, is a righteous-minded girl who  attended on Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the Korean  People's Army, when he was in a critical condition after a  cerebral haemorrhage at the Pusan University Hospital, the news  analyst says:    She had to have her ribs cut off in an operation for T.B.  pyothorax at the hospital. Now, she is in a very critical  condition, the inflammation spreading to the region of vertebrae.    She is aware that even a moment's suspension of treatment  will endanger her life. Yet, she is intending to leave the  hospital. She has to take care of three younger brother and  sisters without anyone to rely on, and is unable to pay the  daily increasing charges for hospitalization and operation.    We, as fellow countrymen, can never overlook the miserable  situation of the 29-year-old fragile girl who is suffering from  both a serious disease and mental ailments.    We deem it our bounden duty and obligation to fetch them to  the northern half of the country at an early date to give  medical treatment and take care of their life.    At present, a state of acute confrontation has been created  between the North and the South. But that must not be an  obstacle to the transfer of Kim Chi-hyon to the North.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst says the South Korean Red Cross must  take an appropriate step at an early date to ensure that Kim  Chi-hyon and her three brother and sisters receive medical  treatment and be granted protection for their life in the  northern half of the country, as proposed by the North.</p>

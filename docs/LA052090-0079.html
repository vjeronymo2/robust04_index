			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS MAKE IT LOOK QUEASY, 15-12;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: THEY LOSE TO PHILLIES IN 11TH INNING AFTER BULLPEN WASTES TWO LEADS  IN FIRST NINE INNINGS.  </P> <P> The Dodger bullpen has blown another game in the late innings.  </P> <P> Philadelphia's Rod Booker hit a three-run triple off a weary Jay Howell in the  11th inning Saturday night to give the Phillies a 15-12 victory, the fourth  Dodger loss caused by the bullpen in the late innings this season.  </P> <P> Before what remained of a crowd of 44,703 at Dodger Stadium, Howell hit Ricky  Jordan with a pitch, gave up a single by John Kruk, and one out later Dickie  Thon singled to load the bases for Booker, who came to the plate one out later.  He hit the ball into the right-center field gap, scoring three runs.  </P> <P> Howell should not have even been in the game, as the Dodgers wanted to rest him  after his strong comeback from knee surgery Friday night, during which he  pitched two innings. But Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda had little choice, and  brought Howell into the game to start the 10th.  </P> <P> The game began, and appeared to end, with Kal Daniels' grand slam in the fourth  inning. That gave the Dodgers a 8-5 lead.  </P> <P> But the Dodgers, who already knew their middle relief pitchers are not very  dependable, learned they are also not very original. Thirteen days after the  Dodger bullpen blew a 5-1 lead against Philadelphia, they blew two leads  against against the Phillies.  </P> <P> Mike Maddux, the second reliever to follow an ineffective Fernando Valenzuela,  gave up a run in the sixth inning. Two innings later, Tim Crews gave up four  consecutive hits, two runs scoring on Kruk's single, to make the score 8-8.  </P> <P> The Dodgers appeared to win it again in the bottom of the eighth, when Alfredo  Griffin scored on Darrel Akerfelds' wild pitch, and Daniels later singled for  his fifth RBI of the night.  </P> <P> But Don Aase and John Wetteland combined to blow another Dodger lead, and  nearly the game, by giving up four runs in the top of the ninth. The keys were  a two-run single by Tommy Herr and an RBI grounder by Jordan that shortstop  Griffin threw into the Phillie dugout to account for another run.  </P> <P> Where was Howell? The Dodgers didn't want to use him because on Friday night he  threw his first two innings in 27 days after arthroscopic knee surgery.  </P> <P> But 10 minutes after the Phillies took the lead in the ninth, the Dodger  offense rescued the bullpen again. With the Dodgers trailing, 12-10, John  Shelby hit a two-run double off reliever Roger McDowell. The Dodgers appeared  ready to win it then, as Shelby moved to third base on catcher Darren Daulton's  fielding error with no outs.  </P> <P> But after the Phillies intentionally walked both Griffin and Mike Scioscia,  Juan Samuel laid down a poor suicide squeeze bunt that resulted in Shelby being  thrown out at the plate. Stan Javier then flied out to shallow left field and  Mickey Hatcher hit a grounder to shortstop Thon to end the inning.  </P> <P> In the eighth inning, Griffin nearly became the Dodgers' hero. After he singled  against Akerfelds, the Dodgers took a chance on a hit-and-run play with  Scioscia batting.  </P> <P> Scioscia hit a grounder to Herr, who caught it near second base and tried to  step on the bag. But Griffin was already there, and in the confusion among  those two and shortstop Thon, the ball popped from Herr's glove and rolled into  center field.  </P> <P> Griffin went to third on the error. On the next pitch, as Griffin danced off  third base, Akerfelds threw the ball into the dirt and Griffin scored. The  Dodgers added another run later in the inning on Daniels' RBI single.  </P> <P> The eighth inning nearly overshadowed Daniels' first dramatic statement as a  Dodger: a 400-foot grand slam against Don Carman that gave the Dodgers that 8-5  lead in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> Daniels' first career grand slam was laced with answers for those who  questioned the trade that brought him here from Cincinnati last season.  </P> <P> It came in his 32nd game in this 36-game season, not a bad attendance mark for  a player who some said would miss many games because of bad knees. And it came  against a left-handed pitcher, who the left-handed batting Daniels is not  supposed to be able to hit.  </P> <P> The night featured a couple of other brash Dodger statements.  </P> <P>  -- Javier, the outfielder acquired from Oakland for Willie Randolph last week,  proved that perhaps he can make the Dodgers not miss their favorite player. He  saved a run in the first inning with a diving catch in center field, then set  up Daniels' heroics with a two-out, two-strike RBI single in the fourth.  </P> <P>  -- Fernando Valenzuela, who many thought had returned to his earlier form with  three victories in his last four starts, proved that such thinking is still  premature. Once again, he looked more like 1988.  </P> <P> Valenzuela was given a 3-0 Dodger lead against previously unbeaten Phillies'  starter Dennis Cook in the second inning, but gave it back by giving up five  runs on six hits in the fourth inning. He finally departed with one out in the  fifth inning after giving up five runs on nine hits, a season high in both  categories.  </P> <P> By then, the Dodgers were already in the lead thanks to Daniels.  </P></p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Gatwick BA staff threaten to strike TRAVELLERS may face another airport strike this week if talks over pay and conditions break down today, the GMB general union has warned. Mr David Warburton, national officer of the union, said yesterday that his 300 white-collar members at Gatwick Airport, who include flight controllers and computer staff, were still 'very much in dispute' with British Airways even though a similar dispute with the TGWU transport union had been resolved. The dispute centres on BA's subsidiary company at Gatwick, BA EOG.</p>

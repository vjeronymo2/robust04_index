			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING in the FT-SE future formed a mixed pattern with a sluggish start and a late rally, Christine Buckley writes. In a dull morning, volume was low in the December contract on the FT-SE 100. Much of the trading was conducted by independent traders although some US buying was in evidence. After opening at 3,115, the contract dipped to its lowest level of the day at 3,109 in the mid morning. But some vigour was stimulated in the afternoon. US unemployment figures triggered a strong US bond performance and similar strong showings were seen in European markets. A technical spur came from traders buying into the contract to avoid short positions on Monday. With some brokers system buying, the contract climbed about 20 points in the last hour or so to reach a close of 3,143 with 6,298 contracts traded - the technical push taking the contract to a 17 point lead over the fair value premium to cash. In traded options, FT-SE volume was strong at 17,903 lots.</p>

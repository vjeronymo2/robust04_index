			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (7): Noted for foreign talent - The music scene: Zurich offers a varied repertoire, and performances should be good. But don't expect the avant garde Zurich's private banks, Alpine views and chocolate truffes may be unmistakably Swiss, but its musical life is heavily dependent on imported talent. That gives it a more international character than most European cities of comparable size. Insecure about their own artistic merits, the Swiss have used their money to tap into Europe's cultural mainstream. In return, Zurich has provided foreign artists from Wagner onwards with a haven of wealth and stability. This means that, while Zurich may not be the cradle of the avant garde, it offers dependable performances, varied repertoire and appreciative audiences. For the visitor in search of a civilised evening, the Opera House and the Tonhalle concert hall are the places to be. Both were built a century ago by the Viennese architectural team of Fellner and Helmer, whose sense of proportion and stucco ceiling decorations provide a handsome central European atmosphere. The Opera House, situated next to the lake, is run on a semi-stagione basis not unlike Covent Garden. The season comprises around 25 operas, each performed in a properly rehearsed series. In any given week, you might have three operas and a ballet to choose from, perhaps with a song recital or chamber music concert on a Monday. Casts are a mixture of youth and experience. Zurich may be a small speck on the map for Pavarotti and Domingo, but it regularly attracts divas such as Agnes Baltsa and Gwyneth Jones. This season's highlights include Verdi's 'Falstaff' staged by Jonathan Miller, Handel's 'Alcina' conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Mozart's 'Le nozze di Figaro' with Ruggero Raimondi. Performances are sung in the original language without surtitles - but the programme-sellers will provide an English synopsis free of charge. The theatre has good acoustics and an attractive neo-baroque lay-out, with galleries and side-boxes. The best seats and sight-lines are in the central and rear stalls, which cost up to SFr200 (Pounds 90). You can eat before the performance in Belcanto, the upbeat Italian restaurant attached to the theatre, but nearby hotels and restaurants offer a more relaxed meal after the performance - as long as you book in advance. Zurich's opera public is smart and cosmopolitan. The atmosphere at the Tonhalle is more sedate. Like the Opera House, the exterior of the building has been spoilt by redevelopment, but the interior - a shoe-box design with a resonant acoustic - is magnificently intact. The Tonhalle Orchestra has a distinguished history and a well-blended sound. Its problem is complacency: it hardly ever tours or makes records, and is run by a variety of commissions and committees - a very Swiss arrangement which militates against dynamic artistic leadership. Audiences are dominated by subscription-holders, but each programme is given three or four times, so tickets are never hard to find. A good seat in the body of the hall costs around SFr100 (Pounds 45). The standard of guest conductors and soloists is comparable to a good regional orchestra in Britain. This season's highlights are a Lutoslawski cycle and a series pairing the conductor-oboeist Heinz Holliger with the pianist Andras Schiff. A big shake-up is expected when the American conductor David Zinman takes over as chief conductor in 1995, the Tonhalle's centenary. Zurich has several good choral societies, and the Zurich Chamber Orchestra gives concerts about once a month, often with instrumental soloists of the old school. Both the Tonhalle and the Migros retail co-operative promote concerts by touring orchestras, and there some high-powered recitals - but to get a good seat you have to book well in advance.

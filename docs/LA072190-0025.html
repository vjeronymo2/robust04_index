			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> HONORS FOR PRIEST POSTPONED 2 MONTHS  </P> <P> A dinner in honor of Father Luis Olivares, the former pastor of Our Lady Queen  of Angels Roman Catholic Church and a tireless crusader on behalf of Latino  immigrants and refugees, has been postponed to Sept. 5. The event, chaired by  Mayor Tom Bradley and union leader Cesar Chavez, originally was planned for  earlier this month.  </P> <P> It was postponed after Olivares fell ill and was diagnosed with AIDS. His  doctors said he apparently contracted the disease from contaminated syringes  while undergoing treatment for other maladies during his travels to Central  America. Representatives of Los Angeles' religious, political and entertainment  communities will host the event at Olvera Street Plaza near downtown as a  tribute to Olivares and his work, said Linda Mitchell of United Way and one of  the event's organizers. She added that the city of Los Angeles will declare  Sept. 5 Father Olivares Day.  </P></p>

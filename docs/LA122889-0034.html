			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: CASH GIFTS TO BOSS ARE IMPROPER  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- The boss was given $100 each by two married men. She is  married, and she took it for a Christmas present.  </P> <P> I say no married man with any morals would consider doing this, especially if  he thought anything of home and family. And no married woman with morals would  accept a gift of that amount.  </P> <P> So that means the two men were without morals to offer it, and she had no  morals in taking it.  </P> <P> I think it was tasteless and rude. One of the wives is thinking of divorcing  her husband over it. It's full of trouble for all three parties.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners hopes that you are not the wife thinking of  divorcing her husband, and that you will discourage any such action in cases of  which you know. The situation you describe is trouble, all right, but it's not  that much trouble.  </P> <P> Presents to one's boss are inappropriate from any employee. Money given in a  working situation at the end of the year is called a Christmas bonus, and it is  properly given by a boss to employees.  </P> <P> To violate this practice may be foolish or subservient, but it is not immoral.  And who is married and what anybody thinks of his family has nothing whatever  to do with it.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- My husband and I were invited to a Christmas party, with  an "open house" invitation of the kind that you buy at a stationery store. It  did not indicate the proper form of dress. We are all professional people in  our early 30s.  </P> <P> We arrived at this party in casual dress (my husband was without a jacket or  tie and in deck shoes, and I was in slacks and a sweater) and were surprised to  find ourselves at a dressy and catered affair. Many of the male guests were in  tuxedos, and the rest were in jacket and tie. The women were all in holiday  dresses.  </P> <P> It was obvious when we arrived that the hostess was not pleased with our dress.  We spent the first half-hour wondering when we could leave. Finally we  retreated to the kitchen until we felt it appropriate to excuse ourselves.  </P> <P> When I saw the hostess at work afterward, I thanked her and said that we  thought it would be a more casual affair, otherwise we would have dressed more  appropriately. She responded, "Oh, well, we had a little bit of everything." I  thought this response was flippant.  </P> <P> This experience leaves us wondering what went wrong and hoping that it will  never happen again. We feel that hosts have a responsibility to inform their  guests, either directly or through the tone of the invitation, if the dress is  to be anything but casual.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- While it is true that hosts are supposed to indicate what  dress will be appropriate to their parties, Miss Manners is not going to  exonerate you as thoroughly as you are prepared to exonerate yourself.  </P> <P> Among adults, standard dress is business attire, unless you are informed -- or  know, from intimacy with the hosts' habits -- otherwise. That is what you  should have worn. The men in tuxedos were every bit as wrong in their dress as  you were.  </P> <P> But why do you object to your hostess being cheerfully flippant after the fact?  Her comment, generalizing the error and trivializing it, seems to Miss Manners  to have been in the right tone. Would you have preferred "Next time you'll know  better"?  </P></p>

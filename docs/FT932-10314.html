			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / 'Bosnia' warning to S Africans SOUTH African President F W de Klerk and the African National Congress both warned at the weekend that the mobilisation of right-wing whites could turn South Africa into a new Bosnia, Patti Waldmeir reports from Johannesburg. In a tough statement aimed at demonstrating to his nervous supporters that the government is able to control left- and right-wing violence, Mr de Klerk warned that 'extremists on the left or the right should not underestimate the government's power and its resources'. The ANC said: 'The people of South Africa will not . . . be blackmailed into accepting schemes that seek to turn South Africa into another Bosnia.' Both were reacting to moves last week to set up a united front of right-wing parties to press for Afrikaner self-determination in constitutional negotiations. Those talks have now reached a crucial point, with negotiators promising to set a date for the first all-race elections - and agree principles of a new constitution - within four weeks.</p>

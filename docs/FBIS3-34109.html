The source said that the two Yemeni leaders, in separate  telephone contacts with Jordanian officials on 2 February, asked  for Jordan's help in carrying out this disengagement.    The source said that His Majesty King Husayn contacted the  two Yemeni leaders on the phone last Tuesday, at which time they  agreed to meet in Amman on Sunday to sign the accord on settling  the crisis.    The General People's Congress [GPC], headed by Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has ruled out the possibility of  an early signing of the national reconciliation agreement to end  the political crisis, blaming its rival the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] for this delay.    On 2 February, President Salih said that the agreement would  be signed in the Jordanian capital on Saturday, but Planning  Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, a GPC member, ruled out the  early signing of the agreement.    Al-Iryani told a news conference that no arrangements have  been made to sign the agreement either in Amman or in Yemen  since the YSP, under Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has come  forth with new conditions.    Al-Iryani said that the GPC was preparing to go to Amman on  Saturday but that information became available indicating that  new conditions have been set and that he could not now say if  the GPC would go to Amman on Saturday.    Al-Iryani added: The new conditions deal with  constitutional, security, military, and legal affairs that were  not mentioned in the agreement that the committee comprising  representatives from all parties, including the GPC and YSP,  reached in mid-January. The minister said: This is a new  interpretation and this is strange and surprising.    Al-Iryani did not elaborate further, but political sources  say that it seems that the YSP is asking for guarantees from the  security bodies that are run by President Salih's supporters  concerning the safety of its officials, and insists that the  agreement be implemented before all of its officials return to  Sanaa.    Al-Iryani said: The GPC has no reservations about the  contents of the agreement. We are ready to sign everything that  it contains. The GPC is even ready to sign it on board a vessel  in high seas. He added: The GPC's stand is that the agreement  should be signed as soon as possible without any obstacles.  Those who set new conditions should be held responsible.    The YSP yesterday said it seized antiaircraft missiles while  its northern adversaries were moving them toward the south.    This announcement highlights the crisis that threatens Yemen  with fragmentation and takes place at a time when political  leaders have ruled out the possibility of an early signing of  the agreement.    A YSP spokesman said that a southern brigade seized an army  vehicle carrying 40 antiaircraft missiles from the north to the  south.</p>

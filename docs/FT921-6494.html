			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Aerospatiale seeks Russian role in Airbus RUSSIAN aircraft manufacturers including Tupolev and Ilyushin have been approached by Aerospatiale of France to consider possible collaboration in the development of a new 600-seat jumbo airline with the European Airbus consortium. Mr Henri Martre, the chairman of the French state-controlled aerospace company which owns a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus, said at the Singapore Air Show yesterday that Aerospatiale was trying to introduce former Soviet as well as Asian co-operation in future Airbus plans to build an ultra-large aircraft. He said Aerospatiale had established links two years ago with the Soviet aircraft industry which were growing rapidly. Apart from the new jumbo project, Aerospatiale is considering joint development of a new light civil helicopter with Russian partners and is discussing Russian participation in the long-term possible development of a second generation supersonic aircraft. Airbus said yesterday it has so far not had any direct contact with Russian aircraft manufacturers over its proposals to develop a 600-seat jumbo. But it added that under the Airbus system, each partner in the consortium was free to subcontract work and development to other companies. Mr Martre said the huge costs of developing a new 600-seat aircraft would require wider co-operation than under the current Airbus partnership. The Commonwealth of Independent States had a powerful aeronautical and space industry and could become an important partner, he added. Airbus is also expected to start delivering soon the first of five A310 wide-body aircraft worth about Dollars 400m (Pounds 228.5m) ordered by Aeroflot. Deliveries of the aircraft have been delayed because financing had to be renegotiated. Mr Martre remained cautious about the eventual timing of the launch of a 600-seat aircraft programme. Preliminary studies to define the aircraft were likely to take at least five years. Mr Martre added that the market for such an aircraft was not at present sufficiently large to launch a programme. The former Soviet aircraft industry is desperate for western partners and investment, writes Anthony Robinson. In return it offers a combination of high-quality design skills, long experience in rugged airframe design and construction and a cheap, highly qualified labour force. The industry faces a difficult future following the big cutback in military orders and long delays in bringing new civilian projects like the Ilyushin IL-96, replacement of the long-range IL-62 and the medium-range Tupolev Tu-204, into mass production.</p>

The Ministry's representative, Mikhail Demurin, declared  that  what the Polish president had said during his visit to Latvia  was not conducive to stability in the Baltic region and was an  affront to the spirit of Polish-Russian agreements.    On 24 February, during an official visit to Latvia,  President  Lech Walesa said that the excessive concentration of Russian  troops in the Kaliningrad district was not beneficial to  security in the Baltic region.    [Reporter] The Kaliningrad district belongs to Russia, and  everything that happens there is an internal matter for the  Russian Federation, said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov,  commenting on Lech Walesa's statement.    The spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mikhail  Demurin, added that Russia had the right to keep within the  Kaliningrad district as many troops as was necessary to ensure  security. According to Deputy Minister Krylov, President Walesa  is well aware that many Russian soldiers are in the district  temporarily. This situation arose when troops were withdrawn  from the Baltic countries, and it was impossible to relocate  them in other regions of the country.    The Russian diplomat believes that by his statement Lech  Walesa wanted to please the Latvians. According to experts,  there are at present 150,000-200,000 Russian soldiers stationed  in the Kaliningrad district.</p>

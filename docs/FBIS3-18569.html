			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Reinhard: "Rocard, the Left's Handicap"] </F>   [Excerpts] The Socialist Party (PS) is slowly recovering  from its electoral defeat. The emergence of social movements and  the impressive mobilization of lay school defenders open new  prospects for the Left. Nevertheless, if the improvement in the  partial legislative elections reinvigorates it, this does not  reverse the balance of power.    Ten months after its rout, the PS seems unable to present a  credible alternative. [passage omitted] The scars of the March  1993 defeat do not explain everything. In politics, one year is  an eternity, and the opposition has regenerative qualities. The  disaffection affecting the Left has a deeper cause: the lack of  credibility of the PS' first secretary.    At a time when [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur is  paralyzing for the moment the game on the Right because he is  considered the winner of the race to the presidency under any  circumstances, Michel Rocard is blocking the game on the Left  because he has the image of a loser. Polls indicate that he will  be beaten by a wide margin regardless of the identity of his  adversary from the majority. The most recent CSA-LE PARISIEN  poll on the popularity of presidential candidates places him in  10th place with 27 percent of the vote. Even more worrisome for  Rocard is the fact that he is far behind [EC Commission  president] Jacques Delors, who gathers 44 percent of the vote.  Rocard is even overtaken by [former Minister of Culture] Jack  Lang (28 percent).    Considering his personal qualities, the disaffection  burdening the PS boss is no doubt unfair. However, it is  explained by his inability to convince his own camp. Placed  under high-level surveillance in the PS, Rocard moreover suffers  from his being the man most detested by [President] Francois  Mitterrand, who remains the most emblematic figure of the Left.  Like [Union for French Democracy, UDF leader] Valery Giscard  d'Estaing, and to a lesser degree [Rally for the Republic, RPR,  leader] Jacques Chirac, Rocard is laboring under the burden of  the attrition affecting officials who have been in the limelight  for more than 20 years.    Rocard is the heaviest handicap of the Left, which has no  lack of talented personalities. Laurent Fabius is the most  gifted politician of the forty-something generation. Unlike the  majority, the Left also has a galaxy of (young) women  politicians capable of incarnating the future: Elisabeth Guigou,  Segolene Royal, and Martine Aubry. The emergence of the former  minister of labor is particularly significant. [passage omitted]  The changing of the guards does exist in the PS.    However, the Left is playing with marked cards. Partisan  logic will probably impose Rocard's candidacy even if the Left  has a credible candidate in Delors. He gathered 53 percent of  the vote in the last S0FRES poll, compared with 38 percent for  Rocard (69 percent among leftist partisans for Delors, 63  percent for Rocard). The former can attract beyond his camp, the  latter is contested by his own people. However, just like the  Right, the Left is intent on justifying the thesis that "the  best one loses." In this game, the socialists seem to be ahead  of the majority.</p>

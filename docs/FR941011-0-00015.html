			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Timing of the Interim Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters criticized the Service for promulgating this regulation as an interim regulation after the October 1, 1993 deadline for submitting petitions elapsed. One commenter stated that the timing of the promulgation of the Service's regulation violated the spirit of the Administrative Procedures Act and was unfair to the public by not providing the public with adequate notice of the October 1, 1993 deadline by issuing the interim rule in January of 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The timing of the interim regulation did not implicate the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) nor did it adversely impact the public. The MTINA amendments to section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT clearly superseded the Service's regulation on establishing priority dates for employment-based petitions in the case of labor certifications filed before October 1, 1991. The interim rule merely made the regulations consistent with the statute. The purpose of the regulation was to inform the public that, under section 301(e)(2) of the MTINA, if a labor certification was filed before October 1, 1991, the petitioning employer should file an employment-based petition with the Service as soon as possible to maintain the priority date. It also notified the public of the statutory requirement that if a labor certification filed before October 1, 1991 is still pending with the Department of Labor, an employment-based petition must be filed within 60 days of the date of certification to preserve the priority date. Any impact on the public therefore resulted from the enactment of section 301(e)(2) of the MTINA and not by the promulgation of the interim rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter objected to the interim rule on the ground that it had an impact on pending litigation involving substitution of labor certification beneficiaries by the employer. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kooritsky <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reich, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No. 92&hyph;5277 (D.C. Cir. March 18, 1994). In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kooritsky <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidated on APA grounds a Department of Labor regulation which eliminated substitution of labor certification beneficiaries. The commenter argued that the interim rule adversely affected an employer's ability to substitute labor certification beneficiaries, because, under the interim rule, the substituted alien will not have the original priority date if the employer failed to file an employment-based petition before the October 1, 1993 deadline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same commenter also stated that the interim rule circumvents the Department of Labor's existing rule at 20 CFR 656.30 that a labor certification is valid indefinitely. The interim rule neither affects an employer's ability to substitute labor certification beneficiaries nor the Department of Labor's regulation. By issuing this interim rule, the Service simply implemented section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA, which deals solely with preservation of priority dates. Moreover, even though the MTINA amendment may affect a pre-October 1, 1991 priority date, it has no effect on the validity of the underlying labor certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

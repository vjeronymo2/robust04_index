			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Storehouse in talks for sale of Habitat STOREHOUSE, the UK retailing group, is negotiating the sale of Habitat, its home furnishing chain, to Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer. Talks are also being held with Sears, the retail and mail order group, which is understood to be interested in buying Richards, the Storehouse women's wear business. City analysts estimate the two deals could raise up to Pounds 70m for Storehouse, though the negotiations have yet to resolve a number of 'issues of substance', according to one source. Habitat, founded by Sir Terence Conran, was one of the high street successes of the 1960s and early 1970s. Its cheap, well-designed furnishings epitomised the lifestyle of young professional people. It failed, however, to keep pace with the retail revolution it helped to create. In the past two years, it has closed a quarter of its UK stores and losses have amounted to more than Pounds 20m. Habitat's French operations, in which Au Printemps, the French retailer, was recently reported to be interested, are profitable; but the US business lost Pounds 7.7m last year. Ikea has prospered in the UK since it opened its first superstore at Warrington five years ago. It was ranked the country's sixth largest furniture retailer last year despite having just three stores. Since then, it has opened a fourth at Gateshead, and is due to open another at Croydon next month. Its out-of-town stores, with facilities such as children's playgrounds and family restaurants, represented 'what Habitat might have been,' said one analyst. Storehouse declined to comment on the Habitat disposal yesterday but Mr David Dworkin, who became chief executive of Storehouse in July, has indicated that the core of the group's future operations would be BhS and Mothercare, each serving mass markets in clothing. Storehouse, which showed signs of recovery with pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.8m last year, is expected to register a small loss during the first half of the current year.</p>

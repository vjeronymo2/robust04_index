			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Thin reprieve gives Twelve the chance to take a deep breath - The Yes vote does not mean treaty can be implemented in its present form THE Yes vote in yesterday's French referendum is an almost unbelievably thin reprieve for the 40-year-old enterprise of European integration. For many years, public opinion polls in France have shown steady majority votes of 60 per cent or more in favour of Europe. On this occasion the French administration campaigned strongly in favour of Maastricht, eventually with the support of the national leaders of all the mainstream parties of government. If a 50.7 per cent majority was the best they could muster between them, the government (and the opposition, for that matter) are clearly under notice that the Maastricht Treaty does not command the kind of popular support which would be required to implement it. In reality, there was almost no chance, even before yesterday's vote, that the treaty could be implemented in its present form. The Danish people have rejected it, and they cannot vote again unless the government can claim that the situation has somehow changed. There has been loose talk of some kind of declaration or protocol which would reinforce the restraints on gratuitous meddling by Brussels in national affairs. But even if this is what would be required to bring the Danes back into the fold, it must mean a change in the Treaty, which would open the door wide to a re-negotiation. Secondly, the uncertain prospects of British ratification of the treaty must have been further reduced by last week's collapse in the government's strategy for sterling. Euro-sceptics in the Conservative party will be even less amenable to Maastricht rhetoric. Correspondingly, Mr Major's authority for imposing party discipline in favour of a monetary system which even he does not wish to rejoin soon, would seem small. The Yes vote in France does not mean there is after all a chance for the Maastricht Treaty to be implemented in its present form; but it does mean the 12 governments can take a deep breath and decide where they go from here. First, they have to decide whether to try to rescue the specific objectives of the treaty by replacing it by another treaty or (more likely) several treaties; or whether to pause until circumstances are more auspicious. The most specific questions they have to consider are whether the cause of economic and monetary union is really being advanced by current conditions of recession, economic divergence, and monetary turbulence; and whether a programme which requires the political leadership of Bonn to override the narrow monetarism of the Bundesbank is really plausible when the economic credibility of Bonn is so clearly at a discount. But the most general question is more fundamental: :are the 12 really committed to a programme of integration based on common interests; or was last week's fiasco in the currency markets a stark indication that we are seeing the re-emergence of conflicts of interests, between the internal German problems associated with unification, and those of the rest of the Community? It is too soon to give any general and durable answer to that question. Last week's temper tantrums by British ministers and officials showed that the UK government has no confidence that Germany is putting common interests first. But perhaps they should reflect that French ministers and officials, too, have repeatedly (if more temperately) revealed irritation with the high level of German interest rates. The difference is that the French economy is in much better shape to ride, at least for a time, the consequences of the egotism of German economic and monetary policy. Here we have the bottom line. If the German government is still committed to the idea of economic and monetary union, eventually, the French are probably in a position to stay for the ride on the roller-coaster. But the British are not. If the French had voted No, we might have had a 12-speed Europe, or even a No-speed Europe. What the Yes vote does is to preserve the option of a two-speed Europe. In that sense, the dilemma for Mr Major is acute and painful. He wanted to put Britain at the heart of Europe; but last December he demanded the right to choose the slow speed in a two-speed Europe. His wish has been granted. As Oscar Wilde said: 'There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's desire. The other is to get it.'</p>

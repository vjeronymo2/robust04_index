			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Revenue refuses to budge In my share dealing during the present tax year, I made profits of Pounds 3,500 and losses of Pounds 3,000. Am I entitled to carry forward the losses against any capital gains tax in the future? We consider the answer is yes. Unfortunately, the Inland Revenue maintains the answer is no. It is to be hoped the question will be decided in the House of Lords one day. The crucial wording is now to be found in section 2(2)(b) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992: 'Capital gains tax shall be charged on the total amount of chargeable gains accruing to the person chargeable in the year of assessment, after deducting . . . so far as they have not been allowed as a deduction from chargeable gains accruing in any previous year of assessment, any allowable losses accruing to that person in any previous year of assessment (not earlier than the year 1965-66).' We consider the Revenue's construction of the words after the dots to be perverse and untenable. It considers our construction to be contrary to the intention of parliament. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: NFC Yesterday's 4 per cent fall in NFC's shares was an appropriately modest reaction to the gloomy company statement over the weekend. After all, the dividend could yet be increased by 15 per cent this year and still be twice covered. If pre-tax profits come in at the top end of the board's guess, the group will not be very far from meeting earlier expectations. The shares continue to yield a fifth less than the market average, so NFC's status as one of the market's favourites in these recessionary times is barely diminished. With its solid balance sheet and exposure to volume-sensitive businesses, it is as set to benefit from economic recovery as it was last year, during which the shares doubled in value. Investors will probably be hanging on for the ride. It was perhaps more curious that the market appeared rather sanguine about the rest of the transport sector. If NFC is struggling, the likes of P&amp;O, Ocean Group and Transport Development Group are doubtless finding life somewhat tougher.</p>

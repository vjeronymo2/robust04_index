			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Guatemala City, 2 Apr (DPA) -- The slaying of  Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon is  not an isolated incident, much less a common crime,  personalities we have consulted have told DPA. [passage omitted]    Gonzalez Dubon's wife, the main witness to the killing, has  said she does not believe the motive of the killing was a car  theft, as certain versions have reported. She added there was  no attempt to steal the car, and the assailants unloaded their  weapons on the car, damaging it badly.    According to another version, unidentified gunmen were  following Gonzalez, who tried to take shelter in his home, where  they reached him. Apparently, police protection at the victim's  home had been withdrawn due to the recent change of the interior  minister. [passage omitted on funeral]</p>

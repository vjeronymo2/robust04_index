			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours Failure to capture Owners Abroad has not held Airtours back. Its shares have risen by 40 per cent since it gave up the chase in March, while Owners has fallen by a similar proportion. A 25 per cent rise in full year profits, even after charging Pounds 9m bid costs, justifies the rise. Strong early bookings for next summer hold the promise of another good year to come, if the industry can avoid a sustained bout of discounting in the New Year. Owners' underperformance is a reminder of how quickly things can go awry for a tour operator if management gets distracted. Airtours faces the challenge of uniting 545 Pickfords and Hogg Robinson travel agencies under a single banner. Further acquisitions, including an up-market tour operator to complement the Airtours brand, cannot be ruled out. Plans to expand in hotels and aircraft contain special pitfalls, since high fixed costs are a strong incentive to sacrifice margins in favour of market share. Airtours maintains that its ambitions in these areas are strictly limited. Long may it remain so. With Thomson and Airtours now accounting for more than half the package holiday market, there must be a decent chance of maintaining discipline on margins. Holiday prices have held up well through the recession. The real challenge, though, is avoiding overcapacity as consumer spending rises. Memories of the 1987 price war will keep Airtours on a price-earnings discount to the stock market average, despite its impressive record.</p>

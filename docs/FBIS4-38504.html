			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 30, RIA -- The Interior Ministry of the  Russian Federation has received a request for 20 workers of the  ministry whom the UN expects to incorporate in the international  police force discharging peacekeeping functions in Angola. As  Chief Inspector of the Main Personnel Department of the ministry  Aleksandra Zemskova told a RIA correspondent, the question of  the trip of Russian policemen to Angola has not yet been  decided. According to her, some time earlier the leadership of  the Interior Ministry had refused to send its men to Mozambique  because of the hot climate in that country and considering that  in Angola the climate is no better it can be assumed that the UN  request will hardly be granted.    Zemskova stressed that the Russian police contingent acting  as part of the peacekeeping force on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia has well acquitted itself and has earned a high  assessment of specialists. "This explains the increased demand  for our workers," noted the spokesman of the Russian Interior  Ministry. She reported that now a group of five Russian  policemen is preparing for dispatch to Haiti where they will go  as soon as the appropriate UN mandates are received.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Equity Markets: Middle classes back Thai unit trusts - The Emerging Investor The unexpected popularity of Baht-based unit trusts owes as much to the eager demand from Bangkok's burgeoning middle class as to the timing of foreign fund managers. After two years of strong growth, unit trusts have attracted about Dollars 7bn, or some 7 per cent of the Bangkok market's capitalisation, overturning the notion that Thai investors will shun managed funds for the personal thrill of hunting for quick rewards. 'What we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg - more and more people realise that they have not got the time to try to follow every twist and turn of the stock market,' said Mr Yingyong Nilasena, vice-president for research at Thai Farmers Asset Management. The eight companies currently permitted to issue unit trusts - referred to as mutual trusts in Thailand - have tapped not only Bangkok's middle class but also strong demand from the supposedly less sophisticated provinces, where investors apparently feel excluded from the Bangkok market rumour mill. Mr Peter Emblin, a senior vice-president at One Investment Management, said: 'A year ago almost all the money going into our new funds came from Bangkok; 70 per cent of the money in our latest fund still came from Bangkok, yet nearly two thirds of the unit holders are from up country.' Many foreign fund managers have quickly spotted the attractions of closed-end Thai unit trusts that usually trade at a sizeable discount to the value of their portfolios. A fifth may already be in foreign hands, becoming particularly popular with nervous managers near the top of last year's sharp rally in Thai shares. Baht-based trusts have a number of advantages over direct investment: there are no limits to foreign ownership of unit trusts; they are not subject to foreign share ownership limits so they do not have to pay the premium that often attaches to 'foreign' shares; they also pay only about 0.3 per cent in brokerage commission compared to the average of about 1 per cent levied against overseas funds. Thailand's powerful commercial banks have become enthusiastic converts to fund management, which is seen as a useful source of income at a time when the Bank of Thailand is pressuring them to squeeze their traditionally wide and profitable spreads between lending and deposit rates. The three biggest banks - Siam Commercial Bank, Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank - used slick television advertising and their own extensive branch networks to acquire nearly half the money invested in unit trusts, as at the end of January 1994. The Bangkok Bank expects that from next month its customers will be able to use their ATM cards to transfer money to and from units in the bank's fund management affiliate, only two years after this was first done in the US, which has a long-established mutual fund industry. Fund managers admit that this year's one third slide in share prices and the upturn in interest rates has bruised a lot of their often first-time customers, who bought in last year's bull run. Some managers like Mr Emblin say that it is an educational process: 'They are missing the fact that 80 per cent of funds outperformed the market on the way down, so they have done what they are supposed to do.' However, others, like Mr Sangad Satapatana, a director of Baring Research in Bangkok, say that many companies sold unit trusts aggressively on past performances of only a few months. 'Last year people simply thought they were better than bank deposits which were paying lousy interest rates. I suspect that most of the people who bought the funds didn't understand the risk.' Yet if the image of trusts has been tarnished they were being created at the rate of seven a month during the first quarter of this year. Although 90 per cent of unit trusts are currently closed-end, Mr Thawat Angsuwarangsi, managing director of BBL Asset Management, the Bangkok Bank's 25 per cent-owned affiliate, predicts they will be rapidly overshadowed by open-ended funds. 'I think it was wrong to lock people into closed-end funds without telling them the risks. Now people want the flexibility of open-ended funds,' he said. The Securities and Exchange Commission expects to license only a further six or seven fund managers: the requirement that every 25 per cent stake holder must be either a financial institution or an insurance company limits the number of participants. Fund managers complain that the industry is currently restricted because the Securities and Exchange Commission forbids funds from diversifying overseas; this is of particular concern given the lack of derivative instruments in the local market. Although the SEC says that it may soon relax its rules pending clarification of permitted overseas investments, the central bank, the Bank of Thailand, is worried that such a move could further exacerbate a worrying national savings gap. However, Mr Eamonn McConnell of the Thai Asia Mutual Fund said: 'Diversification would actually help stabilise the local market because investors would be less tempted to withdraw their funds if the Bangkok market turns down. So in that sense it should encourage people to save more not less.' Seven of the eight companies currently authorised to create mutual funds only opened their books in March 1992, yet Baht-denominated funds have proved extremely popular, helped by last year's sharp rise in share prices and low interest rates.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Friday   Week on week change Stock                    Country    close     dollars   per cent  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Eczacibasi Yatirim        Turkey    0.1828    0.0321    21.32 Otosan                    Turkey    2.5020    0.3048    13.87 Formosa Chemical &amp; Fibre  Taiwan    1.2188    0.1458    13.59 CP Feedmill              Thailand  6.3737    0.7555    13.45 Chang Hwa Bank            Taiwan    5.9425    0.6168    13.24 Hua Nan Commercial Bank   Taiwan    6.6238    0.7470    12.71 Hyundai Engineering       S Korea  48.3241    4.9453    11.40 Inti Indorayon Utama      Indonesia 2.5687    0.2412    10.37 Finance One               Thailand 14.4101    1.1955     9.05 Tan Chong Motor Holdings  Malaysia  1.2118    0.0959     8.60  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

A facility which lays off a registered nurse  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> other than a staff nurse <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  still meets the ``no layoff' requirement if, in its attestation, it attests that it will not replace the nurse with an H&hyph;1A nurse (either through promotion or otherwise) for a period of 1 year after the date of the layoff. Nothing in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of this section shall be construed as requiring a facility to have taken significant steps described in such paragraph before December 18, 1989 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the date of enactment of the Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The first attestation element: substantial disruption. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The facility shall attest that ``there would be substantial disruption through no fault of the facility in the delivery of health care services of the facility without the services of such an alien or aliens.'' This element shall be met if the facility provides the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

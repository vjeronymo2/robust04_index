			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are intended to give effect to the extraordinary challenge committee provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement by setting forth the procedures for commencing, conducting and completing extraordinary challenge proceedings. Originally published on December 30, 1988 (53 Fed. Reg. 53212, 53222), the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  became effective on January 1, 1989, the date the Agreement entered into force. These amendments to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are the result of negotiations between the United States and Canada. The amendments improve the extraordinary challenge committee review process by providing for the smooth functioning of that process and by making the rules more easily understood by counsel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A summary of the amendments to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is contained in the following section-by-section analysis. Amendments involving typographical errors, corrected cross-referencing, minor ministerial corrections, and any other changes not explained below, are considered drafting clarifications and have no substantive significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preamble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Preamble has been amended to clarify that paragraph 2 of Annex 1904.13 provides the mandate for the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Rule 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rule 2 has been added in view of the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA'') and in light of the possibility that a Party may withdraw from NAFTA. The Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  govern any proceeding in which a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee is filed in respect of a panel review of any final determination published or, in the case of a determination that is not published, for which notice is received, prior to the entry into force of NAFTA. If either Canada or the United States were to withdraw from NAFTA, the Agreement would revive between them and these rules would again apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 3 amends former rule 2 to clarify that where procedural questions arise which are not covered by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  any procedure adopted by a committee should not be inconsistent with the Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 3 also has been amended to add a provision corresponding to the final sentence of Rule 2 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Article 1904 Panel Rules, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which provides that the Agreement prevails where there is an inconsistency or ambiguity between the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``Disclosure Undertaking'' corresponds to an amendment to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Article 1904 Panel Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and has been added to eliminate the need to refer to the form of the undertaking in the body of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or in an attached schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``investigating authority'' corresponds to an amendment to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Article 1904 Panel Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and has been added to include a delegation of power by the competent investigating authority in matters regarding the issuance, amendment, modification and revocation of Disclosure Orders and Protective Orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``personal information'' has been added to account for a class of information not found in the administrative record under review by a panel and consists of information produced in respect of a request for an extraordinary challenge committee arising from an allegation under Article 1904.13(a)(i) of the Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``pleading'' has been amended to remove the Notice of Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee and to add the Notice of Motion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``proof of service'', as it applies to an extraordinary challenge proceeding requested in respect of a panel review of a final determination made in the United States, has been amended to remove acknowledgement of service as an alternative form of proof of service because it is not standard practice in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``Protective Order Application'' corresponds to an amendment to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Article 1904 Panel Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and has been added to eliminate the need to refer to the form of the application in the body of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or in an attached schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``service address'' has been amended to correspond to an amendment to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Article 1904 Panel Rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and has been rephrased to clarify that an address, rather than a facsimile number, is the principal service address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

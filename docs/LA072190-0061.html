			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL REASSURED ON MISSILE DEFENSE;  </P> <P> U.S. AID: CHENEY SAYS THE ARROW PROJECT WILL CONTINUE DESPITE CRUNCH.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney assured Israel on Friday that the United States  will continue to support Israel's $160-million Arrow missile-defense program  despite the U.S. budget crunch.  </P> <P> The Pentagon said Cheney told Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens that  Washington backs continuing research and development on the second phase of the  project, which was launched two years ago as part of the U.S. "Star Wars"  missile-defense program.  </P> <P> However, the Pentagon statement said details of the second phase have yet to be  worked out.  </P> <P> Cheney's two-hour meeting with Arens was the first high-level contact between  the Bush Administration and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's five-week-old,  right-wing government.  </P> <P> The Pentagon said Cheney "stressed the friendship between the two countries and  reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Israel's security."  </P> <P> At the same time, the State Department announced that Secretary of State James  A. Baker III will hold his first meeting with newly appointed Israeli Foreign  Minister David Levy on Aug. 9-10 in Washington. Baker has been far more  critical than Cheney about Shamir's government.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Baker hopes the meeting  will help to "develop a credible basis on which to move the peace process  forward."  </P> <P> Baker has accused Shamir of foot-dragging on U.S. efforts to begin a dialogue  between Israel and Palestinian representatives. Last month, Baker sarcastically  recited the White House telephone number and told Israeli officials to call  when they were ready for peace.  </P> <P> Baker had suggested that Levy meet him in Paris earlier this week, but Levy,  who is recovering from a mild heart attack, said he was too ill to make the  trip.  </P> <P> Israeli sources have said Levy prefers to have his first meeting with Baker in  the United States, rather than in a third country, to emphasize the importance  of the U.S.-Israeli relationship. The fact that he readily agreed to a far more  demanding trip so soon after the proposed Paris meeting seems to lend some  credence to that view.  </P> <P> Arens, Levy's predecessor as foreign minister, told reporters at the Pentagon  that Israel "attaches very great importance" to the Arrow project, 80% of which  is financed by the U.S. government.  </P> <P> The Arrow is intended to shoot down the kinds of short-range missiles that  Israel's Arab adversaries have deployed or are developing.  </P> <P> It was proposed as an international contribution to the U.S. Strategic Defense  Initiative, commonly called "Star Wars." Technologically, defending against  short-range missiles poses far less daunting problems than the strategic  missile defense that is the heart of "Star Wars."  </P> <P> An Israeli spokeswoman said Arens told Cheney that the first phase of the Arrow  project "is going very well, and we would hope to go ahead with the second  phase." Israel hopes to deploy the weapon within five years.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Tutwiler confirmed that the United States has postponed a meeting,  scheduled to begin next week, of a joint U.S.-Israel committee that coordinates  Washington's $1.8-billion-per-year military aid program.  </P> <P> Reports from Israel said the postponement appears to be an attempt by Baker and  the State Department to bring more pressure on Israel to agree to Washington's  plan for negotiations with Palestinians. But Tutwiler said there is no such  meaning to the decision.  </P> <P> She said the meeting was put off until September because the size of the  military aid program is one of the issues in the current round of budget  negotiations between the White House and Congress. Until the budget is  resolved, she added, there is no point in trying to plan ways to spend the  money.  </P> <P> "The postponement is purely a practical matter," Tutwiler said. "United  States-Israel relations remain strong. Our commitment to Israel's security and  to the preservation of its qualitative edge remains unshakable."  </P> <P> Israeli Embassy spokeswoman Ruth Yaron said: "We were asked to postpone the  meeting, and we agreed to the postponement. We don't read anything into it  beyond what we were told."  </P> <P> However, the postponement seemed to catch some Israeli officials by surprise.  David Ivri, director general of the Defense Ministry and Israel's  representative on the Joint Security Assistance Program committee, accompanied  Arens to Washington, intending to remain for next week's meeting.  </P></p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Estonia leader puts citizenship law on hold ESTONIA'S president has backed away from a confrontation with Russia by refusing to ratify a citizenship law which the country's large Russian minority claims discriminates against them. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, threatened to halt all oil and gas deliveries to Estonia if it continued 'apartheid and ethnic cleansing in kid gloves'. Mr Lennart Meri said yesterday that he would refer the law to the Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe for expert opinion.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Religious Party [NRP] Knesset faction  is against soldiers' disobeying orders, and says that the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] -- including all its forces and echelons  -- is above the public debate. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht  reports the decision was made unanimously following a session  lasting more than four hours. The NRP faction also states that  a government decision to evacuate Jews from their homes and  lands in Eretz Yisra'el is a terrible edict which contradicts  Zionism, Jewish law, and human ethics. The NRP promises to do  everything within its power to foil such a decision and calls on  the entire Israeli public to evince passive, nonviolent civil  resistance to foil such a decision, if it is made.</p>

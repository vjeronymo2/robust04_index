The  African National Congress, admitting some self-defense units are  out of control, says it's trying to reestablish its authority  over them. Sources close to the ANC say at least three  self-defense units are out of control in townships east of  Johannesburg, among the most violent in South Africa. The  self-defense units are informal armed groups which live in and  are responsible for the security of local communities.</p>

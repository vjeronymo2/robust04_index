			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GAMES PREVIEW;  </P> <P> COACH'S RESIGNATION LEAVES CLEVELAND BASKETBALL TEAM IN A STATE OF UNCERTAINTY  </P> <P> On the eve of the L. A. Games, the normally ebullient Cleveland High basketball  players this week appeared burned out, not fired up.  </P> <P> Marc Paez, who replaced Bob Braswell as coach last summer, has resigned,  leaving the Cavaliers suddenly unsure of themselves. Assistant Bort Escoto will  coach the team during the tournament.  </P> <P> Cleveland was in a similar situation last year after Braswell left to become an  assistant at Cal State Long Beach. Braswell, however, coached the team during  the 1989 L.A. Games and helped in the selection of Paez.  </P> <P> Paez has severed his ties to the team because of "off-court distractions" and  "blatant recruiting," and no decision has been made on a permanent replacement.  </P> <P> Cleveland is seeded eighth in the 128-team tournament, which will take place  this weekend and next. The Cavaliers will open against Inglewood at 1 p.m.  today at El Camino College.  </P> <P> In addition to basketball, L.A. Games events include baseball, football,  karate, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, water polo, and  wrestling. In all, the tournament will include more than 10,000 participants.  Events are open to the public and admission is free.  </P> <P> Cleveland, meanwhile, has been wallowing in confusion.  </P> <P> "Right now, nobody really knows what's happening," said Escoto, conceding that  he is "kind of depressed" about the situation. "It's kind of like a big  mystery. (The players) just feel abandoned. Last year they had the comforts of  Coach Braswell, this year they're in the dark."  </P> <P> The players' recent listlessness contrasts vividly with their previous  attitude.  </P> <P> "The kids basically do what they have to do and just go home," Escoto said. He  added that in more stable times, "There was lots of intensity, lots of  enthusiasm. Kids were feeling good about themselves, like a team getting ready  to go to war."  </P> <P> Cleveland now wars with inexperience. Just four varsity players return: guards  Brandon Martin, Kenny Collins and Sean Gunther, and forward Kaheed Murray.  </P> <P> "It's really hard to say how we'll do," Collins said. "We can win if we play  with our heart. It's going to take hustle and the little things. It's not going  to really be talent that does it, it's got to be from the heart."  </P> <P> That seems to be a prerequisite for success in other sports as well. Among  water polo matches, Harvard will play host to Chadwick at 8:30 a.m. Saturday.  Glendale will open against Damien at 3 p.m. Saturday at Bell Gardens.  </P> <P> In volleyball, Chatsworth, the City Section 4-A Division champion, will play  Boys Republic; Van Nuys will play Canyon. All volleyball matches will be held  at North Torrance and will begin Sunday.  </P> <P> Royal will play Bell at South Torrance in one of the 32 first-round boys'  soccer matches. Burroughs will play Don Lugo in a girls' soccer match. Each of  the eight girls' matches will be played Saturday at El Camino College.  </P> <P> Today's baseball schedule includes L.A. Baptist vs. San Fernando at El Camino  College, Chatsworth vs. Duarte at Grant, Alemany vs. Bassett at Grant, and  Grant vs. Sierra Vista at Grant.  </P></p>

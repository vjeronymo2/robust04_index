			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Manufacturing upbeat in Wales RURAL WALES has shown a resilience to the recession with its manufacturing sector investing at record levels and unemployment lower than the national average, the development board for the region said yesterday. The Development Board for Rural Wales, which covers 40 per cent of the principality's land area, said in its annual report that the manufacturing sector had doubled in size in the past decade and now accounted for 17 per cent of jobs. In 1992-93, the board offered Pounds 3.6m in grants and loans to stimulate a record Pounds 25.7m of planned investment by the region's manufacturers. A total of 25 inward investment projects were won which the board said would support nearly 700 jobs within three years. The board has stopped building speculative premises and now concentrates on pre-let workspace. It is encouraging more private-sector involvement in construction and wants to provide space for a wider variety of businesses. Mr Glyn Davies, chairman, said there were 'very major challenges' for the future. Gross domestic product and weekly earnings remained unacceptably low compared with the national average, and there was a steady migration of young people. Although unemployment in 1992-93 was 2 percentage points below the national average, there were pockets of high unemployment. 'We also face serious problems arising from structural change in the agricultural industry, the energy supply industry and, to a limited extent, the defence industry,' he said. In July the National Audit Office criticised the board for the way in which it had allocated housing. The board has changed its practices.</p>

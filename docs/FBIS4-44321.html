			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Marcovici] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Rwanda's tragedy could have,  or rather should have, crystallized the European idea around a  simple notion: to rescue innocent victims. This was an  opportunity for Europe to put words into practice and to assume  a common purpose. But no such thing has taken place. On the  contrary, Europe is but an indifferent, not to say reluctant,  witness to a humanitarian rescue operation which it is letting  France perform alone. At France's peril, but also to its credit.    There are those who diffidently promise some logistical  support, or a few packages of supplies. Italy, which initially  appeared to support France's initiative, is now setting down  conditions. Belgium, whose involvement in Rwanda was deep,  maintains that it will not send a single man. Great Britain  hears nothing, sees nothing, says nothing. As for Germany, it  is hiding behind its constitution, a convenient and customary  alibi for doing nothing. As for all the others they are  reneging. In short, Europe is missing at a time when one of its  own members, France, is resolutely committing itself. [passage  omitted]    People will find it difficult to forget that, when the hour  required some generosity, courage, and responsibility, Europe  was nowhere to be seen. Such is not the case of France,  however. It is showing by force of example that a nation  remains a nation and that it still knows how to act alone when  danger is knocking at the door.    Europe has proved unable to fulfil the promises made in  Maastricht. Too bad. Because it is shouldering this burden  alone, France should not refrain from a feeling of pride at  having upheld its traditions. France is coming to the rescue of  a people in mortal danger. It does not matter whether it has  partners or not. What does matter is for it to succeed.  [passage omitted].</p>

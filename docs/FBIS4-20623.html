			<p>Property   Service Company   <F P=102> 94FE0393B Tokyo NIKKEI SANGY0 SHIMBUN in Japanese 8 Feb 94 p  2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0393B </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGY0 SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] On February 1, 1994, Mitsubishi Materials made an  announcement of its newly-founded, wholly-owned "intellectual  property service" company. The new company will be engaged  mainly in collection and analysis of patent and technical  information concerning manufacturing, mining, and information  industries. Effective February 1, together with the intellectual  property division, previously designated as the patent division,  the company will expand the scope of its activity, strengthening  survey functions and going after orders from external sources,  in addition to the management of various types of ownership. A  target set for the first year is an annual turnover of &yen;200  million.    The amount of capital invested in the new company is &yen;10  million. Mr. Giichi Yamaguchi, the former patent division chief,  has assumed the position of president. The staff consists of 13  members, most of whom have been transferred from either the  former patent division or the research institute. The new  intellectual property division is staffed by approximately 20  employees.    In the past, it was the patent division which primarily had  handled the management of manufacturing and mining proprietary  rights at Mitsubishi Materials Corp. However, as workloads in  the area of information gathering and analysis had increased  and, moreover, as the company had realized that technologies  which it had accumulated in the broad business areas of metallic  and non-metallic materials, machine tools, and cement would be  marketable, the company decided to establish a new firm with an  eye on consulting business as a part of the new venture.    In the beginning, the new company will provide service only  to the head office's intellectual property division and the  various firms belonging to the Mitsubishi group. In the future,  however, the company will go after business from outside firms  by offering consulting, technical training, and engineering  development services in industrial proprietary rights, such as  patents, utility models, and new designs.</p>

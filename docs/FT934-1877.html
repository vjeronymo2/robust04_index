			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: YSL loses battle to call perfume Champagne The French champagne industry yesterday won its legal battle to ban Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, from using the name Champagne for its latest women's perfume in France. The appeals court upheld an earlier verdict in the industry's favour by ruling that YSL and Elf Sanofi, its parent company, must by December 31 stop using the name Champagne for the fragrance and its publicity in France. Mr Claude Saujet, chairman of Elf Sanofi's beauty products division, said his company would comply with the ruling by removing the word 'Champagne' from the product, its packaging and promotional material. 'We didn't want a fight,' he said. 'But we're going to obey the law.' The perfume, which was launched throughout Europe in September, will continue to be sold in France in its original bottle, which resembles a champagne cork. The only name left on the product will be that of Yves Saint-Laurent, the fashion designer. It will still be called Champagne outside France. Elf Sanofi, which earlier this year acquired YSL in a highly controversial FFr3.6bn (Dollars 614m) deal, now the subject of an official investigation into alleged insider trading, sought to play down the financial implications of the ban. Mr Jean-Paul Leon, executive vice-president, said it expected to incur costs of no more than FFr10m in abandoning the name. He said Champagne had been 'a great success' by generating turnover of FFr200m in its first three months on sale in Europe. It was the best-selling fine fragrance in France, he said. Elf Sanofi has spent FFr100m on launching Champagne which means that, unusually for a perfume in its first year, the product is already profitable. However, the French ban could affect the long-term potential of Champagne if the domestic name change confuses overseas consumers.</p>

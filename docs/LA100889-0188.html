			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CYCLING INVITATIONAL;  </P> <P> EKIMOV LEADS SOVIETS; EICKHOFF PACES U.S. TEAM  </P> <P> With most of a $100,000 purse to be awarded today, the NEC World Cycling  Invitational looks like a three-team race between the United States, the Soviet  Union and Italy.  </P> <P> The Soviets, behind Viacheslav Ekimov, took over first place among the eight  teams with 56 points. The United States, behind Janie Eickhoff, moved into  second with 53 points, and Italy won Saturday's last event to stay close with  52.  </P> <P> Ekimov, the three-time world pursuit champion, treated the crowd at the Olympic  Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills to the day's most impressive victory.  Going against Pascal Potie of France in a 12-lap (4,000-kilometer) race, Ekimov  lapped his opponent on their 10th circuit and posted a time of 4 minutes 36.51  seconds, almost 19 seconds ahead of the next-best time.  </P> <P> Eickhoff, 19, of Los Alamitos, who attends Cal State Dominguez Hills, kept the  United States in contention, winning both the tempo and elimination races and  posting her best time in the 3,000-meter pursuit (3:59.22).  </P> <P> America's veteran sprinter, Connie Paraskevin-Young, was eliminated in the  women's sprint semifinals by France's Isabelle Gautheron after two  down-to-the-wire heats. When they last met a year ago at Seoul, Young edged  Gautheron for the Olympic bronze medal. The Soviets' Erika Salumayae also  advanced to today's sprint final in straight heats.  </P> <P> In the men's match sprints, Ken Carpenter of the United States defeated Italy's  Fedrico Paris to reach today's semifinals with Canada's Curt Harnett, who had a  surprisingly easy time against Nikolai Kovsch of the Soviet Union, Gary Neiwand  of Australia and Frederick Magne of France.  </P> <P> Today's final session begins at 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Cycling Notes  </P> <P> Although he did not ride, Saturday's star was Tour de France winner Greg  LeMond. Of his new-found celebrity, he said, "When I went to the White House  the first time I won (the Tour de France) in 1986, I was rushed in, they took  pictures, and I was rushed out. This year, all the Secret Service men were  cyclists."  </P></p>

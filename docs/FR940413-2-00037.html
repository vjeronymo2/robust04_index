			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked what is industrial waste under the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As defined in 40 CFR 258.2, Definitions, ``Industrial solid waste means solid waste generated by manufacturing or industrial processes that is not a hazardous waste regulated under subtitle C of RCRA.'' The MDNR definition of solid waste as written in the 1993 revision of RSMo 260.200(25) includes industrial waste. RSMo 260.200(25) states, ``` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Solid Waste <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ', garbage, refuse and other discarded materials including, but not limited to, solid and semisolid waste materials resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, governmental, and domestic activities, but does not include hazardous waste as defined in &sect;&sect;260.30 to 260.432, recovered materials, overburden, rock, tailings, matte, slag or other waste material resulting from mining milling or smelting;'' EPA finds that these definitions as they categorize industrial waste are consistent with each other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter concerned about the integrity of ground-water testing asked whether EPA requires that ground water testing be done by MDNR or by independent laboratories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations at 40 CFR Part 258.53, Ground-water sampling and analysis requirements, place the responsibility of ground-water sampling on the landfill owner or operator. Samples are generally analyzed by independent laboratories. The landfill owner or operator must place detailed information in the operating record on the sampling and analysis plan. This information must include procedures and techniques for: (1) Sample collection; (2) Sample preservation and shipment; (3) Analytical procedures; (4) Chain of custody; and (5) Quality assurance and quality control. This procedure ensures the integrity of the sampling and analysis process. MDNR requires that landfills either perform their own sampling or contract with a third party to sample all monitoring wells for a list of constituents that includes all the constituents required by the federal rule, plus six additional constituents. The state requirements for sample collection, sample preservation and shipment, analytical procedures, chain of custody and quality assurance/quality control are identical to the federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments were received voicing the concerns about MDNR's funding and its ability to operate an effective enforcement program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff at the hearing, who stated that they have adequate resources to cover MDNR's responsibilities. MDNR added that no state can have an inspector at a landfill at all times, but that it conducts quarterly inspections and periodic inspections as a result of complaints. EPA responded that MDNR's program is viewed as adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter questioned if 60 mil. thickness was the minimum requirement for the flexible membrane landfill liners and if it was adequate for ground water protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations at 40 CFR &sect;258.40 (b) state that ``*&blank;*&blank;* the uppermost component of the composite liner must consist of a minimum 30-mil flexible membrane liner.'' Also, those regulations state that the ``flexible membrane liner components consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE) shall be at least 60 mil. thick.'' Appendix E of 40 CFR part 258 states, ``Based on EPA's experience with these liner materials, these are the minimum thicknesses necessary to ensure adequate liner performance, including being able to withstand the stress of construction and to ensure that adequate seams can be made.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asked what MDNR is going to do about enforcing leachate treatment requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff at the hearing, who stated that MDNR conducts quarterly inspections and periodic inspections as a result of complaints. EPA considers this an adequate enforcement response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter asked whether the state has a requirement for the number of personnel to work at landfills of a certain size?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff at the hearing, who stated that Missouri requires that owner/operators of a landfill employ a sufficient number of personnel to ensure that the landfill will be properly operated in accordance with their approved operating plans and will not cause a public nuisance or health hazard. The owner/operator is also required to have at least one certified solid waste technician. These individuals are provided training by MDNR in the proper operation and construction of landfills. The department does not require additional personnel based on the amount of waste received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

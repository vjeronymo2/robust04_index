			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Changing image at Pearson / A look at its strategic move towards TV THE Thames Television executive said with a smile that Pearson had 'started wearing its hair just a shade longer.' He was referring to the planned acquisition of Thames by the publishing, banking and industrial group noted more for caution and a rather conservative outlook than getting involved in racy and high risk businesses such as indepenDent television production. Yet with irrevocable undertakings already given for Thorn EMI's 58.85 per cent stake in Thames at 200p a share, Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive of Pearson, will soon find himself in control of Rumpole of the Bailey, the smutty double entendres of the Benny Hill Show and Arthur Daley's Minder. But why should Pearson want to buy Thames when its principal asset, its broadcasting licence, has already been lost to Carlton Communications, and why should Thames be seen as a 'nice little earner' worth just under Pounds 100m? Many of its remaining assets, programmes such as This is Your Life and Wish You Were Here, have been around a long time and could be replaced by ITV at any time after the end of this year. Pearson's decision to buy what is now the UK's largest independent producer is not a totally new departure. The publishing group already has stakes in BritishSky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, and in Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television. However, last autumn the Pearson board took a strategic decision - that it had to have a more central role in visual media to complement its profitable but mature print based companies such as the Financial Times and Penguin Books. Although Pearson has no plans to dispose of its oil services and fine china businesses - at least for the foreseeable future - the company is likely to move towards being a more tightly focused media and entertainment group. Against such a background Pearson and Thames were destined to meet. Parts of the Thames deal are easy to value - others much less so. Apart from a net cash balance of Pounds 13.8m there is the recently revalued Pounds 20m stake in the Astra satellite system and freehold studios at Teddington. The Thames programme library of more than 10,000 hours has been variously valued at amounts ranging from Pounds 18m to Pounds 80m. Mr Derek Hunt, the retiring finance director of Thames, insists the truth definitely lies somewhere between those two figures. The programmes already being shown are the UK Gold Library Channel launched on satellite by Thames and the BBC. A second channel of general entertainment aimed mainly at women is expected in the autumn. Programme making is even more difficult to value. ITV will pay Thames more than Pounds 40m this year for its programmes, many of them in the ITV top 20, but so far no longer term contracts have been signed. Rating winners such as the three times a week police series The Bill are likely to have a considerable life on ITV. Thames longer term success will depend on its ability to come up with new ideas for sale to UK broadcasters and international markets. But even if a fraction of the hundreds of televison channels now being promised actually materialise, then there will be a growing demand for programmes from those who own the rights in them. Thames represents the core of a ready-made television division for Pearson. But Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson and current chairman of BSkyB, clearly sees it as something of a beginning. Stakes in other broadcasters around the world and the launch of new international channels could follow.</p>

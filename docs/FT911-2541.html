			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Egypt condemns Israel IN ITS MOST harshly-worded attacksince the end of the Gulf war, Egypt yesterday accused Israel of blocking Middle East peace efforts. The policy of building settlements in occupied territories was 'aimed at trying to abort  .. efforts to promote a peace settlement', said an Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman. Separately, Mr Boutros Ghali, minister of state for foreign affairs, said Israel was creating obstacles over the composition of the Palestinian delegation to a peace conference proposed by Mr James Baker, US secretary of state. The double-barrelled criticism reflected growing concern in Cairo that the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir isnot serious about achieving a compromise on the Palestinian issue, viewed by Egypt as the key to future regional stability. The Foreign Ministry statement said that Egypt regarded Israel's recent settlement activity 'with much repulsion'. Hinting that a halt to settlement would draw a favourable Arab response, Mr Ghali said that confidence-building measures 'must be reciprocal'.</p>

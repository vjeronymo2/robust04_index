			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chin Chang-nip from Washington] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Government stated it would oppose the  replacement of fuel rods at nuclear reactors in Yongbyon, North  Korea. This indicates that the U.S. nuclear policy toward North  Korea has changed considerably, which attracts the people's  attention.    Such a position by the U.S. Government has been disclosed on  many occasions, but it did not attract attention because it was  expressed ambiguously. Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant  secretary of State, has recently expressed the U.S. position  clearly and concretely.    The U.S. Government has clearly expressed its position  opposing the replacement of fuel rods at North Korean nuclear  reactors because, although the United States has been continuing  negotiations with North Korea for the past ten months to freeze  North Korea's nuclear development, it believes North Korea would  continue developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, it seems the  United States has decided to prevent North Korea from replacing  fuel rods in order to block its nuclear development.    After the second round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks  in Geneva on 19 July 1993, Robert Gallucci said that he would  oppose North Korea's extraction of plutonium. Also, U.S.  Secretary of Defense William Perry recently said that we must  not allow North Korea to extract plutonium again by replacing  nuclear fuel at the nuclear reactors.    In U.S.-North Korean unofficial contacts slated for either  28  or 29 April in New York, the U.S. Government is likely to convey  its position to North Korea that it withdraws the demand for the  exchange of special envoys between the North and South, and that  it opposes North Korea's replacing fuel rods at its nuclear  reactors. It is very significant militarily that the United  States has informed North Korea of its intention to oppose the  replacing of fuel rods at nuclear reactors.    When nuclear fuel is replaced, the operation of the nuclear  reactors are suspended. After the reactor core cools down, the  used fuel is removed when the fuel rods are replaced.    The United States has so far considered carrying out a  preventive strike against North Korean nuclear facilities if its  diplomatic efforts to settle the nuclear issue fail, but has  stated that there are many difficulties because a strike against  active nuclear reactors would cause the vast proliferation of  radiation.

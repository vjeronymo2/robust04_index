			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Arts: What you see when the Sky's the limit - Television It is 10.30 on Saturday morning and on screen a black woman is shouting 'Git yo' arse up boy]' Zap to the next channel and you find a singing cowboy: 'Theer's a honky tonk on ther edge 'o town,' he moans. Zap on again and you find yourself looking at a big close-up of a jewelled ring. 'It's a convenient ring to wear at any time,' says a woman with an estuary accent. Which ring isn't, you wonder, as you note the price: Pounds 114 plus Pounds 3.50 p&amp;p. Flick forwards once more and you see three teenagers sitting at a table. 'The Revenoo Act of 1797 was inner-dooced ter replace the Stamp Act,' says one. His friend who is drinking milk through a straw laughs and the milk shoots out of his ears. This is satellite television. The black woman is on the pop video channel MTV. The cowboy appears to be on the Discovery channel which specialises in old American documentaries, but their transponder is being shared by CMT (Country Music Television). The convenient ring is on QVC, a shopping channel which, astonishingly, you cannot watch without paying a subscription, even though its output consists solely of sales pitches from a team of cloned presenters. The ear trick occurs on the American children's channel Nickelodeon. If your satellite dish, like most, points at the Astra satellite you can now receive 48 channels in addition to BBC1, BBC2, ITV and C4. Depending upon the time of day, anything between 20 and 30 of these will be in foreign languages, nearly all German, though Galavision is Spanish, JSTV Japanese, and TV Asia, which piggybacks on the transponders of Nickelodeon and Sky Movies Gold, is in various Asian languages. On most days, at times when most people are free to view, there are now 17 satellite channels delivering programmes in English. Eleven of these are entirely or predominantly American: Bravo (old movies), Children's (many cartoons), CNN (news), Discovery &amp; CMT, Movie Channel, MTV, Nickelodeon, Sky Movies, Sky Movies Gold and Sky 1. The services which can reasonably be called British are the shopping channel QVC, Sky News, Sky Sport, UK Gold (showing old British TV series) and the women's channel, UK Living. Eurosport is international. About 3.5 million people in Britain live in homes which have paid to get access to these extra services, mostly via dishes, though a minority are served by cable. The main channel provider is, of course, Rupert Murdoch's News International via its satellite television outfit, Sky, in which Pearson (owner of the FT) has a significant stake. Since Sky scrambled most of its channels last summer and began charging subscriptions varying from Pounds 7 to Pounds 20 a month for different 'packages', more and more people have been paying a monthly fee for this form of extra television. The smallest package costs Pounds 83.88 a year which is more than the BBC licence fee. If you take the whole Sky package the annual fee is Pounds 239.88. Yet the remarkable fact is that the people who pay these prices still spend much the larger part of their viewing time watching the old terrestrial channels. Using the BARB figures jointly issued by the BBC and commercial television for the week ending February 13, the most recent available, it is possible to construct the following 'Top 10 Channels' list based on audience share inside satellite and cable equipped homes: 1. ITV: 29.9 per cent 2. BBC1: 26.0 per cent 3. C4: 7.7 per cent 4. BBC2: 5.8 per cent 4. Sky 1: 5.8 per cent 6. Sky Movies: 3.8 per cent 7. Movie Channel: 3.6 per cent 8. Sky Sports: 2.9 per cent 9. UK Gold: 2.3 per cent 10. TNT/Cartoon: 2.1 per cent This accounts for 89.9 per cent of viewing. The other 10.1 per cent is split between the other satellite channels with Sky News, for instance, taking 1.1 per cent and the Family Channel 0.4 per cent. Thus even in homes where the satellite is available, the four old terrestrial channels take a 69.4 per cent share while the dozens of satellite channels all put together achieve only 31 per cent. Why? The fashion now among the satellite people is to argue that we should not see their channels as alternatives but merely as adjuncts. There is some strength in this where the specialised channels are concerned: viewers can be expected to dip in and out of Sky Sport or The Movie Channel and not watch them as they might watch, say, BBC1. The same hardly applies to Sky 1, however, which set out to be a general entertainment channel capable of challenging similar channels. Yet it only manages to match BBC2's share. The satellite does offer items unavailable elsewhere. Once you have the service in the house, Sky News and CNN quickly become your first reference points for breaking news: you do not have to wait for the fixed bulletins at 7.00 pm or 9.00. In the past week I have seen, on UK Gold, the final episode of The Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy which I missed twice on the BBC. On Sunday night the Movie Channel screened The Lover, a film which some would regard as soft porn but others might say was a non-violent Ai No Corrida. It certainly has enough explicit eroticism to ensure that the strait-laced terrestrial channels will not show it. For those who can take the tedium, the German channels regularly offer a teutonic type of Carry On movie featuring much lederhosen and bonking; since the dialogue is irrelevant it is no disadvantage to speak no German. And the Sky News political discussion, Target, with Norman Tebbit and Austin Mitchell interrogating somebody, is nearly always good value. Is that enough to justify the extra outlay? Almost certainly not in most ordinary homes. It is not an inspiring experience to switch to the satellite, zap through 20 or 30 channels, and find that virtually all of them are showing old American material featuring, naturally enough, American accents and American values, from guns to god. Between 7.00 this evening and 1.30 tomorrow morning Sky 1 offers nine series, all bought secondhand from the US, and nothing else. I had hoped to be able to add that the first major drama to be commissioned by Sky 1, an adaptation of the Ken Follett thriller Red Eagle, screened in two-hour chunks on Sunday and Monday, proved that matters were improving. Unfortunately, although the locations and credits said 'Money]', this was a distressingly poor piece of work, badly directed, brimful of cliches, and badly acted. Matters can only improve, surely.</p>

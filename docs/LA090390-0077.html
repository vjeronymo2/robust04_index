			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FDR'S YACHT IS GETTING SHIPSHAPE;  </P> <P> TOURISM: RESTORATION FUNDS ARE RUNNING SHORT, BUT THERE ARE EFFORTS TO MAKE THE  POTOMAC PART OF A HISTORIC PARK IN OAKLAND. THE CITY HOPES THAT IT WILL LURE  VISITORS.  </P> <P> In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt plucked from obscurity a 165-foot  Coast Guard cutter and ordered it refitted with a dining salon, staterooms and  a hand-operated elevator to accommodate the wheelchair he used after being  crippled by polio.  </P> <P> For the next decade, until his death, the austere, gleaming-white yacht,  rechristened the Potomac, served as a "floating White House," where Roosevelt  entertained kings, queens and political leaders and spent countless weekends  fishing from the teak-covered deck, a haven from the troubles of Depression and  war.  </P> <P> These days, the ship is in the final stages of a long, against-the-odds face  lift at the Port of Oakland after years of bouncing from one owner to another,  including Elvis Presley, before literally sinking into ignominy after being  seized by U.S. Customs in a drug bust.  </P> <P> If all goes as planned, Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, an Oakland Democrat, will  introduce a bill in Congress later this month to establish the USS Potomac  National Historical Park. The Potomac itself would be a floating museum of the  Roosevelt era, ferrying schoolchildren on San Francisco Bay and the Delta.  </P> <P> The designation would make the restored ship and a planned visitor center  eligible for an estimated $1 million in annual federal funds.  </P> <P> Problem is, the costly restoration effort, always a hand-to-mouth affair, is in  some danger of running aground even as workers install the woodwork and light  fixtures in the staterooms, salon and fantail.  </P> <P> To date, at least $3.5 million raised from government and private sources has  been spent to refurbish the ship, not counting thousands of dollars' worth of  donated equipment and building materials. And the furnishings have yet to be  bought.  </P> <P> "We're almost out of money," Dan Holdgate, project manager for the rebuilding,  said on a recent tour of the ship. "The Potomac probably will be running by  mid-September, but we might not have the money to buy life rafts and vests."  </P> <P> Fund-raising efforts continue, and officials expect the restoration to be  completed. But they note that a key to the ship's future will be qualifying for  government funds.  </P> <P> Given the vessel's tumultuous past, it comes as no surprise to many associated  with the restoration that the Potomac still faces rough sailing.  </P> <P> Originally called the Electra, the ship was built by the Manitowoc Ship  Building Co. in Manitowoc, Wis., in 1934. Its first duty was to chase  rumrunners, who were still around in the early days after Prohibition was  repealed in 1933.  </P> <P> At the time, Roosevelt was using the yacht Sequoia, an ornate vessel not  particularly to his liking. Aides feared that it would be difficult to evacuate  the crippled leader should the wooden vessel catch fire.  </P> <P> Roosevelt, an avid sailor and former assistant secretary of the Navy, picked  the Electra for conversion into a presidential yacht at a cost of $60,000.  </P> <P> Among other changes, a hand-powered elevator was installed in the after stack  to enable the President to ride to and from the boat deck. A large,  leather-covered settee was built into the fantail; photographs of the time show  Roosevelt, with his trademark cigarette holder, enjoying cocktails with guests  there. Wicker chairs and tables and -- when Roosevelt's military advisers  deemed necessary -- bulletproof glass completed the outdoor furnishings.  </P> <P> Below decks, stainless steel bathtubs were added in the President's and guest  quarters. Leather furniture, wood paneling and brass fixtures were installed  throughout.  </P> <P> In one interior room containing radio equipment, Roosevelt conducted at least  one of his famous "Fireside Chats."  </P> <P> "It looked like a boat that could be used for a number of purposes, but when  you used it for a yacht, you weren't ashamed of it," FDR's oldest son, James,  recalled in an interview at his Corona del Mar home. Visitors, he said, often  were astonished that the ship was quite plain.  </P> <P> Log entries show that it was used for travels from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Key  West. Roosevelt often used it for fishing jaunts on the Chesapeake Bay. In  1939, England's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (now the Queen Mum) joined  the President and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on a journey down the Potomac  River to Williamsburg, Va.  </P> <P> The Potomac was part of a notable ruse in 1941. FDR left Maine aboard the yacht  but secretly met a cruiser that carried him to a rendezvous with British Prime  Minister Winston Churchill off Newfoundland, where the two leaders signed the  Atlantic Charter, creating the wartime alliance. Aboard the Potomac, crew  members stood in for the President, fishing from the deck in boat cloak and  snap-brim hat. The secret rendezvous went off without a hitch.  </P> <P> After the war, President Harry S. Truman replaced the Potomac with a larger  vessel, the Williamsburg. The Potomac was mustered out of the Navy,  decommissioned by the Coast Guard and sold to the state of Maryland.  </P> <P> Maryland sold the ship in 1960 to a company that used it to ferry passengers  and freight between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In the next few years,  it changed hands many times. In 1964, Presley bought it for $55,000. He later  donated it to Danny Thomas' pet project, St. Jude's Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.,  which planned to convert it to a restaurant to raise money. The cost proved too  great, and St. Jude's auctioned it off.  </P> <P> Next, a Southern California group pulled off the damaged teak upper deck and  poured concrete, planning to turn the ship into a floating disco palace. That  didn't work either.  </P> <P> By this time, the vessel was looking shabby. An effort to convert it into a  tourist attraction at San Pedro's Ports O' Call went nowhere. The ship was  towed to Stockton and then to San Francisco's Pier 26.  </P> <P> On Sept. 11, 1980, U.S. Customs seized the Potomac and a companion vessel, the  Valkyure, which had 21 tons of marijuana on board. Although no drugs were found  aboard the Potomac, it was a case of guilt by association. The yacht was  apparently being used as a command post for drug smugglers purporting to be a  charity for crippled children.  </P> <P> The Navy towed the bedraggled vessel to the Treasure Island naval installation  in San Francisco Bay. In 1981, the rusted hull was pierced by pilings, and the  Potomac sank in 35 feet of water.  </P> <P> A Navy salvage crew spent 12 days lifting her from the muddy bottom of the bay.  That April, the Port of Oakland, the sole bidder, bought the rusted, derelict  heap for $15,000 at auction. It hauled it to dry-dock and provided $400,000 in  seed money to help establish the Assn. for the Preservation of the Presidential  Yacht Potomac, a mostly volunteer organization charged with overseeing the  project. Congress authorized $2.5 million for restoration work.  </P> <P> All seemed fine until workers struck the shipyard that won the contract.  Eventually, workers at the Colberg yard in Stockton spent months welding on a  new hull and replacing the pilot cabin.  </P> <P> The restoration is now in the final stages back at the Oakland waterfront,  workers hoping to have the vessel shipshape for a recommissioning. Historic  photos are guiding them as they attempt to duplicate furniture and match the  ship's appearance, inside and out.  </P> <P> In addition to putting in 8 to 10 hours a day, project manager Holdgate spends  an estimated 25 hours a week in his home garage finishing wood for cabinets and  trim -- "to save money," he said.  </P> <P> Creation of the ship as a national landmark and park would be a boon for  Oakland, which has struggled to make Jack London Waterfront a tourist  attraction.  </P> <P> The idea is to have a land-based FDR interpretive center at an already  completed Roosevelt Pier, built with a $446,000 grant from the state.  </P> <P> The Potomac also stands a good chance in October of being named a national  historic landmark by the National Park System Advisory Board.  </P> <P> "It would be the only memorial (to FDR) on the West Coast and would be  differentiated from the others on the East Coast, which are immovable," said  James Roosevelt, 82, a close adviser to his father who often sailed aboard the  Potomac.  </P> <P> James P. Delgado, chief maritime historian for the National Park Service in  Washington and head of the National Maritime Initiative, a program supporting  preservation of historic vessels, hailed the effort. Aboard the Potomac, he  said, "there very much is a sense of FDR."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Russian Federation -- </F> Altay Kray" column]    [Text] On 24 January a briefing took place at the Kray  administration where Vladimir Rayfikesht, former head of the  Kray administration, spoke about the motives for his  resignation. V. Rayfikesht cited personal reasons as the main  motive but refused to comment on it. Furthermore, he considers  it impossible for him to continue work at the post of kray  governor owing to the inconsistent reform course pursed by the  government. Rayfikesht blamed the latter for the economic  crisis and the colossal outflow of hard currency funds and raw  materials from Russia. At the same time, Rayfikesht stressed  that "although the government composition is bad, another would  have been 100 times worse." In Rayfikesht's opinion, Yeltsin  can no longer enjoy the entirety of his powers. The former  governor stressed that the Russian president displayed weakness  when after the elections to the Federal Assembly he failed to  consolidate the reformist wing in the government. Hence the  resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov, which only aggravated the  situation. Summing up his performance in the kray, Rayfikesht  stated that he is leaving with a clear conscience. First, the  kray has not become "a preserve of socialism." Second, market  structures have been put in place. Rayfikesht stressed that the  incumbent administration is not responsible for the production  decline in the kray, since that was largely conditioned by the  financial and credit policy pursued by the government.</p>

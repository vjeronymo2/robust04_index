			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Travel: Moules and masterpieces - Susan Moore worships at the altars of art and food in Bruges A larger than life Jan Van Eyck, brush and palette in one hand and beloved bagpipe by his side, presides over the small square by our hotel. We breakfast on strawberries piled in blue and white bowls lifted out of a 17th century still life, marvel at Michelangelo, take deep draughts of Memling and blond beer tasting like nectar, and dine robustly in the house of the Renaissance painter Pieter Pourbus. From day one it is clear that Bruges is a place to worship at the twin altars of high art and the soon-to-expand stomach. For this is a city where moules comes by the four-litre pan, extra frites are offered as a matter of course, and every cup of coffee comes accompanied by a chocolate. And Bruges at table is so like Bruges in the street. Streetscapes of canals and crow-stepped gables have earned it the reputation of the Venice of the North, but there is none of the Serenissima's faded splendour or aristocratic hauteur. Bruges is unashamedly bourgeois: prosperous, spic and span and polite. In this heavily restored Venice, there are no surly waiters or good food only if you know where to find it. Here geraniums in window boxes adorn even the inside of canal walls. Bruges is as pretty as any picture and, oddly enough, comparably two-dimensional. Like its alter ego, it is awash with tourists in season but, unlike it, there seems no escape from the crowds or the lace shops. Strolling along cobbled streets past ornate, once-medieval public buildings and soft domestic red brick, it seems a city of facades but few interiors. It almost would not surprise me to discover that the whole place was an ingeniously constructed film-set. There are, however, at least three glorious places of refuge. The spartan interior of the Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk - more familiarly Notre Dame, but here Flemish, even English, is preferred to French - boasts the sumptuous gilt-bronze Renaissance mausoleums of Charles the Bold and his daughter Mary of Burgundy; visible beneath them, thanks to judiciously placed mirrors, their original narrow tombs, gauchely painted red and black like early wood cuts. Here, too, is the Michelangelo, a pensive marble Madonna seated on a rock, the standing Christ-child, eyes cast down, nestling between her legs and clasping his mother's left hand. Her mournful sadness is heart-rending. The sculpture was made for Siena Cathedral but sold instead to the Mouscron family of Bruges. We were not supposed to view it head on, as currently aligned - the evidence is the cut of the marble. Stand way to the left to see it at its best. St James's Church was the original location for the Moreel altarpiece by the far from 'Primitive' Hans Memling, a triptych which not only includes portraits of the donor Willem Moreel and his wife but their five sons and 11 daughters. Memling is the city's greatest adoptive son who left his native Rhineland to pursue a lucrative career in cosmopolitan Bruges in 1465. St John's Hospital, now the Memling Museum, still lays claim to handful of his masterpieces. The Groeningemuseum (which is host to a major Memling exhibition, until November 15) also boasts Jan Van Eyck's wondrous 'Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele'. But then, one of the great advantages of visiting Bruges is that Ghent is only 20 minutes away by train. There, in St Baaf's Cathedral, locked in bullet, earthquake and everything-proof glass is Jan and Hubert Van Eyck's 'Adoration of the Mystic Lamb', the most sublime evocation of heavenly paradise ever painted. That was our ambrosial lunch, and there was plenty of time to get back before dinner. The author travelled from Ramsgate to Ostend by Sally Lines jetfoil (reservations 0843-595522) and stayed at the 18th century Relais Oud-huis Amsterdam in Bruges (tel: 050-34 18 10). The crossing takes 1hr 40 mins. The train direct from the port of Ostend to Bruges takes 12 minutes.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Recovery heralded at MoDo A long-awaited upturn in the forestry cycle was signalled yesterday by MoDo, one of Sweden's leading forestry groups, when it announced a sharply reduced loss for 1993 and predicted a strong return to the black this year. Mr Bernt Lof, chief executive, said: 'The upturn in the market which we clearly saw in the last quarter of 1993 is gaining momentum. The balance between supply and demand is improving.' He noted that prices for pulp and fine paper had already risen strongly this year and predicted increases for other products. MoDo said the price rises and its own competitive position should enable it to produce a profit of more than SKr1bn (Dollars 127m) in 1994. Like other Swedish forestry groups, its position has been improved by cost-cutting, lower interest rates and the weaker krona. It expects capacity utilisation at its units to rise to 90 per cent this year, from 85 per cent in 1993. Last year, the group cut losses after financial items to SKr449m from SKr1.51bn, with the deficit in the fourth quarter amounting to only SKr22m, against SKr824m in the same 1992 period. The group said higher volumes, increased productivity and a near SKr2bn reduction in costs since 1990 had helped to compensate for the fall in market prices during the year. Sales expanded to SKr17.1bn from SKr15.7bn. There was an operating profit of SKr687m, compared with a SKr407m deficit in 1992. MoDo felt the full effects of rationalisation and the weaker krona in its Swedish units, where operating profits reached SKr1.2bn after a SKr182m loss in 1992. However, a deeper operating loss of SKr522m at its French unit proved a drag on the result, as did the higher costs of servicing foreign debt. The French operations were negatively affected by the strong franc and low market prices. The group is not proposing a dividend for the second year running.</p>

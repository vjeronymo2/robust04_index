			<p>BFN     [Text] According to news reports, U.S. hard-line  conservative forces have recently continued to wage an  undisguised war frenzy against our Republic.    According to a Voice of America report on 20 June, two U.S.  senators, including Senator McCain, gave a news conference after  their junket to South Korea, and advocated imposing tough  sanctions against us and reinforcing U.S. forces in South Korea.  They even made provocative, violent remarks, in an undisguised  way, insisting that the United States launch a selective  military strike against us.    Prior to this, in a television interview, Representative  Hamilton, chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee,  remarked that there is a limit to U.S. patience. He said  emphatically: It is necessary to complete the (?threat)  potential of the ROK and U.S. Armed Forces and to make the  intensification of sanctions a way to solve the issue on a  priority basis.    In recent days, a spokesman for the U.S. Defense Department  has found fault with us by saying that our measure of  withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency is  making the situation more dangerous. He made an undisguised  remark to rapidly reinforce U.S. Armed Forces in South Korea and  additionally deploy U.S. military airplanes and an aircraft  carrier to the area near the Korean peninsula.    THE WASHINGTON TIMES, a U.S. newspaper, has reported that  the  U.S. Defense Department has recently made an in-depth  examination of ways to conduct a rapid dispatch of U.S. troops  and U.S. fighter planes and a further dispatch of artillery  detection radar, while additionally dispatching military  intelligence experts to South Korea.    According to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, a U.S. newspaper, U.S.  Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton has made it public that  the United States is further reinforcing U.S. forces in South  Korea with modern weapons and combat equipment.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Simplicity, that's the secret - Robert Langley &amp; Co, 12th in a series on fee-based advisers Douglas Skene practised as a chancery barrister before entering financial planning but, clearly, he did not choose a career as an independent financial adviser (IFA) because he considered this to be less taxing than the law. Skene founded Robert Langley &amp; Co., a fee-based adviser in Leicester, in 1989 after working for the financial group Schroders and a firm of advisers in London. He says: 'In my view, genuine comprehensive financial planning is extremely difficult, and perhaps the majority of the financial services industry has never accepted that. I think that is why some stockbrokers, accountants and merchant banks have failed when they have tried to set up financial planning arms. 'Also, there is an enormous shortage of technically qualified people with the right skills to provide financial planning. If we could find these people, we would have no difficulty in finding the clients.' Skene is an associate of the Institute of Financial Planning and praises the standards it sets. 'If everyone in the industry had to do the IFP exams, it would be a very good industry,' he says. 'There is no doubt about that.' He also believes that better use could be made of technology to raise standards among IFAs. 'The advent of computer technology has offered us the opportunity of doing what would previously have taken us a very long time to do, but I am not sure that any of the financial planning software is really satisfactory. 'It all comes down to simplifying something that is quite complicated. I think I know what is required and I have, effectively, written the data base for it.' Skene aims to provide clients with a total planning service in which he looks at all aspects of their financial lives, although he does not use his legal background to usurp the solicitor's role. 'I get involved in trusts and wills and service contracts and staff benefit legislation, but I don't myself compete with solicitors. What I do is act as a catalyst, putting the jigsaw together. 'When I went into the industry, I was very surprised that there were not more people offering genuinely comprehensive financial planning advice. There is a very big demand for this, although this demand is not generally perceived.' At present, Skene is splitting his business so that there is a clear division between what he considers to be the two separate stages of client advice. He argues: 'I think one should first look and see what should be done. Having agreed that, one should look at the advice. I think this is a very important distinction, and I think clients find it attractive to separate the non-generic from the generic advice.' Robert Langley &amp; Co. is a member of the Burns-Anderson Independent Network, which was founded in 1988 under the chairmanship of Sir John Harvey Jones and acquired by its 150 member firms a year ago in a management buy-out. The cornerstone of the network's business is its research and its computerised best advice system which, it claims, is unique. It also deals with compliance matters for members and provides them with the underpin of indemnity insurance. Skene says: 'Burns-Anderson provides us with best advice research and they collect commissions where commissions arise. At the end of the day, what they give me is the research upon which I can make my decisions for clients.' Although Robert Langley is based in Skene's home county of Leicestershire, the clients are not confined to the shires. The majority arrive after either personal recommendation or professional - say, from an accountant or solicitor. Skene says most 'tend to be on the wealthy side. But I have those who have very little income. It is extremely rare that I think there is really nothing I can do for a client.' The firm's hourly rates range from Pounds 100 to Pounds 150. 'I think, at the end of the day, that clients will realise the importance of going to a fee-based adviser,' says Skene. 'Would you go to a doctor who made a living out of commissions on pills and medicines?' First step for all clients is a meeting to discuss their general situation and priorities. Clients are seen by Skene or Hamish Leng, the firm's other adviser, in the Robert Langley offices or at their homes. Skene says: 'I suspect clients come to us in most cases because they have a feeling that, in some ways, their financial affairs need direction and focusing. There is a basic contradiction. People are very concerned about their financial circumstances but very lethargic about doing anything about them.' After the first client meeting, Skene assesses the information and might then arrange a further meeting 'to delve more deeply into what clients are trying to achieve. I will then try to spell out more specifically what I feel their options are. 'After this second meeting, I would probably write them a report. I have a set way of doing that, which I think is very readable.' All clients are seen at least once a year. Robert Langley does not run a managed fund service. It either uses other investment managers or invests on behalf of clients on an advisory basis. Skene says: 'If I have done my job properly, I should have got to a stage where the recommendations I make are ones that clients will agree to. When I go wrong, it is because I have not appreciated the clients' views.' He adds: 'If I have learned anything in this business, it is that every client is very different.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------                  THE INDEPENDENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Name of Financial advisor:      Robert Langley &amp; Co  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Address of head office:         Snowden Lodge,                                 North Kilworth,                                 Leics LE1 7 6NE  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Date firm was established:      August 1989  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Regulator:                      Fimbra  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Funds under management:         Pounds 20m  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Number of clients:              350  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Number of offices:              3  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Minimum investment:             No minimum  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Services offered:               Comprehensive financial planning  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Fees:                           Pounds 100 to Pounds 150 an hour  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

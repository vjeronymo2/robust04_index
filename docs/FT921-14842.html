			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Citic Pacific to acquire Hang Chong CITIC Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Beijing's China International Trust and Investment Corporation, yesterday announced it planned to pay HKDollars 3bn (USDollars 389m) to take full control of Hang Chong Investment, a large Hong Kong trading and property company in which it owns 36 per cent. The move should give Citic Pacific full control over a diversified and well-established group. It will also help silence critics who say Citic has only been able to build strategic stakes in key Hong Kong companies such as Cathay Pacific Airways. Citic Pacific described Hang Chong, which holds the franchises for several motor dealerships, as 'an ideal vehicle' for it to increase its direct business involvements in Hong Kong and China. The company will largely finance the increased stake in Hang Chong through a share consolidation and issue of new shares to raise HKDollars 2.6bn. Citic Hong Kong, an unlisted company which holds 47 per cent of Citic Pacific, will hold 44 per cent following the transaction. Kerry Trading, owned by Malaysian financier Mr Robert Kuok, who has developed close links with Citic Pacific, will raise its stake by 1 percentage point to 17 per cent. Citic Pacific also announced it was increasing its stake in Hong Kong's second airline, Dragonair, to 46 per cent with the acquisition of a further 7.46 per cent from Citic Hong Kong. Over the past year, Citic Hong Kong, which is directly owned by Beijing, has shifted a number of key stakes into Citic Pacific, which it hopes to turn into a leading Hong Kong 'hong', or trading conglomerate. With the completion of the transactions, which are conditional upon shareholder approval, Citic Pacific's market capitalisation is estimated to rise from HKDollars 8.5bn to HKDollars 11bn, making it one of the colony's 25 largest listed companies. However, Hang Chong's high profile chief executive, Mr Francis Yuen, appointed by Citic Pacific to head the company in September, has resigned following disagreements with Citic management. Mr Yuen's appointment was questioned by some analysts since neither he nor Citic Pacific has experience managing trading companies. Citic Pacific led a consortium which paid HKDollars 6.94bn, equal to HKDollars 330 a share, for Hang Chong in September. Except for Kerry Trading, all the members of the consortium are selling to Citic Pacific at an equivalent price of HKDollars 390 a share. Mr Li Ka-shing, who held a 19 per cent stake in the consortium, is estimated to have earned HKDollars 232m on the transaction.</p>

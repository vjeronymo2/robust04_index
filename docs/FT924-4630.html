			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): The bottom line, how Reuters made the news - The remarkable history of an institution and its visionary founder THE POWER OF NEWS: THE HISTORY OF REUTERS by Donald Read Oxford University Press, Pounds 20, 432 pages ANYONE WHO knows Reuters a little will be aware of two things: its obsession with speed and accuracy and the sometimes melodramatic schisms between its general newsgathering and commercial news arms. It is pleasant, therefore, to have this history confirm that it was more or less so from the beginning. By the time that Julius Reuter, third son of the chief rabbi of Cassel, launched his first news service in Paris in 1849, he already had behind him several years' experience in his uncle's bank in Gottingen. No doubt it was the revolutionary atmosphere of Paris in 1848 that excited Reuter's imagination and led him into a formative alliance with Sigismund Englander, an anarchist, freelance diplomat and scribbler. But from the very beginning, the news sheet which Reuter sent from Paris to Germany was crammed with Paris Bourse prices, as well as gossip and accounts of proceedings in the national assembly. The connection between financial and political information has informed the Reuters business ever since. Donald Read says his main theme in this book, which is to be followed by two more detailed volumes covering the same story, is 'the working (or otherwise) of the Reuter news tradition.' How did it begin? How free is it from bias? Fortunately, he does not leave out, although he treats less fully and less thoughtfully, what some will think the more interesting story: how did a German-founded telegraphic news agency turn into a central communications corridor of the British Empire, before surviving the stagnation and brawling of post-war Fleet Street to emerge as a leading provider of electronic information to the financial markets ? Although an official history, the book does not hesitate to challenge Reuter's heavy reliance through most of its history on funding and favours from the British government. But Reuter's early success, after a series of false starts on the continent, was very much in the sphere of economic news. Shortly after the opening of the cross-Channel telegraph cable, he established himself in the City, selling information on continental markets to the London stock exchange and sending telegraphic messages for his London customers. He established a continental network of information channels, using telegraph, mail, steamship and pigeon and developed an ambitious series of alliances with other information agencies across the world, securing cartels whenever he could. At first, he was excluded from selling information to newspapers by the haughtiness of The Times, but the proliferation of newspapers which followed the repeal of newspaper stamp duty in 1855 created the conditions for Reuter to prosper. Until his retirement in 1878, Julius Reuter applied to his business his gifts of vision, organisation, determination and salesmanship. He was also constantly alert to new technology, making early use of wireless, for example. The flamboyant Englander was by this time chief of the London editorial bureau, from which position he was still insisting to Julius Reuter's successor in 1886 that Reuter journalists must be hommes politiques rather than mere reporters. At the height of the British Empire, this Reuter-Englander blend of shrewd efficiency and wordliness was a potent, profitable mix. Queen Victoria read her Reuter telegrams, vouchsafing to Disraeli that Reuter was one 'who generally knows.' When Reuter died at his villa in Nice in 1899, he left a solid, if not stupendous, estate. Under the leadership of his less gifted son, Baron Herbert, Reuters at first rode the full tide of imperial greatness, but also made mistakes, including a disastrous diversification into banking. Weakened financially as Europe slithered towards the 1914-18 war, Reuters found its expenses rising and its revenue stagnating. A long-standing alliance of interests with the British Foreign Office turned, on certainly more than one occasion, to secret payments for services rendered. Between the wars Reuters had, in Sir Roderick Jones, another leader of great forcefulness. It was Jones who, in 1926, started the process of selling Reuters into the collective ownership of the British press. With the growth of the great American agencies, Reuters was now in an intensely competitive business. Jones's autocratic regime saw some improvements in Reuter's range of reporting and growth in the by now Cinderella commercial services, but there was no post-imperial vision and no understanding of the deadliness of any embrace between newsman and government minister. It was eventually the exposure of yet another secret deal between Reuters and the Foreign Office that led to Jones's resignation in 1941. The 1941 trust agreement between the squabbling British and colonial newspapers which now owned Reuters provided a certain kind of security, but it was hardly likely to nurture dynamic management and growth. It also tended to buoy the spirits of those within Reuters who were more interested in general news than business. As Derek Jameson, later to be editor of the Daily Express, is quoted here as telling a hapless commercial service colleague: 'Sorry, cock. They've just formed their 29th postwar government in Italy. No room for your crap.' But that could not stop the black ink from business information flowing even more strongly than the red from general news. For a period, Reuters resorted to that last refuge of a desperate management: it ceased to declare divisional profits figures as separate lines. As in all geopolitical struggles, power eventually followed economic success. The board knew that it needed more commercial service income to avoid levying heavier tariffs on its newspaper owners and in the 1960s and 1970s, Reuters promoted to key positions individuals who had risen through the commercial service. Multilingual, technologically alert, willing to take large but calculated business risks, these men shaped the new Reuters. Profits in the 1970s never exceeded Pounds 4m. By the end of the 1980s, they had reached Pounds 283m. All of this made possible the flotation of Reuters as a public company in 1984, yielding a fine bonanza for the Fleet Street owners and raising questions, confidently dismissed in this book, about their fidelity to the terms of the Reuters trust. Read's account of the flotation contains new and arresting information, but his narrative of Reuter's rise to pre-eminence in electronic business information does not quite convey either the scale of the achievement or an adequate explanation for it. Here was an organisation bereft of capital, unused to borrowing, barely profitable, and owned by one of the most quarrelsome groups of businessmen on the planet; yet it transformed itself, in a decade when Fleet Street was still spending most its time fighting outdated industrial relations battles. Read certainly touches on some of the factors involved: the maturing of an intake of well-educated trainees; a culture attuned to the importance of technology shifts; the chemistry between senior executives; luck. He also reasons that some of the most dramatic advances were really the result of defensive moves. These points are no doubt valid as far as they go, but they do not account for one of the most remarkable management stories in British business since the war. There is nothing much here, for example, about Reuter's competitors and nothing at all to help the reader towards a judgment on the sustainability of the company's achievements. But Read is right to conclude that were Julius Reuter to return from the grave, he would be glad to see his creature still noted for speed and accuracy in both economic and general news, still innovative in terms of technology and still a global player. 'Not least,' Read notes, 'he would be delighted that Reuters was making large profits.'</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Kitty Little makes Pounds 150,000 In view of the profit made in 1992 and the current trend, Kitty Little Group is returning to dividends with a payment of 1p. The last distribution was the final for 1990. In what was a difficult year for the retail sector, with exports 'surprisingly difficult', the USM-quoted group held its turnover at Pounds 4.74m (Pounds 4.23m) and produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 150,000, compared with the loss of Pounds 306,000. There were no exceptional charges this time, against Pounds 218,000. For the current year results in the first quarter were encouraging. 'I expect every segment of the business to perform satisfactorily,' said Mr Graham Webster, the chairman. The group distributes four main product ranges - fragrances, reading glasses, sunglasses and luxury toilet bags. It had seen a fundamental change of profile from the original fragrance business heavily orientated towards Christmas, but that division still represented about 50 per cent of overall business. Earnings per share were 1.05p (losses 1.96p). Cost of the dividend was Pounds 21,000 after waivers by the directors.</p>

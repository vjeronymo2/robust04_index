			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENLARGING THE COUNTY BOARD  </P> <P> My family has always been proud of our Mexican and German heritages during our  gatherings and special trips taken to the places where our family lived in  Mexico and Germany. My father is proud of his heritage as many of us are, but  has chosen not to wear it on his sleeve as The Times is suggesting. He hasn't  had to. During the last two elections he has run unopposed in a district that  happens to be largely Latino/Hispanic.  </P> <P> As he nears the end of his political life it would do well to look at his  accomplishments over the last 25 years. Your paper has failed to do so over and  over again. It is no wonder that people of high purpose, intelligence, caring  and good strong values, like my father, do not seek public office or stay in it  very long. Journalism such as your recent efforts breaks down the willingness  to serve the people.  </P> <P> Knowing full well what goes on in the county, and what it takes to politically  survive there, I've seen races hard fought (Mike Antonovich) and lost (Baxter  Ward, Yvonne Braithwaite Burke) due to the kind of representation that forces  voters to think harder about their choices in county government.  </P> <P> The people of the First District have spoken very loud over the last 18 years  with their vote. He must be doing something right.  </P> <P> THOMAS SCHABARUM  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

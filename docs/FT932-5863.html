			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Mayoral polls will point way ahead for Italy: Milan is the big prize for old and new parties SHAKEN by terrorist bombings and stirred by 16 unrelenting months of revelations about political corruption, almost 11m Italians will go to the polls next Sunday in the first big test of public opinion since last year's general election. The voting in mayoral polls will provide the clearest snapshot yet of the country's mood and the balance of power between the parties. With national politics in ferment after deepening divisions among the Socialists - severely tainted by the corruption scandals - and the departure of the popular Mr Mario Segni from the Christian Democrats, the outcome will be decisive in mapping the months before a general election widely expected in the autumn. Attention on Sunday will focus on a handful of cities, led by Milan, where new ground is being broken constitutionally as well as politically. For the first time, voters in towns in mainland Italy will be choosing their mayor directly, in a reform originally put forward by Mr Segni's referendum movement. Voters will still be presented with party lists, but the contenders for mayor need not be linked to any party. The new system's impact has already been seen in the run-up to the polls, with a much greater concentration on candidates than on parties. The change has contributed to the erosion of traditional allegiances, and is likely to accentuate the broader disillusionment with the established political order now sweeping much of Italy. The newly elected mayors will be free to make their own appointments to the city council, eliminating the arduous horse-trading usually associated with the translation of electoral support into party politically balanced councils. But distancing the mayor's job from party structures does not mean Sunday's polls are being ignored by the main groupings. Winning control of Milan, Italy's second city, and Turin, its fourth, represents an important prize for the victor and a severe loss of face for the losers. The Lombard League, represented by Mr Marco Formentini, its parliamentary leader, is pinning its hopes on winning Milan. Victory would provide the boost Mr Umberto Bossi, its leader, seeks after gaining control of many smaller Lombardy towns. The League still suffers from criticisms that it is no more than a protest movement. Winning in Milan would provide the chance to show it has real policies and the talent to govern a large conurbation. Failure would be a serious blow in its Lombard homeland and reinforce suggestions it may be running out of steam. Victory for Mr Nando dalla Chiesa, a popular sociologist and MP for La Rete (Network) would also shake up the established political order. Mr dalla Chiesa, whose father, a Carabinieri general, was assassinated by the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s, is one of La Rete's co-founders with Mr Leoluca Orlando. The growing support for the party, which puts crime-and-corruption-busting at the top of its agenda, epitomises the current breakdown in established voting patterns. Success in Milan, where Mr dalla Chiesa is supported by the Democratic Party of the Left, the former Communists, could help significantly creation a stronger left-wing alliance nationwide. Failure by both Mr Piero Bassetti and Mr Piero Borghini, two of the three candidates representing the broad political centre, would be a blow to the established parties. Mr Bassetti, a former Christian Democrat chairman of the Lombardy region, is struggling to shake off his political past. Mr Borghini, a former Communist turned independent, elected mayor with the blessing of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, would also like people to forget his links. Though he is widely seen as honest and intelligent, the Socialist stigma is so strong that Mr Borghini politely declined the party's formal backing. With corruption at the forefront and established party alliances crumbling, dividing lines between local and national issues have become blurred. Most of the 12 Milan candidates are offering broadly similar policies. Eliminating political corruption and making city government more transparent are at the forefront. De-politicising urban administrations by basing appointments on ability rather than party affiliations also feature prominently. The winner may not be known until a widely expected run off, due on June 20. But whoever captures Milan, the message to Rome is clear: Italian politics are changing, and those unable to react in time and reform run the risk of being swept away.</p>

The talks were conducted in  a warm [re qing 3583 1906] and friendly atmosphere.    President Suessmuth warmly welcomed Chairman Qiao Shi's  official friendly visit to Germany, and assessed highly the  development of German-Chinese relations and the friendly  cooperation between Germany and China in recent years. She said  that the ties between Germany and China, especially since 1992,  had been very close. Although the two countries were wide apart  in distance, relations between them had been sound in the 20-odd  years since the establishment of diplomatic relations. She  indicated that German- Chinese relations maintained  long-standing traditions, which were very important for the  future too. She said that China was undergoing great economic  reform, for which Germany had shown great concern. China had a  population of 1.1 billion, with 50-odd nationalities. China had  maintained stability and unity; that was a tremendous  accomplishment not easily achieved.    Chairman Qiao Shi expressed his thanks for President  Suessmuth's welcome on behalf of the FRG Federal Assembly. He  said that the ties between China and Germany had a long history;  such ties involved not only economic relations and trade, but  also other fields, including culture and science. Since the  PRC's founding, it had all along cared about developments in  Germany, while paying attention to and showing concern for the  reunification of the German nation. Therefore, when the new  change came, we did not find it too sudden, and correctly  handled the relations between China and Germany. Since  diplomatic relations between China and Germany were established,  their bilateral relations had enjoyed sound development, with  all sorts of resistance gradually eliminated, and the bilateral  relations of friendly cooperation accumulated and developed.  Over the past few years, Sino-German economic and trade  relations had been sound in their development. In 1992, the  trade volume between the two countries rose to some $6 billion,  and it was around $9 billion in 1993. At the same time,  exchanges and cooperation in all arenas, including culture,  science, technology, and education, thrived. Of course, in the  course of making progress, difficulties were inevitable;  however, the two countries had done their best to overcome  difficulties; consequently, bilateral relations were forging  ahead. Last November, Chancellor Kohl headed a large delegation  visiting China, with satisfactory successes scored; thus a new  phase of Sino-German relations has begun.    Chairman Qiao Shi indicated that the relations between the  NPC and the German Federal Assembly had also developed  continuously. Two vice presidents of the German Federal Assembly  had already visited China, in addition to some other Federal  Assembly members visiting China one after another. Because of  the two sides' joint efforts, President Qiao Shi believed that  his current visit would be successful. He formally invited  President Suessmuth to visit China at a suitable time.    Chairman Qiao Shi said that China is developing; it has a  vast territory and 56 nationalities; there are many aspects that  call for Germany's understanding, and there is a need for mutual  understanding and exchange of information between the two  countries. He said that at present China was focusing its  efforts on pursuing construction, and hoped for the maintenance  of a peaceful and stable world environment. At home, China  hoped to maintain long-range social stability; because without  stability, China's economic and cultural construction would be  out of the question. In more than a century of modern Chinese  history, China had not really been unified and stable, and the  Chinese people had to lead lives without stability while  enduring great suffering. It was precisely because of this that  China was implementing a peaceful foreign policy characterized  by independence, taking the initiative in its own hands, and  safeguarding Asia-Pacific and world peace, while maintaining a  social environment of stability and unity internally.    Chairman Qiao Shi said that in the several years when the  former Soviet Union was going through the most drastic changes,  China had taken the road of reform. Taking the road of reform  meant that at the beginning, the influence of the USSR had been  done away with, while conducting political and economic reform  according to China's actual conditions. In the 15-year reform,  China's economy had been improved and would continue to be  improved; furthermore, the people's political status had been  greatly elevated; they could freely air their views, and their  minds were at ease. He said that China was a vast country, and  the central government's macroeconomic regulation and control  were indispensable; at the same time, it was imperative to give  full play to the enthusiasm of various localities. Those two  aspects were equally important. Last year, China set forth the  principle of building the socialist market economy, and the  Constitution was revised at the NPC, with that point set down in  the Constitution. That had great effects at home and abroad;  and at the same time set arduous tasks for us. China was to set  up the framework of the socialist market economy by the year  2000; in the current NPC session, China must set up the legal  framework of the socialist market economy. He indicated that  the tasks for economic legislation would be numerous; and there  would also be legislation in education, science and technology.  China was doubling its efforts to do a good job of building its  legal system.    Participating in the talks were major members of Chairman  Qiao Shi's entourage Cao Zhi, NPC Standing Committee secretary  general; Ye Gongqi, Shanghai Municipal People's Congress  Standing Committee chairman; Redi, Tibet Autonomous Regional  People's Congress Standing Committee chairman; Dai Jie, NPC  Standing Committee member and concurrently NPC Financial and  Economic Committee vice chairman; Vice Foreign Minister Jiang  Enzhu; and Chinese Ambassador to Germany Mei Zhaorong.</p>

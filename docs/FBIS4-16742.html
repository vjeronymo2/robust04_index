			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen Republic will hold talks with Russia  only through the Foreign Ministry. INTERFAX correspondents  report that this decision was taken at the session of the  Chechen Government on Friday [15 April].    In an interview with INTERFAX the Chechen president's aide  Soltmurat Apazov said that this means raising the status of  talks to the level of inter-state ones. According to the Chechen  president Djokhar Dudayev, the step was taken to regulate the  relationships between the two states. As it has become known to  Interfax, the matter was discussed in telephone talks between  the Dudayev and his representative in Moscow. This emphasizes  the fact, said Dudayev, that the Chechen Republic does not  consider itself the subject of the Russian Federation.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Observer: Dog of war On the Pacific island of Guam - at the US official war dog cemetery - you will soon be able to visit a life-size bronze sculpture of a Doberman, erected in honour of the many dogs which died helping US troops in the war against Japan. The dogs 'saved hundreds of lives on the island and thousands the Pacific', says retired Lt Gen Claude M. Kicklighter, director of the Pentagon's 50th anniversary of the second world war commemoration committee. As yet, no mention of a presidential medal for Socks.</p>

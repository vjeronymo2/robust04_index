According to Helio Vigio, chief of the DAS  [Counter-Kidnapping Headquarters], the main drug traffickers  from the Red Command and Third Command gangs have established  illegal enterprises to supply men and weapons and plan the  collection of ransom, and they even have experts to negotiate  with the kidnapped victims' families.    According to police, Flavio Negao, from the Vigario Geral  slum, and Orlando Jogador, from the Alemao and Marcelo Xara  slums on Varginha Hill, besides being drug traffickers also  kidnapped people and robbed bullion in the past four months.  "The news now is that smaller gangs are kidnapping minor  businessmen to raise money to buy drugs," said Inspector  Placidio Guimaraes, DAS operations chief.    Other gangs, like that of drug trafficker Robertinho from  Parada de Lucas slum, which is linked to the Third Command, rent  sophisticated weapons for kidnapping and bullion robbery  operations. They also provide men for operations in exchange for  a percentage of the ransom. Joel de Oliveira Carvalho says he is  "an expert in negotiating with the victims' families" and also  provides other services to kidnappers.    Vigio says drug traffickers usually buy drugs in return. "If  police discover one of their drug caches, they need to find  money quickly to buy more drugs and not lose their supplier," he  said.    According to DAS, there currently are seven kidnapped people  in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

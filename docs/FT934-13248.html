			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / More NHS job losses planned: About 2,000 administrative posts to go in proposed restructuring LARGE NUMBERS of National Health Service administrative jobs will be lost under proposals to simplify the management structure announced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday. Unison, the public service union, estimated that the plans would mean 2,000 job losses in addition to 3,000 administrative posts that it says have gone already this year. Ministers say every effort will be made to minimise compulsory redundancies when the 14 English regional health authorities are reduced to eight next year and the service's Leeds-based management executive is slimmed down. Mrs Bottomley was announcing her decisions on an internal review into the higher level structure of the NHS now that the management of hospitals has been devolved to local level. The proposed eight amalgamated regions will have only a short life as statutory authorities. Legislation to abolish regional authorities from 1996 will be introduced next year. The authorities will be replaced by regional offices of the management executive, which is answerable to Mrs Bottomley for the day-to-day running of the NHS. Mrs Bottomley said she would limit the budgets of the management executive and regional offices in order to 'bear down on administrative costs to maximise spending on patients'. The existing regions and executive cost Pounds 200m a year to run. A battle over the extent to which the NHS needs direct government regulation since the 1991 health reforms has been fought out behind the review. Although the government said yesterday's plans were based on the review committee's preferred option, the team offered more radical alternatives in its report. It suggested a formal separation between the Department of Health and the NHS through the creation of an English National Health Authority, or that the management executive could become an arm's-length agency. Mrs Bottomley decided that separating the service from the department could reduce parliamentary and public accountability. The management executive will remain within the Department of Health but develop a more clearly defined head office identity. Even though Mrs Bottomley has taken a relatively cautious approach, critics immediately accused her of further centralising the service and reducing public accountability. Unison said the proposals were a denial of democracy while Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said they were rampant bureaucracy and would reduce accountability. While regional health authorities are not elected, they have members appointed to represent community interests. Critics fear the community link would be undermined if they were replaced by Civil Service regional offices. Mrs Bottomley intends to appoint a non-executive member from each of the eight regions to sit on the NHS policy board in London. But this will not satisfy campaigners for greater accountability.

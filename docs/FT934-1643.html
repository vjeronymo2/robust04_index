			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fairline powers back to the black Fairline Boats powered back into the black in 1992-93 with overseas sales bolstered by sterling's devaluation in 1992. Recovery at the Peterborough-based luxury powerboat maker gathered pace through the second half with pre-tax profits for the full year to end-September working through at Pounds 558,000. That compared with previous losses of Pounds 507,000. The shares responded with a 16p rise to 298p. Conditions in all of Fairline's export markets were helped by the devaluation while new boats introduced in the year - Targa 38, Phantom 37 and Squadron 47 - were all 'exceptionally' well received. Turnover improved from Pounds 27.7m to Pounds 33.7m with about 90 per cent of output going to European countries. Mr Sam Newington, chairman, was expecting some impact from the deepening recession in Fairline's main markets, pointing out that this had already been experienced in Spain, France and Italy as well as the Scandinavian countries. In Germany, however, sales were holding up quite well, UK sales were showing some improvement while east Asian sales were significantly better. At the end of November the company held 11 per cent more value of order deposits than 12 months earlier and its total outstanding order book value was ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 15m. Overall, Mr Newington was looking for a better year in 1993-94 with improved margins working through when the new boats were 'in full and efficient production.' City analysts were anticipating pre-tax profits in the region of Pounds 1m for 1993-94. However, that depended on the outcome of the London and Dusseldorf boat shows in January which would be a key factor of the outcome. Fairline has a strong balance sheet with more cash in hand than at this time last year after paying off a large part of its development loans for its factories at Weldon and Oundle, Northamptonshire. A final dividend of 6.925p maintains the total at 10.5p. Earnings of 10.6p compared with previous losses of 7p.</p>

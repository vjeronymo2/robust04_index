It is one of the major items on the agenda in line  with the objective of the grouping, that is to strengthen  South-South cooperation. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir  Mohamed is among the several leaders who are present in the  Indian capital for the summit.    Our correspondent Vasunta Rajkumaran has these details:    [Begin recording] [Rajkumaran] Good morning! Though the  summit does not draw the full participation of all the 15 heads  of state or government, it will be no less significant with a  perusal of the agenda reveals the commitment being attached by  member countries to ensure the continued development of the  G-15. One of the major topics to be discussed is the future  course of the group in a fast changing world. This summit is  being regarded as a watershed in the development of the group.  It will provide the leaders an opportunity to look at the G-15  with fresh perspective. In fact, the group has the potential of  becoming consultative partners with the G-7 on issues and  policies affecting the international environment for accelerated  growth and sustainable development.    Malaysia views the G-15 as the beginning of a collaborative  effort towards a North-South dialogue. The minister of foreign  affairs, Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, says as there is a  stronger call for a North-South dialogue, there is certainly a  role for the G-15 in the future.    [Badawi] We have begun to see lately that there is now also  a stronger and stronger call for North-South dialogue. The  North-South dialogue is something that we must have. But then  we must begin with a successful South-South cooperation. I  cannot see how a North-South dialogue can be successful as far  as advancing the interest of the countries of the South as much  as protecting the interests of the South if there is no  effective South-South cooperation. And G-15 certainly  emphasized on that. I would see G-15 as the beginning of a  collaborative effort towards that. South-South cooperation has  been much an idea. Since it is an idea, we talk about  South-South cooperation. So G-15 tries to implement, tries to  come out with projects that make South-South cooperation a  reality.    [Rajkumaran] The other major issues on the agenda are the  questions of frequency of summit and the level and composition  of the summit quorum. The foreign ministers at their meeting  reached a consensus that the summit should be held every two  years so as to ensure a better participation among the leaders.  They have also proposed that heads who are genuinely unable to  attend summits be allowed to send special envoys. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Rolls-Royce keeps hold of the steering wheel: The agenda behind yesterday's BMW deal For as long as Rolls-Royce Motor Cars remains true to its traditions as a producer of luxury cars at the very highest  - and much the most volatile  - end of the new car market, it will have difficulty controlling its own destiny. The engine supply and collaborative engineering agreement it announced yesterday with BMW of Germany should at least make the long-term task easier without, as yet, compromising its relative independence. It lifts from the illustrious Crewe-based carmaker, a subsidiary of Vickers, one of the heaviest financial burdens facing any small-scale vehicle manufacturer  - to design, develop and manufacture the complex engines needed to propel more than two tonnes of vehicle and to meet a maze of ever-stricter legislation on exhaust emissions, fuel economy and other technical standards. Rolls-Royce's own engines, with their roots in the 1950s, can meet emission standards up to the end of this century. Yesterday's deal, arrived at after months of negotiation with both BMW and possible alternative supplier Mercedes-Benz  - Vickers yesterday freely admitted playing one off against the other  - goes a lot further. The V8 and V12 engines BMW already produces for its own vehicles will be jointly re-engineered for the Rolls-Royce and Bentley ranges. Another Vickers subsidiary, Cosworth Engineering, which specialises in high-performance car engines, is also to play a role in their development. The two companies will look at other component systems and technological help BMW might be able to supply to Rolls-Royce. Not least, they will explore how best to build and bring to market 'Concept Java', the spectacular prototype coupe Rolls-Royce has been displaying at motor shows around the world. The response has been overwhelmingly favourable. The collaboration is aimed at helping Rolls-Royce to bring its next generation of new models to market towards the end of the century. As Mr Peter Ward, Rolls' chairman and chief executive, said yesterday: 'There is no screaming rush.' What the deal seemingly does not do, in spite of much media speculation to the contrary, is to launch immediately the now-familiar process of a small British carmaker with a big reputation being absorbed into a much bigger foreign one. There is no provision for BMW either to buy Rolls-Royce, or to take an equity stake. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, said yesterday neither was in prospect 'for the foreseeable future'. Rolls-Royce executives point out that the agreement, of which no financial details were released yesterday, is not all one way. Rolls-Royce has been quietly advising BMW on its interior trim for several years. Mr Chandler left the door at least slightly ajar, however, in acknowledging that 'nothing is impossible in the long term'. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman who was in London for the announcement, said: 'If and when it is on the table we will discuss it.' BMW earlier this year bought Rover Group, whose Swindon pressings plant already supplies the bodies for Rolls-Royce's existing cars. Mr Pischetsrieder said that BMW wants to get even more closely involved in the UK industry. When it comes to the long term, Rolls-Royce's management readily concedes that one of its biggest problems, the volatility of the luxury market, will never go away. Even if it were able to prove its disputed claim to make 'the best car in the world', the company would be unable to prevent sales plunging more sharply than those of other carmakers in times of recession. When jobs are being cut and other costs slashed, the cars  - no matter how good they may be  - become the unacceptable face of indulgence and sales dry up. In the past Rolls-Royce has slipped into losses just as predictably as it has risen to being Vickers' single biggest profit earner when the good times have returned. Mr Ward insists that the financial rollercoaster has come to an end as the result of drastic action to reduce the company's break-even level. When the last recession struck in 1991 the Crewe factory needed to produce 2,400 cars to break even. Its sales plunged from 3,333 in 1990 to 1,723 in 1991 and to 1,378 in 1992. According to Mr Ward flexible team working, heavy investment in automated machining processes and other productivity measures had reduced the break-even level to below 1,300 at the start of this year and higher margins from niche models such as the Bentley Continental coupe have reduced this further. As a result Rolls-Royce is believed to be on course to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 12m this year, in spite of world-wide sales up only 2.2 per cent, at 1,051, in the first three quarters. Mr Ward said the collaboration with BMW should help reduce that level even further.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: CME to relaunch derivatives in French francs THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange plans to relaunch French franc futures and options contracts. Trading is due to restart on Monday. The new contracts will represent FFr500,000 each. This is twice the size of the CME's last attempt to interest traders in French currency derivatives. 'With the French franc unravelling relative to the D-Mark, and volatility increasing rapidly, we've had a remarkable number of requests for the (franc) contract,' said Mr David Lerman, director of the CME's currency product marketing. The CME, which trades D-Mark, sterling, Swiss franc, yen and Canadian dollar contracts, last traded French franc futures in 1990. A lack of volume prompted the exchange to shelve the product. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which lists French franc options, is the only other US exchange that trades franc derivatives. Mr Lerman said the CME plans to open trading in French franc 'rolling spot' contracts, which approximate over-the-counter currency trades, in early 1994. It has no immediate plans to list the currency futures on Globex, the after-hours electronic trading system. The CME and the New York Mercantile Exchange have finalised plans jointly to develop a standardised trade clearing system, first announced in May. The Dollars 19.35m project is expected to set a standard for other US futures exchanges. Co-operation in clearing could lead the exchanges into other joint ventures, said CME chairman Mr Jack Sandner. He said the CME and Nymex, best known for its energy futures contracts, might re-enter negotiations on Globex.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Algiers (DPA) -- The seizing of an arms delivery in  Morocco, which was destined to Algerian fundamentalists, has  given rise to speculations in Algeria about the international  ties of the armed Islamic fundamentalists. On Wednesday [25  May] the Moroccan judiciary announced that the six Moroccans and  two Algerians, who were arrested on 17 May carried large amounts  of weapons and military equipment, including 13 submachine guns,  ammunition, and 12 infrared night-vision devices. According to  the head of the group, 34-year-old Moroccan Ighir Hassan, the  weapons were bought in Germany and brought to Morocco via Spain.    Thus, for the second time this month, Germany is accused of  being the country of origin of weapons used by the armed groups  in Algeria in the battle against the ruling regime. On 6 May,  on the German-French border, French police arrested an Algerian  who had just entered the country from Germany carrying 5,000  rounds of ammunition, 13 kg of explosives, three automatic  weapons, and other military equipment in his car. In both cases  the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which is banned in Algeria,  was reportedly the customer.    According to Algerian information, several prominent members  of the FIS have asked for political asylum in Germany, including  the sons of FIS founder Abassi Madani, who is in prison in  Algeria, as well as Rabah Kebir, the fundamentalist party's boss  abroad. The latter is accused by Algeria of having been  essentially involved in the bomb attack on the airport in  Algeria on 26 August 1992, during which nine people were killed.  The special court in Algiers has, therefore, sentenced him to  death in absentia. In September 1993, the Munich Regional Court  repealed an extradition warrant for Kebir, because the documents  presented by Algiers did not provide sufficient justification of  the suspicion.</p>

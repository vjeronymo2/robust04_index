			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Mobile phones American Telephone and Telegraph's purchase of a stake in the US group McCaw Cellular has excited interest in the prospects for the mobile phone business in Britain. AT&amp;T wants to be in cellular telephony around the world, and technological development offers a way into the UK market. New digital personal communication networks will begin to be established in the next year or so which will allow much larger numbers of callers to use the networks. At present PCN licences have been granted to Mercury and Microtel; AT&amp;T could apply for a third or throw in its lot with either of the existing licensees. PCN is expensive to establish, but offers high capacity immediately, so these networks will be driven to offer low prices to attract high volumes, undermining the existing networks' margins. If AT&amp;T were prepared to take a long view, it might favour this approach. Of course, another way into the UK market for AT&amp;T would be to buy Vodafone. Indeed, the price it was prepared to pay for control of McCaw makes Vodafone look cheap: hence the latter's price rise last week. However, AT&amp;T would have to pay well over Pounds 4bn for Vodafone, while a PCN network might cost only Pounds 1bn to build. The marketing budget needed to establish PCN is unlikely to cost anything like the difference. Vodafone is currently trying to broaden its base in the UK while retaining its profitable customers. It may also be interested in expanding into Europe, but is equally likely to run into AT&amp;T there. In the long run, Vodafone's exceptional returns will fall victim to the tide.</p>

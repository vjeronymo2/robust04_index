			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Labour whip criticises Blair Mr Tony Blair and his shadow cabinet came under attack from the Labour back benches last night for agreeing to reforms aimed at ending marathon sittings of the Commons. Mr Don Dixon, the party's deputy chief whip, made a temporary move to the backbenches to argue against changes which would aid the passage of government legislation. He said: 'I see no reason, half way through a parliament when we have got the government on the ropes, why we should give up any weapons.' For the remainder of the present parliamentary session at least, 10pm will be the 'normal' hour for the end of Commons business.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Brakes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f)(7) of the final rule specifies provisions regarding machine brakes. Paragraph (f)(7)(i) of the final rule requires that the brakes must be sufficient to hold each machine and its maximum load on the slopes on which the machine is being operated. As discussed above, rated capacity is the maximum load a machine was designed by the manufacturer to handle. This provision was adopted from the proposed rule. Machine brake provisions are also included in various State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K), and in the 1978 ANSI logging standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;22). These commenters also said that OSHA should include provisions requiring brakes to meet certain criteria in respective SAE and ANSI standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The variety of terrain encountered in logging operations makes the adequacy of brakes a critical safety issue. For example, information presented in the preamble to the proposed rule indicated that an operator was unable to stop the machine he was operating on a slope and the machine rolled over (54 FR 18799&hyph;80). The injured operator was trapped in a cab for 45 minutes until he could be rescued. This provision requires that the braking system, that consists of the service and emergency brakes, must be adequate to hold the machine and its maximum allowable load on the slope. For certain machines (tractors and rubber tired skidders), employers can look to national consensus standards for guidance on brake system performance (See SAE J1041, October 1991, ``Breaking System Test Procedure and Braking Performance Criteria for Agricultural Tractors'' and SAE J1178, June 1987, ``Braking Performance_Rubber Tired Skidders''). However, these standards do not cover all machines used in logging operations. Therefore, OSHA is specifying certain minimum brake system requirements for all machines used in logging operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f)(7)(ii) requires that each machine be equipped with a secondary braking system, such as an emergency brake or parking brake. This provision also requires that the secondary system be effective in stopping the machine and maintaining parking performance, regardless of the direction of travel or of whether the engine is running. These requirements parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule. These provisions are also contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. There were no comments opposing these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Guarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraphs (f)(8) (i) and (ii) of the final standard requires that each machine be equipped with guarding to protect employees from exposed moving elements and flying objects. These provisions also require that guarding must meet the requirements specified in subpart O of part 1910. These provisions clarify that guarding requirement also applies to each machine used in debarking, limbing and chipping. The proposed standard also contained a provision requiring machine guarding. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters stated that the provision should be applied only to stationary equipment to prevent misapplication to mobile equipment (Ex. 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57). OSHA believes the record does not support the commenters' recommendation. The Agency believes that both mobile and stationary machines pose a risk of injury due to exposure to moving parts. According to the WIR survey, a significant number of employee injuries involved mobile equipment (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that employees working with or near both types of machine need to be protected. Additionally, requiring all machines to be guarded eliminates the ambiguity as to whether a machine is stationary or mobile (e.g. mobile machines that are used in place, such as a trailer mounted chipper).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA notes that guarding satisfies the requirements of subpart O when it is in the form of a specially constructed and installed barrier or when the structure of the machine itself prevents employee contact with the moving element of the machine. Each machine shall be equipped with guarding to protect employees from exposure to moving elements, such as but not limited to, shafts, pulleys, belts on conveyors, and gears, in accordance with the requirements of subpart O of part 1910.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

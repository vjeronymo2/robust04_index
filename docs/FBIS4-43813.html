			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Murmann, president of the Federation </F> of German Employers' Association, by Andreas Bohne; place and  date not given: "In 1995 There Will Not Be More But Fewer  Unemployed"]    [Text] [Bohne] When will the upswing bring more jobs?    [Murmann] In 1995 we will, all in all, not have more but  fewer unemployed. This year we will have 3.8 million registered  unemployed. Out of this basic unemployment we will be able to  fill several hundred thousands of additional jobs in 1995. Of  course, this is not sufficient, measured in terms of the total  number of unemployed, to which one must add the approximately  1.5 million people who are involved in job-creation and  advanced-training programs. By the way, three months ago I said  that in 1994 the number of unemployed would rise not by 500,000  but only by 300,000.    [Bohne] Do the private labor exchange offices finally reveal  those jobs that have so far not been reported to the state's  labor exchange offices?    [Murmann] Not all of them, but many. And if more people are  now recruited from jobs that are already filled, this can be  accepted. This is simply part of the free play of forces, and,  in the end, private labor exchange offices are a help. I hope  that the law will not be delayed and that the new labor exchange  offices may start very soon.    [Bohne] Are you for entrance-level wages for unemployed  people?    [Murmann] In 1994 we agreed on entrance-level wages in the  chemical industry, which are 90 percent of the normal wages. I  would like other industries to adopt this model, too.    [Bohne] The chancellor has vehemently called for more  part-time jobs.    [Murmann] Indeed, this is an important potential. But many  say that this is not a good idea.    [Bohne] You too?    [Murmann] It is not the only good idea, but it is certainly  one of the possibilities that offer the most chances. The way  of thinking is a problem in this respect. We must get rid of  this blockade. And this needs time, because at the moment it is  typical German social behavior to say: Anyone who works  part-time has lower social prestige.    [Bohne] Meaning that he probably has not found anything  better?    [Murmann] Quite so. Jobs like yours and mine can allegedly  not be split up, which is complete nonsense. In particular,  men, too, must get used to the idea that they can work part-time.    [Bohne] And employers, too?    [Murmann] Even more so. The broad middle echelon is still  braking this process, but not so much top management. All in  all, we must come to completely new forms of work time. Today  only machine time counts in industry. A completely flexible  model should be developed for how the work can be distributed to  make sure that machine time is at its optimum.    [Bohne] Many of your colleagues remain skeptical.    [Murmann] I tell them two things: First, many jobs that are  divided produce higher productivity. The standard example is a  person feeding in data in electronic data processing: If you do  this for four hours you are more productive than if you do this  for eight hours. This is quite clear.    [Bohne] Thus, it is not true that the performance of a job  goes down if the job is divided?    [Murmann] No. My second argument is this: We lose more  than 50 billion marks [DM] of expenditure per year because of  absenteeism, whether for alleged or real illness. These  absences would go down considerably.    [Bohne] In which economic sectors can Germany afford highly  qualified and correspondingly well-paid labor?    [Murmann] Where German industry is traditionally strong, we  will maintain our position only through technical progress. In  machine-building, in the metal and electrical industries, in  automobile construction, and in the chemical industry, we have  productive jobs that can tolerate the corresponding wages.    [Bohne] Where does the opposite apply?    [Murmann] The opposite begins for me in the job "household,  yard, and garden," which has now also been discovered by  politics. Here we have an important field, which is related to  services and in which the potential for additional jobs must be  exploited.    [Bohne] Does this also apply to nursing the elderly and to  caring for children?    [Murmann] The social sector would be the second large  additional area. Here we are not facing international  competition, here the price of labor must develop at the  national level. However, this price must not be so prohibitively  high that -- as is the case now -- no jobs are created.    [Bohne] The qualifications of many of the long-term  unemployed are no longer in demand on the market -- what do you  tell them?    [Murmann] Of the 36 million people gainfully employed in our  country 10 to 15 percent are not sufficiently qualified or could  be qualified more. This is the depressing thing. Society --  and also the partners to the wage negotiations -- must create a  work environment that offers these people value-creating,  satisfying work again. In the recession many people lost their  jobs who would never have thought that this would happen.  Unfortunately, in many cases they cannot expect to find work  with the same income and status as in the past. And with all  due respect to the individual's situation: It is necessary also  to accept jobs with lower qualifications, because in the long  run we cannot pay the costs of unemployment of about DM110  billion per year.    [Bohne] Do we need more entrepreneurial spirit among the  general population?    [Murmann] Absolutely, yes. This is a very decisive factor  for the dynamism of the economy. In the new laender the number  of those becoming self-employed is remarkably high.    [Bohne] What incentives can one provide for that?    [Murmann] The state could perhaps provide tax incentives.  However, I believe that private investors would be called upon  to act far more.    [Bohne] Should the banks issue loans more easily?    [Murmann] There is a lack of risk capital. If I want to  raise a loan on my grandmother's house, I get it. If I want to  do that on an invention that has not yet proved its worth on the  market, this is much more difficult.    [Bohne] Subcontractors in housing construction,  self-employed computer experts in companies, time work: The  trade unions reject forms of work that are a transition toward a  more entrepreneurial spirit as "unprotected employment."    [Murmann] With our rigid system we have catapulted ourselves  into large-scale underemployment. The trade unions will have to  resign themselves to the change.    [Bohne] Is participation in shaping this change a task for  the new DGB [German Trade Union Federation] chairman?    [Murmann] Of course. This week the DGB Federal Congress  will take place. I would like to make a very clear appeal to  the trade unions and to the new DGB chairman. The parties to  the wage negotiations have a decisive coresponsibility for the  situation in the German labor market. We live up to this  responsibility only if we give up old rigid patterns and become  more flexible in work time and in wages. We must get away from  thinking in terms of the masses and move toward wages that are  shaped more in line with company requirements and also include  company profits as an element.    [Bohne] As of next year the state will once again reduce the  income of a young employee who currently gets DM3,700 net out of  his gross salary of DM6,500. How can one still provide  motivation for performance in view of this?    [Murmann] Politics is called upon to reduce the tax quota --  otherwise, we do not get the economic dynamism that we need to  stimulate the labor market.    [Bohne] You are referring to domestic demand?    [Murmann] Yes, apart from exports, I consider domestic  demand to be essential.    [Bohne] To reduce taxes, the state must cut expenditure.  Where can it do that?    [Murmann] Our administration is too expensive. This applies  in particular to the east. There the share of the public sector  in the overall number of working people is about 30 percent  higher than in western Germany. We simply cannot afford this.  Many of the 6.6 million jobs in the public sector must be  abolished. Even if one just does not hire new people for any  job, a considerable saving is very quickly achieved. The  greatest potential for saving is in the personnel in the public  sector.    [Bohne] Could a red-green election victory endanger Germany  as a business location?    [Murmann] Industry and its representatives will cooperate  with any democratically elected federal government. But the  citizen Murmann would consider participation by the Greens in a  federal government as something that would make things very  difficult for industry. Regarding the Social Democrats, it is  to be feared that a federal government led by them would relapse  into the political patterns of the past: redistribution and  enlargement of the social state to the detriment of economic  dynamism. I have criticized the current coalition often. This  criticism is still valid concerning nursing-care insurance, for  instance. However, over the past 12 to 15 months correct  approaches have been made. This has come late, but not too  late. I, for my part, could live well with a continuation of  this coalition.</p>

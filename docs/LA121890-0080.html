			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SEEKS BANK LEVY TO AID FDIC;  </P> <P> FINANCE: INDUSTRY WILL BE ASKED FOR $25 BILLION TO SHORE UP INSURANCE SYSTEM.  FIRMS IN RETURN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENTER OTHER BUSINESSES, SEIDMAN SAYS.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and federal regulators will ask the banking industry --  rather than U.S. taxpayers -- for an extra $25 billion to replenish the rapidly  dwindling insurance fund that protects depositors in case of bank failures, a  top federal regulator said Monday.  </P> <P> Regulators are discussing with bankers the details of a major financial  contribution by the industry, an amount equal to approximately 1% of all  deposits, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,  told a congressional hearing.  </P> <P> The one-time levy would represent a vast increase in payments by banks, which  already are scheduled to pay insurance premiums of approximately $6 billion a  year over the next three years. The special levy would substantially exceed the  current yearly profits of the industry.  </P> <P> But Seidman said the levy is essential to save the fund, adding: "The resort to  the taxpayer is the last resort. It ought not to be done while the industry can  handle the problem."  </P> <P> In return for providing badly needed cash for the insurance fund, banks should  be granted broad new powers to move into other lines of business, and the  traditional state barriers limiting bank expansion should be abolished, Seidman  told the financial institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee.  The expansion of bank powers will be the centerpiece of the Bush  Administration's financial reform program next year.  </P> <P> Seidman called on Congress to take action early next year on the reform  package, including the special levy to bolster the fund that protects deposits  up to $100,000.  </P> <P> Bankers say they are willing to pour additional money into the insurance fund  as part of a legislative package enabling them to enter the insurance and  securities businesses without restraints.  </P> <P> "We have always paid whatever was necessary to keep the fund on a sound  footing, and we have the willingness to continue doing so," said Mark Burneko,  a spokesman for the American Bankers Assn. "The bottom line is the need to get  the fund up as quickly as possible without imposing an overwhelming financial  hardship on the industry."  </P> <P> The insurance fund, which held $18.3 billion just four years ago, will finish  this year at $9 billion and plunge to $4 billion by the close of 1991, Seidman  said. The fund has declined as more than 800 banks have failed since 1986.  Approximately 180 more are expected to fail next year.  </P> <P> Currently, banks pay 19.5 cents into the insurance fund for every $100 worth of  deposits. Those premiums, interests on investments and the special 1% levy on  all deposits could generate $52 billion over the next three years to pay for  losses involved in shutting down insolvent banks and paying off insured  deposits. Almost half the money, about $25 billion, would be generated by the  one-time 1% levy on deposits.  </P> <P> Outlays by the insurance fund depend on the size of losses at individual banks,  with the insurance money filling in the gap between the bank's deposits and the  weakened value of its real estate loans and other assets.  </P> <P> A $52-billion cushion could enable the fund to handle bank failures involving  total assets of $270 billion to $320 billion, Seidman noted. With that cushion,  the FDIC "fund should be able to handle the problems of the next three years  unless a disaster occurs," he said.  </P> <P> A special assessment of $25 billion would represent about two years' worth of  bank industry profits, according to a projection by R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., an  economist who testified before the committee.  </P> <P> "The ability of the banks to take that additional money out of earnings depends  on what happens in the economy," said Burneko of the ABA. "There is still  considerable uncertainty. The scenarios on losses are quite widespread."  </P> <P> One possible way to ease the financial burden on banks would be to permit them  to spread the contribution over several years, according to government and  industry sources.  </P> <P> The banks' additional contribution would be included in the Bush  Administration's plan for the most sweeping overhaul of the financial system  since the Great Depression. The proposal will be offered to Congress early next  year.  </P> <P> If banks are allowed to enter nontraditional businesses as part of this  overhaul, Seidman and other regulators want so-called "fire walls" built  between divisions so insured deposits are not placed into risky ventures.  </P> <P> Regulators and bankers alike are quick to assert that the problems of banks are  manageable.  </P> <P> The nation's 12,400 banks had profits of $15.4 billion for the first three  quarters of the year -- a 13% improvement over the prior year.  </P> <P> Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), the subcommittee chairman, said: "We need to make  certain that the taxpayers of this nation, who already have been forced to pay  too much for the savings and loan bailout, are not asked to bail out the banks  or the bank insurance fund."  </P> <P> Several panel members suggested that regulators should stop banks from paying  dividends to stockholders until the crisis passes.  </P> <P> Administration officials and members of Congress believe the banking industry,  although threatened by falling real estate values that have turned many loans  sour, can avoid the crisis that gripped the savings and loan business.  Financial and regulatory standards have been more strict for banks, and federal  oversight has been more intense.  </P> <P> The collapse of hundreds of S&amp;Ls bankrupted the insurance fund protecting  their deposits. It will cost taxpayers as much as $130 billion, without  counting future interest on bonds, to finance the S&amp;L cleanup by closing  crippled institutions and paying off insured depositors.  </P> <P> But if Seidman is correct, and the economic situation doesn't worsen, the extra  assessment on banks should keep the insurance fund for banks solvent.  </P> <P> The costs of bank failures over the next three years could range from $17  billion to $63 billion, depending on the severity and duration of the  recession, according to a report presented to the subcommittee Monday by  Brumbaugh and two other economists, Robert Litan and James R. Barth.  </P> <P> Forecasting can "only be educated guesses," said Seidman, offering a skeptical  view of the report. "Three years ago, who would have predicted that Germany  would be reunited and that we would be shipping food to Russia? In three years,  will we be in a booming economy, stagflation or a deep recession?"  </P> <P> His own educated guess is that a $25-billion infusion would keep the "weak"  insurance fund working.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By O Chun-tong] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Justice Minister  Shigeto Nagano's controversial remarks on the Pacific war are  expected to stir up a political debate in the Diet (parliament).    Social Democratic Party Secretary-General Wataru Kubo said  in  an interview with the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Wednesday evening that  the justice minister's remarks would prompt the Diet to call  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to account and question Nagano's  fitness to serve in the cabinet, suggesting that his party would  make an issue of the comments when the House of Representatives  (the lower house of the Diet) opens.    Nagano has said the war was intended to liberate the  colonies  and create a greater East Asian co-prosperity sphere. He also  called the Nanjing massacre of Chinese civilians and prisoners  of war a hoax.    "We have to attach importance to his having said that it is  wrong to call the Pacific war a war of aggression," Kubo said.    Pointing to former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  remarks  that the Pacific war was wrong and Japan was the aggressor, he  noted that Nagano's comments indicate the new cabinet's policy  has changed from that of its predecessor.    All Japanese television networks, including NHK, reported  that the justice minister's remarks were causing ripples in  South Korea, China, Russia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia on  their news programs Thursday.    In particular, NHK reported that Chinese President Jiang  Zemin had expressed regret over Nagano's comments in a  roundabout way on Thursday when he met Bunpei Hara, speaker of  the Diet's Upper House.    Meanwhile, the Japanese Government and the ruling coalition,  concerned about the unexpectedly strong reactions from Korea,  China and other countries, will take action to clear up the  fallout from the controversial remarks to preserve friendly  relations with these nations.    The steps will include having Nagano accept political  reponsibility for the remarks and issuing a statement that they  were his personal opinion and not related to the Hata cabinet's  policy in any way.    A government source said Friday the steps would be taken as  soon as Prime Minister Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  return from tours of Europe and the Middle East, noting the  ruling minority coalition is in a difficult position as the  majority opposition, including the Social Democratic Party, is  moving to make a political issue of the remarks.    The Hata government is worried that Nagano's remarks will  harm relations with South Korea, China and other countries as  they brought up memories of past suffering, he added.</p>

Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said the move  will be to the advantage of both Vietnam and Thailand. It will  be a catalyst in the development of Vietnam, as more investors  will go in, but it will be for Vietnam to amend its existing  laws and regulations to tempt investors, he said. The transfer  of funds will become more convenient, and the Mekong Sub-region  Project will benefit as Vietnam will be encouraged to take part,  he said. Suphachai assured Thai investors that Vietnam will not  become a competitor because Thailand is several steps ahead of  Vietnam in manufacturing.    Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan commented that he does  not expect Vietnam to represent a serious threat to Thai rice  exports to the US as a result of the move. The US imports Thai  glutinous rice because there are many Asians living there, and  normally the US does not import rice from any country because of  its rice surplus. Amnuai said Thailand's strong economic growth  will prevent a significant shift of foreign investment away from  Thailand to Vietnam. "Nobody will abandon Thailand for  Vietnam," he said. "What we should worry about is how to manage  and control our strong growth."    Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said that Thailand  as one of the main gateways to Indochina stands to benefit from  increased trade and regional investment. "The lifting of the  embargo will stimulate trade and investment in the region,"  Abpisit told UPI. "It is positive development for Thailand."  But the lifting of the embargo will eliminate the necessity to  trans-ship products through Thailand to Vietnam. "Definitely it  will affect certain kinds of Thai businesses," Aphisit said.  "Some will benefit from this and some will lose. We have to  accept the (Vietnamese) competition." [passage omitted]    Kroekkrai Chiraphaet, Director-General of the Business  Economics Department, said the move will mean keener competition  for Thailand. "Vietnam may take three to five years to catch up  with us, especially in products such as textiles, shoes,  electronics, computer components and electrical appliances, he  said. But it does not take long to establish factories and  Vietnam has a comparative labour advantage, he said. Thailand's  labour costs are moving up, therefore it should seek a  comparative advantage in manufacturing quality. Thailand must  catch up with Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong and step away  from competitors. The influx of investors to Vietnam implies  that they want to gain a greater share of the local market,  Kroekkrai said.    Due to its proximity to Vietnam, Thailand enjoys a decisive  advantage in certain businesses such as construction materials  and certain Thai consumer products. These have gained market  recognition from being smuggled into Vietnam over the past two  decades. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Plain farewell for lost leader The life of John Smith, the Labour leader who died last week, was commemorated yesterday at a funeral in Edinburgh which underlined his Scottish roots. Although the prime minister, many English Labour MPs and some foreign representatives attended, the majority of the congregation at Cluny parish church in Morningside were from Scotland. The service in the sandstone church which Mr Smith attended was plain, even for a funeral. Outside the wind was bitter, even for Edinburgh, and the sky grey. Inside, the congregation heard Mr Smith's closest friends from his days at Glasgow University rekindle his memory with touching addresses. They portrayed a man of unpretentiousness, honesty and consistency, but also of ambition and tenacity who had been cruelly denied his ultimate political objective of becoming prime minister. Mr Jimmy Gordon, chief executive of Radio Clyde, said Mr Smith was 'someone people could relate to. He was one of us, not one of them.' Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said Mr Smith had not been interested 'in the trappings of power - he wanted power itself'. There would be many people who disagreed with him on political issues. 'But no one would deny the sincerity, the tenacity of the man. Consistency was at the core of him. His life, his work, his reassuring presence were a standing reproach to the easy cynicism that brands politics as a dishonest game.' He also spoke of Mr Smith's warmth, saying he could 'start a party in an empty room, and often did'. He would walk through walls to help a friend, he said. The 900 mourners had been arriving in the quiet side street by the church for more than an hour before the service. There were Scottish judges, advocates and solicitors, reflecting Mr Smith's past as a QC, and delegations from local government and from his Monklands constituency. Also present were Scottish cabinet ministers, including Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary. From London came Labour party figures including Mr Neil Kinnock, whose wife Glenys helped Mr Michael Foot, another former Labour leader, up the steps to the church. The contenders for Mr Smith's succession, Mr Gordon Brown, Mr Tony Blair, Mr John Prescott and Mr Robin Cook, were there, as was Mr Tony Benn. The former prime ministers Sir Edward Heath and Lord Callaghan, the latter representing the Queen, were in the congregation, as were English trade union leaders and the political editors of the national newspapers. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's acting leader, read one of the lessons. After the service Mrs Elizabeth Smith, Mr Smith's widow, led her three daughters behind the coffin, facing about 2,000 people who had gathered outside to hear the service over loudspeakers. Today Mr Smith will be buried privately on the Hebridean island of Iona, the resting place of Scotland's early kings.</p>

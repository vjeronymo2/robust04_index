			<p>BFN     [Text] A news conference was held today in the European  House in Zagreb by Stipe Mesic, the Croatian Assembly speaker,  and Josip Manolic, the speaker of its Chamber of Counties, on  behalf of the promotional board of a new political party, the  Croatian Independent Democrats [Hrvatski Nezavisni Demokrati].  This promotional board has already been joined, they said, by  17 deputies from the two assembly chambers from the ranks of the  Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ].    They cited the impossibility of influencing the articulation  of party and state policies within Croatia's ruling party, the  HDZ, as their reason behind the creation of the new party.  These policies are in a state of crisis because, as they say,  they are not discussed by the party's leadership since all  decisions, they say, are taken by only one man. We were trying  to initiate, within the HDZ, a debate on the fundamental issues  of democracy and the law-governed state, and particularly on HDZ  policies toward Bosnia- Herzegovina but we were denied this,  Manolic, Mesic and their fellow-members Slavko Degoricija, Pavao  Tomislav Duka, and Perica Juric explained. This is why, they  said, they are going to convene the founding assembly of the  Croatian Independent Democrats as early as this month.    We are deliberately aiming to bring about a polarization  within the HDZ, Mesic and Manolic added. We do not intend to  join the ranks of opposition parties. We want to cooperate with  all parties, including even the HDZ. We support the government  of Nikica Valentic while we reserve the right to criticize him  for having no articulate program for Croatia's development, and  for the implementation of privatization and denationalization.  We want the government to govern in keeping with the  constitutional principle of triple division of power, Stipe  Mesic and Josip Manolic said at their news conference.</p>

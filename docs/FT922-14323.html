			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Business survey signals upturn BUSINESS confidence has recovered to its highest level for more than two years, according to the latest quarterly survey of business expectations from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group. The survey of more than 1,900 managing directors in all regions and sectors of business, services and trade found that companies were notably more optimistic about orders and sales than at the beginning of the year. Confidence in London and the south-east, the regions that led the UK into recession, improved markedly. However, the overall recovery in confidence is unlikely to result in reduced unemployment. Dun &amp; Bradstreet said pressure on staffing levels was lighter than in its previous survey but it forecast continued cuts in employment. One in three companies expects to make people redundant while only one in five expects to employ more staff. The survey was carried out between March 11 and March 27, covering the period immediately after the March 10 Budget, which has been dominated by the general election campaign and the publication of differing remedies for Britain's economic ills by all the main parties. It found that the chief executives of 52 per cent of companies expected their order books to increase in the present quarter, compared with 23 per cent predicting a fall. The balance of replies - plus 29 per cent - compares with plus 7 per cent at the beginning of this year and is close to the plus 30 per cent balance recorded in the fourth quarter of 1989, before the recession. Fifty two per cent of companies expect sales to increase. The balance of companies expecting higher sales increased to 25 per cent from 7 per in the last quarterly survey and is back to levels last seen in the first quarter of 1990. Dun &amp; Bradstreet found that more companies expected to increase stocks, suggesting greater optimism about future demand. The number of companies expecting to increase exports, at 32 per cent, outnumbers the 11 per cent expecting exports to fall by nearly three to one. Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, said the survey showed 'a proper renewal of business confidence'. He said another Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey showing a strong rise in business optimism in the US underpinned the improved expectations. The report is the latest of several tentative indicators pointing to better times.</p>

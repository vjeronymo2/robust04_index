Speaking after a cabinet session, he also said the Czech  side  believed that the core to the solution was a "domestic  agreement," and outside intervention could only supplement, and  not replace, a domestic solution to the situation.    Klaus said no representative of the Czech Republic had  criticized the NATO Council's decision to bombard the positions  of Bosnian Serbs if the Council's ultimatum was not upheld.  "Nobody, including me, has made any statements concerning how we  would react in the event of attacks," he said.    Last Thursday [10 February] Klaus said the Czech Government  and the Civic Democratic Party (ODS, of which he is chairman)  were afraid there would be outside military intervention in  Bosnia and were of the opinion that civil war should not be  ended by foreign intervention but by settlement at home. He  said that he personally considered the possible air strikes  approved by the NATO Council on Wednesday as "unfair from a  human point of view."    Klaus stressed today that it was not the task of the Czech  Republic to find a way of solving the crisis in Bosnia. As far  as the difference between the standpoints of President Vaclav  Havel and Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda, both of whom support  NATO's position, and his standpoint was concerned, it was  unnecessary to consider the difference a dispute.</p>

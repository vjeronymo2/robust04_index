			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / What it takes to be chancellor Mr Norman Lamont made a nice try in his plea for a rouble stabilisation fund in New York; but not nice enough. He showed a sense of strategic purpose, which is one requirement for a chancellor, and his proposal was in line with current specialist thinking, which is another. But he did not get his way, which shows lack of clout; and he allowed himself to be seen to fail, which suggests a lack of political cunning. In short, rather much as expected. The list of required qualities was supplied by a retired Treasury official, and would be echoed, in my experience, by almost any senior civil servant; but the order of importance would differ from one department to another. In a major spending department, clout is probably the key quality, as I discovered when a gaggle of veterans at the Reform Club rather surprisingly agreed that the best minister in their long experience was Lord Duncan-Sandys. This would not have been a press lobby nomination; Sandys was awkward and obtuse under questioning. Yes; but the department could supply the ideas and the answers to questions. What mattered was the result. 'Frankly, my dear boy, once he had an idea in his head, he went into Cabinet like a programmed tank. He could bore them into submission.' Chancellors, it seems from my friends at the Reform, are different. A good relationship with the prime minister will substitute for clout - at home, if not at G7 meetings - but not for a sense of strategy. In this most exposed of jobs the pressures - from the whips, the markets, the Bank of England, the polls and in Cabinet are such that nothing can substitute for a clear aim and a pretty quick intelligence. But political guile and good powers of public persuasion are also needed when the going is difficult, and may even affect economic performance on their own, by way of confidence. These conversations at the Reform - with former civil servants, City men and economists, who had only long experience in common - arose from a suggestion that Mr Lamont has had an unfairly bad press. He inherited an economic mess which nobody could sort out quickly, his one Budget showed real ingenuity, and his over-optimistic forecasts were made on what he thought was the best advice. Well, yes; but most chancellors suffer bad luck, and it's a matter of how you handle it. Mr Lamont got good marks - in the City as well as among ex-insiders - for many of the things he actually did, especially for his handling of interest rates; but his public relations have been damaging. 'Doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut' growled a gilts man. That is a serious handicap, but need not mean that he is a bad chancellor. Mr Lamont would have to do something much more drastic than pass on bad forecasts or get flustered on television to join the ultimate roll of dishonour which emerged. Mr Anthony (now Lord) Barber was the clear majority choice as worst chancellor in anyone's memory; a regretful judgment, since everybody liked him a great deal, but seemingly inevitable on results. It is not clear, though, how far Barber's disastrous policies were his own. The then prime minister, Mr Edward Heath, leaned heavily on the advice of Sir William Armstrong, who had moved from head of the Treasury to be head of the Civil Service, and is blamed by many for most of what went wrong. Mr Nigel Lawson got one firm nomination as worst, for failing to learn from the Barber experience. Other contenders were Mr Reginald Maudling, for actually believing in the dash-for-growth theory; Mr R. A. Butler, for cutting taxes in 1955 for electoral purposes, and raising them shortly afterwards (possibly a nasty precedent for Mr Lamont). There was also one for Mr Peter Thorneycroft, for resigning in principle when the Cabinet insisted on breaching his borrowing limit - 'it looked noble, but in practical terms it was fatuous' - and one, from a former Conservative policy adviser, for Mr John Major, for joining the EMS at the wrong rate. It is interesting, surely, that all the contenders for the bottom place were Conservatives, since none of my witnesses were Labour supporters; the Conservative reputation for sound management clearly does not extend to the more august levels of the retired and near-retired. It is also striking that the clear winner, with no dissent, was Mr Roy Jenkins (now Lord J of Hillhead), though Sir Geoffrey Howe also got some honourable mentions. The central Jenkins strategy was to fight excessive wage rises with tax increases, which was not popular and would not have been sustainable in the long run; so his win is an odd verdict by objective standards. It looks a tribute to his elder statesman manner, which certainly inspired confidence; or perhaps it is a vote of thanks from Conservative supporters for an unexpected victory in 1970, or evidence that the City and the Civil Service really do have the hair shirt tendencies of which they are widely suspected. Of course, steering the economy is not the whole of a chancellor's job. He also has to get the wrinkles out of the tax system, and get value for money for taxpayers - indeed, according to quite recent orthodoxy, that is the whole of his job. Several of the chancellors who got high marks for this essentially accountant's role - Selwyn Lloyd, for example, and Anthony Barber - got very poor ratings overall. One analyst simply concluded that good mechanics make bad drivers. Another possible conclusion is that the job is too big for one man, as Harold Wilson supposed. Meanwhile, the unhappy Mr Lamont is stuck with the whole of it. Industrialists appear to be getting gloomier, and analysts certainly are: Mr Bill Martin of Philips and Drew is now projecting no recovery at all this year. But stock market prices continue to suggest that the economy may yet live up to Mr Lamont's expectations, though not necessarily in time. The chancellor, now in what could be a fortunate period of pre-Budget purdah, can only read the few suggestive items of good news and hope that the market isn't just up to its contrarian tricks again.</p>

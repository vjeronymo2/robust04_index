			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Lending increase boosts Indonesian listed banks INDONESIA'S stock market-listed banks have announced mostly improved results for the first half of 1993. They were helped by an increase in lending as banks lowered interest rates but maintained margins. Bank Internasional Indonesia posted a 35 per cent rise in gross profit, to Rp83.7bn (Dollars 39.9m), while gross profits at Lippobank rose 54 per cent to Rp31.3bn. Gross profits at Bank Niaga climbed 6.6 per cent to Rp22.4bn, and at Panin Bank by 5 per cent to Rp21.46bn. Bank Bali was alone among the leading listed banks to report lower gross profits. It suffered a 14.3 per cent setback to Rp42.5bn. Most banks have also seen an increase in loan growth and deposits. Lippobank's loans in the first half grew 15 per cent after asset reclassification, to Rp3,090bn, and deposits rose 10 per cent to Rp3,400bn. BII's loans and deposits grew 8.5 per cent and 11 per cent, to Rp3,850bn and Rp3,885bn respectively. The banks have taken advantage of the lending constraints on state banks, which account for about half the sector's assets. Most state banks have failed to reach higher capital adequacy requirements set by the central bank and have been told to limit new lending. Local brokers expect listed banks to raise more capital by the end of this year to further increase loan growth.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Golyayev report: "`Sokol' in Flight"] </F>   [Text] The Interdepartmental Comission for Promoting the  Organization of Industrial Companies and Financial-Industrial  Groups has approved the project for the "Sokol"  Financial-Industrial Group, which has been submitted to it, and  adopted a decision to register it and issue its certificate of  registration. The project was elaborated on the intiative of  specialists and leaders from a number of major industrial and  financial enterprises of the Central Chernozem Zone and other  economic regions of Russia, and was backed by the  administrations of Voronezh, Kursk, and Sverdlovsk Oblasts.    Projections suggest that, already in its first stage,  "Sokol"  will be able to secure a growth in the volume of manufactured  output from 326 billion rubles [R] last year to R1.27 trillion  in 1996. The recoupment period of the investment projects will  be from two to five years.    "The creation of the `Sokol' Financial-Industrial Group  meets  the fundamental interests of federal industrial policy. This  policy aims at developing the science and production complex,  ensuring the competitiveness of Russian-made products, and  raising economic potential," Igor Shurchkov, chairman of the  State Committee for Industrial Policy, said. "We wish to use  the experience of `Sokol' and of the `Uralskiye Zavody'  Financial-Industrial Group which was set up earlier to prove the  efficiency and promise of such groups."</p>

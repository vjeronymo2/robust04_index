Under a previous agreement, they were supposed to deliver by  Jan. 27 the complete register of the town's residents as well  as the car register.    Town secretary Taimi Laar informs that the Russian officials  surrendered only the registration forms for new arrivals and  departing residents which, however, don't suffice to make up a  complete register of the town's population.    Estonian Justice Minister Kaido Kama earlier claimed the  register kept by the Russian police cannot be trusted and a new  register will have to be made up. Local elections cannot be  held in Paldiski until the residents have been registered.    Russian officials don't intend to hand over the car register  any time soon. They insist the issue be put on the agenda of  talks between the two countries. In Laar's opinion, Russians  try to put off handing over the documents because many stolen  cars are registered in Paldiski.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive report" by reporter An Ping (1344 1627): "Wang </F> Dan, Zhou Duo, Min Qi Issue Statement: They Are Leaving Beijing  Temporarily on Their Own in View of the Situation"]    [Text] According to authoritative sources, student  movement leader Wang Dan, Zhou Duo, and Min Qi have arrived in  Fujian. Several days ago, they signed and published an open  statement, saying that they had "deliberately" left Beijing for  a few days and calling on the U.S. Government to extend the MFN  trade status to China. However, the statement, which is being  circulated, has not been confirmed by Wang Dan in person.    The full text of the statement is as follows:    1. Under pressure from the current situation, we are  deliberately leaving here for a few days.    2. We strongly call on the U.S. Government to extend MFN  trade status for China. [Signed] Zhou Duo, Wang Dan, Min Qi  [Dated] 9 Mar 1994    As U.S. Secretary of State Christopher arrived in Beijing,  Wang Dan and the others were in other parts of the country.  This ties in with what they said in the statement, that is,  they left Beijing "under pressure from the situation."    It is understood that Christopher had submitted a list of  political prisoners to judicial departments in Beijing askine  for their release. This list included the names of Wang Juntao,  Ren Wanding, and the three dissidents detained recently--Yuan  Hongbing, Wang Jiaqi, and Zhou Guoqiang.    The U.S. Secretary of State is paying this special visit to  Beijing to gauge the human rights situation at a time when the  National People's Congress and China People's Political  Consultative Conference sessions are being held. It is not easy  for the Chinese side to find any reason to prevent Christopher  from making contact with democratic activists, therefore the  abovementioned "arrangement" have been made.    The sources estimate that Zhou Duo, Wang Dan, and Min Qi  will  return to Beijing in about 10 days.</p>

The license authorizes Jones Inspection Services to possess and use sealed radioactive sources in various radiographic exposure devices at temporary job sites in the state of Arkansas. 10 CFR 150.20 of the NRC's regulations grants a general license to Agreement State licensees to conduct the same activities in non-Agreement States provided that the NRC is notified and the other provisions of 10 CFR 150.20 are followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 14, 1994, an NRC investigation was conducted to determine whether Jones Inspection Services was using regulated byproduct material in NRC jurisdiction without NRC authorization. Based on interviews with Otho G. Jones, the sole proprietor of Jones Inspection Services, and on documents obtained from the Central Oklahoma Oil and Gas Company, the investigation confirmed that Jones Inspection Services, which does not hold an NRC license, had illegally used and possessed regulated byproduct material in Oklahoma, a non-Agreement State in which the NRC maintains regulatory authority over such material. The NRC's investigation determined that Jones Inspection Services stored radiographic exposure devices in Oklahoma from at least January 1, 1994, to July 1994, and that these devices has been used to perform industrial radiography in Oklahoma from April 1, 1994, to June 27, 1994 for Central Oklahoma Oil and Gas Company. The investigation also determined that these activities were conducted without NRC authorization. Specifically, the investigation found that Jones Inspection Services did not hold an NRC license as required by 10 CFR 30.3 and that Otho Jones did not notify the NRC, in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 150.20, that he planned to conduct radiography at temporary job sites in NRC jurisdiction. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Thus, these activities were not subject to inspection by the NRC to assure the protection of the public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC notes that Otho Jones' previous company, Tumbleweed X-Ray Company, was prohibited by Order from conducting licensed activities in non-Agreement States until September 6, 1994. Thus, had Mr. Jones notified the NRC of his intent to conduct radiography activities in Oklahoma in early 1994, it is unlikely that the NRC would have authorized those activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a signed statement Mr. Jones provided the NRC investigator, he said he did not know he had to notify the NRC and did not know to whom the information should be provided. However, Mr. Jones also said ``I did think to call the NRC about reciprocity, but I am afraid of the NRC and did not want me more hassel [sic] so I chose not to call them about working in Oklahoma.'' Furthersome, as indicated in the footnote, Mr. Jones was the sole proprietor of Tumbleweed X-Ray Company in September 1991 when that company was issued an NRC order specifically suspending its authority to conduct radiography activities in Oklahoma and other states in which NRC maintained regulatory authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 21, 1994, the NRC issued a Confirmatory Action Letter (CAL 4&hyph;94&hyph;70) which described voluntary commitments made by Mr. Jones to discontinue the use of three radiographic exposure devices in his possession and to transfer the devices to authorized recipients or authorized locations. Mr. Jones informed NRC Region IV personnel on the same date that he had already transferred two devices to an NRC licensee in the state of Oklahoma and was preparing to ship a third device to the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above, it appears that Otho G. Jones, the sole proprietor of Jones Inspection Services, he willfully violated NRC requirements and, notwithstanding his voluntary actions to transfer three radiographic exposure devices, was and may continue to be in violation of NRC requirements by possessing regulated byproduct material in NRC jurisdiction without authorization, i.e., without either an NRC license or a general license authorizing the use of this material in the state of Oklahoma. This is prohibited by section 81 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended, and by 10 CFR 30.3, which state that, (except for persons exempt as provided in 10 CFR parts 30 and 150), no person shall possess or use byproduct material except as authorized in a specific or general NRC license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Improper handling of the byproduct material can result in unnecessary exposure to radiation. The Atomic Energy Act and the Commission's regulations require that the possession of licensed material be under a regulated system of licensing and inspection. Given the current circumstances surrounding Mr. Jones' possession of the byproduct material and the facts associated with Mr. Jones' former company (i.e., Tumbleweed X-Ray Company) to whom Mr. Jones was the sole proprietor in 1991 and to which an NRC order was issued suspending its authority to conduct radiography activities in Oklahoma and other states, Mr. Jones has not demonstrated that he will comply with NRC requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, it appears that Mr. Jones is either unwilling or unable to comply with NRC requirements and without Mr. Jones having an NRC license, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public will be protected. Therefore, the public health, safety, and interest require that Otho Jones and Jones Inspection Services be required to cease and desist unauthorized possession of regulated byproduct material and to provide certification to the NRC that all regulated byproduct material has been transferred to authorized recipients or authorized locations. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the violation described above is such that the public health, safety, and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  IV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordlingly pursuant to section 81, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR part 30 and 10 CFR part 150, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that Otho G. Jones shall:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

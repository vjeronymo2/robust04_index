			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / China aims to stem corruption tide: Campaign launched to counter threat to Communists' authority CHINA yesterday launched a nationwide campaign to combat corruption which Communist leaders believe is undermining their authority and threatening their party's very future. The party's top watchdog, the central commission for discipline inspection, began a session in Beijing yesterday at which strong calls were made to rein in corruption which has been fuelled by the economic boom of the past year. The drive against corruption, a pervasive force which reaches high into the party itself, coincides with a general tightening up in China as the authorities seek to regain control of a runaway economy that grew by nearly 14 per cent in the first six months of this year. The six-day conference in Beijing, which is due to be addressed by Mr Jiang Zemin, the Communist party leader, follows the release of a report this week that 'nearly 30,000 party and government officials have been disciplined in the first half of this year on charges of malpractice or irregularities'. According to the People's Daily newspaper, 'the accusations against them have ranged from bribe-taking to neglect of their duties'. Mr Jiang, who has struggled to stamp his authority on the party since becoming general secretary after the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, has made the anti-corruption fight something of a personal crusade, railing against the 'exchange of power for money and indulgence in sex and food'. Mr Wei Jianxing, head of the commission for discipline inspection and a politburo member, blamed the uncertain transition phase from a centrally planned economy to a market system for creating opportunities for corruption. He told more than 100 delegates to the conference: 'As the new structure has not formed and the legal system is still being perfected, there are loopholes in policies and management and there isn't a clear line of demarcation between right and wrong in some issues. This gives opportunities to violators of law and discipline.' Mr Wei called for increased vigilance among all Chinese to help in the campaign to root out corruption, which ranges from official involvement in smuggling to accepting kickbacks from foreign companies anxious to do business in China. Petty corruption is also widespread and is one of the main causes of unrest in rural areas, where hard-pressed peasant farmers have suffered at the hands of unscrupulous local officials responsible for levying a host of taxes and charges. Mr Wei presented a report to his party colleagues entitled: 'Adapt to the new circumstances, expand the fight against corruption and strive for the full implementation of the basic guidelines of the party.' This is expected to form the basis for a new code of conduct to try to ensure 'clean government'.</p>

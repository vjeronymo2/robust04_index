Experimental data necessary for analyzing the  surface layer of the studied melts are presented in a table. The  obtained data make it possible to assume that for iron metals  family based melts with negative deviation from perfection a  monatomic model of thickness of the surface layer is correct.  For melts with positive deviation the model of a variable  thickness surface layer is correct. But for the most important  concentration region from 0 to 0.05 of molar share the monatomic  model is applicable. It is concluded that in the case of metal  melts of systems with positive deviations from perfection the  surface layer is more perfect in terms of its behavior than the  volume of the melt.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Own correspondent Vladimir Gundarov report from </F> Severodvinsk under the "In Brief" rubric: "At Present, Ships  Are Also Born in Pain"]    [Text] The creation of the "Severodvinsk" nuclear-powered  submarine -- KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported the laying of its keel in  late December -- has entailed painstaking efforts from the first  days of building work. The shipbuilders are not satisfied with  the quality of design documents, which, according to  specialists, can bear no criticism. This is not the sole reason  for wrecking the timetable of work on the building stocks,  however. According to M. Zhukov, who is responsible for  commissioning the ship, the main reason are undersupplies of  metal and steel work because "Sevmashpredpriyatiye"  [Severodvinsk Engineering Enterprise] does not have money to pay  to supplier plants in advance.</p>

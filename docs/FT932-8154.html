			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Iraq inquiry told of cabinet disunity FORMER Trade Secretary Mr Paul Channon indicated yesterday that he may have been unable to influence key decisions within government affecting the sale of defence equipment to Iraq and Iran for which his department had statutory responsibility. Mr Channon told the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that during his period as secretary of state, from 1986-87, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence were interpreting government guidelines in a way he had not envisaged. The guidelines agreed to in December 1984 were intended to restrict defence exports which could significantly enhance military capabilities and prolong or exacerbate the Iran-Iraq war. But Mr Channon commented on one case in which the export of hovercrafts to Iran had been blocked not, in his view, on the basis of military criteria, but because Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher, then prime minister, had not wanted either to alienate the opinion of other arab countries or become embroiled in the Irangate controversy which had surfaced in the United States. 'I think (the MOD and the Foreign Office) were changing the rules as they went along . . Although it was government policy, it was jolly irritating,' he said. Documents made available to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry team confirm that by 1986 Mr Alan Clark, then serving under Mr Channon as trade minister, and other DTI officials were arguing strongly for a relaxation of the guidelines. But Mr Channon said he had no record of some documents being circulated to him. One which he could not recall seeing before yesterday was a minute written by Mr Clark to Mrs Thatcher on November 24 1986 urging a relaxation of the guidelines. The public hearings continue on Monday.</p>

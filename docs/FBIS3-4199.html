This was the consensus and a hot topic among deputies at the  recently closed session of the Eighth National People's Congress  (NPC).    Most of the deputies held that the persistence of social  stability has promoted the reform and economic progress. And in  return reform and economic progress are helping maintain  long-term stability in the country.    "This is the fundamental experience of the 15 years of  reform  and opening to the outside world in China," they said.    The maintenance of social stability in this huge country  with  a population of 1.1 billion while facing an arduous and  complicated transfer of the economic system is regarded as a  miracle by many foreigners.    While carrying out the reform, China attaches importance to  its own conditions and has adopted different methods for  different stages.    The reform first started in rural areas, and new reform  measures are usually taken after experiments and then spread  step by step.    The pursuit of the reform has never been conducted at the  cost of lowering the living standards of the people.    Over the past 15 years the national economy has made a  sustained and rapid development. The gross domestic product  increased from 358.8 billion yuan (about 44 billion U.S.  dollars) in 1978 to 3,138 billion yuan (about 404 billion U.S.  dollars) last year.    The per capita income of urban residents went up from 343  yuan a year in 1978 (38.5 U.S. dollars) to 2,337 yuan (262.5  U.S. dollars) last year; and the per capita income of rural  residents increased from 145 yuan a year (16.29 U.S. dollars) in  1978 to 921 yuan (103.48 U.S. dollars) in 1993.    Consequently, peasants' living standards have been improved  greatly. Color TV sets, video-recorders, washing machines and  refrigerators have become common appliances, no longer luxury  goods, for most Chinese.    The country's markets are brisk, with adequate supplies, and  the cultural life is now more colorful.    With the deepening of economic reform, democracy and  legislation efforts have been greatly enhanced in state  political activities.    The people's congress and multi-party democratic  consultation  systems have been much improved. The Chinese people now enjoy  much more democracy and freedom.    At the recent session of the NPC and the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, deputies offered more than  1,000 proposals and opinions on key state tasks, and political,  economic, cultural and diplomatic affairs.    China's top leaders attended each delegation's discussions  to  listen to their opinions and criticisms.    The Chinese people are deeply involved in the country's  reform and construction, and cherish the current social  stability.    1994 is a key year for China to carry out a series of new  reforms in finance, taxation and enterprises. The Chinese  Government pledged to adopt measures to ensure the progress of  reform and economic development under conditions of social  stability.    The Chinese Government has set the economic growth rate at  nine percent for 1994, in the bid to avoid inflation caused by  excessive investment and construction scale.    The financial reform will be centered on strengthening the  functions of the central bank.    The implementation of the financial reform stage by stage  will suit the needs of various enterprises, especially state  major industrial enterprises.    China's taxation reform hinges on a tax-revenue sharing  system between the central and local governments, while carrying  out readjustment of taxation structure.    The tax reform has given full consideration of the interest  of both the state and enterprises, and the central and  localities which are supported by some transitional policies.    The tax reform is now proceeding very well, said Jin Xin,  deputy head of the State Taxation Administration.    The enterprise reform will lead to corporatization of the  majority of state-owned enterprises.    A number of enterprises will be closed down and merged  during  the reform, but that will not lead to widespread unemployment,  said officials of the State Commission for Restructuring the  Economy.    As the country's social insurance system has begun playing  its role, the unemployed will obtain social relief funds in time  and get retrained through job centers.    Some people were at the first worried about introducing a  single exchange rate in the country. However, facts have proved  that after unifying the foreign exchange rate against the  renminbi, the foreign exchange market has been stable, with the  U.S. dollar exchanging for about 8.70 yuan. That is about the  exchange rate at the swap market late last year.    China used to have two exchange rates for foreign currency  --  the officials rate and the swap market rate.    Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of  economic  work, said that after a series of reform measures have been  adopted this year, the prices, markets and society are stable.  "That has convinced us more about the correctness of the  direction of reform," he said.    Years of practice have proved that development is the  target,  reform is the motive and stability is the guarantee and  prerequisite for China. These three aspects are linked and  influence each other.</p>

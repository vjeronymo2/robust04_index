			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias, leader of the  failed 4 February 1992 military coup, in a letter he sent to  this newspaper yesterday, explained he is willing to resign from  the National Armed Forces [FAN] 24 hours after being released.    The commander, who is staying at the Military Hospital, said  the situation following statements by the president have  prompted his decision. In a speech the president of the  Republic has said the only obstacle that can keep an officer or  noncommissioned officer from returning to active duty in the FAN  is his political involvement.    He has admitted of the many officers and NCOs of the 4  February uprising still in prison, "only Hugo Chavez Frias has  assumed a permanent and critical political attitude, in his  attempt to respond to the expectations of the people who woke up  and stood on their feet that night, while all the other officers  and NCOs have remained almost completely silent."    He accepts responsibility for the position publicly adopted  by the 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement and accepts  whatever punishment that may result from such statements.    Following the reasons given by the commander in chief, I  hereby state to my countrymen I will physically leave the Army  and hang up my uniform 24 hours after my release, if this should  occur." [no opening quotation mark as published]  <H5>  The Conditions </H5>   Commander Chavez states in his document that to request his  resignation the following specific conditions must be met:    1. Freedom and a return to active duty of ALL [previous  word published in uppercase] officers, NCOs, and subordinate  soldiers still imprisoned for the 4 February and 27 November  events, provided this is their wish.    2. Restitution of retirement pension rights and all other  social and economic benefits to ALL [previous word published in  uppercase] officers and NCOs discharged after 10 or more years  of active duty.    3. Solutions to the problems described by senior officers  still imprisoned who cannot or do not want to remain on active  duty.    4. Discussion and approval of a swift solution plan for  the Venezuelan soldiers who are abroad, in Peru and Ecuador,  considering the fact most of them would like to return to active  duty and that none of them has adopted any specific political  position.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (15): A greater mood of optimism - North America AMERICA'S Big Three vehicle manufacturers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - which have spent a decade losing market share in their own country to nimbler Japanese rivals, are at last hitting back hard and winning market share gains. The revival of Detroit still has a long way to go, and special factors may be making the Japanese atypically weak at present, yet there is a greater mood of optimism in the US motor industry now that at any time since the early 1980s. That was when the Japanese began not only importing vehicles to the US but also manufacturing in America, setting up so-called 'transplant' assembly plants, for the most part making cars rather than trucks. This helped boost their share of the US car market to more than 30 per cent by the early 1990s. The improved mood in Detroit stems partly from the fact that the US vehicle market generally is recovering from the deep recession of 1991-2, and sales growth is running somewhat ahead of the overall economic recovery. This may be due partly to the high average age of the fleet presently on US roads, and partly to low interest rates, which makes borrowing for a new car less painful. Whatever the reason, US vehicle sales could total about 14m units in 1993, up from roughly 13m last year - and Detroit is winning a bigger share of this larger pie. In the first six months of this year the Big Three accounted for 75 per cent of car and light truck sales, up from 72.5 per cent in the same period of last year. Asian companies saw their share drop to 22.8 per cent from 24.7 per cent. In the car market alone, Detroit boosted its share from 65.1 per cent to 67.7 per cent, while the Asians dipped from 30.7 per cent to 28.9 per cent. Why the change? First, the Americans are seeing the fruits of the painful lessons they learnt from the Japanese in the 1980s. Detroit is developing vehicles more quickly, and bringing its suppliers into the design process; it has introduced Japanese style 'lean' manufacturing techniques in many plants. And it has realised the importance of building the highest quality into its products. Chrysler, for example, the smallest of the Big Three, totally changed the way it operated after studying Honda, the first Japanese company to set up 'transplant' operations in the US. Japanese vehicles still tend to have a higher reputation for quality than US ones among American customer surveys, but the gap has narrowed to the point where consumers are prepared to pay greater attention to other issues, such as a vehicle's styling, price and dealer service. The Americans are doing much better in the style stakes. Chrysler has a big hit on its hands with its very different-looking LH series of mid-sized vehicles, the Chrysler Concorde, Eagle Vision and Dodge Intrepid. General Motors still has to revamp much of its model range, but its Saturn small car is one of the country's hottest selling vehicles. Saturn, a stand-alone project begun in the early 1980s to show that America could compete with Japan when starting from scratch, has just moved into profit after three years of production. Detroit has also been much more effective than the Japanese in taking advantage of a trend by consumers to buy pick-up trucks, mini-vans or four-wheel-drive Jeep-style vehicles rather than cars. This segment of the market is likely to account for about 40 per cent of total US sales this year, up from about 36 per cent in 1992. Many of these vehicles have substantially higher profit margins than cars. Ford's four-wheel-drive Explorer and Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee have been especially successful. Japan's share of the light truck market has dropped from a peak of 20.4 per cent in 1986 to 13.5 per cent in 1992. Factors behind this drop include the sheer strength of the US competition; the fact that imported trucks have long faced a 25 per cent tariff; and dumping allegations by the Big Three, which have held back Japanese mini-van sales. In both the car and truck markets, Japan's competitive position has been hurt by the rise in the value of the yen relative to the dollar since the start of this year. This has forced the Japanese manufacturers to push up prices in the US much more aggressively than their Detroit rivals. This trend shows no sign of changing in the near term. General Motors, for example, recently announced that it would seek to raise its market share during the 1994 model year by increasing its overall vehicle prices by an average of only 1.8 per cent - well below the expected rate of inflation. Still, Detroit can hardly afford any complacency. For one thing, exchange rates are unpredictable and the dollar could strengthen against the yen. And some observers suspect that the Japanese manufacturers may, to some degree, be deliberately soft-pedalling in the US market so as to stave off tougher trade sanctions by the Clinton administration. Whatever the case, the Japanese remain formidable competitors and the Big Three still have some way to go to match their manufacturing efficiency and reputation for quality. None has further to travel than General Motors which is still losing money in North America and remains extremely inefficient compared to the rest of the industry. However, the plan it put in place last year to return North America to profit is starting to bear fruit. GM says it is on target to break even - on an earnings before interest and tax basis - in North America this year, compared to its loss of Dollars 4.5bn in 1992. Factors include plant closures, which are bringing its manufacturing capacity more in line with demand, job cuts and a drive to reduce its biggest single cost item, raw materials. But restoring its North American operations to healthy profits is likely to take several years, and will depend in no small measure on it producing an attractive range of new vehicles which consumers are keen to buy.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   LEADING WORLD VEHICLE MAKERS 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Manufacturers              Cars       Commercial        Total                                        vehicles*      production  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Australian insurer returns to the black STATE Government Insurance Corporation, the Perth-based general insurer and investor, has returned to the black in the year to June, ahead of Western Australian government plans to float the group to the public. The corporation, which achieved a high profile in the late 1980s through its involvement with Western Australian corporate entrepreneurs, turned a ADollars 4.3m loss into a ADollars 27.1m (USDollars 16.5m) profit for the year. The directors said the improvement reflected a 35 per cent rise to ADollars 29.2m in investment income following a reorganisation of the group's portfolio. They said gross written premiums rose 14 per cent to ADollars 183.3m, reducing the underwriting loss by ADollars 18.8m.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / German interest rate cuts 'ending' The period of falling German interest rates is drawing to a close, according to one of the Bonn government's most senior independent advisers. Prof Herbert Hax said on radio yesterday that the economy had improved so much that further cuts in short-term rates were unnecessary; the Bundesbank also had to be careful to protect its credibility. He added that the recent weakness of the dollar did not reflect real economic conditions in the US. The Bundesbank last week appeared relaxed about recent rapid growth in the M3 money supply measure, saying the raw figures overstated the case. However, Prof Hax, who is chairman of the government's council of economic advisers, believed the inflationary danger from M3 expansion to be too great. As long as money supply was not under control, the most markets could expect were quite small interest rate corrections, he said. 'It is possible that we will have a further small reduction in the course of the winter. But I have the impression that we will soon arrive at the end of interest rate cuts.' Many private sector economists still believe the internationally important discount rate will be down from 4.5 per cent to 4 per cent by the end of the year, with more easing possible if inflation falls further in early 1995. However, pressure from outside Germany for more cuts has eased, and the export-led economic recovery appears to be progressing smoothly. If these conditions continue, the bank could elect to extend the pause instituted after its unexpected mid-May reduction in the discount rate. This cut, made while money supply was apparently expanding at an excessive rate, was interpreted by many observers as an uncharacteristic gamble. A pause to allow closer analysis of any inflationary dangers in the M3 distortions could also serve to restore the bank's shaken credibility. Opinions differ on the timing of possible changes, but action at the bank's next council meeting, due on August 18 is generally considered unlikely. Any cut too close to the federal elections in mid-October might draw charges of political motivation since Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, and Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, his deputy, are close associates of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. However, relaxing rates after the elections might tempt trade union pay negotiators to table inflationary demands in the 1995 pay round, due to start in November. The Bundesbank has consistently warned that pay and public spending must be kept under tight control for several more years. Prof Hax gave a similar warning yesterday. The German economy might be poised on the brink of a spell of growth lasting 'four or five years or more,' he said. But to remain competitive it was important that unions and employers reached 'rational' pay settlements.</p>

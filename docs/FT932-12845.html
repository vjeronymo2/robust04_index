			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Venezuelan opposition picks reformer: Battle lines drawn for a presidential election THE MAIN Venezuelan opposition party has chosen a state governor favouring economic and political reform as its candidate for the presidential election due in December. The social Christian party (Copei), voting in open primary elections on Sunday, chose Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, governor of the western state of Zulia, which produces most of Venezuela's oil and agricultural products. Mr Alvarez, 50, won clearly, with some 60 per cent of 2m votes cast, according to preliminary figures. This gives the Copei candidate strong impetus for the presidential race. Mr Eduardo Fernandez, who has long controlled Copei's bureaucracy and was its presidential candidate in 1988, received a disappointing 34 per cent, and Mr Humberto Calderon Berti, a former minister, came third. The two losers pledged party unity and support for Mr Alvarez. The Copei presidential candidate says he supports free market policies and broad political reform. Mr Alvarez joined the party at the age of 14. He is a lawyer, has occupied various party jobs and has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies. He won the Zulia governorship in 1989, and was re-elected last December. The choice of Mr Alvarez puts Venezuela's 1993 presidential campaign into better focus, both of the country's main political groups, the governing Democratic Action Party (AD) and Copei, now having chosen their candidates. On April 18, AD elected Mr Claudio Fermn, a 43-year-old former mayor of Caracas, as its presidential standard-bearer. Other figures seeking the presidency are Mr Rafael Caldera, aged 77 and president in 1969-1974, and Mr Andres Velasquez, aged 40 and the left-wing governor of the south-eastern state of Bolvar. Mr Caldera founded Copei and was its long-time chief, but he broke with the party after Mr Fernandez won the presidential nomination in 1987. Mr Caldera said he will run in December as an independent. The Sunday primary suggests that Venezuelans want a younger generation in the presidency and a chief executive identified as a party 'outsider'. Mr Alvarez, although linked with Copei for many years, has not been at the top. He has been very critical of corruption among the ruling cliques of Venezuelan political parties and the way party officials are chosen. The Copei election marked the first time that a political party in Venezuela has held an open presidential primary where any registered voter, regardless of party affiliation, could participate. The turnout was larger than expected, with almost 20 per cent of Venezuela's 9.8m registered voters taking part. Fewer than 600,000 people participated in AD's primary.</p>

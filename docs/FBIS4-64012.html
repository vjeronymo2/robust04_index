			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- New dates have been fixed for  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias's official visit to  Moscow. He will arrive in Moscow on May 31 and stay until June  2, Grigoriy Karasin, Information and Press Department director  in the Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing held today.    The reason of putting off the dates is linked with the fact  that the both ministers had been busy attending different  international forums, Karasin noted. "However, the aim of the  forthcoming talks - the continuation of an active Russian-Greek  political dialogue - remains unchanged," the spokesman said.</p>

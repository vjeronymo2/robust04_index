			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / People: Making Hays Hays has announced the latest in a series of board changes at the business services group which came to the market in 1989. Derrick Frost, 58, and Peter Roberts 58, will both retire on December 31, as they had previously agreed. They will be replaced by Dennis Matthewman, 53, who joined Hays in 1983 and is currently a divisional managing director, and Michael Proffitt, 45. Proffitt joins Hays from the Ocean Group, where he was chief executive of McGregor Cory, its contract distribution and specialised warehouse servicing business. These moves follow the appointment of David Tibble as finance director in June, when Graham Williams relinquished that post to concentrate on the group's acquisition strategy and European operations. Hays recently made its first overseas acquisition - a French distribution company - and intends to buy more distribution and commercial services companies on the continent. Ronnie Frost, Hays' executive chairman, says the board is being reshaped in the light of the group's strategy of doubling its size within the next three years. Headhunters are looking for one more executive director and the number of non-executives may be increased from two to three. At the operational level, the group has been split into 11 divisions, each with its own managing director below main board level.</p>

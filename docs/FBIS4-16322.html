			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Press release of the Press Center of the Maritime Kray </F> Administration: "Meeting in Seoul--Specific Results. The Far  East, Siberia, and Korea: Paths of Regional Cooperation"]    [Text] The third joint conference of the Association for  Cooperation Between the Republic of Korea and Russia's Far East  and Siberia (AKRS) and the Committee for Cooperation Between the  Far East, Siberia, and the Republic of Korea (KRKS) has been  held in Seoul. Head of the Kray Administration Yevgeniy  Nazdratenko, his deputy for foreign economic activities,  Vladimir Stegniy, and Chairman of the Committee for Foreign  Economic and Regional Relations Andrey Zagumennov took part in  the proceedings of the conference representing the Maritime area.    The Joint Statement, the draft of a technology park in the  Nakhodka Free Economic Zone which is ready for the stage of  technical and economic feasibility study, and the organization  of the Korean College at the facilities of the Far Eastern State  University were the results of the Korean-Russian conference.    As Vladimir Stegniy stated, the conference in Seoul  proceeded  under the leadership of KRKS Chairman Yevgeniy Nazdratenko and  AKRS Chairman Chang Yi-haek. Some 300 prominent representatives  of the statesman and business communities of the two states took  part in the conference. The parties found it feasible to form a  specific economic zone in Northeastern Asia and in the basin of  the Sea of Japan with the participation of countries such as  Russia, China, and Japan. In the process, the need to use the  significant geopolitical situation of the Far East in an optimal  way was stressed.    The parties agreed to approach their governments with a  proposal to establish a private-governmental Joint Committee for  the Far East and Siberia under the Russian Intergovernmental  Commission for Economic Cooperation. The committee in question  could engage in resolving differences and overcoming  difficulties that develop in the course of effecting  commercial-economic, investment, scientific- technical, and  cultural cooperation between the Republic of Korea and Russia's  Far East and Siberia.    It was resolved to seek that the relevant authorities of the  two states begin regular flights between Vladivostok and Seoul  in 1994, as well as regular flights between Korea and Sakhalin,  Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, and Kamchatka Oblasts in the future. The  parties agreed to facilitate the creation of customs warehouses  in the principal seaports and air terminals of the Far East and  to make efforts to improve the operation of the Transsiberian  Railroad.    It is planned to hold the Fourth Joint Conference in Irkutsk  in 1995.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this paragraph, the providing of the services at an airport by a single fixed-based operator shall not be construed as an exclusive right if both of the following apply: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. It would be unreasonably costly, burdensome, or impractical for more than one fixed-based operator to provide such services, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. If allowing more than one fixed-based operator to provide such services would require the reduction of space leased pursuant to an existing agreement between such single fixed-based operator and such airport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It further agrees that it will not, either directly or indirectly, grant or permit any person, firm, or corporation, the exclusive right at the airport to conduct any aeronautical activities, including, but not limited to charter flights, pilot training, aircraft rental and sightseeing, aerial photography, crop dusting, aerial advertising and surveying, air carrier operations, aircraft sales and services, sale of aviation petroleum products whether or not conducted in conjunction with other aeronautical activity, repair and maintenance of aircraft, sale of aircraft parts, and any other activities which because of their direct relationship to the operation of aircraft can be regarded as an aeronautical activity, and that it will terminate any exclusive right to conduct an aeronautical activity now existing at such an airport before the grant of any assistance under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Assurance 26 is revised to read: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. Reports and Inspections. It will submit to the Secretary such annual or special financial and operations reports as the Secretary may reasonably request. A report of the airport budget will be available to the public at reasonable times and places. For airport development projects, it will also make the airport and all airport records and documents affecting the airport, including deeds, leases, operation and use agreements, regulations and other instruments, available for inspection by any duly authorized agent of the Secretary upon reasonable request. For noise compatibility program projects, it will also make records and documents relating to the project and continued compliance with the terms, conditions, and assurances of the grant agreement including deeds, leases, agreements, regulations, and other instruments, available for inspection by any duly authorized agent of the Secretary upon reasonable request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Assurance 31 is revised to read: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31. Disposal of Land. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. For land purchased under a grant for airport noise compatibility purposes, it will dispose of the land, when the land is no longer needed for such purposes, at fair market value, at the earliest practicable time. That portion of the proceeds of such disposition which is proportionate to the United States' share of acquisition of such land will, at the discretion of the Secretary, (1) be paid to the Secretary for deposit in the Trust Fund, or (2) be reinvested in an approved noise compatibility project as prescribed by the Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. (1) For land purchased under a grant for airport development purposes (other than noise compatibility), it will, when the land is no longer needed for airport purposes, dispose of such land at fair market value or make available to the Secretary an amount equal to the United States' proportionate share of the fair market value of the land. That portion of the proceeds of such disposition which is proportionate to the United States' share of the cost of acquisition of such land will, (a) upon application to the Secretary, be reinvested in another eligible airport improvement project or projects approved by the Secretary at that airport or within the national airport system, or (b) be paid to the Secretary for deposit in the Trust Fund if no eligible project exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Land shall be considered to be needed for airport purposes under this assurance if (a) it may be needed for aeronautical purposes (including runway protection zones) or serve as noise buffer land, and (b) the revenue from interim uses of such land contributes to the financial self-sufficiency of the airport. Further, land purchased with a grant received by an airport operator or owner before December 31, 1987, will be considered to be needed for airport purposes if the Secretary or Federal agency making such grant before December 31, 1987, was notified by the operator or owner of the uses of such land, did not object to such use, and the land continues to be used for that purpose, such use having commenced no later than December 15, 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Disposition of such land under (a) or (b) will be subject to the retention or reservation of any interest or right therein necessary to ensure that such land will only be used for purposes which are compatible with noise levels associated with operation of the airport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Assurance 36 is deleted: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 36. Drug-Free Workplace. It will provide a drug-free workplace at the site of work specified in the grant application in accordance with 49 CFR part 29 by (1) publishing a statement notifying its employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the sponsor's workplace and specifying the action that will be taken against its employees for violation of such prohibition; (2) establishing a drug-free awareness program to inform its employees about the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace and any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employees' assistance programs; (3) notifying the FAA within 10 days after receiving notice of an employee criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace; and (4) making a good faith effort to maintain a drug-free workplace. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

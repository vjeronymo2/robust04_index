			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OILERS' RUSH PARTY INITIATES WALSH AND STOPS SAINTS, 23-10;  </P> <P> INTERCONFERENCE: IN HIS FIRST START FOR NEW ORLEANS, HE PASSES FOR 292 YARDS  BUT IS SACKED FOUR TIMES, FUMBLES ONCE AND THROWS AN INTERCEPTION.  </P> <P> Steve Walsh got his initiation rite as a starting quarterback from the Houston  Oilers.  </P> <P> Walsh, who came off the bench last week and led New Orleans to victory in his  first game with the Saints, passed for 292 yards but was harried all game  Sunday by the Oilers, who ended up with a 23-10 victory.  </P> <P> Houston (4-3) sacked Walsh four times, forced a fumble and made an interception  after the quarterback had taken the Saints (2-4) to an early 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> "The line kept constant pressure on him after that first drive and then he  started to feel the pressure more," defensive end William Fuller said.  </P> <P> Lorenzo White, who fumbled away a chance for Houston at the New Orleans  one-yard-line on the first drive of the game, later scored on a one-yard run  and a six-yard pass from Warren Moon as the Oilers built a 17-3 lead.  </P> <P> Moon completed 23 of 37 passes for 202 yards.  </P> <P> Houston's Tony Zendejas kicked field goals of 43, 45 and 33 yards. However,  Zendejas suffered a broken left leg while planting his foot on the kickoff  after his third field goal. Zendejas will be out from four to six weeks.  </P> <P> After the early fumble by White, Walsh led the Saints 97 yards in 15 plays,  completing six of his first seven passes. The Oilers stiffened at the two and  Morten Andersen kicked a 20-yard field goal.  </P> <P> After that, nothing came easy for Walsh, who had a short stint as a starter  last season for the Dallas Cowboys.  </P> <P> "The pressure was good," Walsh said. "The only time they were able to get a lot  of heat on me was on obvious passing situations late in the game. They get good  pressure on the quarterback. They get in the passing lanes and give you a lot  of trouble when you're trying to make some reads.  </P> <P> "I'm still not where I'd like to be, but I feel like I'm making progress. I've  learned the system. I just need more experience with it."  </P> <P> Walsh completed 22 of 39 passes, including a 31-yard touchdown throw to Hoby  Brenner.  </P> <P> The Saints had a chance to increase their 3-0 lead when Walsh drove them  downfield again in the second quarter, but the drive stalled and Sean Jones  blocked Andersen's field-goal attempt.  </P> <P> After Moon's touchdown pass to White, Walsh tried to bring the Saints back  before halftime, but his pass for Dalton Hilliard was intercepted by Johnny  Meads, who returned it 32 yards to the New Orleans 26 with 12 seconds left.  Zendejas kicked a field on the last play of the half to make it 7-3.  </P> <P> "Steve had a good game," Saints' Coach Jim Mora said. "It wasn't a perfect game  by any means, but I'm encouraged by his performance. Houston has an outstanding  defense."  </P> <P> Walsh said his short time with the Saints was a factor.  </P> <P> He also noted that the Oilers' defensive players were talking a lot and it  upset some of his rhythm.  </P> <P> "That hurt us on some of the snap counts," Walsh said.  </P> <P> The loss ended the Saints' NFL record-tying streak of 13 consecutive victories  against AFC teams, dating to 1986. Miami won 13 consecutive games from NFC  teams from 1978-81.  </P></p>

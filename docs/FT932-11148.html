			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Press will benefit from privatisation FRENCH state companies due for sale will have to place 'at least half' their privatisation publicity budgets with the press, to boost newspapers' falling advertising revenues. This commitment was made to press proprietors yesterday by Mr Alain Carignon, the new communications minister, who also promised a FFr200m (Dollars 37m) 'support fund' to prevent certain ailing publications from disappearing. These include the Quotidien de Paris, which braved a national strike last week only to warn its readers it was about to go bankrupt, and l'Humanite, the Communist party newspaper. Asked about the irony of a conservative government saving a Communist paper, Mr Carignon's spokeswoman said yesterday: 'We need to find out what's going in that section of opinion.' The conservatives' last sell-off of companies in 1987 proved a boon for the press, which received 63 per cent of the privatisation advertisements. But the share of ordinary publicity going to newspapers fell to 51 per cent last year. Economic recession and competition from television have caused press advertising revenue to fall by a third in the past two years. Last year the Socialist government also stopped newspapers from carrying tobacco and alcohol advertisements. Mr Carignon said he would honour this law.</p>

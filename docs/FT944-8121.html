			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Curtain raised on Franco's final scene Nineteen years after the Franco dictatorship ended, Spaniards have learnt in detail for the first time about the grotesque circumstances of the dying general's departure from his El Pardo palace outside Madrid. In a documentary by the private Antena 3 television station, members of General Francisco Franco's medical team lifted a pact of secrecy to reveal how he underwent emergency surgery in primitive conditions in the palace guard's disused infirmary. Although desperately ill, the 82-year-old leader had stayed on at the palace for weeks while the Spanish public was kept in the dark about the true state of his health. In the last week of October, 1975, medical bulletins had disclosed the seriousness of his heart condition. But Franco, who had ruled Spain for 36 years, still wanted to die in his own bed. Surgeons described how the general, suffering a stomach haemorrhage and bleeding profusely from the mouth and nose, had to be carried downstairs in a rug since they could not negotiate the staircases with a stretcher. The infirmary, about a kilometre away, belonged to the first world war era, complete with original glass cabinets. According to one of the doctors, there was only a dirty yellow towel to cover the general's naked body when be was placed on the operating table. And then the lights went out. The local electrician in El Pardo village had to be summoned from his bed to fix improvised lighting. One surgeon, holding up a lightbulb, received a series of electric shocks because the floor was wet. One astonished commentator said yesterday it was 'like the infirmary at a third-rate bull ring'. The general, who surprisingly revived once his wounds were sutured, was then finally moved to the modern La Paz hospital in Madrid, where he died more than two weeks later. The contrast provides a bizarre symbol for the mixture of the modern and the archaic which characterised Spain in the latter Franco period. The doctors denied that the general, whose final days coincided with a mounting crisis between Spain and Morocco over Spanish-controlled Western Sahara, was kept artificially alive for political reasons. It was just that old soldiers of his ilk do not die easily.</p>

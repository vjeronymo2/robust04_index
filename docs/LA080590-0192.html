			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAMPRAS LOOKS FOR THE MIDDLE;  </P> <P> TENNIS: HE HITS HIGHS AND LOWS IN THREE-SET LOSS TO EDBERG AND SEARCHES FOR  CONSISTENCY.  </P> <P> Like most 18-year-olds, Pete Sampras is a bundle of energy whose life teeters  on an emotional roller coaster. His tennis game is much the same.  </P> <P> Sampras, having his best year since turning professional in 1988, dropped  Saturday's semifinal at the Volvo/Los Angeles tournament to Wimbledon champion  Stefan Edberg, 6-2, 6-7, (7-2), 6-1.  </P> <P> "Each time I play these guys in the top five, it gets easier and easier,"  Sampras said. "After a set or two, you kind of relax and play your own game."  </P> <P> Sampras won his first professional tournament in February in Philadelphia,  defeating Andres Gomez for the title. He has made it to the quarterfinals in  three of his past five tournaments.  </P> <P> "I think he will mature in the years to come," said Sampras' coach, Joe Bardi.  "He's a serve-and-volleyer and they tend to mature a little later than baseline  players.  </P> <P> "But the first priority is more consistent results. Week in and week out I want  him to finish in the semis and win one every once in a while. The last two  times he's done just that. You just can't hurry it. You build a tennis player a  little at a time."  </P> <P> The Rancho Palos Verdes native started the match showcasing his  serve-and-volley attack, beating Edberg with an array of drop volleys and  passing shots and taking a 2-1 lead in the first set.  </P> <P> His serve was keeping Edberg on the defensive and his volleys were landing in  all the right corners.  </P> <P> "He's a good talent," Edberg said. "Soon, he's going to rank in the top 10. He  has a bright future if he keeps working."  </P> <P> In the fourth game, however, Sampras' game changed dramatically. He never won a  game the remainder of the set, playing as dejectedly as he looked.  </P> <P> "I made a lot of careless volleys and my concentration was up and down,"  Sampras said.  </P> <P> The second set was as up and down as the first. But this time, Sampras came out  ahead.  </P> <P> Trailing 3-1 and 4-2, Sampras played superbly, coming back to tie the game,  then winning it in a tiebreaker, 7-2.  </P> <P> "Mentally, I was so happy to be in the third, I didn't care what happened,"  Sampras said.  </P> <P> But just as a few good points in the second set ignited Sampras, a few bad  shots in the third set depressed him again.  </P> <P> Edberg took a 5-0 lead before Sampras finally held serve, but Edberg finished  it with a love game.  </P></p>

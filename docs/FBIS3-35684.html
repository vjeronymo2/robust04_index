Rucs gathered 53 votes in the ballot, while only 14 deputies  supported other candidates.    "Vidzeme district's local government is against the Cabinet  -- let all Latvia learn it. Let all municipalities work as we  work," Rucs exclaimed after the vote was announced.    The conference rejected the request by the Prosecutor's  Office to nullify Rucs' deputy's immunity. Consequently, Rucs  cannot be tried for the Jan. 10 incident with Russian generals.    Rucs described the incident as a political order of the  Russian military intelligence service, in an interview with BNS  before the vote.    During the session, Rucs reiterated that he "acted correctly  to prevent a possible conflict."    Rucs argued that investigator Biruta Ulpe's comments on the  lack of evidence on the groundedness of his actions. [sentence  as received] Ulpe has not acquainted herself with all the  materials, he said.    The council's next session is scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>

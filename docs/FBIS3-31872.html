Without denying that the Serbs' humanitarian rights have  been  violated on a large scale in Croatia, as confirmed in the latest  reports by the U.N. special rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki and  the U.S. State Department, in a speech to the U.N. Human Rights  Commission in Geneva, Granic attempted to find an excuse in  saying that "Serb armed forces still hold one-third of the  Croatian territory."    Granic said that human rights have been violated as 6,900  people had been killed, 26,000 others wounded and 7,600 people  perished in war (which broke out following Croatia's violent  secession from former Yugoslavia), and that there were currently  some 550,000 refugees and displaced people in Croatia.    Granic, however, failed to explain what this had in common  with mass evictions of Serbs from their homes, with destruction  of their property, with discharging them, and especially with  banning the non-Croat children to attend classes, all of these  listed in Mazowiecki's report as drastic examples of violation  of human rights.    International humanitarian organizations, including the  Croatian Helsinki Committee for the Protection of Human Rights,  have warned intermittently that these actions spurred on ethnic  cleansing campaigns against the Serbs, 300,000 of them already  expelled from Croatia. This was why 10,000 Serb houses have  been blown up and scores of Christian Orthodox churches  destroyed in Croatia.    Granic assessed that the normalisation of relations with  "the  Serb minority in Croatia, especially in the U.N. protected  areas" was "a key to stability in the area and in overall  Croatian-Serb relations," and threatened in a familiar way that  there should be no delusions that the Croatian Government would  negotiate Croatia's territorial integrity.    In 1991, Serbs in Croatia proclaimed the Republic of Serb  Krajina (R.S.K.), now a U.N. protected area, within their ethnic  and historic territory in response to Croatia's violent  secession from the former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce  their status to that of a national minority.    Serbs in Croatia also decided to take such a step because  they were afraid of a relapse of the genocide committed against  them in World War Two, when in the Nazi puppet "independent  state of Croatia," more than a million Serb civilians had been  killed.</p>

They will meet San Gabriel Valley League champion Cerritos  Saturday at 8 p.m. at Gahr High School.  </P> <P> "We play in a tough league with Mission Viejo and Dana Hills," Coach Carlos  Arce said, "but Redlands was a very tough team too. They were very physical and  forced us to play with discipline. We've faced physical teams before, but no  one with as much skill."  </P> <P> Seventeen minutes into the second half Barry crossed a pass from the right  corner and Mejia drilled it past Redlands goalkeeper Jim Moran to give El Toro  the only goal it would need. Redlands finished the season 21-5-2.  </P> <P> El Toro goalkeeper Kevin Rowe, a two-time All-South Coast League selection,  recorded eight saves for his second shutout of the playoffs.  </P></p>

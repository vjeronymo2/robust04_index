[Correspondent A. Pishchayev] The procedure for sealing the  fate of the coup plotters took no more than three hours today.  But this quick verdict did not serve to change the minds of  those participating in the trial. As before, the defendants  continued to maintain that they were not guilty of high treason.    On the subject of amnesty, they gave their full support, as  this is in the name of so-called national reconciliation.    Pichenkin, Yazov's lawyer, said the Duma resolution reflects  the will of the people, no more, no less. He called for this  will to be carried through.    All the defendants called on the court to issue a resolution  closing the SCSE case.    Defendant Varennikov said: All is apparently quite clear and  simple, but I cannot understand who is giving me amnesty and for  what. I can do the forgiving -- of Gorbachev, of Valentin  Stepankov, of Nishanov, of Trubin, for unlawful actions. He  announced his petition requesting that criminal proceedings be  started over the break-up of the Soviet Union.    Defendant Shenin said he saw no point in proving his  innocence to a regime which has violated the law. I believe  that Soviet power will return and sort everyone out, Shenin  asserted.    The defendants and their lawyers said that throughout the  whole SCSE trial the court came under pressure from the powers  that be. Lawyer Ivanov accused Yeltsin's adviser Baturin of  putting pressure on the former general procurator Kazannik,  which warrants criminal proceedings, he said.    After a hearing of the state prosecution which insisted on  continuing the case, the military tribunal decided to end the  SCSE trial on the basis of the amnesty resolution.    So, the case is closed and at the flick of the Duma's  finger,  1 March can now be regarded a day of reconciliation and justice.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 KEATING DEALS UNDER SCRUTINY BY FEDERAL GRAND JURY  </P> <P> Lawyers for former Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. have  identified three activities that they said are being investigated by a federal  grand jury in Los Angeles involving the thrift's $2-billion collapse.  </P> <P> According to documents released Thursday in Washington, Keating and two former  associates were notified on Sept. 18 that they are targets of the federal  inquiry. That was the same day Keating was jailed in Los Angeles under  $5-million bond on separate state charges of securities fraud.  </P> <P> The documents, filed by Keating's lawyers with federal thrift regulators,  listed three subjects of the federal criminal inquiry: the purchase of a  Detroit hotel, the use of an employee stock option plan for alleged personal  gain and a series of dubious land deals.  </P> <P> Keating's lawyers acknowledged in court recently that he is a target of the  federal inquiry. But the disclosure of the three specific areas of  investigation is the first confirmation of what the grand jury is examining.  </P> <P> Being identified as a target of a grand jury is not proof of wrongdoing and may  not result in criminal charges.  </P> <P> Regulators have blamed Keating for the April, 1989, failure of the Irvine-based  institution, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> The federal Office of Thrift Supervision is seeking a record $40.9 million in  restitution from Keating and five associates in connection with Lincoln's  failure. The OTS has charged in its civil action that Keating and the others  diverted money from Lincoln through phony tax schemes and dubious land deals.  </P> <P> The regulators have been pressing for a hearing on the civil charges. In a  response filed Sept. 27, Keating's attorneys asked for a delay until the  criminal actions against their client are complete.  </P> <P> The state indictment accuses Keating and three others of victimizing investors  who bought worthless bonds of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental  Corp. But, according to the documents, the federal inquiry is more  wide-ranging.  </P> <P> The lawyers said the federal grand jury was sought in a 16-page request  provided to the Justice Department by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which  used to oversee thrifts. The request cited three areas of inquiry:  </P> <P> * The purchase of the Hotel Pontchartrain, a downtown Detroit hotel, by a  Lincoln subsidiary in December, 1985. The subsidiary sold it the following  March for $38 million to a partnership consisting largely of Keating, his  family and associates. Another Lincoln subsidiary financed the partnership's  purchase, an action that alarmed regulators, and the hotel eventually went into  foreclosure.  </P> <P> * A guarantee by American Continental and Lincoln of a $20-million letter of  credit issued by Bankers Trust so American Continental's employee stock option  plan could buy company stock. The ESOP, which also obtained a $3-million loan  from a local bank, spent $21 million to buy American Continental stock from  Keating, certain family members, other directors and officers, and the  brokerage firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, which had acted as broker for much of  Lincoln's trading in junk bonds.  </P> <P> * The Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Co. deal, a convoluted  arrangement in which Lincoln made loans to developer Ernest C. Garcia, who then  loaned $3.5 million to Westcontinental, a limited partnership in which Garcia  had an interest. Westcontinental used the money as a down payment on a  $14-million purchase of raw desert land from Lincoln, but never repaid the  loans. In a letter, the company asked that the property be returned to its  rightful owner, suggesting that the partnership was a straw borrower.  </P> <P> Keating, on advice of his lawyers, has refused to talk to the press. He is in  the Los Angeles County Jail unable to post a $5-million bond while awaiting  trial on the state charges. Previously, he has denied wrongdoing in the three  transactions.  </P> <P> The other two targets of the federal grand jury were identified as Judy J.  Wischer, the former president and chief executive of Lincoln's parent company,  and Robert J. Kielty, its former senior vice president and general counsel.  </P> <P> Wischer is also charged in the state indictment. Kielty is not.  </P> <P> The same three transactions were part of the OTS civil complaint. As a result,  Keating's lawyers sought a delay in the OTS hearing until the potential  criminal charges are resolved. Citing his constitutional protection against  self-incrimination, the lawyers said that Keating would not be able to respond  to the OTS charges so long as the criminal actions are pending.  </P></p>

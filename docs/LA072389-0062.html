			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE JACKSON PHENOMENON THE MAN, THE POWER, THE MESSAGE BY  ELIZABETH O. COLTON (DOUBLEDAY: $19.95; 290 PP.)  </P> <P> Early in her account of Jesse Jackson's 1988 campaign for President of the  United States, Elizabeth Colton makes it clear that, although she worked as  Jackson's press secretary from January, 1988, until the election, she intends  to include the unflattering as well as the laudatory. Colton briefly recounts  the years that Jackson spent methodically building a power base with his own  grass-roots organization, PUSH, originally People United to Save Humanity,  though the save was soon replaced with the less grandiose serve. Colton notes  the particular attention Jackson has paid to cultivating a following among the  young. His first appearances at schools were in 1971, she points out, so one of  the major Jackson constituencies was still too young to vote in 1988. They  will, however, be of age in 1992. The many on-the-campaign-trail anecdotes make  clear Jackson's ear for a good line, witness his immediate adoption of the  statement from a Klansman turned Jackson supporter: "I just don't want to be on  the wrong side of history again."  </P> <P> Colton also examines issues over Jackson's history that came up during the  campaign: his disingenuous account of his reason for leaving the University of  Illinois; his heavy-handed negotiating on behalf of PUSH to establish  "covenants" with corporations to hire blacks; his antisemitic remarks and  continued association with controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis  Farrakhan. There was also the continuing rancor over his bid for black  leadership upon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s death. In her explanation, Colton  says that Jackson regrets his behavior, but manages to leave the impression  that he mainly regrets the problems the incident caused him later. Even without  reviving past issues, Jackson's behavior during the campaign gives rise to  enough criticism on its own: his emphasis on loyalty over competence in his  staff; his disinclination to relinquish control over any part of his operation;  his reliance on a seat-of-the-pants approach; his struggle to control himself  in relations with the press; his occasional abusiveness to members of his  staff. There are no great revelations, however. Colton is not the first to  suggest that Jackson's drive for power is actually pursuit of legitimacy (he  was born out of wedlock, as he said so often during the campaign), first as  heir to King, then with his own political organization, and finally, as  contender for the highest office in the land. Colton makes no secret of the  fact that she found it extremely difficult to work closely with the candidate.  What is unclear is whether Colton seeks to temper her admiration for Jackson  with criticism in the interest of fairness, or whether she means to warn the  public between the lines that Jackson's volatile personality could be a  liability in public office. Her ambivalence creates a curiously opaque account.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Police yesterday issued arrest warrants for two  Iranians allegedly involved in a foiled truck-bomb plot believed  to have been aimed at the Israeli Embassy in March, Bangkok  Metropolitan Police Chief Pol Lt Gen Chaisit Kanchanakit said.  However, Chaisit admitted that it was not possible that the men  were still in Thailand.    Mohammadt Lotfollah and Hossein Shahriarifar, both about 40  years old, have been identified by police in connection with the  plot. Police said they had asked Interpol to help.    "We still don't know where they are living but we are  certain  that they left the country through the southern border of  Thailand," Chaisit said.    The plot was unveiled on March 17 when the owner went to  claim his truck, which had been taken to Lumphini police station  a week earlier.    Police then discovered a one-tonne water tank full of  powdered ammonium nitrate, large quantities of C-4 plastic  explosive wired to detonators and four 25-litre containers  filled with diesel oil in the back of the truck.    The body of the man who delivered the truck to the alleged  saboteurs was found in the water tank.    According to police, the truck had been stored at the police  station since being involved in a minor accident at Phloenchit  intersection, about 100 metres from the Israeli embassy, on  March 11.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AIDS KILLING ROMANIA'S CHILDREN  </P> <P> At Victor Babes Hospital, rows of cribs hold small, shriveled babies slowly  dying of AIDS.  </P> <P> Manea Gabriel, 11 months old, could scarcely breathe.  </P> <P> Her frightened eyes scanned the room as she failed to find the strength to  raise a tiny hand.  </P> <P> The cries of Mihai Van, 7 months old, were reduced to a mere rattle by the  deadly disease.  </P> <P> The ward was filled with 68 other babies who had been born to die.  </P> <P> Dr. Jacques LeBas, president of Medicins du Monde, an international  organization that provides humanitarian aid to needy countries, said Monday  that AIDS-infected children constitute the most serious health problem facing  Romania today.  </P> <P> Investigations during the past few days have revealed a startlingly high  proportion of babies with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, LeBas said. Of  1,025 babies tested at hospitals and orphanages, 367, more than one-third, were  carrying the disease, and 60% of those had symptoms of fully developed AIDS.  </P> <P> Urgent help is needed from the European Community, "otherwise more babies will  die in this most awful way," he said.  </P> <P> "We need everything -- medical equipment, specialists, money and information,"  LeBas said. "This morning I saw a pediatrician using the same syringe several  times. When I asked why, she replied that it was the only one she had."  </P> <P> AIDS is commonly transmitted by contaminated needles.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 21 April TASS -- Talks on a  peace settlement of the Dniester conflict consequences are to  resume in Moldova in late April, the Russian president's special  envoy for the talks Vladlen Vasev told TASS on Thursday.    According to Vasev, Russia's proposals for Dniester  settlement are based on recommendations worked out by the CSCE  mission in Moldova and take into account the interests of both  sides to the conflict.    Dniester leader Igor Smirnov said yesterday Tiraspol found  unacceptable some aspects of the Russian proposals. The  document was also subjected to criticism by certain Moldovan  politicians who assessed these proposals as "pro-Tiraspol."    "We believe our proposals can lay down the basis for  negotiations," Russia's envoy stressed. "However, we are not  too self-assured and understand they may be adjusted in the  course of discussion in order to reflect the compromises  reached," he noted.</p>

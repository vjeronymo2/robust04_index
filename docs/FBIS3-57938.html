			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Suleyman Demirel by Hasan Yalcin </F> in Ankara; date not given]    [Text] [Yalcin] Did Turkey's defense concept change? Did  the concept of a threat change following changes in Russia?    [Demirel] No. Of course Turkey assessed the possibility of a  threat following changes in the Soviet Union. Since Soviet  Russia no longer exists, it was concluded that while the threat  from the former Soviet Union has vanished, it has been  supplanted by uncertainties. Turkey did not make this  assessment alone; it consulted its allies.    But, the assessment of a threat is Turkey's own evaluation.  The assessment made with others was simply consultation to  enable us to make a correct assessment.    Changes took place in Russia. And, while Russia is no longer  a threat to the world, there is uncertainty. Where will things  end because of this uncertainty? Uncertainty is as serious as a  threat. The case of Zhirinovskiy has shocked the world. There  are aspects about it that have not been covered in our press.  What will happen now? The world has not figured out where  Zhirinovskiy and his policies will end. How will this popular  movement and Zhirinovskiy's views affect the Russian Government?  No one knows. But our defense system is flexible. It could  readjust at any time. Of course, a new assessment of a threat  will be made eventually. I believe the General Staff will brief  us on this issue in the first week of January.    [Yalcin] Assuming Turkey can engage in political activity  over a wider area when there are two superpowers, will the new  situation benefit Turkey? Can Turkey act more freely if  Zhirinovskiy makes further claims against the West?    [Demirel] It doesn't much look that way. Zhirinovskiy's  views, first, are targeted against Turkey and Central Asia. Let  us put it this way: Zhirinovskiy is the mouthpiece of a group  of people who are uncomfortable with the dissolution of the  Soviet Union, although how his utterances could be put into  practice is something different. These are people who want to  revive the empire, although not in its excessive communist form,  which can't be done. Already, there are nearly 30 million  Russians outside Russia. Russia openly expressed its interest  in these people in the near abroad. The Russians make up 38  percent of Kazakhstan. They constitute 20 percent in  Kyrgyzstan. Efforts to recreate the Russian empire have  considerably unsettled officials in these republics. They  already had such fears.  <H5>  Change in Essence of Relations With Iran </H5>   [Yalcin] Looking at the Middle East, are we seeing a change  in the essence of the relations among Turkey, Iran, and Syria or  is this a simple improvement in ordinary relations? There have  been reports of late that joint operations could be undertaken  in Iran and Iraq and that signs in this direction are being  observed. Was this a qualitative jump?    [Demirel] There is some information to the effect that the  PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] has settled in Iran. These  were rumors for a while and Iran rejected them. Later, the  situation was explained to Iran. Incidents that might have  happened over there would have concerned them. Upon that, a  major rapprochement took place. I held a long conversation with  Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Tehran last year. I also held a long  conversation with him when he visited Istanbul for the ECO  [Economic Cooperation Organization] meeting. Our foreign  minister went to Iran and their's came here. All these things  are good, but there is also an agreement that goes back to 1932.  If they [the PKK] are there, let us launch an operation against  them. We have reached the point of joint operation.    [Yalcin] Is this, that is, the joint operation, something  for  the coming months?    [Demirel] But an improvement is obvious. [as published]    [Yalcin] What about the last three visits?    [Demirel] These were scheduled visits. Their foreign  minister could come at any time. First Vice President Habibi  had to pay a return visit for my visit, but it was then  postponed following the assassination of Ugur Mumcu. It was  said that the Iranians were behind it, which upset them.  <H5>  Multilateral Diplomacy Between U.S. and Europe </H5>   [Yalcin] Where does Turkey stand with the United States and  Europe? Does it regard them as one single entity or follow a  policy that recognizes differences between them?    [Demirel] Turkey has been pursuing a multilateral policy  since 1965. This policy has not changed even with the change of  governments. This is not a policy with ties to any one place.  It is tied to Turkey's obligations. It is free where it has no  obligations. But, it does not use this freedom to the detriment  of what it sees as friendly countries. This is because we have  had good relations with both Europe and the United States.    [Yalcin] Also with the Soviet Union?    [Demirel] Yes, we also had good relations with Russia and  have good relations with the present Russia, and we do not want  these relations to suffer. We signed a friendship and  cooperation agreement with Russia. Last year, Yeltsin told me  that "this is a very important development." This is not mere  friendship but also a cooperation agreement. These are  important for Russia. What we are saying is this: If the United  States, Russia, and Turkey forged good cooperation, they would  form the backbone of world peace.    [Yalcin] Do you see a threat in Zhirinovskiy against  Yeltsin?  That is, are the two very different?    [Demirel] Yeltsin made no mention or allusion to  Zhirinovskiy's views.    [Yalcin] Or to the CFE [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]  agreement.    [Demirel] That is something else.    [Yalcin] Is Yeltsin not also expansionist towards Central  Asia as evinced by his stance on Armenian-Azeri problem?    [Demirel] At present they do not have the strength for it.  If a reasonable person gets involved in a number of imprudent  ventures then he will further exhaust himself. I think Yeltsin  and people around him are wise enough to make the proper choice.    [Yalcin] But, you do not say the same thing about  Zhirinovskiy.    [Demirel] No. I am not saying that Zhirinovskiy is  brainless, but from our and world's viewpoint he is an  adventurist.  <H5>  PKK Issue Has Been Given Serious Consideration Since 1989 </H5>   [Yalcin] I will ask a question concerning the PKK. For the  last ten years there have been promises to the effect that this  problem would be eradicated. You too expressed similar views.  Has there been a tragic turn to the events now? What is the  difference between the new assertion and the previous ones?  And, while making this assertion, what material conditions do  you have in mind?    [Demirel] There is no difference. The PKK is a state problem  for Turkey. No matter what country you are talking about, if  armed people of its own nationality or from another country take  to the mountains and start killing five-month old babies, women,  and girls, and martyrs its soldiers guarding the borders, it has  only one choice: to neutralize them. How could they be  neutralized? There is only one, and not two ways, of doing it.  That is, Turkey has a Constitution whose Articles 120 and 122  define this subject and state what to do if such a war erupts.  What is required by these articles will be done.    [Yalcin] I know your approach. My question is what factors  shaped the state's present conviction that it will eradicate  this problem after ten years?    [Demirel] There is this talk about ten years, but the  incidents were not considered serious or grave at the beginning.    [Yalcin] Is this problem being given serious consideration  for the first time now?    [Demirel] Not for the first time. After a while its  importance was realized. It was after 1989.    [Yalcin] But, is this realization at a new stage, that is,  will a different type of struggle be waged?    [Demirel] No matter which government comes to power it has  to  show the same determination that the 49th government headed by  me and the present 50th government have shown. Any other  government cannot be the government of this state.    [Yalcin] New forces and measures are being introduced. Are  these the foundation of this determination?    [Demirel] These are security measures. There is no political  aspect to it.  <H3>  "No One Can Run in the Name of the PKK, for the State Knows  Everything" </H3>   [Yalcin] You made a statement on local elections. Could you  clarify it? You said that the PKK candidates will be prevented  from running. What is the legal way to prevent it? That is,  how are you going to do that?    [Demirel] Could a PKK candidate run in an election?    [Yalcin] How are you going to weed out such people since  their being PKK is not written on them?    [Demirel] What I want to say is this: If a PKK member runs  in these elections and wins it would be tantamount to a  plebiscite. The PKK is a criminal organization, a terrorist  group. Could a state, while struggling against the criminal and  terrorist group, also allow its members to run in the elections?  When the time comes, measures against it will be thought out.    [Yalcin] Is there a legal measure before the start of the  elections?    [Demirel] No, there is no legal way to sift out such people  before the elections. But if a candidate says "I am a PKK  member," or is engaged in such propaganda, then the state will  take care of it. Could a state ever allow members of a crime  syndicate to run in elections? Could the state forces, which  pursue the bandits in the mountains, allow the members of that  bandit group to come down to the cities and run in elections?    [Yalcin] There might be legal measures if the state knows  these people.    [Demirel] It knows, it knows. The state knows everything.  Of course there is also the following case: The elections  cannot be presented as a plebiscite if a candidate has not  entered the elections in the name of the PKK and has not openly  declared himself affiliated to it but later announces that he is  a PKK member.    [Yalcin] Simply because he has not stated this at the  beginning?    [Demirel] This is not possible by merely stating that  elections were tantamount to a plebiscite.  <H5>  "Postponement of Elections Will Create Panic" </H5>   [Yalcin] It is being said that there is an ongoing huge  refugee problem and that the number of electors has fallen in  the region. Figures are being issued, and it is even being said  that "this trend is being encouraged a bit [by the state]." Did  you hear about this?    [Demirel] Yes, we now know how many people have moved out of  their places. Nearly 678 villages and hamlets have been  partially or completely vacated. But then there are more than  4,000 villages and hamlets there. The partially and completely  vacated villages and hamlets amount to 15 percent. Most of the  people from these villages have come to Diyarbakir, Batman and  such places. They came to cities. They went to Sirnak and  Cizre. That is, this will not alter the election balances in the  region.    [Yalcin] That is, does there exist a normal electoral  quantity?    [Demirel] Even if not normal, it is not at the level of  altering the balances.    [Yalcin] You consider elections possible under the present  conditions. But there are also those who say that we should not  hold elections under these conditions and instead start thinking  of constitutional measures.    [Demirel] Postponing elections only in that region would  show  a weakness in the Turkish state.    [Yalcin] Could a general postponement be considered?    [Demirel] No, because these elections are set for every five  years.    [Yalcin] What about a constitutional amendment?    [Demirel] What reason should we give for a constitutional  amendment?    [Yalcin] Let us first ensure peace, as the present situation  does not look pretty.    [Demirel] It [the postponement of elections] would create  panic in the world and in Turkey. That is, it would be exactly  what the terrorists want.  <H5>  Hizbullah and Unsolved Murders </H5>   [Yalcin] When we were still publishing the magazine 2000  IKIBIN'E DOGRU, I asked you. I hen conveyed to you fresh  reports, and at the time you told me that such organizations are  illegal and that you are opposed to such things. You are now  the head of state and an influential organization is active over  there. I am talking about Hizbullah, which is based in the east  and southeast. What can you say on this issue?    [Demirel] The state is closely watching this organization.  The state cannot make concessions to illegal activities. There  cannot be a state where some enjoy the right to commit lawless  acts and some are charged with criminal offenses if they act  lawlessly. We are watching them very closely.    [Yalcin] You might have heard, but it is being said that the  state is making use of Hizbullah to balance out the PKK.    [Demirel] Such a claim is wrong.    [Yalcin] But there have been many complaints in this  direction in Batman.    [Demirel] There is no such case.    [Yalcin] There are hundreds of unsolved murders in Batman.    [Demirel] Unfortunately, all these are interconnected. I am  following the case of unsolved crimes very closely.    [Yalcin] Are satisfied with the things that are being done  to  solve these problems? You are at the helm of the state and yet  such things are taking place in the country you run.    [Demirel] It would be very wrong if I were to say that I am  not concerned about what is happening in Turkey. I am very  concerned. But since the state has no other alternative than its  present course of action, then it should do what it is already  doing but do it better and get results. I am telling you openly  that in my former capacity as prime minister and in my present  capacity as the head of the National Security Council I told all  the state organs that the unsolved crimes should be solved.  Otherwise, there will be an inclination to blame them on the  state. I am following this problem very closely. It is being  tackled in a positive manner.</p>

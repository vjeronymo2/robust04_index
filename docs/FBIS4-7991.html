			<p>BFN     [Text] A general alert has been sounded due to an explosion  in the military weapons depot in Duboki Jarak in Sesvete, near  Zagreb. Fire raging in one of the warehouses is threatening to  spread to other buildings, which could have serious  consequences. The residents of Sesvete have, therefore, been  urged to go to shelters, and everyone should avoid going to  Sesvete -- particularly drivers, because roads through Sesvete  will be closed. The residents of Dubrava near Sesvete, as well  as of the surrounding villages have also been warned to be  cautious and not stay in the streets but seek shelter in houses  or basements.    Mr. Sindicic, on duty in the Zagreb police station, has  confirmed this talking to Gordana Cukon.    [Begin recording] [Sindicic] There have been a series of  explosions of stored powder in Duboki Jarak in the Sesvete area,  and we are asking residents to move to a safe distance to avoid  casualties. Everyone should protect themselves. They should  not stay on the road but move to a safe distance. There should  be no panic. This is not an attack. The situation is under  control, and it will probably (?calm down) in 10 to 20 minutes.    [Correspondent] Have the explosions stopped?    [Sindicic] Not yet, and we cannot estimate when they will  stop. When they stop, there will be no more danger. The most  important thing is to inform the residents to stay away, not to  panic, and that this is not an attack. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn handed over  an Estonian Foreign Ministry protest in Moscow today, in  connection with the continued Russian campaign of statements  distorting the reality in Estonia.    The Riigikogu has issued a statement on increasing  imperialist tendencies in Russian foreign policy. The Riigikogu  voices resolute protest against the increasing imperialist  tendencies in the Russian foreign policy according to which the  Baltic countries fall within the Russian sphere of influence.  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has consistently  justified the continued Russian troop presence on the territory  of the Republic of Estonia, against the will of the Estonian  people and the norms of international law. Statements made  against Estonia by Russian Government members are in conflict  with the UN Charter and the provisions of the CSCE final acts,  which Russia, too, has pledged to observe in its foreign policy.  The Riigikogu draws the attention of the parliaments of all  countries to the fact that in 1992, at a CSCE Helsinki summit,  Russia took upon itself the obligation of withdrawing its troops  from the territory of the Baltic states quickly, in an orderly  manner, and completely, without setting any additional  conditions.    [Words indistinct] for this reason the development of  relations between Estonia and Russia has run into a deadlock.  The Riigikogu holds the position that for the purpose of  developing relations between countries it is essential to  proceed from the principles of respect for a country's  sovereignty and equality, from those countries' legislative  acts, and from the principle of mutual interest.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Survey of Building Services (5): Code of practice published  -Environmental issues A cartoon sums up some of the thinking behind recent moves on the environment in the building services industry. It depicts a bright, pristine planet earth with two figures. One, called The First Client, is drawn with a god-like flowing white beard and gown. He instructs a small, confused individual called The First Engineer: 'Okay, now put in the services'. The next image is of the same planet almost completely covered in smoking pipes and tubing, oxygen tanks and numerous different gadgets. The client says to an exhausted engineer: 'Fine, fine. But where do the lifts go?' If only there had been more communication - if only the engineer had been in on the act of creation at the beginning - his efforts to supply the end product with the services it needed would not have been quite so damaging. The cartoon is used on the cover of a report which aims to do something about this state of affairs. The Building Services Research and Information Association published an environmental code of practice earlier this year. The code, sponsored by a range of clients and funded by the Department of the Environment as well as by industry, aims to cover the process of building from inception to dismantling. Although most people in the building services industry accept that their chances of improving the environmental impact of buildings would be enhanced if they were brought in at the inception of any project, the code aims to provide advice and recommendations for the 'real world', says its author, Sandy Halliday, principal engineer and environment section leader at BSRIA. This world consists of engineers being called in once a building is built, or for refurbishment once it is already past its prime, or for demolition. The code, the result of three years' work, will be distributed to architects, project managers, quantity surveyors and designers as well as the association's 800 or so building service members. It was sponsored by a range of clients, from PowerGen and a county council to housing project groups. 'We realised quite early on that it was pointless trying to do this in isolation; that everybody involved in building had to realise what was going on,' says Halliday. Lack of awareness and lack of communication have been at the root of the problem for some time, she says. 'Traditionally engineers have been given a box and told to heat it to such and such a temperature and cool it afterwards. The work has been thought of in terms of providing equipment rather than a living environment. There has been no concern about what the effect on the local environment is going to be, let alone the global one.' The association felt that the accepted attitude had to change. It soon found that members were willing to listen. More members of the association supported the Pounds 140,000 environment project than had supported any other in BSRIA's 19-year history. The report focuses on the life cycle costs of a building rather than the first cost of construction. It deals with the basics - how to improve the environmental impact of waste disposal, for example - but it also paints the work of a building services engineer on a wider environmental canvas. It questions whether a building is actually necessary. 'This sounds radical for a building services engineer,' says Ms Halliday, 'but not enough of us actually ask whether we need a building in the first place.' The report warns of the effect that a badly-designed building can have on the local environment. Demolition of unsightly buildings is a 'wasteful use of capital resources', it says. It criticises the move away from the use of sunshine, natural light and air in buildings. 'There has been an increasing tendency to replace these natural systems with energy-consuming building services which are frequently more prolific, less functional and less efficient.' Many in the industry have already taken on board some of the issues dealt with by the association's code. The Justham Dunsdon partnership, for example, has been working on a feasibility study for National Westminster bank. The engineering consultancy proposes to use a system of air conditioning or 'comfort cooling' which aims to save the bank Pounds 750,000 a year in energy costs. Most of this saving would be achieved by employing a system of refrigeration which uses the outside environment. Keith Dunsdon, principal partner at the company, believes the industry is only now beginning to wake up to the benefits of environmental technology and developments. 'We were perhaps too happy in years gone by to use systems which had worked quite well in one building for all buildings. Now we are being encouraged to be more innovative as well as practical in our energy efficiency, for example.' This change was brought about by a number of factors but particularly the recession, he says, with 'people expecting twice as much for their money'. Both he and BSRIA are clear that long-term environmental benefits go hand in hand with cost savings in winning projects. Mr Dunsdon adds that the job is easier with educated clients who understand the advantages of constructing environmentally-friendly buildings. 'Sometimes people are worried about new ideas. We've been lucky in working with clients that understand.' A follow-up project will chart the economic and environmental implications of the code by analysing the effectiveness of case studies in the public and private sector later this year. Sandy Halliday says: 'We didn't want to end it there; to say: 'A code has been drawn up - that's it'. We had to make a judgment about how effective the recommendations were in actually cutting harmful emissions, improving the environment and saving money. That's the next step.' Much of the work in terms of attitude has already been done, she says. 'At the most basic level, engineers recognise that good sense about the environment makes good business sense. If you can save money by turning lights off, and at the same time save a lot more, then you do so.'</p>

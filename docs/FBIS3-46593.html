[applause]    In greeting the New Year, I extend warm congratulations and  warm greetings to all the people, including our working class,  cooperative peasants, intellectuals, and People's Army officers  and men, who, with boundless loyalty to the party and the leader  [suryong], are devotedly waging the struggle for the  chuche-oriented socialist cause. [applause]    I extend warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings to  brothers and sisters in South Korea and Korean residents in  Japan and all the other compatriots overseas who are positively  waging the struggle to peacefully reunify the fatherland.  [applause]    I extend New Year greetings to the progressive peoples and  friends on the five continents who treasure justice and peace  and aspire for an independent new world. [applause]    The year 1993 was a historic year when the justness of our  party's independent revolutionary lines and the might of chuche  Korea were displayed powerfully. [applause]    Last year, the imperialists and reactionaries more viciously  than ever maneuvered to isolate and stifle [korip chilsik] our  Republic and obliterate [malsal] our socialist cause. As a  result, the situation in our country has become very tense.    When a stern trial faced the fatherland and revolution, our  party, in response to the prevailing situation, took the bold  self-defensive measure of declaring a state of semi-war in the  entire country, all the people, and the entire Army and called  on all the people to break through head-on [matpadanagamyo] the  enemy's challenge with the revolutionary spirit and militant  spirit -- which was displayed during the period of the stern  fatherland liberation war -- and score great upsurges in  socialist construction.    Our heroic People's Army officers and men and all the  people,  who accepted the party's militant call with their hearts, rose  up like one in the struggle to defend national independence and  the revolutionary feats with confidence in a sure victory and  soaring spirits, crushed the enemy's challenge and aggression  maneuvers, and honorably defended the dignity and safety of the  socialist fatherland, thus fully displaying the indomitable  spirit of chuche Korea. [applause]    This is the victory of our party's revolutionary lines and  the great victory of single-minded unity among the leader  [suryong], party, and masses. [applause]    Last year our people, under the leadership of the party,  attained successive victories in the political and military  confrontation with the enemies. With high revolutionary zeal,  they vigorously accelerated the socialist economic construction  and brilliantly concluded the final year of the Third Seven-Year  Plan. [applause]    During the Third Seven-Year Plan period, we came up against  considerable difficulty and obstacle in the economic  construction owing to the unexpected international events and  the acute situation created in the country, but we have made  great progress in all fields of socialist economic construction.  Our independent industry made significant expansion in the  overall production capacity, the standard of its technology and  equipment was enhanced much, and its structure by sectors  further reinforced, thereby its self-reliance and might was  further strengthened.    In the rural economic sector, the great nature-remaking  project of completing irrigation at a higher level was  victoriously conducted and an upturn was brought forth in  mechanization and scientization. With the further development  of agricultural science and technology in conformity with the  chuche agricultural method, we built a solid revolutionary  agricultural foundation ensuring a continuous bumper crop.    According to our party's idea of capital construction, the  magnificent and splendid Kwangbok Street, Tongil Street, the  Fatherland Liberation War Victory Monument, the Three  Revolutions Exhibition Center, the May Day Stadium, and numerous  other monumental creations were built during the Third  Seven-Year Plan period. This intensively demonstrates the might  of the inexhaustible creativity and our country's self-reliant  national economy. It clearly symbolizes the heroic spirit of  socialist Korea which victoriously advances undisturbed by the  worldwide economic recession. [applause]    Despite today's complicated situation, our people are all  enjoying rewarding, happy lives free from social and political  unrest or worries about livelihood under the popular  mass-centered socialist system of our country. The communist  virtues, in which the people help and encourage each other--one  for all and all for one--sharing joy and sorrow, prevail more  beautifully in the entire society.    Through a stern trial and struggle in recent times, we  strongly demonstrated once again that our party is a great party  of iron-will and tested guidance, that our people are a heroic  people of firm revolutionary faith and indomitable struggle  spirit, and that our-style socialism embodying the chuche idea  is an indestructible socialism taking root deep among the  popular masses. [applause]    I warmly thank all the people--including our workers,  farmers, intellectuals, and the soldiers of the People's  Army--for the shining exploits they have accomplished in the  revolution and construction last year under the party's  leadership. [applause]    The New Year of 1994 is a year of revolutionary upturn when  our country's socialist construction enters a new developmental  stage and a year of rewarding struggle when the entire party  membership, the entire country, and all the people should be  totally mobilized to effect revolutionary upsurge in all fronts.    The situation at home and abroad of our revolution is still  complicated and strained, and we are building socialism in acute  confrontation with the enemies. In conformity with today's  situation and the demand of our revolution's development, we  must thoroughly implement the independent, self-reliant, and  self-defending revolutionary line and vigorously conduct the  three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--so  that we may further strengthen the country's political,  economic, and military might.    We must solidify and develop the successes we have already  attained in socialist construction and win new greater victories  so that we may add luster to the popular mass-centered socialism  of our own style and hold further aloft the chuche socialist  banner. [applause]    We should consider the next three years to be an adjustment  period for the socialist economic construction as decided at the  21st plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee. We  should thoroughly implement a policy of top priority for  agriculture, light industry, and trade during this period.    Along with this, we should firmly give priority to  developing  the coal and electric power industries and railway  transportation, which are primary sectors in the national  economy. We should constantly develop the metal industry. By  thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary strategies  during the adjustment period for the socialist econonomic  construction, we should consolidate as firm as a rock the  self-reliant economic foundation of the country, should more  smoothly ensure the people's lives in keeping with the socialist  demand, and should secure a new position of attack to reach a  higher target of socialism. [applause]    This year, we should concentrate our strength on developing  agriculture, the light industry, and foreign trade. This year  is a significant year. It marks the 30th anniversary of the  publication of the socialist rural theses. We should effect a  new turn in developing the rural economy by vigorously  struggling to implement the historic task of the rural theses.  We should further develop all fields of agricultural  production, including the production of grains, by consolidating  the successes of irrigation and electrification in the rural  areas, realizing the mechanization and widespread use of  chemicals at a higher level, and by thoroughly carrying out the  chuche-oriented farming method in the rural areas.    Our working class should produce more tractors, automobiles,  modern agricultural farming instruments, chemical fertilizers,  and farming medicines, and send them to rural villages. With  the attitude befitting the masters responsible for the national  granary, the people working in agricultural cooperatives and all  the people working in agriculture should conduct all farming  work carefully and frugally and realize the high target of grain  production provided by the party. [applause]    We should make a great innovation in producing people's  consumer goods by vigorously accelerating the light industry  revolution. We should repair, supplement, and modernize light  industry plants. We should take a positive measure to  strengthen the production of light industry raw materials, such  as chemical fibers and plastics. By so doing, we should operate  all light industry plants at full capacity and normalize  production at a higher level.    Ranging the large-scale central light industry from small-  and medium-sized local industries and the production of 3 August  people's consumer goods, all units and domains should fully  produce various people's consumer goods. By so doing, we should  increase the types of consumer goods and actually improve their  quality.    We should positively pioneer foreign markets and thoroughly  win our reputation in developing foreign trade in keeping with  the changing circumstances. Various domains of the national  economy should thoroughly strengthen the production bases for  export goods, increase production of export goods, and improve  their quality.    All domains and all locals should further increase export by  positively finding and mobilizing the sources of export. They  should also develop the processing trade.    We should put efforts into the coal, electrict power, and  metal industries in a bid to develop agriculture and the light  industry and vigorously accelerate the overall economic  construction of the country. We should more smoothly resolve  the railway transportation issue. The fields of coal and  electric power industries should effectively use existing  production foundations and further develop the production  capacity. They thereby should decisively increase the  production of coal and electricity. We should smoothly meet the  daily-increasing demand for transportation of the national  economy by strengthening the railroad's material and  technological foundation, setting up a policy for  transportation, commanding the transportation organization, and  actively making the railways strong.    All units and domains of the national economy should  vigorously launch the campaign for the struggle for production  and conservation as an all-people movement. By so doing, they  should effectively use existing labor, facilities, and  equipment, and should fully mobilize inner reserves and increase  production.    All the economic guidance officials must carry out economic  organizational work and production management to comply with the  party's economic strategies, have the popular masses display  their revolutionary enthusiasm and positive creativity, and,  thus overfull the people's economic plan for this year.    Contributing to socialist construction with scientific  knowledge and technology is our intellectuals' honorable duty.  In hearty response to the party's policy on cultural  revolution, intellectuals must devotedly wage the struggle to  achieve new development in science, education, culture and arts,  public health, and all other fields of socialist cultural  construction.    This year we must also cope with the enemy's war provocation  maneuvers and make proper efforts to strengthen the country's  defense capability. We must firmly prepare ourselves  politically, ideologically, militarily, and materially so that  we may confidently cope with any unexpected development, and  thoroughly establish the environment in the entire society of  regarding military affairs [kunsa] as important and actively  assisting the People's Army. [applause]    To vigorously push ahead with revolution and construction  under today's circumstances, we must strongly adhere to our  party's policy on ideological revolution, further strengthen  single-minded unity in the revolutionary ranks, and highly  demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.  Single-minded unity and self-reliance are the immortal,  honorable traditions of our revolution and the banners of  victory. [applause]    We have opened the road of brilliant victory after  overcoming  stern trials with the might of single-minded unity and made  great progress in revolution and construction while overcoming  all difficulties with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.    When all the people fight vigorously by being  single-mindedly  united around the party and the leader [suryong] and highly  demonstrating the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  arduous struggle, can we defend and maintain the socialism of  our own style and boundlessly glorify it and victoriously  complete the chuche-oriented socialist cause no matter the trial  we may face. [applause]    We must defend single-minded unity in our revolutionary  ranks, which has been consolidated like a rock under our party's  leadership, as the most precious and further consolidate and  develop it.    We must break through difficulties at hand and score new  upsurges in socialist construction by more highly displaying the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle.    "Let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist onward  march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous  struggle!" This is the call of our party today and a militant  slogan that our people must uphold. [applause]    In hearty response to the party's militant call, all the  officials, party members, and workers must continue their  innovation and advance in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by  the speed of the nineties and, thus, make the New Year, 1994, a  historic year of turns in revolution and construction in our  country. [applause]    The fatherland's reunification is a foremost national task  to  our people that cannot be delayed even for a moment. We must  achieve the cause of the fatherland's reunification at the  earliest possible date, and thus, fulfill all the fellow  countrymen's unanimous earnest desire and hand the reunified  fatherland over to the posterity. [applause]    Our party and the Republic Government put forward the  10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for  reunification of the country in a bid to lay a foundation for  national reunification through the united national strength last  year and has made all efforts to realize the 10-point program.    Our 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for  reunification of the country reflects the 70 million fellow  countrymen's noble desire to firmly unite all people as one by  transcending the difference in ideology, ideas, and systems and  to achieve the reunification and prosperity of our nation who  has the long history of half a century.    We wanted the South Korean authorities to come out to the  road of reconciliation and cooperation by responding to our  10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for  reunification of the country. We also took the important measure  for exchanging special envoys of the two sides' top leaders.  However, the South Korean authorities have ignored our  magnanimous proposals and all the people's desire for  reunification. They have taken the road of depending upon  foreign forces, not the road of national independence; they have  taken the road to the North-South confrontation, not the road to  national unity.    While frequently conducting large-scale military exercises  against our Republic, in collusion with outside forces and  talking about military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] or an  international cooperation system under the pretext of our  nuclear issue, the South Korean authorities are leading  North-South relations to a dangerous phase.    The so-called South Korean civilian regime is only so in  appearance [houl ppunida], and is actually not different from  the preceding military dictatorial regime. Anticommunist and  fascist evil laws have remained as they are in South Korea. The  South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy, and  national reunification have not been realized. The South Korean  people and figures of all strata are saying that they no longer  have any further expectations of the current South Korean  regime. This is natural.    If I speak of our nuclear issue, which the United States and  its followers are babbling about, it is because of the  antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuver which the United States  has persistently sought.    It is the United States that raised the nonexistent nuclear  issue and brought the nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula  in actuality, thus threatening us. Therefore, the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through DPRK-U.S.  talks. Pressure and threat cannot work on us. If the United  States adheres to such methods, it cannot resolve the issue and  may drive the situation to a catastrophe [paguk]. The United  States should look straight at all facts and act with discretion.    Under the circumstances in which the DPRK-U.S. joint  statement was adopted, if the two sides abide by and implement  the principles which were already reached, the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula can be impartially resolved.    There is no change in the principle and line of our party  and  the Republic Government for national reunification. We will  make all efforts to achieve the national reunification by means  of a confederation based on one nation, one state, two systems,  and two governments according to the three-point principles of  independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national  unity.    The destiny of the fatherland is the destiny of the nation  and the destiny of all our compatriots at home and abroad. All  the Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas  should be united and wage a pannational struggle under the  banner of great unity of the whole nation in order to open a new  phase for national reunification this year. [applause]    Although the imperialists are raving about the end of  socialism in the international arena, indulging in bravado and  bluster, they cannot block the people's aspiration for  independence and socialism, nor can they reverse the trend of  history. If the world's progressive people strengthen unity and  solidarity under the anti-imperialist banner for independence  and actively push forward the trend of history, they will  certainly expedite mankind's bright future. [applause]    Our party and the government of the Republic will  consistently implement the external policy of independence,  peace, and friendship in conformity with the demand of the  present situation. We will make active efforts to maintain  unity with socialist and nonaligned countries on the principle  of independence. We will also develop good neighborly and  friendly relations with capitalist countries which respect our  country's sovereignty. [applause]    The government of our Republic will destroy the old  international political and economic order of domination and  subjugation, establish new international political and economic  order based on equality, justice, and fairness, and make active  efforts to develop South-South cooperation on the principle of  collective self-reliance.    Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is an  honorable and sacred struggle for the growth and prosperity of  our fatherland and for the future of mankind. Ever-victorious  are our people who struggle for the just cause under the great  party's leadership. [applause]    Let us all firmly unite around the party Central Committee  under the banner of the chuche idea and wage a vigorous struggle  to win new victory in socialist construction and to expedite the  independent and peaceful reunification of the country. [applause]</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 22  March.    Deputy Economy Minister Irma Toledo said on 10 March that,  based on a study by the Finance Ministry, the government would  have to allocate 700 million additional quetzales in 1994 to  grant public employees the 300 quetzales salary increase they  are demanding. Toledo stressed that: "Public employees have  been told that it is impossible to meet their demands because to  do so would mean setting aside social investments, which the  government is not willing to do." (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE  in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 94)    An official source said today that the Guatemalan monetary  authorities agreed to make the exchange system more flexible by  liberalizing the public sale of foreign exchange, which is  regulated by the Central Bank. Willy Zapata, president of the  Guatemalan Central Bank and the Monetary Board, indicated that  the new measure will go into effect on 17 March. Zapata  rejected the possibility that the measure will trigger an  increase in the exchange rate or a flight of foreign currency.  (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2305 GMT 15 Mar 94)</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As BELAPAN has learned, the 1,336th central tank  reserve base in Chavusy, Mahilyow Oblast, has been liquidated  four months ahead of a previously established deadline. Around  1,000 pieces of tank equipment have been transported by 24  trains to either the Barysaw tank repair plant for dismantlement  or temporarily to the 969th central tank reserve base in  Urechcha, Minsk Oblast.    Although the Chavusy base was initially scheduled to be  liquidated by 1 September 1994, the last three temporary-service  soldiers were released to the Reserves on 30 April.</p>

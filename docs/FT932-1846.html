			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: The Magic Flute - Maggio Musicale The final opera presented at the Maggio Musicale in Florence was a new production of The Magic Flute, an event of great artistic merit, the sort of evening that, alone, justifies the existence of a festival. In the warm, intimate Teatro della Pergola, the brilliantly inventive Julie Taymor designed and prepared a fanciful, but never arbitrary, staging that beguiled the eye and won the heart and, at the same time, set the spectator's mind to working. Two qualities especially distinguished Taymor's achievement: painstaking care (rehearsals must have been many and rigorous) and intelligent coherence. While every stage-picture, every movement, was magical, the whole concept followed a palpable internal logic. The airiness of the monsters - the long snake with large paper scales, handled by black-garbed assistants; the billowing kite in the form of a bear - was enchanted, but they also held a menace that was as real to the audience as it was to Papageno. There was no sign of the Disneyfication of the story, no cuteness; and the initiatory trials were genuinely awesome, just as the trial of Tamino and Pamina by separation and imposed silence was fraught with convincing pain. The noble sentiments of the libretto were not ignored, but rather underlined by the visual severity of the rituals. Julie Taymor's long stay in the Orient has enriched her producer's vocabulary immensely, and this Flute had not only Javanese and Chinese ingredients (discreet use of shadow figures), but also elements from Kabuki (Tamino, identifying himself as a prince, stamped his foot in a typical mie gesture) and - in the final encounter between Papageno and Papagena on a raised platform - a reference to Punch and Judy. But all these components were used naturally, as part of a universal and wondrously rich language of theatre. Fortunately, the singers were not only excellent musicians but also pliable actors, especially Manfred Hemm, a genial Papageno, who won laughter and applause without any hamming or any sacrifice of his attractive singing. Deon van der Walt was a sober, impassioned Tamino, and Matthias Hoelle, though the voice was not entirely even, made a noble Sarastro. Sumi Jo was an appropriately exotic, icy Queen of the Night, and - chief Italian representative in the cast - Mariella Devia was a Pamina of distinction, perhaps somewhat lacking in tenderness, but musically admirable and also natural in her movements. The three ladies (also Italian), superbly masked and costumed, performed with wit and style. The three boys (soloists from the Toelzer Knabenchor), chalk-white and silver-bearded, seemed truly to arrive from another world. The Monostatos of Sergio Bertocchi, shameless in his politically incorrect assertions, added a properly grotesque touch. After his sorely disappointing Carmen earlier in the festival, Zubin Mehta drew some good playing from the scaled-down Maggio orchestra, though - as in the Bizet - there was little flair or vitality, and at times, notably in Pamina's music, the conductor seemed to be dragging his feet. But any deficiency on the podium was forgotten in an otherwise thrilling, indeed unforgettable performance of this great, but often elusive, masterpiece.</p>

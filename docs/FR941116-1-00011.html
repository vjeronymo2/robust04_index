			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation, if promulgated, would significantly improve the effectiveness of VE in the Federal-aid highway program by requiring VE to be applied in all States, thereby ensuring that the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 106(d) are met. The regulation would provide nationwide application of VE to the FHWA's grant program in the same way that the FHWA's direct federally funded VE program is covered by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;131 (Revised June 8, 1993, 58 FR 32964 (June 14, 1993)). The OMB Circular A&hyph;131 requires ``Federal Departments and Agencies to use value engineering (VE) as a management tool, where appropriate, to reduce program and acquisition costs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Major Sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation would require States to establish, administer, and monitor VE programs. Each State would determine the administrative details of its VE program and institute VE program requirements to carry out the VE program. States would have up to 1 year from the effective date of the final rule to establish VE programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section-by-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.1&blank;Purpose and Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this regulation is to improve project quality and productivity, foster innovation, eliminate unnecessary and costly design elements, and ensure economical costs by requiring the application of VE in the design and construction of selected Federal-aid highway projects. The regulation would apply to contracts for early project development, design, and construction of selected projects funded with Federal-aid highway funds and may include studies of project elements, project procedures, specifications, and standard plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.3&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would define the VE terms of ``Function,'' ``Life-Cycle Cost,'' ``Total Quality Management,'' ``Value Engineering,'' ``Value Engineering Change Proposal,'' ``Value Engineering Incentive Clause,'' ``Value Engineering Job Plan,'' and ``Worth.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.5&blank;General Principles and Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would require States to establish VE programs which meet minimum VE program requirements and to develop procedures to administer and monitor their VE programs. This section would require States to be adequately staffed to effectively manage and monitor their VE programs, allow States to employ VE consultants to perform VE studies, and authorize the cost of the VE studies as eligible for Federal-aid participation. In addition, this section would require VE program staffs to receive VE training. Value engineering training is available through courses and workshops offered by the National Highway Institute (NHI), various VE consulting firms, and some SHAs with active VE programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.7&blank;Reports <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would require States to report to the FHWA the yearly results achieved through the application of VE to projects financed with Federal-aid highway funds. This information should be readily available from the SHA's internal tracking and documenting of its VE program. The FHWA is required to report certain data and other information about its VE program to the Department of Transportation (DOT), which then forwards the information to the OMB. The information provided in the State reports would provide the data and information needed for FHWA's report and would help the FHWA and States monitor the effectiveness of State VE programs. The information contained in the report will be made available to FHWA field offices and State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above will be considered and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address. Comments received after the docket closing date will be filed in the docket and will be considered to the extent practicable, but the FHWA may issue a final rule at any time after the close of the comment period. In addition to late comments, the FHWA will also continue to file relevant information in the docket as it becomes available after the closing date, and interested persons should continue to examine the docket for new material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

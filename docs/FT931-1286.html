			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Companies to be required to revalue assets regularly COMPANIES will be required to revalue regularly most of the assets shown in their accounts, under radical proposals issued yesterday by the body which sets accounting standards in the UK. They will need to show properties, quoted investments and commodities in their balance sheets at current values which are updated every few years, according to two documents from the Accounting Standards Board. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'The balance sheet does not make sense. This will reduce the scope for manipulation by companies and remove a lot of discretion.' He said he would like to see full revaluations of assets every five years, and 'desktop' or partial revaluations every year. The action will halt the practice by which companies can leave assets undervalued on their balance sheets by showing them at their original purchase price or historical cost. It will also hit companies with properties which they have revalued but which are now overvalued because of the slump in property prices. It is likely to generate opposition from companies during consultation in the coming months that revaluations will be costly and subjective. But a survey commissioned by the board last year showed that 70 per cent of companies already revalue operating properties and 83 per cent had done so within the past five years. The board's discussion document says the three options for valuation are to return to historical cost accounting, introduce full current values or address existing anomalies. The board favours the latter option, saying historical cost accounting would be regressive and full current values would be extremely costly and unlikely to gain support from companies. But in a separate draft chapter of the board's statement of principles - on which its standards are based - it calls ultimately for a move to regular revaluations of all assets and liabilities at the current value to the business. The statement also calls for the introduction of the concept of 'capital maintenance' which would reflect the true value of a company's capital over time. But Mr Tweedie said: 'This is the agenda for the unforeseeable future. At the moment we are just moving modestly to clean up the present system.' The role of valuation in financial reporting.

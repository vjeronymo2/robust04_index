"We highly estimate and support  your party which is invariably defending the socialist banner  and actively struggling for peace in Asia and the rest of the  world even under the difficult situation in which vicious moves  of the imperialists and reactionaries are going on unabated," he  noted.    Saying to struggle in unity to defend and advance the cause  of socialism in the present period is a common honorable duty  devolved on the progressive parties of all the countries by  history and the people, he stressed: "The WPK will in the  future, too, make positive efforts to strengthen and develop the  bonds of friendship, unity and solidarity with the Bangladesh  National Socialist Party."    General Secretary Hasanul Huq Inu in his speech said that  though the relations between the WPK and the BNSP were  established not long ago, these relations are becoming closer  for the commonness of their aim, idea and ideology. He affirmed  that the Bangladesh National Socialist Party would always stand  on the side of the Korean people.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il are making sincere efforts to realize the  reunification and denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, he  said, adding:    "We will express solidarity for the struggle of the Korean  people in the future, too."</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bethlehem Steel chief sees return to profit BETHLEHEM Steel expects to return to profitability in the third quarter of 1993, said Mr Curtis Barnette, the company's chairman, Reuter reports. The US group reported a second-quarter loss of Dollars 5.3m, or 18 cents a common share, an improvement over its year-earlier performance when it suffered a loss of Dollars 51.7m, or 76 cents. Revenues advanced to Dollars 1.12bn, from Dollars 1.01bn last time. Mr Barnette maintained that the results of a cost-cutting programme, achieving a satisfactory new labour agreement, better markets and achieving fair trade in steel 'will return Bethlehem to profitability in the third quarter of 1993.' 'We have continued to make steady and favourable progress in our return to sustained profitability,' he said. The company said its basic steel operations segment had income from operations of Dollars 11m for the quarter, a Dollars 29m improvement from the same period a year ago. It cited increased volume and cost reduction efforts at its two main mills as primary reasons for the improvement. Bethlehem said product mix was also better. Bethlehem said cash and cash equivalents totalled Dollars 205m at June 30, against Dollars 208m at December 31 1992. It added that significant uses of cash during the latest quarter included capital expenditures, pension funding and repayment of short-term borrowings. At June 30 this year, Dollars 294m was available for borrowing under a 1992 revolving credit agreement.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / ICI chief urges EC to boost economy EUROPE'S chemicals industry is heading for a serious crisis and the European Commission should introduce emergency measures across the continent to stimulate economic recovery, Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of the British companies Imperial Chemical Industries and Zeneca, warned yesterday. 'Politically, economically and chemically, the industry's performance has been depressingly poor,' Sir Denys admitted at yesterday's European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) annual general assembly in London. His warning came as Cefic forecast zero GDP growth in Europe this year, a 2.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output, a 0.5 per cent fall in chemical output, a 6 per cent fall in chemical industry investment, and a 3 per cent fall in chemical industry employment. Cefic said stocks were above normal and order books poor. Given weak demand prospects and excess capacity, there would be continued pressure on margins. Europe's chemical industry employs 2m people directly and generates sales of Ecu300bn (Pounds 236bn) a year, equivalent to 3 per cent of western Europe's GDP. Sir Denys called for a speedy end to the Gatt negotiations on world trade liberalisation. He said no measures should be introduced by the EC Commission that weakened Europe's competitive position. He singled out proposals for a carbon tax, which he said would be particularly unhelpful. To a large extent, self-inflicted and unnecessary pricing wounds had caused a collapse in financial performance, he said.</p>

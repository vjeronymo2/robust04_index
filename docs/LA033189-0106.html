			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERATION MAY HAVE PROVED FATAL TO MUSLIM CLERIC  </P> <P> The shy, bespectacled leader of Sunni Muslims in three countries, Abdullah  Ahdal was no fanatic. Indeed, he demonstrated his moderate beliefs in his  private life. He often wore Western suits and met regularly with Western  diplomats. He even sent his children to Roman Catholic schools rather than to  one of the several Islamic academies here.  </P> <P> That moderation may have been the death of him, Belgian authorities said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Ahdal, 36, and an assistant, Salim Behir, 40, were shot and killed Wednesday  night in the office of the city's largest mosque, and Belgian officials said  the professional killings were almost certainly linked to his position on the  controversy surrounding author Salman Rushdie and his book, "The Satanic  Verses."  </P> <P> A police spokesman revealed Thursday that Ahdal, spiritual head of the mosque  and of Muslims throughout Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, began  receiving death threats March 24 after he made a series of moderate public  statements regarding the Iranian death sentence against Rushdie.  </P> <P> In a recent television appearance, for example, Ahdal had criticized Rushdie's  novel, which many Muslims regard as blasphemous and insulting to their  religion. But he said he was opposed to the call on Muslims by Iran's Shiite  Muslim leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to kill the author and everyone  connected with publishing and selling the novel.  </P> <P> "We live here in a democratic country," said Ahdal, a native of Saudi Arabia,  "where each person has the right to say and think and express themselves as  they want."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Represented Mainstream  </P> <P> In this, Ahdal represented the attitudes of the moderate mainstream here, a  mostly Sunni Muslim community.  </P> <P> Except for a brief flurry of activity during anti-U.S. demonstrations in 1986,  after the American bombing raids on Libya, there has been little evidence of a  significant fundamentalist Muslim presence here.  </P> <P> "I can't believe these killings were done by Belgian Muslims," said Yohan  Leman, an anthropologist and expert on the North African Arab communities in  Brussels. "I think the killers had to come from outside."  </P> <P> Brussels has one of the largest concentrations of Muslim immigrants in Europe,  more than 150,000 out of a population of 1 million. North African women in  scarfs and ballooning pants stroll the cobblestone streets of several sprawling  neighborhoods. Mustachioed Turkish men drink mud-like coffee in all-male cafes.  More than 30 mosques call the faithful to prayer.  </P> <P> In some neighborhoods, such as Sant-Josse near the headquarters of the European  Commission and Molenbeek on the western side of the city center, Arabs and  Turks exceed more than 50% of the population. Forty percent of the births in  Brussels now occur in these immigrant families. In some areas, 65% of the  school children are immigrants.  </P> <P> The Muslim community reacted with shock, rage and tears to the slayings  Thursday.  </P> <P> "Nearly everyone was weeping during the evening prayers," said Abdullah Amid,  one of the worshipers at the tiny El Azhar mosque in the mostly Moroccan  Sant-Josse. "Those not showing tears outside were weeping inside with wounded  hearts."  </P> <P> "The killings were a shameful stupidity," said Arab taxi driver Achour  Derkaoui. "What they did was against the teachings of the Koran."  </P> <P> Ahdal was a respected, if not widely known figure in the community. He spoke  classical Arabic and no French, which limited his access to the Arab immigrants  from North Africa. However, he was the only Muslim leader officially recognized  by the Belgian government, and he was directly involved in Muslim education in  the state-supported schools, which have included instruction about Islam in  their curriculum since 1975.  </P> <P> On this level, Ahdal will be sorely missed as an arbitrator between the Muslim  community and the government.  </P> <P> However, his relatively liberal ideas were not universally acclaimed in the  community. A petition against his stance on Rushdie had drawn nearly 300  signatures. On the eve of his assassination, he met with other Muslim leaders,  including a former religion education director at the mosque, to hear their  criticism of his position.  </P> <P> After the telephone threats against Ahdal's life, a police official said, a  "discreet surveillance" was placed around the large World Islamic League mosque  in the city's Cinquantenaire Park. Ahdal, his wife and six children lived in an  apartment attached to the mosque.  </P> <P> Officials could not explain how a lone assassin using a 7.65-millimeter pistol  managed to slip into the mosque and kill Ahdal and librarian Behir, first  firing into the nape of the neck and then into each man's temple. The killer  escaped undetected shortly after evening prayers Wednesday.  </P> <P> "In the wake of the assassination," Deputy Prime Minister Willy Claes said in a  press conference Thursday, "protection measures have been immediately  increased. Police have been asked to make preventive patrols to assure the  necessary protection to the Islamic community and contribute to the peace of  mind in that community."  </P> <P> But crude graffiti painted on the walls of a monument adjacent to the mosque  illustrated the underlying tension that exists here between the Muslim  community and many native Belgians.  </P> <P> "Arabs Have Four Paws," said one of the painted slogans. "Arabs Go to Mecca!"  said another.  </P> <P> For many Muslims, the killings raise fears that the rest of Brussels'  population, including native Bruxellois and other immigrants, will become even  more resentful and fearful of their Muslim neighbors.  </P> <P> "The killings have augmented the tension that already existed here," said  Haslaoui Rabah, 37, director of a Brussels Arabic-language radio station. "They  had the effect of pouring gasoline on the fire."  </P></p>

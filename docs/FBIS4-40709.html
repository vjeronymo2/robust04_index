			<p>BFN     [Text] Kharkov -- At a news conference for local  journalists on 16 June, Leonid Kuchma, a candidate for president  of Ukraine, expressed the opinion that Ukrainian society is  continuing to live under socialism, that the state is to be  found on the brink of a national catastrophe,  deindustrialization of the country is occurring, it is being  turned into a raw materials appendage, and it is sliding toward  an African path of development.    In the event of his election as president, Leonid Kuchma  considers his most important steps to be resolving issues of  taxation policy, the revocation of a fixed currency exchange  rate, getting banking, credit, and financial activity going, and  resolving the non-payments problem. In Kuchma's opinion, one  should conduct forced small privatization and return currency  from abroad. The candidate for the post of president believes  that land and all means of production should become goods in  future, but if one were to declare land to be goods now, one  could end up with nothing.    Once again Leonid Kuchma expressed himself against the  election of a prime minister before the presidential election,  and noted that although he considers Vitaliy Masol to be an  experienced individual, Masol's present views are not known, and  on the whole he considers "all of this" to be "a dangerous game."    At the news conference, Leonid Kuchma renounced some of the  assertions he made during his previous meeting with  representatives of the nonstate sector of the economy.</p>

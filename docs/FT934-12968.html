			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Warnings on housing scheme - A look at the latest batch of BES offerings A BUSINESS expansion scheme called Housing the Homeless, which says it aims to offer accommodation in the East Anglian area, has sparked warnings from other parts of the BES industry. The Peabody Trust, which has launched a string of successful house-the-homeless BES companies in association with Downing Corporate Finance, has said in a statement that neither body has any relationship with the new BES. The Allenbridge Group, publishers of Best BES Advice, adds in its latest bulletin: 'We have a number of very serious concerns about this issue, and would advise extreme caution. 'We are principally concerned that the option agreement prejudices the tax qualifying status. Moreover, we have seen no financial information on the guarantor whatsoever. Be careful.' The Investment Analysis bulletin, published by the Briish Taxpayers Association, says of the new scheme: 'The prospectus makes a number of claims . . . We are not convinced . . . these claims will be met. Furthermore, numerous inconsistencies appear in the documentation. Avoid.' The 'helpline' telephone number for the BES was regularly engaged yesterday. Accountant Moores Rowland is warning investors not to make hasty decisions on any investment as the demise of the BES in December approaches. Partner Robin Stevens says: 'With the scheme coming to an end, there is bound to be considerable interest in the final period. But it would be a big mistake to jump at anything offered - careful consideration is needed.' The present round of BES companies, which have arranged exits and cash backing, are very different from the early ones which were highly risky, small start-up companies. Johnson Fry, sponsor of a large number of issues in the late 1980s, has been criticised for the number of its companies which went bust. Problems have emerged recently at Quality Coaching Inns and on the Fantom and Fast BES issues. Chairman Charles Fry says that of 100 old-style BES issues up to January 1992, 28 per cent failed, accounting for 25.5 per cent of the money raised. He says, however, that this is a lower proportion than might be expected for similar venture capital schemes, and the risks were made clear at the time. Johnson Fry is still active in the BES market and this week sees the launch of another housing-the-homeless scheme, the Twelfth Johnson Super Growth. It is a Pounds 5m, contracted-exit, assured tenancy scheme from Acton Housing Association, in association with the London Borough of Harrow, and offers an exit price of 121p after five years - equivalent to 13.93 per cent net for higher rate taxpayers. But the scheme is not cash-backed. The Countrywide Rentals Second Growth Scheme is another Johnson Fry BES, backed by the Leeds &amp; Holbeck building society, which aims to raise Pounds 7m to buy mostly repossessed residential properties from the L&amp;H. It offers higher-rate tax-paying investors a return of 13.51 per cent net via a non-status, non-recourse loan at 117p per share (assuming subscription at 99p before November 12) after the end of the five-year period. It also offers investors 50 per cent of any extra gains if property prices rise substantially. BESSA North of England is a contracted-exit scheme with an FT-SE option from Close Brothers and the North of England building society. It aims to raise Pounds 10m to buy residential properties, to be let on assured tenancies. Investors can choose between a fixed return of 120p a share or a Footsie investment with a lock-in once the index has grown by 24 per cent - or a combination of the two. Warwickshire Select is an assured tenancy scheme, involving two companies, from Berkeley Fund Managers. There is no arranged exit, but the managers say their aim is to ensure investors receive at least Pounds 1.50 a share after six years.</p>

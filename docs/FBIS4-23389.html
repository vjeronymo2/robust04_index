			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Liberia's Transitional Assembly [TA] flexed its  muscles this week, and called on the rival factions to come  before it and explain why they were still fighting each other,  and why the disarmament process was in disarray and at a virtual  standstill. There have been continuing battles between rival  wings of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in  Liberia], with Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces driven out of  their headquarters at Tubmaburg by Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn  troops. Flare-ups have continued between Charles Taylor's NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and the Armed Forces of  Liberia, AFL, and the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and the UN are increasingly  exasperated. Well, the factions did send representatives to the  TA yesterday, and it seems some were eager to shift the blame.  From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report:    At the meeting were Alhaji Koromah, leader of ULIMO's  Mandingo faction; Hezekiah Bowen, chief of the AFL; and John  Richardson, who was representing Charles Taylor's NPFL.  Richardson told the assembly that the reluctance to disarm is a  result of the failure of the transition government to assert  itself in Liberia. General Bowen of the AFL said his fighters  were delaying disarmament due to advancement on their positions  by the NPFL, especially in the Harbel area. He said the AFL is  ready to disarm as soon as the NPFL withdraws to its original  positions. Alhaji Koromah said the ongoing war between the  Krahn and Mandingo factions of ULIMO was preventing his fighters  from laying down their arms.    Meanwhile, for the first time since the ULIMO conflict broke  out, the leader of the Krahn faction, Roosevelt Johnson, has  travelled out of Monrovia to Tubmanburg. ULIMO's Krahn faction  captured Tubmanburg from the Mandingo faction a few days ago.  Johnson is expected to set up an administrative structure in  Tubmanburg. UN sources here confirm that Johnson's motorcade  drove into the city amidst cheers from his Krahn fighters. A  local journalist who travelled with Johnson said bodies littered  the outskirts of the city. He said the city center was  completely deserted, and that homes of Alhaji Koromah and some  of his key commanders had been blown up by rocket-propelled  grenades.</p>

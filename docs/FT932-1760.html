			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bad weather may reduce Russian grain harvest RUSSIA'S 1993 grain harvest may fall below last year's because bad weather delayed spring sowing in some regions, government officials said, reports Reuter from Moscow. 'The sowing is almost finished. But in some regions in Siberia and eastern Russia it is behind schedule because of rains and cold weather,' said Mr Vladimir Kotov, aide to Mr Vladimir Shcherbak, the first deputy agriculture minister. 'Due to bad weather, it's possible that the grain harvest in 1993 may be slightly below 1992 levels,' he said. 'Early autumn rains may cause damage in some areas but it's too early to say.' Russia harvested 106.8m tonnes of grain in 1992, when imports were 26m tonnes. Imports in 1993 were forecast sharply lower at 16m tonnes by Mr Alexander Zaveryukha, deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture, last week. Mr Kotov said it was too early to forecast this year's yield. There was an acute shortage of fertilisers, he added, but Russia had enough diesel and aviation fuel for crop-spraying aircraft. Mr Kotov dismissed reports that up to five million hectares of farmland could be damaged by the worst locust invasion in five decades. 'Locusts are not a threat this year,' he said. 'We are not concerned.' He estimated the winter grain harvest this year at about 40m tonnes, compared with 42.1m tonnes in 1992.</p>

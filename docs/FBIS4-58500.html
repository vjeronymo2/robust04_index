			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 4 May (JANA) -- The JANA political editor  has commented on Yasir 'Arafat and Rabin, the prime minister of  the enemy, the terrorist, signing in Cairo today the document on  the implementation of the so-called Gaza-Jericho Agreement.    He said: What should be emphasized first is that Palestine  is  part of the great Arab homeland which was exposed to foreign  settler occupation, and that Zionist Israeli racism, which gave  concrete expression to this occupation, is endeavoring to occupy  extensive parts of the Arab homeland. This is a fact which is  not born of inference, since these Israeli settlers have written  it in prominent letters on the door of the so-called Israeli  Knesset, in a phrase saying: Your land, O Israel, from the  Euphrates to the Nile.    Second, awareness of this fact and of its dangers and  dimensions inevitably leads one to say that the security and  stability of the region cannot be guaranteed without the removal  of this colonial settler racist entity and the establishment of  a democratic state in the region, after the return of the  invaders to the countries from which they came.    If this is not achieved, the Arab presence in its entirety  will be threatened and the survival of all Arabs in their  homeland from the ocean to the Gulf will be doubtful. The Arabs  will remain in the range of Israeli nuclear bombs and weapons of  mass destruction and exposed to destruction by these weapons.    The editor adds that this is a reality that cannot be hidden  by persistent acts of deception, pressure, and obliging people  signing worthless conventions. All this remains an illusion and  a waste of time, and does not resolve the problem. The solution  will never be achieved without the return of the Palestinian  homeless to their own land, their homes, farms, and shops, the  return of the foreigners to their countries of origin, from  where they had come, and by removing the threat and danger from  the Arab region, which constitute the main element of tension in  the region.    If at the present stage the superpowers are making their  potentials available to lead the Arabs to recognize  falsification, forgery, and lies, all this will remain  temporary. Our advice to these superpowers is to bear true  historic responsibility in order to secure a genuine solution to  the problem by bearing the cost of the return of the Palestinian  refugees to their country, Palestine, and the return of the  alien jews to their origins. Everything else is an exercise in  lies and forgery. If the U.S. Government is serious in seeking  a genuine peace it must bear this responsibility.    The editor affirms that neither this generation nor the  coming generations of Arabs and Muslims will recognize the right  of a settlement-based racist invasion on a single inch of their  country, or a single grain of dust, and they will continue to  fight until doomsday for their own right.</p>

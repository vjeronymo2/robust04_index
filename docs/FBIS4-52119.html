			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Malaysian International Trade and Industry </F> Minister Rafidah Aziz by Yang Razali Kassim in Kuala Lumpur;  date not given]    [Text] BUSINESS TIMES: What is the origin of the  informal retreat [of ASEAN economic ministers in Awana,  Malaysia]?    Mrs. Rafidah: When we have our structured meeting every  year, the agenda is already set. We don't have enough time to  discuss in- depth the long-term vision for Asean. So when we  met last year in Singapore, we agreed that we should have one  informal meeting, minus the rigmarole of formality, even without  officers.    Because Asean economic ministers have achieved a very high  degree of personalised relationships, I am very happy to note  the frankness and forthrightness of our discussions.    Q: And what are the instances of this frankness?    A: For example, why some countries are not able to offer  some products for tariff cuts. Explanations were given as to  why some countries took action to raise tariffs for some  products, like Malaysia did. We gave our reasons, so there  would be greater understanding. And there were many things that  we agreed to do to solve some of the irritations among Asean  members in the area of trade.    Most importantly, this sort of meeting provides the  ministers  with the possibility to filter down to officers certain policy  decisions for the future. In the past, it was down-up.  Officers make a suggestion and the ministers take it up. In  this case, the ministers look at it, decide what is best for  Asean, and ask the officers to fine-tune.    Q: We notice some countries are not as ready as others  to cut tariffs in some areas.    A: This is where the reasons are discussed. We all agreed  that while we understand (why some are not ready to cut  tariffs), we must now go back and look closer at the reasons.  Some of the reasons are not very valid; they just simply are  the lobby tactics of industries which want long-term protection.  For those that have no valid economic reasons, we told our  counterparts: "Please see to it that you review this."    Q: Within Asean, the bigger countries have different  speeds of development such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and  Thailand. Being bigger, they need more time to adjust to the  demands of the new World Trade Organisation (WTO). Did this  fact create any problems in reaching a consensus on how to  improve Afta [ASEAN Free Trade Area] at the Awana meeting?    A: Not really. It's just that, in the past, each Asean  country volunteered to offer tariff cuts in certain products.  Now we have fine-tuned that.    We say, let's determine the common products. Let's say  product A, B, C are available in all countries. We take those  products, see if we can harmonise tariffs on them, see if we can  reduce these tariffs together so that there is no inequitable  treatment of domestic industries. Previously, you offered what  you could. And then we haggled.    Q: Is it true that Afta has been slow, to the extent  that there is a need to quicken the Afta process?    A: No, Afta is not slow. The Afta schedule has been such  that it is not due to begin until now because we announced it  last November, and we chose it to be such.    But now we say, harmonise our tariffs, bring them down at  the  same time -- within a shorter period. If we can do this for  products in the fast track of Afta, we can do the same for  products in the normal track. Eventually the net effect is that  Afta will be realised in less than 15 years (as originally  scheduled).    The fast track is eight years now; the old normal track is  15. If we can make both categories go faster, naturally the net  effect will be a faster rate. So we have deliberately not set  any dates and time frame. We want business to look at our  products first and let it (the process) evolve so that in a year  or two, you will see that there are no more products that will  go beyond 10 or 11 years.    Q: So there will be no specific time frame now?    A: At the moment, no. We've asked them (the officials) to  look into it. But eventually when the officers have fine-tuned  the products list, we may be able to come up with a schedule  that reflects a rapid actualisation of Afta.    Q: And that rapid pace will have to be consistent with  the WTO's programme?    A: No, not necessarily. What we want to do is to make our  Afta tariff cuts better than our tariff cuts that were committed  under the Uruguay Round. How can it be better? If we  multilaterally (at GATT) offered 10 percent cuts in our tariffs,  we should offer 5  percent (more) to ourselves. That means the Asean Free Trade  Area  has got better tariffs than with the rest of the world. That's  the  target.    Q: But, at the moment, we do not see any consensus  on a shortening of the Afta process or a "strengthening" of  it.    A: We all agreed that, after the joint press conference (at  Awana, Genting Highlands on April 23), individual ministers will  make their announcements. So, wait for a few more days.    Q: What are the problems faced in the implementation  of Afta?    A: One basic problem is the harmonisation of customs codes,  which is a strengthening of the Afta process. Then you have  preshipment problems. And the problem of standards. But what  we face is an administrative problem. Most of them have to do  with (the inconsistency in) customs nomenclatures.    Q: So the fundamental problem is an administrative  one, and that is holding back Afta?    A: Not holding back, but constraining the free flow of trade  using the CEPT (Afta's Common Effective Preferential Tariffs  scheme). Trade can still happen, but if you use the CEPT, there  are concessions. You enjoy tariff cuts.    Q: So if the proposal at Awana is adopted, there will  be no more need for any CEPT fast track in Afta?    A: No. The fast track will still continue. What we can do  is to include more items on the fast track, increase the items  on the normal track, and shorten the time for the normal track  and the fast track to be brought down to the lowest possible  tariff levels. That's all we need to do. The fast track will be  there, except that it will be faster. The normal track will  also be faster. That's the net effect that we hope to see  eventually after the study by the SEOM (Senior Economic  Officials Meeting).    Q: Except that there will be no specific time frame  for the faster Afta?    A: Well, if the SEOM suggests a time frame, why not? But at  Awana, we did not set that. Unless within the next few days you  hear something else, it will be safe to say that all of us are  agreed that Afta will have to be made more real.    Q: The CEPT will now be expanded to include new  elements such as raw agricultural products and services?    A: Yes. Raw agriculture is a very new element. It is a  very important decision. Many of us are agriculture-based. If  we can find common agricultural products that can be subjected  to one harmonised tariff, and at the second stage, to tariff  cuts to zero or to the lowest level -- at the same time -- then  we should do it first.    Q: What's the significance of the proposed framework  of cooperation in the services sector, which the ministers  agreed to introduce?    A: The services sector is being looked at now because  services have become important in global trading. The  significance of the proposed framework is that in the past,  we've had suggestions mooted by the various (Asean) committees.  Many of these were not followed up. Yet there is room and  potential for cooperation in transportation, tourism,  professional services, and also in financial services.    Q: So, basically, the idea is to open up the area of  services to each other?    A: Selected ones. Those which will not cause dislocation  for domestic services and industries. We haven't identified  them. The senior officials will look at it in greater detail.    Q: Do you anticipate some problems here, resistance  from some industries?    A: Yes, that's why the senior officials have been asked to  study it. So, we have to identify areas of least difficulty and  move them first.    Q: What is the likelihood of this frame work being  adopted?    A: Very likely. The framework will be discussed in greater  detail in September. What we hope to do is to have this  framework, if it is feasible, ready for the (Asean) leaders  meeting next year.    Q: Was there any reservation on the part of the other  countries?    A: What we have announced was based on consensus. We took  note of reservations, but conceptually there was a consensus to  have this studied. The formal decisions, one way or the other,  will be made at the structured meetings. The next one is in  September.</p>

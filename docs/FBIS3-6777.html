			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aung Zaw] </F>   [Text] At noon, the riot police began to enter Rangoon  University while Burmese army troops surrounded the campus,  easily crushing the peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations.  Female students ran to escape arrest, but they were caught by  police and beaten. As the women began sobbing and crying, the  situation became like hell. In the evening, about 1,000 students  were taken to Insein prison.    It was March 17, 1988, the beginning of what has become  known  as the democracy uprising in Burma. Quickly, Rangoon became a  ghosttown: Martial law was imposed, as shooting, street  demonstrations and fighting between riot police and civilians  continued.    On March 18, about 70 people suffocated to death in a prison  van. In the evening, thousands of people were rounded up and  thrown into jail yet another hell. Children, mostly Muslims, as  well as many other civilians were beaten to death in prison.    "Fear in Burma is increasing," said a foreign journalist who  was lucky enough to get a visa to Burma recently. Some  observers and diplomats have noted lately that it seems that the  State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) countrywide  intimidation campaign has been successful.    Even with this grim observation the next few months offer  many occasions for commemorating the 1988 uprising and the  important events that followed. While it is a sure bet that  SLORC will not allow any public display of solidarity, some  Burmese in Rangoon and other major cities are expecting  "something to happen", according to a source.    An activist in Rangoon recently said, "We are hoping for  change because we are fed up with SLORC." He said that by  change he meant, "pressure from outside and inside." Many  Butmese, indeed, are dreaming about "outside pressure" since  they realise that they cannot fight the cruel armed forces. In  particular, many Burmese were expecting the UN or one of the  superpowers to respond with tough action against the Burmese  military during the uprising of 1988.    Even with attempts to apply pressure by the international  community the Burmese military is still allowed to terrorise and  to purge all opponents. Six years after the nationwide street  demonstrations, killings and violence, Burma is like a dormant  volcano which can explode anytime.    Rangoon resident Hla Htun said "We feel very depressed about  the current situation but are always encouraged by Daw Suu [Aung  San Suu Kyi]. What we need is encouragement." He criticised  SLORC's General Secretary, Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, for recently  refusing to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi. Khin Nyunt turned down  a proposal by U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson to hold a  dialogue with the detained leader.    Another Rangoon resident, Aung Myint, said Khin Nyunt's  decision had "crushed people's hopes", adding, however, that he  and others are still hoping that "SLORC may see the light in the  end. Aung San Suu Kyi is still the strongest leader we have."    Though it is not known what the remamlng opposltion groups  are planning at the SLORC-sponsored National Convention, the  National League for Democracy (NLD), winner of the 1990  elections, is still opposed to SLORC's proposal to give the  armed forces a leading role in the constitution, an inside  source reported.    According to the source, people in Rangoon are not told what  is happening at the convention, but "some of SLORC's hand-picked  delegates also feel guilty because they know they are lying like  SLORC and that the ordinary Burmese do not have faith in the  convention."    While SLORC is forcing delegates to the convention to accept  what SLORC wants, it has meanwhile been reaching cease-fire  agreements with the armed ethnic groups that have been fighting  for autonomy for more than four decades.    As these agreements do not really guarantee peace for Burma,  it may be that SLORC is just testing the waters. The ethnic  groups are tired of war and are seeking peace, but different  circumstances among the armed groups have led to these  cease-fire talks.    Some groups, for instance, the Karen and the Mon, are being  forced to make peace with SLORC through pressure from  neighbouring countries. Even the peace agreement between the  Kachin Independence Organisation (KI0) and SLORC, which was  formally signed in Myitkyina last month, has an uncertain future.    At the signing ceremony, which was broadcast by Burmese  television, Lt Gen Khin Nyunt was still using the term of  "coming back to the legal fold" in referring to the KIO. This  certainly did not go down well with some Kachin leaders. Later,  Maj-Gen Zau Mai, vice-chairman of the KI0, said at the ceremony  that although both parties were agreeing to sign the cease-fire  agreement, it would be possible for the KI0 to return to its  armed struggle if the peace process falls.    As it is, the people in the tea shops, markets, pagodas,  factories, and schools who were active in the prodemocracy  movement in 1988 and the following years are still waiting for  true democratic change. These people can become street-fighters  again at anytime. For this reason, fear is increasing in Burma,  not only among ordinary people, but also within SLORC itself.    According to well-informed sources, Matriculation students  staged a brief protest against the SLORC after sitting for the  final exams in mathematics in Rangoon early this month. The  students dispersed before the authorities arrived, the sources  said. There were no arrests reported.    Burma did have a parliamentary democracy before 1962, and  there was even a short-lived democracy in August-September 1988,  but SLORC's leaders considered these only as "disturbances."    It does not matter what the medieval Burmese military  dictatorship thinks about democracy, most Burmese will continue  to believe that democracy and freedom are essential for Burma.    Recently, a U.S. State Department spokesman hinted that the  Clinton administration may push for an international arms  embargo against SLORC and may put pressure on SLORC's leaders to  open a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi by appointing a special UN  envoy to Burma. These long overdue moves by the U.S. may be the  "encouragement" that Hla Htun and so many other Burmese  desperately need.</p>

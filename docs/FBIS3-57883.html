			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has declared that if  Glavkos Kliridhis, Greek Cypriot Administration leader,  sincerely wants to solve the Cyprus problem, then he should  immediately put an end to armament activities, border  provocations, the hostile policy pursued in the international  arena, and the embargoes. Kliridhis must also accept the  proposal repeatedly put forward by the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus [TRNC] for signing a nonaggression treaty, Atun  added.    Atun issued a written statement regarding the  demilitarization proposal -- which Kliridhis will reportedly  submit to the NATO summit meeting -- as well as the recent  shooting incidents against Turkish Cypriot positions. Atun  remarked that this attitude is aimed at turning the Cyprus  problem, which is an intercommunal issue, into an international  one. He described Kliridhis' proposal as a stale tactic  designed to eliminate the guarantee and alliance agreements,  apply international pressure on motherland Turkey, and undermine  the intercommunal negotiating process.    Atun stressed that the fact that the Cyprus issue is not an  international problem and that it is an intercommunal problem  between the two communities on the island and not one between  Turkey and Cyprus as claimed by the Greek Cypriot side, has been  acknowledged by the United Nations and confirmed in the summit  agreements. The prime minister underlined that Turkey is not an  occupation force as charged by Kliridhis, but a guarantor state,  that instituted peace by preventing the attempts to achieve  enosis on the part of the Greek-Greek Cypriot pair, which  destroyed the legitimate order, occupied the Cyprus Republic  through the use of force, and massacred the Turkish Cypriot  people.    Atun stated that if Kliridhis is sincere in his quest for a  solution, then he must accept these facts and stop his efforts  to stage cheap shows, to further complicate the issue by  dragging it into the international arena, and to hinder the  basis for negotiations.    Strongly protesting the shooting incidents against Turkish  Cypriot fighters yesterday, Atun announced that the TRNC  Government will adopt the necessary measures against these  senseless provocations aimed at disrupting the peace, which has  prevailed on the island for 20 years, within the framework of  its right to legitimate defense.</p>

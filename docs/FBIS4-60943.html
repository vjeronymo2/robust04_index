			<p>BFN     [Text] On 29 April Georgian Head of State Eduard  Shevardnadze made a brief visit to western Georgia. Here is  Mikhail Mamulashvili reporting from Tbilisi:    [Mamulashvili] The main aim of Eduard Shevardnadze's visit  to  the western part of the republic was the desire to see for  himself the state of affairs in the regions. This time, the  head of state visited two rayons - Zugdidskiy and  Tsalendzhikhskiy - which until recently were at the center of  the Zviadist movement.    You will recall that it was here that the main events during  the armed confrontation between government troops and armed  supporters of the ex-president took place. The last time  Shevardnadze was in Tsalendzhikha was two years ago. Back then  he was obliged to endure reproaches and insults from people who  considered Zviad Gamsakhurdia the only legitimate leader of the  country.    On 29 April, things were different. The press service of the  Georgian head of state informed me that Shevardnadze was given  the warm welcome typically accorded by the inhabitants of that  region. He met with the inhabitants of Tsalendzhikha, the heads  of the local administration, representatives of the  intelligentsia and local workers.    Speaking to the inhabitants of Tsalendzhikha, Shevardnadze  stressed that Georgia is now going through a bad patch. We want  to build a democratic state and that's why we all have to work  instead of sitting down with our arms folded.    Touching on the situation in Abkhazia -- and inhabitants of  Tsalendzhikha are particularly anxious about this question since  their rayon borders Abkhazia and there are a large number of  refugees in Tsalendzhikha itself -- Shevardnadze said that all  matters and problems connected with that region would in all  probability be solved in the near future.    The head of state was accompanied on his trip to western  Georgia by Vakhtang Goguadze, speaker of the Georgian  parliament, Prime Minster Otar Patatsia, and other officials.</p>

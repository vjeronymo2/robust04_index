			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 8 June (MTI) -- "The new Socialist-led  government should not expect any days of grace as there are too  many problems to solve," Laszlo Bekesi, the Socialist party's  top economic expert, said in Wednesday's [8 June] issue of the  economic and financial daily NAPI GAZDASAG. The Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP) won an absolute majority in the May  general elections.    "First, we have to try to stop financial balances from  critically deteriorating in 1994," he said, adding that inland  economic processes provide little chance for this. A  supplementary budget should be presented to the new Parliament  in order to prevent deficits from exceeding the level already  expected for 1994, Bekesi added.    The financial expert deemed it even more important to halt a  further deficit increase in the country's current payment  budget. "The situation is rather critical. This year's deficit  is expected to amount to $3-4 billion," he said.    It would not be expedient to raise or lower the real value  of  the forint, Bekesi said. However, its nominal revaluation is a  different matter. Since the forint is regularly revaluated due  to the gap between Hungarian inflation and the inflation in  other countries belonging to the currency basket, the nominal  devaluation of the forint is unavoidable. But it will not reach  the 10-20 percent rate rumored by the press, he told NAPI  GAZDASAG.    Privatization should be made more effective, with techniques  which completely stop or alter further frauds, Bekesi said.  Moreover, capital-raising privatization should be launched which  primarily concerns banks and major public utility works. The  new government aims to increase investments by a more favorable  taxation system, Bekesi said.    Regarding agriculture tasks, the economics expert said that  smashing up cooperatives should be ceased. Privatization must  be completed as soon as possible, and the economic and legal  foundations of uniting an atomized ownership structure should be  laid. Sensible measures need to be implemented which protect  the interests of the agricultural market, and are not  discriminatory against Hungary's obligations undertaken in  agreements with the European Union (EU) and the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Bekesi said.    The acceleration of concessions for major infrastructure  projects (i.e. motorway and railway construction, and  telecommunications) would also result in economic growth, Bekesi  continued. Hungary's economy would be promoted if it were to  open up again towards Eastern European markets, obviously  beginning with barters, he said.    "The new government wishes to improve conditions for direct  foreign investment. Here we consider re-establishing normative  tax allowances, Bekesi said. We intend to liberalize the  purchase of real estate -- excluding land -- to enable  foreigners to purchase flats, houses, or shops in Hungary. The  same measures cannot be applied to arable land as there is no  market for land, therefore current land prices are not  realistic."    Bekesi also said that he deemed it expedient to revise  certain points in the association agreement between Hungary and  the EU. "The conditions set forth in the agreement for Hungary's  agricultural, textile, steel, and metallurgical products are  unfavorable, nor does the agreement cover conditions for a free  flow of the work force; instead it leaves regulation of the  issue up to bilateral agreements. These are the points that  will surely have to be rediscussed. Additionally, conditions  for penetration into the international market should be also  improved," Bekesi told NAPI GAZDASAG.</p>

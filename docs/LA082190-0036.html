			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHANNEL ISLANDS AIR NATIONAL GUARD UNIT GEARS UP FOR POSSIBLE CALL TO THE  MIDEAST  </P> <P> The base commander of an Air National Guard unit that recently moved from Van  Nuys to Ventura County has put 1,400 active duty and reserve personnel on a  "heightened state of awareness" in preparation for a possible call to the  Middle East.  </P> <P> "We have been advising our people to get their personal affairs in order," said  Col. Daniel H. Pemberton, commander of the Channel Islands Air National Guard  Base adjacent to Point Mugu. "We have been getting our recall rosters in order  and we have been taking inventory of all our personnel and supplies."  </P> <P> Pemberton said the National Guard unit, which includes a fleet of 16 C-130  Hercules transport planes, has not been put on any special standby status or  heightened state of readiness. "But prudence dictates that we gear up for what  might be coming," he said.  </P> <P> Over the weekend, President Bush began preparing to act on a Pentagon request  for permission to call up as many as 150,000 members of the National Guard and  other reserve units to meet critical shortages of support troops in the Persian  Gulf.  </P> <P> The principal mission of the Channel Islands guard unit, which moved from Van  Nuys in March, and most of whose members live in Ventura and Los Angeles  counties, is to haul military cargo. The base's 146th Tactical Airlift Wing has  16 C-130 Hercules transport planes designed to carry military supplies and  troops relatively short distances.  </P> <P> The Channel Islands base also has a military police unit, a civilian  engineering unit for emergency construction, a 170-member air medical  evacuation unit and an air medical tactical hospital of about 50 personnel  qualified to administer medical aid in the field.  </P> <P> Combat operations are not new to the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing, which  provided air support in the Korean and Vietnam wars. More recently, a portion  of the wing was used in the military mission to topple Panamanian leader Manuel  Noriega.  </P> <P> The guard unit moved 1,647 passengers and more than 363 tons of cargo in that  operation, which won high praise from other U.S. forces in Panama for grueling  hours in the air and missions flown under "lights-out" conditions that included  some blackout landings.  </P> <P> The Channel Islands base has 320 full-time members and about 1,100 reservists  who report to duty on scheduled weekends and go on training missions once a  year.  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Arts: Chabrier's buoyant opera bouffe - Opera In 1991, Opera North celebrated Emmanuel Chabrier's 150th anniversary with an exuberant production of his 'opera bouffe' L'Etoile. This year, the centenary of his death, Opera North promises his 'opera-comique' Le Roi malgre lui for later; meanwhile, to ensure that appetites are well whetted, L'Etoile is back again in Phyllida Lloyd's delectable staging. The crisis-ridden story is impeccably silly, far-fetched but not too complicated, with a clever text by Leterrier and Vanloo (nattily Englished here by Jeremy Sams). The music is as buoyant, original and witty as one expects of Chabrier - and never just tacked on: it springs straight from the ridiculous situations, and turns them into farcical gems. It is immensely singable, at least for singers who appreciate the 19th-century French vocal manners that Chabrier exploits and sometimes satirises. The excellent Opera North cast swings into it with confident relish. They have invaluable support from Valentin Reymond, who conducts the score with no less grace than verve, idiomatic as could be. They also survive Anthony Ward's designs - sets and costumes alike drawn from children's fairytale books, and shamelessly exaggerated - with unshakeable aplomb. In the breeches-role, Pamela Helen Stephen makes the lusty pedlar Lazuli into a carrot-haired, full-voiced, ripely accented Scot; occultly linked to him by astrology is King Ouf, as whom the tenor Paul Nilon is a model of knowing style. Jonathan Best's glum astrologer abets him staunchly, Mary Hegarty's Princess is brightly assured, and the unreliable Ambassadorial couple are reliably impersonated by Alan Oke and Kate Flowers. But it is always the composer's voice we hear: irrepressible Chabrier, the 'amateur' musical revolutionary who quit his civil-service job as soon as he heard Tristan (at 39), the heir of Offenbach who was far more of a musical ground-breaker than the older mini-master. Without Chabrier's untrammelled example - the tricky firecracker rhythms, the fractured concision, the brusque modulations, the lush, free-floating seventh- and ninth-chords - the Debussy and Ravel we love might have never have become the composers they were. And then where would we be? Revival sponsored by Manchester Airport Terminal 2. Further performances: Leeds, January 25, 28; Nottingham, February 16, 19; Manchester, February 23, 24; Norwich, March 2, 3; Hull March 9, 11</p>

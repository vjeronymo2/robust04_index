			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ECONOMY IS HEATING UP, FED REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board, which has vowed to keep the economy from overheating  and risking higher inflation, said Wednesday that the pace of activity picked  up in recent weeks.  </P> <P> In a report, the Fed said the economy gained momentum, especially from consumer  spending and manufacturing output, in December and early January, compared to  the prior six weeks.  </P> <P> "It would appear . . . that the national economy gained momentum in recent  weeks as consumer spending strengthened, manufacturing activity continued to  rise and producers scheduled more investment in plant and equipment," the Fed  said in a periodic report on the economy called the "tan book" by Fed watchers  on Wall Street.  </P> <P> In 11 of 12 Federal Reserve districts around the country, retail sales in  December met or exceeded retailers' expectations, the report said. Three  districts said the moderate-to-strong pace of sales continued through early  January.  </P> <P> In manufacturing, "several industries were reported to be operating at high  capacity utilization rates, but only a few, such as chemicals, claimed capacity  limits had constrained production," the Fed said.  </P></p>

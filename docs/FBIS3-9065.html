			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Concerning the signing in Washington of the  agreement between Bosnian Muslims and Croats on the creation of  a joint federation, Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi  gave this statement to the Voice of America correspondent in  Tirana:    [Begin Serreqi recording] The Albanian Government hails the  signing of the agreement, considering it a very important step  and an act that opens a perspective for a stable and acceptable  solution to the conflict. This was a result of a serious  commitment by the United States, international pressure, and  perhaps the obligation of Russian diplomacy in the Balkans.    Judging from the rate and outcome of these efforts and the  results in the field, we reckon that, at least, this stops that  part of the conflict, avoids that part of the war, the most  absurd part of the war -- the Croat-Bosnian war.    Of course, it points out the aggressor more, against whom  there should be no illusions. However, the line of political  isolation and the strict application of sanctions should  continue, and they must be conditioned by other elements of the  crisis.    Of course, the results of this agreement bring to the fore  those other elements which, because of the tragedy of the war in  Bosnia, have been somewhat marginalized. Here I want to point  out the problem of Kosova and reiterate that by signing the  agreement, this is the first step, a step that should be  followed by other measures to solve the crisis definitively, a  crisis that cannot be solved without finding an acceptable and  stable solution to the Kosova issue and the pan-Albanian problem  in the Balkans.

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Letter: Not lobster eaters Sir, The article by Dominic Lawson, 'Pity the lobster socialists - A plan to help wealthy Labour voters carry on' (April 18), must be one of the most insensitive ever to be published by you. The 3m unemployed, the many bankrupt entrepreneurs, the dispossessed, do not eat lobster - nor will they be helped by the new government. Mr Lawson has displayed his total lack of Christian charity in his unwillingness to countenance the redistribution of wealth from fat cats (like him and me) to the poor and needy. His cynical approach would have made even Marie Antoinette ('let them eat cake') seem generous. Government of the people, by the 42 per cent for the 42 per cent was not what Abraham Lincoln had in mind. Cannot you dispense with the services of this servant of Genghis Khan? William Norton, The Dovecote Field, Brant Broughton, Lincoln</p>

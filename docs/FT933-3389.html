			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Beckenham warns on results Beckenham Group, the restructured USM-traded heating and ventilation engineer, has announced a board shake-up and warns that the current year's results will again be disappointing. The company said that Mr Peter Long becomes executive chairman while Mr Brian Newman (formerly managing director) and Mr Christopher Egleton (formerly chairman) are leaving the board. Beckenham Ductwork, the group's largest subsidiary, formed as a result of last year's reorganisation, was still not performing satisfactorily. This was partly due to difficult trading conditions but also certain aspects of the reorganisation which are not producing the required benefits. The directors said further changes were being made which should bring significant cost savings. Turnover at this subsidiary fell below budget in the third quarter and at the start of the fourth quarter but had now picked up. The situation has adversely affected profitability and put a strain on cash resources. Certain shareholders are making available support of more than Pounds 2m with the intention that most will be converted into long-term capital.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Thailand's foreign minister ousted Thailand's foreign minister, Mr Prasong Soonsiri, has been ousted after a party squabble and replaced by Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, an entrepreneur. Mr Prasong, a tough former intelligence chief, was sometimes accused of handling delicate relations with neighbours in a devious manner, and failing to erase the notion that Thailand supported the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. His replacement, the founder of the Shinawatra Computer and Communications group, is an ambitious former policeman with no previous political experience. He started in business by selling computers to his own police department. The leader of the Palang Dharma (Buddhist way) party, Mr Chamlong Srimuang, has pushed Mr Thaksin forward as part of a reshuffle of all the party's 11 cabinet seats in the ruling five-party coalition's administration. Mr Chamlong fears his party has been overshadowed by the ruling Democrat party in the two years since the last election. He will enter the cabinet for the first time as a deputy prime minister, replacing former party leader Mr Boonchu Rojanastien, and is expected to strive to bolster the party's Bangkok power base particularly by trying to ease the capital's traffic jams.</p>

Keko report: "Prosecution Calls for 14 Years </F> Imprisonment for Fatos Nano"]    [Text] Including interruptions, the Nano trial has now  lasted for three weeks since its start on 5 March. Tirana  District Court, surrounded by police for every session, has  called a record number of witnesses and has attracted the  interest of the entire press. It must be said that the trial  was held for practical reasons in two buildings, in the old  courtroom on Kavaje Street and in the former building of the  Energy Directorate. Despite the changes in both the location  and the accusations, Prosecutors Qeleshi and Gjokutaj did not  deviate from the goal for which they had joined forces: the  conviction of Socialist leader Fatos Nano. The Nano trial is  inevitably the trial of the year. Neither the protests of the  European Parliament nor the noise of the Socialist Party and its  electorate have influenced the trial. Rumors of a rebellion of  the electorate on the eve of the trial were successfully quashed  by the people's police, and the Democratic Party's propaganda  did the same for the Socialist Party's propaganda. The  Democratic side will no doubt consider the end of the trial a  new victory over the old communist nomenklatura, because this is  the language that has been used against Nano. In itself, the  Nano trial is an episode in a prolonged series of trials of the  former nomenklatura, to continue with the trials of Ramiz Alia,  Hekuran Isai, and others.    Thus, the prosecution at the Nano trial finally summed up  its  case at yesterday's session of Tirana District Court before the  bench presided over by Agim Bendo. Prosecutor Qeleshi read out  the 27-page file and in conclusion presented his demands.    The prosecution demanded: "A verdict of guilty against the  defendant Fatos Nano for the crime of appropriating state  property and abusing his office for the benefit of other persons  to the amount of 73,780,000 leks, and his sentencing on the  basis of Article 62 of the Penal Code to 13 years imprisonment;  also a verdict of guilty against the defendant Fatos Nano for  the crime of falsifying official documents and his sentencing on  the basis of Article 110 of the Penal Code to three years  imprisonment. "A verdict of guilty against the defendant  Sokrat Plaka for the crime of abuse of office leading to damages  incurred by the state amounting to 73,780,000 leks and his  sentencing on the basis of Article 106 of the Penal Code to five  years imprisonment.    "A verdict of guilty against the defendent Robert Gjini for  the crime of abuse of office leading to damages incurred by the  state amounting to 399,390 leks and his sentencing on the basis  of Article 106 of the Penal Code to four years imprisonment.    "A verdict of guilty against the defendant Hasan Hallko for  the crime of abuse of office leading to damages incurred by the  state amounting to 144,821 leks and his sentencing on the basis  of Article 106 of the Penal Code to two years imprisonment.    "The prosecution also demands that the defendants be held  liable to pay to the Albanian State Bank the sums over which  they have been accused, under Article 155 of the Code of Penal  Procedure."    After the prosecutors' summing up, the lawyers of Nano,  Plaka, Gjini, and Hallko asked for time for their clients'  defense.    Lawyer Perparim Sanxhaku asked for 20 days to defend Fatos  Nano; Lawyer Ali Meta asked for nine days to defend Sokrat  Plaka; lawyer Fatmir Braka left the time necessary to defend  Hasan Hallko to the court's discretion, but asked for a  sufficient period; and lawyer Roland Permeti requested nine days  to defend Robert Gjini.    In conclusion, the court decided to invite the defense  counsel to make their presentations in their clients' favor on  30 March 1994. Thus ended the session, which began at 1210 and  ended at 1305. After it ended, we turned to Prosecutor Genc  Gjokutaj, who said that the prosecution's summing up was a  synthesis of the evidence obtained throughout the judicial  investigation and during the trial, which proved the charges.  The severity of the punishment is in total proportion to the  importance of the accused and the seriousness of their  activities. The very serious consequences arising from the  defendants' criminal activities must be taken into consideration.    Asked whether the prosecution would triumph over the  defense, Gjokutaj said:    "We do not envy the defense. We are men of the law and are  convinced of the justice of what we have argued. What the court  decides is the court's business."    Mr. Nano's lawyer, Perparim Sanxhaku, made no press  statement  after Prosecutor Qeleshi's summing up. He said that he reserved  the right to speak after the defense summing up, which Bendo has  decided will take place at 0900 on 30 March. It is not known  what Mr. Sanxhaku hopes for from this session or whether the  bench will reduce or increase the sentence requested for Nano.  The latter is highly probable, if one remembers the precedent  of the journalists' trial.    In connection with the defense summing up on 30 March, it  has  been learned that Fatos Nano has finally stated that he will  defend himself, but will he bring evidence to show his  innocence? From what has been seen in the trial so far, Nano  has not wished to enter into the details of the accusation, and  this leads one to think that his speech will deal more with the  trial's political ramifications than with its legal details.</p>

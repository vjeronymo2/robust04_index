			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DAD BARRED ZOLA BUDD FROM FUNERAL  </P> <P> In a final snub to his estranged daughter, the murdered father of runner Zola  Budd has barred the South African-born athlete from his funeral.  </P> <P> Frank Budd gave instructions in his will, which was read today, that Zola and  her two sisters should not be allowed at the graveside.  </P> <P> Budd, 56, was shot dead last week in his farmhouse home near the Orange Free  State town of Bloemfontein. A 24-year-old man was charged Monday with murder.  </P> <P> Budd became estranged from the rest of the family around the time she took  British citizenship to evade anti-apartheid boycotts and take part in the 1984  Olympic Games.  </P> <P> The elder Budd's sister, Joyce Evans, told state radio that her brother had  since made peace with his children and would have changed his will had it not  been for his untimely death.  </P></p>

AIA, a Christian-advocacy organization that played a schedule of  college teams in exhibition games, had moved from Vancouver, Canada, to San  Diego in 1985.  </P> <P> The move comes as part of a structural and leadership change within the  national organization. The national offices also will be moved to Cincinnati  from Irvine.  </P> <P> The AIA will operate a West Coast branch in San Diego and continue to offer  summer camps and its three-on-three tournament.  </P> <P> AIA will move to Cincinnati with no coach and only one confirmed player --  Lorenzo Romar.  </P> <P> Coach Rle Nichols left the team in January and AIA is searching for a coach and  general manager.  </P> <P> AIA was 83-49 in four seasons in San Diego. The organization was in Vancouver  for eight years.  </P> <P> TENNIS  </P> <P> Steffi Graf, the top-ranked women's tennis player in the world, will compete in  the $200,000 Great American Bank Tennis Classic at the San Diego Tennis and  Racquet Club July 31 to Aug. 6.  </P> <P> Graf became only the fifth player to win tennis' Grand Slam -- the Australian,  French, U.S. Open and Wimbledon -- last year. This will be her only tournament  appearance on the West Coast this year.  </P> <P> COLLEGE SIGNINGS  </P> <P> Michael Hudson and Shawn Jamison, both of Pratt Community College near Wichita,  Kan., signed national letters of intent with San Diego State Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jamison, 6-foot-8, had verbally committed to the Aztecs last Tuesday. He  averaged 19.9 points and 9.2 rebounds for Pratt. Hudson, a 6-2 guard, averaged  13.8 points, five rebounds and three assists.  </P> <P> Jamison is a graduate of Gahr High in Cerritos. Hudson prepped at Los Angeles  Washington. In 1987-88, both played at Casper College in Wyoming where they  finished sixth in the national community college tournament.

Teresa Schreck and Kim Saiki followed at 75.  </P> <P> Shelly Tulao, a Chula Vista amateur, is among a group of three golfers three  back at 75.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> UC San Diego scored seven runs in the third inning, including back-to-back home  runs by Gary Fessia and Jim Martinez, to lift the Tritons over visiting  Pomona-Pitzer, 9-3.  </P> <P> Also in the third, eight batters reached base, the first seven scoring, before  Fessia's grand slam and Martinez's solo home runs. The Division III  eighth-ranked Tritons improved to 18-14. Pomona-Pitzer dropped to 7-21-1. Rick  Rupkey (8-3) picked up the win.  </P> <P> Freshman Bruce Moutaw hit a three-run homer in the ninth to get US  International close, but the Gulls (16-27) still fell to UC Riverside, 7-5, in  a nonconference game. Scott Einhorn hit a solo homer for USIU.  </P> <P> University of San Diego broke its 15-game losing streak by winning the second  game of a doubleheader with UC Irvine, 1-0. UC Irvine won the opener, 3-1.  </P> <P> DISTANCE RUNNING  </P> <P> Ultra distance runner Sarah Fulcher of Pacific Beach will run in the  Soviet-sponsored Pravda International Super Marathon June 15-30 in Russia.  </P> <P> Fulcher, an assistant track coach at Mission Bay High, is one of 10 Americans  on a relay team that will run 1,000 miles -- approximately 20 miles a day per  runner -- beginning in Tynda, 200 miles east of Lake Baykal in eastern Siberia.  The marathon will finish at Pyongyang, on the border of North Korea.  </P> <P> There are 12 teams, mostly Eastern bloc countries, running in the relay,  according to Fulcher, 27.

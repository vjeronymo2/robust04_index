			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Leading Article: ACT revisited AS SEVERAL companies scramble to push through increased or accelerated dividends following the Budget's changes to Advance Corporation Tax, but ahead of the new tax year, there is a reminder once again of the distortion which arises from the fondness of chancellors for producing complex proposals from a battered red box. In fact the proposed Foreign Income Dividend scheme is indeed to be the subject of a consultative paper. But the more important reduction in ACT from 25 to 20 per cent is apparently more or less written in stone. A measure which was presented as a way of helping companies to overcome a problem of surplus ACT can also be seen as a tax on pension funds and certain other investors. This 'help' for the corporate sector is budgeted to raise an extra Pounds 900m in 1995-96. The 'imputation' system of UK corporation tax is 20 years old. It was introduced to iron out distortions, so that profits would be similarly taxed whether retained or distributed, and there would be little bias in favour of debt rather than equity finance. Within a closed economy with an evenly spread burden of income tax, this approach would have made admirable sense. But nowadays more shares  - perhaps 40 per cent in all - are owned by tax-exempt investors, in respect of which the system actually creates a pro-dividend bias. Looking through their shareholdings to the underlying company, pension funds bear a 33 per cent tax on retained profits but only 10 2/3 per cent on dividends (soon rising, however, to 16 1/4 per cent). In addition, companies have become more international in scope, and listed industrials could derive well over 40 per cent of their pre-tax earnings from overseas subsidiaries in 1993. Meanwhile UK profits are depressed. So ACT on dividends has expanded disproportionately to the domestic corporation tax liability. One approach, to segregate the distribution of overseas profits through FIDs, is logical, although the details have yet to be clarified. It will not be welcomed by pension funds and other gross investors, who will lose a 20 per cent tax credit; yet they can scarcely expect to reclaim overseas taxes. But the proposal to reduce the rate of ACT on normal dividends, paid out of UK profits, to a level below the basic rate of income tax, is more questionable. Not only occupational pension funds but also individual holders of personal pension plans and personal equity plans have had the reasonable expectation that they would be sheltered from dividend taxes on established contracts, whatever might happen in future. The element of retrospection is worrying. In addition, the bias in favour of debt finance is being increased. Interest payments can be received gross by pension funds, but dividends will be subject to tax of 16 1/4 per cent. This bias may suit a government which has vast quantities of debt to sell. But is this a wise time to be raising the cost of equity finance for companies? Third, to 'help' companies by attacking their pension funds could prove counter-productive. Many companies, perhaps as many as 40 per cent, are still enjoying pension fund contribution holidays because of surpluses, but now scheme valuations must be made on the basis of a reduced gross income stream. There is a case for arguing that companies are paying out too much in dividends, and there is a rather weaker case for saying that the exempt investor sector has become too large and should bear more of the tax burden. But these matters should be tackled openly, and not by proposing undiscussed changes to company taxation with motives that have not been fully spelt out.</p>

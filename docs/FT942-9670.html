			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / More curbs on tobacco adverts New restrictions on tobacco advertising were announced yesterday by the government as a backbench bill to ban all tobacco advertising failed to complete its passage through the Commons. The restrictions, which form part of a five-year voluntary agreement between the government and tobacco manufacturers, will mean larger health warnings, fewer posters and the removal of all permanent shopfront advertising for tobacco products by the end of 1996. The bill, which had been proposed by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, was opposed by the government and yesterday ran out of time at the report stage after Conservative MPs tabled amendments. Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said the new voluntary rules would mean an end to the use of humour likely to appeal to the young, and the removal of poster advertising from within a 200m radius of school entrances. The Tobacco Manufacturers Association said yesterday it had agreed 'with the utmost reluctance' to the new restrictions. It said it was 'dismayed and disappointed' by the 'attack on the industry's marketing freedoms'. The Advertising Association, the umbrella group which has been co-ordinating opposition to the bill, said it was relieved that a complete ban did not get through. It was 'extremely disappointed', however, that further restrictions had been placed on advertising in spite of there being 'no evidence of a link between advertising and total market consumption' of tobacco products. Action on Smoking and Health, the anti-smoking campaign group, claimed a 'moral victory' and said it would back amendments to other bills, 'in the same way that the seat-belts legislation was introduced', to bring in a ban on tobacco advertising.</p>

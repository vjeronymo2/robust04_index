			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by John Carvel: "Britain Watches as EU 11 Act on </F> Workers' Rights"]    [Text] Luxembourg -- Britain was in a spectator role  yesterday when ministers from the other European Union [EU]  member states legislated for the first time under the Maastricht  social protocol to increase the rights of workers in  multinational companies.    With David Hunt, the Employment Secretary, sitting out  because of the British opt-out, they approved a directive to  establish European works councils in transnational companies  with at least 1,000 employees in the community outside Britain.    The law is designed to ensure that workers are consulted  about strategic corporate decisions which could affect their  livelihood, such as changing technology, shifts in production  from one country to another, or large-scale redundancies.    Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said the  decision was an historic breakthrough after 23 years of  argument. He claimed the law could improve the competitiveness  of business by strengthening its most important asset -- good  relations between managements and their staff.    "We have reaffirmed in a dramatic way the commitment of  member states to maintain social progress at the same time as  other policies," he said.    But Mr Hunt said the decision to establish "trade-union  dominated works councils" was a dreadful mistake which would  "impose unnecessary costs and bureaucracy on companies at a time  when the overwhelming need is to reduce costs and increase  employment." The measure was opposed by every employers group  in Europe, he said.    Up to 100 of the largest British-based multinationals might  be affected by the legislation because they have more than 1,000  employees in the EU outside Britain and meet the threshold of at  least 150 in two or more of the other 11 member states.    They will be obliged to set up works councils for their  continental and Irish employees. "But they will be free to  decide for themselves what arrangements they have for consulting  and informing their staff in Britain," Mr Hunt said.    He presented this as a benefit of the opt-out, but this  interpretation was disputed by Norbert Blum, the German labour  minister, who said: "Modern entrepreneurs must have a system of  informing their employees if they are going to make headway.  This is all about motivation and we can't have the standards of  the last century."    Mr Flynn said the evidence from company boardrooms was that  they intended to apply the directive right throughout the EU.  "De jure this legislation covers the 11, de facto it will be  applied across the 12," he said.    He estimated that 1,500 multinationals would be affected in  the EU as a whole, of which 15 to 100 would be based in Britain.    John Monks, general secretary of the TUC [Trade Union  Council], said yesterday: "I regret the British government  opt-out means some British workers will be denied rights that  obtain elsewhere, but I am confident that many of the  British-based companies concerned will take the sensible course  and apply the same provisions to their British operations."    The legislation agreed yesterday is expected to pass through  the European Parliament in September and to receive a second and  final approval from the Council of Ministers before the end of  the year. The 11 member states then have up to two years to  transpose it into their national law.    The directive is designed to encourage managements to agree  arrangements with their trade unions for consulting employees in  the way which best suits the style of the business. Its  legislative bite lies in a fall-back procedure which imposes  works council machinery if these negotiations fail.    On a proposal from the French government, the allowable  negotiating period was extended from two to three years. This  means no compulsory machinery can be established before the year  2000, but Mr Flynn believes there is now the incentive for firms  to start negotiating immediately.    Another amendment approved yesterday was to restrict the  legislation to firms with at least 150 employees in two or more  member states, instead of 100.    The social affairs council gave final approval for a  directive to prevent the exploitation of young workers,  including a controversial exemption to allow 14 and 15-year-olds  in Britain to continue to work more than 12 hours a week.    Mr Hunt said this was a "UK opt-out" which would protect  British schoolchildren's traditional right to earn pocket money  by delivering newspapers and gaining work experience from a few  hours work at weekends.    Mr Flynn said there was a temporary concession, but no  opt-out. Britain would have to legislate to comply with the  directive within the next six years because the exemption would  automatically expire unless the European Commission proposed its  renewal, which it would never contemplate.</p>

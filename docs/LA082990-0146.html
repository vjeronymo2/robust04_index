			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> JETS TO START TONY EASON AT QB  </P> <P> Jets Coach Bruce Coslet said he will start quarterback Tony Eason in Thursday  night's preseason finale at Tampa Bay because "it's Tony's turn to start."  </P> <P> It's approaching judgment day in the Jets' quarterback competition and there is  reason to wonder if Coslet may turn to Eason as his regular-season starter.  </P> <P> In the preseason Eason has shown the ability to move the team better than  incumbent starter Ken O'Brien.  </P> <P> In 15 series, Eason has directed the team to two touchdowns and a field goal.  In 11 series, O'Brien has moved the team to one touchdown.  </P> <P> Eason has completed 31 of 51 passes for 359 yards and two touchdowns. O'Brien  has completed 12 of 26 for 133 yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Coslet will name his starter sometime after the Tampa Bay game and before the  Jets' season-opener at Cincinnati.  </P></p>

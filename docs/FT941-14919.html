			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Observer: Hard cheese Who says the Swiss have no sense of humour? Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the Euro-fanatic Swiss economics minister proves the contrary, and now claims to have a sympathiser in heaven. He tells of the German, Italian and Swiss foreign ministers having brief audiences with God. The Italian asks when his country will finally be rid of the mafia. 'It will be in 10 years,' says God. 'Oh dear, I'll no longer be in office then,' responds the minister. The German asks when the neo-Nazis will disappear. 'In 15 years,' intones the deity; the German minister also regrets he won't be in office then. The Swiss then asks when Switzerland will join the EU. 'By then I will no longer be in office,' comes the reply.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Franco told to take over in Brazil today THERE was such concern in Brazil yesterday over the power vacuum at the top that the Senate insisted Vice-President Itamar Franco take over as acting president today. Last night, there was still no-one named to occupy the crucial new finance ministry in the incoming administration, but Mr Francisco Gros, Central Bank president, said he had been asked to stay on. Mr Franco had asked for a delay in his take-over until Monday because of difficulties in choosing, as head of the finance ministry, someone acceptable to the wide range of parties supporting him. The Senate decision left Mr Franco rushing to finish compiling his cabinet. His spokesman said that he would not assume power without having named a finance minister. His task was helped last night when the two main parties disputing - the Democratic Movement (PMDB) and the Social Democrats (PSDB) - agreed to stop vetoing names. For the last two days, they had been wrangling bitterly over the finance portfolio. The first choice of Mr Jose Serra, an economist from the social democratic PSDB party, was vetoed by Mr Orestes Quercia, leader of the Democratic Movement party (PMDB). He believes that, as the largest party, the PMDB should command the finance ministry. Mr Franco seemed impatient with the in-fighting yesterday: 'I choose the ministers. Anyone who thinks he can pressure me is fooling himself.' The failure to name a finance minister and, while Mr Gros's position was still in doubt, a Central Bank chief, was causing concern in the financial community, anxious for word on future economic policy. The main Sao Paulo stock market was operating 1.1 per cent down yesterday afternoon in quiet trading, but closed up 4.8 per cent on news that the acting president would be installed today. The socialist Senator Jose Bisol yesterday criticised the delay: 'We are running the risk of disappointing the nation which took to the streets in favour of impeachment' of President Fernando Collor, newly on trial by the senate on corruption charges. The delay left him still in office, despite the vote by the House of Representatives on Tuesday to strip the president of his powers and send him to a Senate trial. He spent yesterday in his offices, where he could still nominate appointees and issue decrees until he has signed the papers required to suspend him from office for 180 days during the trial.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Shcherban] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- A leader of the abortive  Soviet coup of 1991 insisted on Wednesday that former Soviet  President Mikhail Gorbachev was ill at the time.    "In August 1991 Mikhail Gorbachev was badly ill both in the  physical and morally-psychologic aspects," former Soviet Deputy  Defence Minister Valentin Varennikov told the trial on Wednesday.    Varennikov is the only coup organiser who rejected the  Duma-proclaimed amnesty and insisted that his case be  investigated by court.    Gorbachev's alleged illness was used by the coup plotters to  explain the isolation of the president. Gorbachev himself had  rejected the allegations.    Varennikov admitted that communications with the state  residence in Foros in the Crimea where Gorbachev was staying had  been cut off, but explained it by the desire not to disturb the  president during his talks with the coup plotters.    "Constant calls could have distracted Gorbachev" from talks  with the ringleaders who arrived to Foros to get a go-ahead from  the president for the introduction of a state of emergency in  the country.    Varennikov rejected the accusation that the communications  had been cut off to isolate Gorbachev.</p>

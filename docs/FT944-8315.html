			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / This Week: Film/Video Travel sickness pills are required this week; and a new set of culture-shock absorbers in your brain. You will be journeying across the known globe. Your best bet would be to start in Japan with The Seven Samurai (Kurosawa's classic swashbuckler revived); take a ferry to Hong Kong for the praised youth film cum portrait of an era (1960s), Days Of Being Wild; cut across the Indian Ocean to catch Sean Connery in A Good Man In Africa (from William Boyd's colonialism-satirising novel); nip up to the Mediterranean for the Italian comedy Dear Diary, an enchanter from film-maker/comedian Nanni Moretti; then make a wide loop to Cuba via claymore-swishing Scotland (Highlander III).                         *      *      * Cuba, if you arrive there in one piece, has the real oddity of the week. Strawberries And Chocolate is a gay comedy that, after getting past Castro, has spent most of the year winning festival prizes. Two young men - one gay, one straight (is he a watchman for the regime?) - meet, make friends and move about amid the bizarre subculture of crumbling Havana. Sly satire, hints of farce - and a brave assault on dogma and bigotry.                         *      *      * If you have children you may prefer something more innocent like The Nightmare Before Christmas. Tim Batman Burton wrote the original story for this off-the-map puppet phantasmagoria set in Halloweentown. Henry Selick directed, stuffing our eyes with the richest assemblage of bric-a-brac since the last scene of Citizen Kane. Other ghostly influences abound. The film is part Spitting Image, part Muppet Show, part Svankmajer's Alice. Mostly, though, it is itself: a gloriously endearing chunk of Toytown Gothic in rich paintbox colours.                         *      *      * The video market is bearish this week, growling out little except a poor children's film (Josh And SAM) and a shlockumentary for adults: OJ Simpson, The Rise And Fall. Enough already - many of us cry - with the murder-accused American ex-footballer. But this saga will obviously run and run, at least until Oliver Stone makes a film of it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Francois Mitterrand from </F> the Elysee in Paris on 21 February--live or recorded]    [Text] My dear compatriots: The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina  entered a new phase in Sarajevo last night. The Serbs, who have  been besieging the town, inflicting thousands of deaths and  terrible suffering for the people, have withdrawn most of their  heavy weapons, guns, mortars, and tanks, within a radius of 20  km. The weapons that have not been withdrawn are now grouped  under the control of UN Forces. The first condition was met  within the allotted time. The North Atlantic Council set the  deadline on 9 February at the request of France and the United  States, and it was meant for both the Serbs and the Bosnian  Government.    Last night, I invited the prime minister, the ministers of  defense and foreign affairs, as well as the chief of staff, to  the Elysee in order to take stock of the situation. From the  Elysee I called General Cot, who is commanding the UN Protection  Forces on the ground in the former Yugoslavia. He told us that  the withdrawal of Serb weapons was accelerating.    I then called Washington, where President Clinton, who had  just talked with Mr. Yeltsin, confirmed the information given by  General Cot. We agreed that if events unfold as they are  expected to until the deadline [as heard], it will not be  necessary to use our military means. Since the information we  received from our own services confirmed this, air strikes did  not take place.    The withdrawal of heavy weapons was obtained thanks to the  determination of the allies and the moderating intervention of  the Russians with the Serbs. Need I emphasize the role played  by France, which from the beginning originated all of the  initiatives aimed at settling the conflict, and which has given  the United Nations the largest contingent of peace soldiers? We  need only look at the most recent events. May I remind you that  it was in the wake of the talks that took place 15 days ago  between Mr. Juppe and American Secretary of State Christopher,  that it was possible to find an outcome.    However, much remains to be done. It is necessary to  consolidate the lifting of the siege in Sarajevo. The  cease-fire has been heeded so far, but freedom of movement for  people and humanitarian convoys has not yet been restored.  People are still living in fear.    It is clear that any violation of the decisions of the  Atlantic Alliance will be....[pauses] would be punished  tomorrow as we had intended to do today. I hope that the most  will be made of the time we have saved and of this first success  of reason over so many murderous passions, in order to extend  allied pressure to the other Bosnian towns, to the other zones  of this country where violence is rife. We will thus give a new  impetus to the search for a political settlement, for there can  only be a negotiated solution.    Consultations will take place within the next few days. As  early as this week France will appeal to the Security Council  and ask its members to put Sarajevo under UN administration.    We shall not slacken our efforts. The minister of defense  and and the minister of foreign affairs are following the  development of events--under the authority of the prime  minister--just as I am, hour by hour.    I presided over a restricted meeting this afternoon, as I  did  yesterday. The same will happen over the next few days, and, if  some among you listening to me are wondering, I will tell you:  What is happening in the Balkans affects us, it affects France.  Beyond the human solidarity demanded by the scope of this  tragedy, yes, this affects us, as other things did in the past.  Similar conflicts can flare up at any time. Born from the  dislocation of the Soviet Union and from the solution which will  prevail in Bosnia, many things will happen.    I am about to conclude, my dear compatriots. Let us think of  the 18 French soldiers killed, of the 281 injured in that part  of the world, and let us appreciate together the value of their  sacrifice for the sake of peace. Long live the republic, long  live France.</p>

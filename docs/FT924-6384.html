			<p>921121 FT  21 NOV 92 / Letter: Touchable and untouchable Sir, Tony Jackson finds it 'increasingly difficult to unscramble' the output of services from those of manufacturing ('The incredible shrinking industrial base', November 16). I offer him a simple rule: if you can touch it then it is almost certainly manufactured; if you cannot, it is a service. This works with all of his examples: financial services provided by General Motors and by the City of London, GM's cars, the City of London's need for computers etc. On the more substantive point that services cannot replace manufacturing, well, that argument is untouchable.

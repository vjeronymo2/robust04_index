			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO SUES LOS ANGELES OVER HYPERION SEWAGE PLANT  </P> <P> Complaining of noxious odors and hazardous chemical releases, the city of El  Segundo is suing Los Angeles to force environmental and safety improvements at  the giant Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant.  </P> <P> The suit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, asks the court to  take jurisdiction over hazardous materials and construction projects at  Hyperion. That would make the plant more responsive to residents' complaints  about fumes, noise and dust, said El Segundo City Atty. Leland Dolley.  </P> <P> The suit also seeks $8 million in punitive damages in connection with a March  19 incident in which three residents near the plant suffered headaches, nausea  and burning eyes, apparently from fumes. One woman was hospitalized.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn said he could not comment on  the suit because his office had not yet received a copy.  </P> <P> The El Segundo City Council announced in December that it would sue Los Angeles  because of problems it blamed on Hyperion, which borders El Segundo on the  west. The council authorized the suit March 23 after lawyers for the city had  taken statements from more than 100 residents who complained about odors from  the facility. Some said they suffered health problems as a result.  </P> <P> But it was the March 19 incident that prompted city leaders to unanimously  approve the suit, said City Manager Ron Cano on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that Hyperion officials covered up the causes of the chlorine  smell that residents complained of March 19.  </P> <P> Hyperion officials said at the time that a scrubbing device used to remove  hydrogen sulfide gases had malfunctioned, but they added that it was unclear  whether the problem had caused the smell cited by residents. Officials from the  city and the South Coast Air Quality Management District said they could not  pinpoint the source of the fumes.  </P> <P> The suit claims that the problem stemmed from the mishandling of "chlorine or  some other similarly harmful material" at Hyperion. In seeking the punitive  cash damages, the city alleges that Hyperion officials "failed to be fully  cooperative" with the El Segundo and AQMD investigators.  </P></p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Who's really in charge? Sir, According to Robert Peston ('Treasury drops dividends probe after pressure', November 24), quoting a 'senior government official', the Treasury's inquiry initiated by financial secretary Stephen Dorrell last year into whether high dividend payments were responsible for inadequate investment has been abandoned. The government official revealed that 'it became too much of a hot potato after Lord Hanson attacked the review'. Can we be told who is the real First Lord of the Treasury, John Major or Lord Hanson? J H Mulvey, executive secretary, The Save British Science Society, Box 241, Oxford OX1 3QQ</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cancellation safe harbor.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that it is appropriate to clarify in the Interpretation that it will not be a violation if a NASD member makes an allocation of a hot issue to a restricted person or account, so long as the member cancelled the trade and reallocated the security at the public offering price to an unrestricted account, prior to T+1 of the initial transaction. The NASD believes that the clarification will remedy any concerns caused by inadvertent violations of the Interpretation that are corrected by the NASD member making the distribution. Sales following cancellation would need to be made in compliance with applicable laws, including section 5 of the Securities Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Statutory Basis For Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act in that the proposed changes to the Interpretation will promote just and equitable principles of trade by facilitating the bona fide distribution of hot issue securities to the public, and protect against the receipt of hot issues by persons restricted under the Interpretation. Further, the NASD believes that the proposed changes and clarifications to the Interpretation are consistent with Section 15A(b)(9) in that they alleviate certain inequities caused by the Interpretation, which imposed burdens on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Association received 36 letters commenting on Notice To Members 93&hyph;40 (the ``Notice''), the proposed amendments to the Interpretation. The commenters include the American Bar Association, the Securities Industry Association, twelve law firms, nine investment advisers/asset managers, seven broker/dealers, three insurance companies, two associations, and one CPA firm. Below is a summary of the more significant and/or recurring issues raised in the letters and the NASD's position in connection with the same. The topics addressed follow the order in which they were presented in the Notice, beginning at page 258. Following that discussion are topics not included in the Notice, but raised in the comment letters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Securities to be Covered <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the solicitation of comments on debt securities, those who did comment recommended that rated debt securities, especially corporate debt securities, be excluded from the Interpretation. The commenters maintained, in general, that the pricing of such securities is made in conjunction with a comparison to U.S. Treasury securities, that their price fluctuates relative to interest rates, and that such securities are typically considered fungible by investors,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> investors look for a certain grade of debt, and do not focus on the issuer, as in equity offerings. Thus, they maintained that the abuses that the Interpretation seeks to prevent are not evident in rated debt offerings, and that the Interpretation's methodology is inapplicable to the trading of such securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD has considered that it does not typically bring enforcement actions in this area, but has concluded that the continued coverage of debt securities is warranted for purposes of deterring any potential future problems in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Stand-by Arrangements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those who commented generally supported the proposal. One commenter maintained that the five-month holding period was too long in that it went beyond the period in which the purchaser should be exposed to the market risk for the securities. It proposed a holding period of no longer than three months, which it maintains is adequate time for the market to establish some equilibrium for the security. Another commenter believed that it is unclear to whom an underwriter has to represent that it was unable to find any other purchaser for the securities, and suggested that a representation in the prospectus should suffice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that the various holding periods under the Interpretation and in the Free-Riding provisions of Schedule E to the By-Laws dealing with offerings by members of their own securities should be uniform and has therefore proposed a three month holding period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cancellation of Trades as ``Safe Harbor'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believed that there would not be any implications under SEC Rule 10b&hyph;6 for the proposed safe harbor so long as the cancellation and reallocation was completed before settlement date. A different commenter suggested that any concerns with Rule 10b&hyph;6 could be remedied by obtaining a no-action letter from the SEC. Another commenter suggested that any notice of cancellations and reallocations would have to be given to the restricted purchaser no later than the day after purchase, and a further commenter maintained that the proposal was too reactive. It suggested that the NASD establish a procedure where hot issues were characterized as such before the distribution via indications of interest, so as to prevent sales to restricted accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD notes that for purposes of Rule 10b&hyph;6, a distribution includes ``the entire process by which in the course of a public offering the block of securities is dispensed and ultimately comes to rest in the hands of the investing public.'' <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Thus, a distribution continues if a broker-dealer withholds any part of an offering in proprietary or nominee accounts and later sells those securities to the public after secondary trading has begun. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Moreover, a cancellation of a bona fide purchase order will not reopen the distribution where there is no reason for the underwriter to believe that the purchase order would be cancelled. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Whether a particular cancellation and reallocation for purposes of compliance with the Interpretation will raise an issue under Rule 10b&hyph;6 will depend upon the facts and circumstances involved in that cancellation and reallocation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> R. A. Holman &amp; Co. v. SEC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 366 F.2d 446, 449 (2d Cir. 1966),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> modified on other grounds,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 377 F.2d 665 (2d Cir. 1966),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 389 U.S. 991 (1967). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Wall Street West, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 S.E.C. 1003, 1005 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Immediate Family <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Those who commented strongly supported the lifting of the immediate family restrictions on persons restricted under Paragraphs three and four of the Interpretation. One commenter expressed concern that the retention of the immediate family restriction in connection with allocations by the broker/dealer that employs the restricted person (as opposed to allocations by broker/dealers that do not employ the restricted person) creates a new category of restricted persons that may prove burdensome for the member who is making the distribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD does not believe that any new restricted category is being created and believes that the proposed modifications are appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Persons With Limited Registration or Limited Purpose Broker/Dealers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Several of the commenters supported the proposed exemption as described in the Notice. In addition, virtually all proposed that the exemption be expanded to apply to all persons, notwithstanding their level of registration, if they are associated with broker/dealers that do a limited business. They maintained generally that such representatives are proscribed from doing any securities business which is beyond the scope of the limited broker/dealer's prescribed business (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> investment company securities), and maintained that the potential for abuse by one that has a general license is unlikely. Some of the commenters contended that limited broker/dealer representatives often have a Series 7 (general securities representative) license in order to comply with state law, and one commenter maintained that the exemption as proposed would create a disincentive for persons with limited registrations from seeking further registration/education. Various commenters believed that a firm-based exemption should include the firms listed in the Notice as well as firms that do not underwrite or distribute initial public offerings, merger and acquisition boutique firms that do not trade, and private placement firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

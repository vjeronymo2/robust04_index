			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 17 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Ambassador  Jesus Martinez reiterated today none of the Colombian guerrilla  commanders mentioned by the Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO has  traveled to his country or met there.    In statements made to Radio Santa Fe, the diplomat said such  accusations have been made to attempt to damage the relations  between both countries, which, he said, are excellent now.    In this respect, Martinez said Colombian Foreign Minister  Noemi Sanin and Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos are  scheduled to visit Cuba shortly.    Bishop Nel Beltran, which the newspaper EL TIEMPO mentions  as  one of the participants of the alleged meeting of guerrilla  commanders in Havana during the latter part of January, has told  two radio stations today he was not in Cuba at that time, is not  familiar with that country, and much less had met with the  people the newspaper has mentioned.    In a news conference held this afternoon, Colombian Foreign  Minister Sanin reported although the reports on this alleged  event have not been proven, they will ask the Cuban Government  for explanations,because the Prosecutor's Office has stated the  EL TIEMPO reports could be true.    She admitted if this were true, they would not ask for  explanations, and she said she hoped they will be satisfactory  to clarify the issue. [sentence as received]    Regarding Beltran's denial, she said she believes the  bishop,  whom she has known for a long time. She also spotlighted the  bishop's attributes and contributions to the country.</p>

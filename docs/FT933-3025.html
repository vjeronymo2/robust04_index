			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Caracas vehicle accord signed COLOMBIA, Ecuador and Venezuela have signed an agreement aimed at strengthening regional vehicle assembly industries and discouraging imports of fully assembled vehicles. The agreement, signed in Caracas this week, sets common external tariffs on imports of fully-assembled vehicles ranging from 15 to 35 per cent at the initial stage, and 3-5 per cent duties for imports of complete knock-down kits (CKDs). The signatories also will ban imports of used vehicles, or new vehicles from earlier model years. The accord will take effect on January 1, 1994 for Colombia and Venezuela and later in 1994 for Ecuador. Participants said the new pact would cover about 70 per cent of the Andean vehicle market, which includes Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Lower trade barriers in the three signatory nations have had a negative effect on domestic assembly plants as imports of fully-assembled vehicles have grown sharply in recent years. The accord is expected to provide a boost to local car parts markers.</p>

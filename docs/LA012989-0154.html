			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERRORS MAR TENURE OF REFORM-MINDED RIVERSIDE CORONER  </P> <P> Ray Carrillo vowed to restore respect and harmony when he was elected two years  ago to head what was widely considered a badly managed coroner's office.  </P> <P> But midway through his four-year term, the Riverside County coroner presides  over an office that some say suffers from mismanagement, poor working  conditions, and badly trained investigators. There have been sensational cases  and blunders, including the handling of Liberace's death and the mistaken  cremation of a possible homicide victim.  </P> <P> A grand jury investigation is underway to examine these and other allegations  that have arisen during Carrillo's brief tenure.  </P> <P> "I'm not worried about it (the investigation). I've done nothing wrong," said  Carrillo, 59, who has been touted as a role model for the Latino community in  the county. "I haven't acted out of my range of control."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Trial by Fire'  </P> <P> Still, Carrillo, a heavy-set man with graying hair and beard who was a deputy  coroner for 17 years, acknowledges that his time as county coroner has "been a  trial by fire. Unfortunately, at this particular time, we are the laughing  stock of the county because of mistakes that have been made."  </P> <P> But Carrillo also has strong support, particularly from Latinos in his hometown  of Indio and other cities in the Coachella Desert east of here. They say  Carrillo is a genial and respected community leader who needs more time to turn  the coroner's office around.  </P> <P> Inside the coroner's office -- which handles more than 4,200 cases a year with  a $2.3-million budget that has not increased significantly over the last five  years -- overworked and fatigued employees complain of a lack of leadership and  morale problems so severe that mistakes are all but inevitable.  </P> <P> "Everybody is spending most of their time trying to cover their rear ends  instead of devoting it to the job at hand," said one deputy coroner who asked  to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. "On a scale of 1 to 10, morale is  about sub-4."  </P> <P> Outside the office, county prosecutors have complained that autopsy reports are  often late, and Sheriff's Department homicide investigators have begun to keep  an eye on the work of deputy coroners at crime scenes.  </P> <P> "The fear is that some piece of evidence could become tainted, damaged or  lost," said Sgt. Dan Borden. "I'm paying close attention to what their people  are doing at crime scenes now. I've told my investigators to watch what's going  on."  </P> <P> And some local funeral home directors say they have lost confidence in  Carrillo's ability to administer his office in a professional manner.  </P> <P> "Cripes, I've never seen such an uproar or discontent in an office before,"  said Ed Campbell, owner of the Preston and Simons Mortuary here since 1958.  "It's just an unorganized organization."  </P> <P> Now, Carrillo must prove to county administrators, staff members and the nearly  1 million residents of the county that he can make good on his campaign vow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking for a Comeback  </P> <P> "I have to throw a 93-yard touchdown," said Carrillo, who earns $60,000 a year  in the post and came to the job without previous experience as a government  administrator.  </P> <P> Forensic pathologists and medical examiners say mistakes can be expected in an  office run by a lay coroner without previous experience as an administrator or  formal training in forensic pathology.  </P> <P> "While a lay coroner can work effectively, in general, I think that (elected)  coroners are terrible, terrible systems," said Charles Wetli, a physician and  deputy chief medical examiner for the Dade County Medical Examiner's Office in  Miami.  </P> <P> "An elected coroner can be anybody without formal training," added Wetli, past  president of the Forensic Council of the American Society of Clinical  Pathologists. "And (coroner's offices) are usually under funded, which means  they will be too selective about which cases should be autopsied. Murders may  be missed as a result, and important evidence may be lost."  </P> <P> A recent survey by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed that  23 states have medical examiners who are physicians, 12 states have coroners,  and 16 states, including California, have both coroners and medical examiners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Statewide Pattern  </P> <P> In California, only four of the 58 counties -- Los Angeles, San Francisco,  Santa Clara and Ventura -- have medical examiners. The remaining counties have  sheriffs as coroners or appointed or elected coroners such as Carrillo, reports  the California Coroners Assn. in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Carrillo, who plans to run for a second term, has pointed an accusing finger at  middle management staffers he said he "inherited from the previous  administration."  </P> <P> Such accusations have upset union officials charged with protecting the rights  of county employees, including the 30 who work in the coroner's office.  </P> <P> "I don't think an attempt has been made to establish a rapport between the  coroner and management," said Clayton L. Neff, spokesman for the Public  Employees Assn. of Riverside County. "And that has created a gulf that is up to  him to correct."  </P> <P> In Indio, Carrillo co-owns a Mexican restaurant operated by his wife, Lupe. He  was reared in the area, where his late father, Joseph, served in the 1950s as  the first Latino sheriff's deputy in Riverside County.  </P> <P> Carrillo, a high school dropout who returned to school in 1972, earned a high  school diploma and then an Associates of Arts degree in law enforcement from  the College of the Desert in Palm Desert.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latino Appeal  </P> <P> In November, a group of 40 mostly Latino residents appeared before the  Riverside County Board of Supervisors to defend the man they believe has beaten  the odds in a county that has seen only a handful of Latinos elected to public  office.  </P> <P> One of those who attended the board meeting was Robert Nava, director of  Chicano Student Programs at UC Riverside.  </P> <P> "We are saying give the man a chance. . . . This is only his second year in  office and he inherited an office in disarray," Nava said. "He's a role model  for high school and college students . . . (and) a proven county official."  </P> <P> Jim O'Brien, president of the California Coroners Assn., said Carrillo's  troubles are directly related to the unusual cases that have cropped up under  his reign.  </P> <P> "Liberace, the frozen head -- that would be a nightmare," O'Brien said. "Some  counties have airplanes crash land in them. His county gets these kinds of  things."  </P> <P> Just before Carrillo was elected coroner, former chief deputy coroner Carl  Smith was sentenced to five years probation and fined $8,500 when he pleaded  guilty to one felony count of perjury and one misdemeanor count of obstruction  of justice connected with a district attorney's investigation into alleged  misconduct in office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grand Jury Testimony  </P> <P> The charges against Smith resulted from his and others' testimony in grand jury  hearings "showing a scheme to cover up the deceptive and illegal falsification  of job applications," a spokesman for the district attorney's office said at  the time.  </P> <P> In February, 1987, four months after his election, Carrillo was in the national  spotlight when he announced that he had rejected Liberace's death certificate  and ordered his body returned from Los Angeles for an autopsy to determine  whether he died from AIDS.  </P> <P> Liberace's personal physician, Dr. Ronald Daniels, initially gave as the cause  of death heart failure brought on by subacute encephalopathy, a general term  for degenerative brain disease.  </P> <P> The entertainer's fans and relatives were angry that the inquiry was being  conducted, and chastised Carrillo for publicizing the fact that Liberace  possibly died of AIDS.  </P> <P> Although Carrillo was praised by county officials for following coroner's  procedures to the letter, some coroner's investigators said they were  embarrassed by Carrillo's defensive, combative stance in front of the news  media.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Center of the News  </P> <P> Carrillo recalled that he was under tremendous pressure to explain his position  publicly. "We had 2,000 calls here from reporters around the world," Carrillo  said.  </P> <P> Less than a year later, Carrillo's office made headlines again. In early  January, 1988, it began to investigate the death of 83-year-old Dora Kent,  whose head had been surgically removed and then frozen at a Riverside cryonics  laboratory.  </P> <P> The Alcor Life Extension Foundation stores frozen heads and bodies in the hope  that in the future they can be revived and new bodies cloned for them. Most  scientists dismiss cryonics as fantasy.  </P> <P> Unable to find Kent's head, the coroner's office demanded that Alcor turn it  over so an autopsy could be completed to determine whether the woman was  murdered. Alcor members, including Mrs. Kent's son, Saul Kent, 49, a co-founder  of Alcor, refused, saying an autopsy would eliminate any possibility of the  head being brought back to life.  </P> <P> The standoff became a public spectacle with Carrillo and Alcor members  defending their positions at successive news conferences. The fighting ended  when a Riverside County Superior Court judge barred Carrillo from thawing any  of the six heads and single body preserved at the cryonics laboratory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charges and Denial  </P> <P> Eventually, the coroner's office ruled Kent's death a homicide caused by  barbiturates and prosecutors are investigating. So far, no charges have been  filed. Alcor members deny the woman was murdered.  </P> <P> In July, Carrillo angered union officials when he suspended two employees --  supervising deputy coroner Dan Cupido and coroner's assistant Brenda Kandjari  -- who were involved in the mistaken release of a possible female homicide  victim from Cathedral City to a mortuary home for cremation.  </P> <P> The body of Julie Ann McGhee, 30, was discovered in Cathedral City on July 17  by Cathedral City Police Department officers. Carrillo said Cupido ordered  Kandjari to release the body of a man to the mortuary for cremation. Kandjari,  Carrillo said, failed to look inside the body bag and instead released a  woman's body. The dead woman's family has filed a $1.5-million claim against  the county.  </P> <P> Carrillo suspended Cupido for three days and Kandjari for five days. But a  state mediator in December ordered that the suspensions be rescinded, saying it  was an innocent mistake.  </P> <P> Union officials attacked Carrillo's action and defended the employees, saying  that the remains lacked proper identification and that existing policies in the  coroner's office lend themselves to mistakes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Union's Viewpoint  </P> <P> "What is called for now is not finger-pointing and attempts to place blame  elsewhere," union spokesman Neff wrote in a union newsletter published this  month. "What needs to be done is a self-evaluation of Mr. Carrillo's ability to  administer the coroner's office. Taking public potshots will not decrease the  problems in the office."  </P> <P> In October, Carrillo's office was embarrassed again when a young couple moved  into their new home near downtown Riverside and discovered plastic bags on a  back yard picnic table containing human body parts.  </P> <P> The previous owners were deputy coroners Brad and Alendra Birdsall, who worked  part time for a private pathology firm, Reference Laboratory, of Colton.  Carrillo said the body parts found at the home were related to work the couple  was doing for the laboratory and not related to their duties at the coroner's  office.  </P> <P> "I didn't know they were cutting at home," Carrillo said. "Had I known that I  would have stopped them from doing it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Road to Recovery  </P> <P> Despite these problems, Carrillo insisted, "We are on the road to recovery. . .  . My intention is to get the office back on its feet and working properly."  </P> <P> In early January, he won county approval to form a new management team, hire up  to seven new employees and establish a special training program for newly hired  deputy coroners.  </P> <P> "It hasn't been dull around here since Ray has been coroner," said Riverside  County Administrator Gary Cottrell. "But I definitely think things will  improve.  </P> <P> "Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, but I'm going to see this thing to the  end," Carrillo said. "The petty innuendo and back-stabbing don't count for a  hill of beans. What counts are the friends who back you up."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Johan Schuck report: "Support for Our Policy"] </F>   [Text] Paris -- Finance Minister Anne Wibble is satisfied  with the conclusions reached by the OECD in its study of work  and employment. They lend support to what the government wants  to do with the Swedish economy, she claimed.    Wibble was referring among other things to a reduction in  the  level of unemployment benefits, changes to labor law, and her  past statements about the need for lower wages for young people.  She was also thinking about the proposal that is on the  government's desk awaiting discussion on Thursday [9 June] whose  thrust is to prevent the unemployed from moving backward and  forward between unemployment benefit and labor market stimulus  measures for an unlimited period.    According to Wibble, the level of unemployment benefit in  Sweden is higher than in any other industrialized country, if  all measures designed to help the unemployed are brought into  the equation. She takes the view that this is something that  the OECD has missed in its study and this means that Sweden on  the contrary ends up around the average in this respect.    Strengthened by the support from the OECD report Wibble  wants  to go further -- for example, by tightening up the requirements  at employment centers relating to what are to be considered  suitable jobs for those seeking work. For example, distances of  several dozen kilometers should not necessarily be seen as an  obstacle to accepting a job, she said.    The finance minister also noted that the Social Democratic  proposal for a coordinated financial stimulus from the countries  of Europe does not have the support of the OECD.    Nevertheless she is optimistic about Sweden's chances of  escaping much of the structural unemployment that has hit the  majority of countries in Europe:    "Long-term unemployment is still relatively low in Sweden.  We are lagging behind the others and can learn from their  mistakes. The measures the government is taking are aimed  precisely at increasing flexibility, so that more people can  find jobs," Wibble said.    However, Wibble is not entirely uncritical of the OECD  report. It ought to have been clearer on the subject of the  priorities given to various measures and stated more clearly  which countries they were intended for, she said. The finance  minister does not think that the proposed tax cuts contained in  the report are suitable for Sweden. In Sweden budget  consolidation goes before everything else.</p>

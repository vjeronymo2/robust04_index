			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / German bid invited for Channel rail link contract THE government has privately invited a leading German contractor to form a consortium and compete for the contract to build the Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn high-speed rail link connecting the Channel tunnel with London. Its approach to Hochtief - the Essen-based contractor responsible for shifting the temples at Abu Simbel in Egypt and constructing the Bosporus Bridge - is likely to annoy UK companies that have spent, in some cases, millions of pounds in preliminary assessments. The approach suggests the government is not happy with the companies which have expressed interest in the project so far and is anxious to inject extra competition into the bidding process. The government appears so eager to transfer responsibility for the link to the private sector that it is ready to award the work to continental European contractors with greater financial muscle than their British counterparts. It is unclear whether soundings have been made among other overseas groups. The Department of Transport does not acknowledge the approach to Hochtief. Officially, the government had made no 'proactive approaches' to individual companies, the department said. But Hochtief confirmed it had been asked to form a consortium. 'Of course, we are very interested,' it said. Under the British Treasury's so-called Ryrie Rules, private sector finance is allowed only if companies can prove that they can provide better value for money than the public sector. This is not usually the case as the government can borrow at lower rates of interest than the private sector. The government's move will be seen by Eurorail, the Trafalgar House-GEC-BICC joint venture established specifically to bid for the work on the link, as a blow to its chances of success. The chairman of a large construction company allied to the consortium said he was 'spitting blood' about the Hochtief move. In 1990, Eurorail's plan for an alternative link was turned down by the transport secretary because the public subsidy required by the companies was thought too high. In May this year GEC joined the largely British consortium which is still fighting to win the contract. The government issued a consultation paper earlier this year on how best to harness the private sector for the project. The DoT this week appointed Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, to co-ordinate the transfer of the project to the private sector. Funding gap 'threatens BR sell-off', Page 5</p>

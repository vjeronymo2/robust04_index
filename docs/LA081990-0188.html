			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: WAYS TO SMOOTH OUT MARKET'S UPS AND DOWNS  </P> <P> When the going gets tough, investors are supposed to hang tough. But instead,  when the stock market stumbles, investors tend to head for cover in droves.  Just look at all the nervous selling over the past month.  </P> <P> For skittish types, it can make sense to follow a "dollar cost averaging"  approach to mutual fund investing. That's a highfalutin term for a fairly  simple process.  </P> <P> It means investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, perhaps every month or  every quarter, so you wind up buying shares at various prices -- fewer shares  when prices are high and more when they're low.  </P> <P> The advantage is that it "removes the guesswork and difficulty of trying to  time the market," said Anne Patenaude, vice president of marketing with the  Pioneer Funds group in Boston.  </P> <P> You can rest assured that you won't be putting all your marbles into play at a  market peak. "Dollar cost averaging gives you time diversification," said John  Markese, director of research for the American Assn. of Individual Investors in  Chicago.  </P> <P> You can follow a dollar cost averaging strategy to purchase many types of  assets, from gold coins to stocks. But the process works especially well with  mutual funds, which routinely accept small periodic investments and will credit  you with a fractional purchase of shares. Averaging is more common with equity  funds rather than bond funds because of the greater volatility of the stock  market.  </P> <P> Most mutual fund companies require initial investments ranging from $250 to  $3,000 or so, with subsequent purchases of at least $50 to $250. However, Janus  Funds of Denver and Twentieth Century Investors of Kansas City -- two families  with good track records -- will accept contributions of any size for initial  purchases or subsequent investments.  </P> <P> You can automatically buy shares in a mutual fund by taking money from your  paycheck or bank account at regular intervals. There's usually no charge for  this service, other than the normal front-end sales fee if you invest in a load  fund.  </P> <P> An alternative is to transfer cash gradually into a stock or bond fund from a  money market portfolio within the same family. If you get a large chunk of cash  all of a sudden -- from a pension withdrawal or inheritance, for example --  this can be a good way to ease into the market, says Paul Merriman, head of the  Merriman Funds group in Seattle.  </P> <P> You don't have to set up an automatic dollar cost averaging program. You may  simply write a check each time you want to invest. However, there's a danger in  relying on your own impulses.  </P> <P> "When the market takes a big hit, that's when people tend to throw in the  towel," Merriman said. To succeed with an averaging strategy, you need to keep  investing through at least one full market cycle. Nobody likes to invest during  bearish phases, yet that's the time when prices are lowest.  </P> <P> In fact, there's substantial evidence that a dollar cost averaging strategy can  work nicely with a well-managed, well-diversified mutual fund.  </P> <P> American Funds Group of Los Angeles offers a worst-case illustration of dollar  cost averaging. Suppose you placed $5,000 into the company's American Mutual  Fund each year from 1970 through 1989. Further imagine that you had the unlucky  knack of making your investments exclusively on the worst possible day in each  calendar year -- such as Aug. 25, 1987, the high point before the market  crashed two months later. Would you show a big loss? Hardly.  </P> <P> As it turns out, your total investment of $100,000 would have grown to nearly  $538,000 at the end of 1989, representing a 14.3% compounded annual gain. The  moral of the story: It's more important to keep adding to your stake in a good  fund than to worry about the best times to buy along the way.  </P> <P> Of course, dollar cost averaging assumes that equity funds will rise over the  long term. That's a pretty solid bet, considering that the stock market has  declined in just 19 of the 64 years back to 1926. At any rate, it's certainly  wiser to keep plowing money into a well-diversified fund than a single stock,  because you never know if a company is going down for good.  </P> <P> One criticism of dollar cost averaging is that it addresses just half of the  investment equation -- it tells you how and when to buy shares but provides no  guidelines for selling. Michael E. Edleson, assistant professor of business  administration at the Harvard School of Business, believes that he has found an  answer.  </P> <P> Writing in the American Assn. of Individual Investors Journal, Edleson  recommends an approach that he describes as "value averaging." Rather than  invest, say, $100 each month, you would instead follow a strategy of making  your fund grow by $100 a month. In other words, you would first figure out how  much your portfolio went up or down during the month, then add -- or even  subtract -- money to make sure the overall increase amounted to $100.  </P> <P> For example, suppose you had $4,000 in a fund on Aug. 31 and wanted to see it  grow by $100 a month, to $4,100 as of Sept. 30. Here's how you would respond to  three different scenarios:  </P> <P> * If a falling market during September pulled down your investment in the fund  to, say, $3,900, you would add $200 to reach the $4,100 level.  </P> <P> * If a slowly rising market increased your stake to $4,030, you would add $70  for the month.  </P> <P> * If a strong rally carried you up to $4,270 during September, you would sell  $170 worth of shares.  </P> <P> Edleson claims that his system is more profitable than regular dollar cost  averaging. "It forces you to buy even more than usual when the share price goes  exceptionally low," he said. In addition, it prompts you to sell shares during  rallies.  </P> <P> He tested the two averaging methods using his own money during a 25-month  period from 1986 to 1988. Edleson wound up investing at an average cost of  $4.07 a share using his system, compared to $4.85 for traditional dollar cost  averaging.  </P> <P> Edleson admits that his approach isn't perfect. It's more complicated than  regular dollar cost averaging, and it can force you to regularly incur capital  gains taxes on shares you sell at a profit. Also, you might be subject to  minimum investment or redemption restrictions, depending on the fund company.  </P> <P> The key point is that an averaging strategy of some type can help you come to  terms with volatility. As a result, you can stay invested for the long haul,  with less emotional wear and tear along the way.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW AN INVESTOR WOULD FARE WITH DOLLAR COST AVERAGING  </P> <P> The following shows how an investor would have fared with a dollar cost  averaging approach to investing in stocks. It assumes that the investor placed  $100 a month every month from January, 1978, through December, 1989, into the  T. Rowe Price New Era Fund. It also assumes that all dividends and capital  gains were reinvested. The investor's outlay during the 12-year period would  have been $14,400. Below are three representative years.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.43IN:2.00IN:2.55IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Amount  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Account Value  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Change From  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C">  Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Invested  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> at Year-End  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Previous Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1981 (Down Market)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1,200  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $7,105  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Down $20  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1984 (Flat Market)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1,200  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $13,840  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Up $1,650  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1989 (Bullish Market)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1,200  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $41,016  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Up $9,080  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

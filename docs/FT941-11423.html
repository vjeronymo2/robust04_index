			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Management: Time to walk the talk - New calls to reverse the damaging proliferation of jargon First there was management jargon. Now there is management jargon to describe the management jargon. 'Corporate graffiti', the latest addition to the language, is a derogatory term for a company's unthinking use of the lingo. It is (literally) the catch-phrase to end all catch-phrases. It is high time there was a backlash against this opaque, ugly and cliche-ridden language. Action-centred leadership. Benchmarking. Competences. Downsize. Empowerment. Globalisation. You can go through the alphabet many times without exhausting the vocabulary of management-speak. Open any management book and you may find yourself suffering from what is known in the jargon as the 'mego' syndrome - my eyes glaze over. 'Corporate graffiti' has been coined by Tom Robertson, newly appointed professor of marketing at London Business School. The notion came to him one day when he was thumbing through annual reports of US computer companies. He noticed that each claimed to be 'market driven', and talked about 'time-based competition' and 'core-based competences'. He regards these notions as the 'holy grail of management' (instinctively coining another phase) and argues that 'the holy grail is dysfunctional as it distracts from getting on with the business'. Robertson is not alone. At the Industrial Society, Andrew Forrest, director of 'human resources', is staging a rearguard action, teaching companies that if they want to say anything they should use words that everyone can grasp. 'It's like fighting through fog to understand what they are talking about,' he says. Some management talk is simply naff. 'Global' means no more than international. 'Marketplace' is a cute way of saying market. Then there are the euphemisms. Enlightened organisations do not have workers any more. They have 'people'. Caring companies do not fire people, instead they 'downsize' the organisation. Some go one step further and engage in 'rightsizing', fearing that the word 'down' might have negative connotations. Companies of the 1990s have 'partners', not suppliers. They do, of course, still have customers whom they claim to worship. Unisys, the US computer company, has developed a 'customerise philosophy' to get the message across. Next are phrases to describe a company's professed beliefs. We have corporate missions, corporate value statements, corporate visions. The nouns are bad enough but the verbs are worse. We are meant to 'live' the mission, 'inbed' the vision. The work force has to 'buy into' all new initiatives (ie to accept them) and thereafter 'take ownership'. But the area in which jargon has made the most serious inroads is in business strategy. Total quality management, business process re-engineering, benchmarking, learning organisations, time-based competition, the list goes on. There is often a good excuse for these phrases. Most are a shorthand for a more complicated notion. The danger is that different people mean different things by the words, or they just use the words because it makes them feel in the swing of things. 'Business process re-engineering doesn't come tripping off the tongue. People have five different ideas of what the phase means, and so it simply causes confusion,' says Forrest. It is not hard to see why the words have proliferated. One reason is that all management writers and consultants want to be famous; they come up with an idea and then give it a brand name. Once created the words catch on. According to Forrest, people use the words to make themselves appear more knowledgeable then they are. 'It is easy to slip into jargon to make people think you have something snappy to say,' he says. Some industries are more prone to jargon than others. The electronics companies are perhaps the worst. While others talk of the office as the 'workplace', computer companies have gone one step further and call it the 'enterprise environment'. So what can be done? Management speak is so entrenched it is hard to see how it could change. Yet Robertson thinks things will change if companies direct their attention to the subject rather than the words. There is a special piece of management jargon that says just that. Companies should 'walk the talk'.</p>

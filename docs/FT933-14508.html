			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke trip aims to ease tensions MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, will next week make an official visit to Germany in an attempt to strengthen economic relations between the two countries and smooth over any residual tensions between the Treasury and Bundesbank, Peter Norman writes. In a packed two-day schedule Mr Clarke will dine with industrialists and bankers in Frankfurt on Sunday, lunch with Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president-designate, on Monday and meet Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, in his home city of Munich later that day. In Munich the chancellor will give a speech that is expected to develop the UK's ideas for improving Europe's international competitiveness through supply side policies. UK officials played down suggestions that the chancellor would be pushing for German interest rate cuts. But while Mr Clarke's trip may lack a specific policy goal, it will mark a notable change of style from that of Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / De Klerk comes under fire over death squads MR Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general of the African National Congress (ANC), yesterday criticised Mr F W de Klerk, the South African president, for failing to act against security force death squads which have targeted anti-apartheid activists. Former members of the South African Defence Force and the police have alleged that security force members have been involved in hundreds of deaths of activists in recent years. 'We have reason to believe he (Mr de Klerk) knows and has known all along. . . and has done nothing to stop it,' Mr Ramaphosa told journalists in Cape Town. Mr Roelf Meyer, the defence minister, denied the claims and urged Mr Ramaphosa to present evidence to a government commission of inquiry. Mr Ramaphosa took a more conciliatory line on key political issues such as interim government. He indicated that the ANC was willing to negotiate with the government over the issue of a proposed white referendum to approve constitutional changes which would end white domination. Previously ANC leaders have ruled out the referendum, which would give whites a veto over political change. He also appeared willing to negotiate with Pretoria over the issue of electing blacks to an interim parliament.</p>

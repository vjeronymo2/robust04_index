			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> MINOR IMPACT SEEN IN BUILDING FREEZE  </P> <P> City Councilman Robert A. Curtis' proposal to freeze all new development in the  city until its general plan is complete would have little impact on future  growth, a spokeswoman for the Mission Viejo Co. said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We're still researching the issue, but 95% of our residential units have  either been built or have already received approval," said Wendy Wetzel, the  company spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Curtis, who presented the idea to the council Monday, noted that more than  1,800 new building permits have been issued by the city in less than two years,  and he says the proposal is needed to control development until the city  completes work on its general plan, a land-use document that will guide growth.  Curtis said he expects the plan to be finished within a year, and he advocates  freezing all new permits until then.  </P> <P> "There are many undeveloped areas of the city, and we need to keep them intact  until we can put together our plan," he said. "Otherwise, what good is the  plan?"  </P> <P> Curtis, who is facing the likelihood of a recall election next year, has  tangled often and openly with the Mission Viejo Co. The company and the  councilman split over Curtis' support for annexing Aegean Hills, a pie-shaped  community south of Mission Viejo, and the company is helping finance the recall  effort.  </P> <P> Despite her comments downplaying the significance of Curtis' proposal, Wetzel  said the Mission Viejo Co. would not take a formal position on the idea until  it came before the council. If it reaches that point, she added, the company  would make its views public.  </P> <P> Curtis has asked the city staff to prepare an analysis of his proposal within  the next several weeks, after which the councilman says he intends to press  ahead for a vote on the matter.

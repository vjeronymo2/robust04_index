			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Tuesday [18 January] the State Duma adopted a  provision on its temporary regulations regarding activity of its  committees and commissions.    According to this document, the State Duma forms its  committees "on the basis of proportional representativeness of  deputy associations." The State Duma determines the number of  each committee, "which should be not less than 12 and not more  than 35 deputies."    The provision says that every deputy, except the chairman,  his deputies, and leaders of deputy associations and  deputy-members of the government, should be in one of the Duma's  committees.    A committee's session is considered valid if more than half  of the total number of its members are attending the session.  Decisions are adopted by simple majority of votes given the  number of deputies attending the session.</p>

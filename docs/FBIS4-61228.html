			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Military Courier" program: Video report by Igor </F> Krondo and Gennadiy Makarychev, identified by caption, from  Zapad-94 Air Force exercises]    [Text] [Krondo over video of screen reading "Zapad"  Information System and military control room] In accordance  with the plan for operational training, Zapad-94 [West-94]  command and staff exercises have been held in the Russian Air  Force. During the exercises Air Force command and control, the  formation of Air Force groupings in areas under threat, and  combat operations to thwart an enemy invasion by air were  rehearsed.    In addition to staff command and control organs, combat  aircraft were also involved in the exercises. Long-range Tu-22  MZ [as heard] carried out combat training launches of cruise  missiles against ground targets. Both crews gained excellent  ratings.

The Tu-160 carried out tactical launches of missiles.    Su-27 fighter-interceptors provided air cover for the bomber  aircraft. Su-24 and Su-25 frontal bombers delivered strikes  against the air defense facilities, airfields, and reserves of  the nominal enemy. MiG-29 fighters provided air cover for our  troops and ground facilities. Essentially, these exercises were  the culmination of the winter training period. They have shown  that, despite everything, the Air Force is in a state of  constant combat readiness and capable of implementing the tasks  for which it is designated.

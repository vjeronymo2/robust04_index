			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Holiday executives charged with fraud TWO SENIOR executives of the Land Travel coach company, which collapsed a year ago, have been charged with fraudulent trading, Avon and Somerset Police said yesterday. Mr Valere Tjolle, who was chairman of the Bath-based company, and Mrs Theresa McDermott, who was company secretary, are to appear before Bath magistrates on August 25. The police, who have been investigating the company since its collapse in July last year, said the two were charged this week after a fraud squad interview. An estimated 40,000 holidaymakers were believed to have lost their money in the collapse. Land Travel was not a member of the Association of British Travel Agents and had not arranged a bond to protect customers' money. Mr Tjolle bought the company from the Granada Group in 1990. At the time of its collapse the company was offering three-day coach holidays in Paris or Brussels for Pounds 49 and 10 days in Poland for Pounds 159. In the years that Mr Tjolle owned the company it made heavy losses. In 1990-91 losses were Pounds 1.8m and in 1991-92 they were Pounds 2.7m. Land Travel's case led to warnings by the industry that further failures were likely. European Community rules which came into effect at the start of the year were aimed at ensuring that customers would not lose their money in the event of collapse. Package travel companies now have to arrange bonding or insurance on customers' behalf. The effectiveness of the new regulations was put in doubt by the collapse last May of SFV Holidays, a small Oxford-based company which was unbonded. It emerged that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had told the company that it did not need bonding because it allowed customers to specify which ferry service they wished to use.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> BADER JOINS RECALL DRIVE  </P> <P> Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona) has joined the campaign to recall  Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, accusing him of "abuse of the public trust"  through intimidation of employees and of favoritism in the handling of city  contracts.  </P> <P> Bader, a former Pomona mayor who served with Bryant on the council in the early  1970s, said he has never, until now, signed a recall petition. But he said  Bryant should be removed from office for reasons that amount to "political  corruption."  </P> <P> He accused Bryant of engineering the firing of Police Chief Richard M. Tefank,  making personal attacks on police officers, intimidating employees, attempting  to cancel the services of the Pomona Valley Humane Society because of his  "personal dislike" for the director and of denying payments to another city  contractor "for political reasons."  </P> <P> Bryant said he was not surprised by Bader's decision to join the recall  campaign, saying that Bader "is one of the good old boys" who used to control  city government, but are now out of power. Bryant said Bader's influence among  Pomona voters "is nil. I don't worry about Bader."  </P></p>

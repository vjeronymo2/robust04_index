			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Government urged to include track in ScotRail sell-off The Scottish Office is privately lobbying the Department of Transport to amend its rail privatisation proposals for Scotland. Potential bidders for ScotRail have warned the government that rail privatisation will succeed in Scotland only if the franchise holder is given control over the track. Under present plans, franchises will be offered to run railways while track and signalling will be operated by Railtrack, a separate company. The Scottish Office has told potential bidders for ScotRail that it is sympathetic to their demands for combining services with ownership of track and signalling. The Scottish Office yesterday said rail privatisation in Scotland was the responsibility of the Department of Transport. It pointed out, however, that Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, said bids in favour of vertical integration may be considered for ScotRail. If a prospective operator submitted a bid that included control over infrastructure, it would be left to Mr Roger Salmon, the government-appointed franchising director, to decide whether to accept it. Under the present guidelines laid down by the Department of Transport, Mr Salmon would be highly unlikely to do so. Any bid aiming to control the track in Scotland would also be bitterly resisted by Railtrack, which is chaired by Mr Bob Horton. The Treasury strongly backs the Department of Transport's decision not to relax its rail privatisation plans in Scotland. According to a Whitehall official, both departments are 'fed up with the Scottish Office continually pleading a special case north of the border'. Nonetheless, pressure is growing in Scotland for ways to be found to bypass the Transport Department's opposition. Mr Derek Scott, finance director of Stagecoach, the acquisitive bus operator which is a likely bidder for the ScotRail franchise, said privatisation would have a better chance of success if the Department of Transport kept an open mind on the ownership of the track. Mr Chris Green, who will run ScotRail from April as a 'shadow franchise', said that while he did not want to commit himself at this early stage, it was clear that the Scottish franchise was 'the most 'self-contained of the lot', with 95 per cent of trains never leaving Scotland. ScotRail is one of the first seven franchises to be offered. The government hopes to see ScotRail being run by the private sector by early 1995, after running as a stand-alone concern within BR from next April.</p>

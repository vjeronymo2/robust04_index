			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Management: Safety network spreads like fire On a frosty, damp November night, a tanker loaded with flammable chemicals slews off the road and bursts into flames at Seal Sands, the chemical and petrochemical industry complex at the mouth of the River Tees. A gatehouse attendant at one of the sites edging the road grabs the telephone and rings Cleveland county fire brigade headquarters at Hartlepool to raise the alarm. At one time, this would have been the prelude to a long, laborious ring-around, as the emergency services tried to alert the various companies which make Teesside the UK's largest concentration of hazardous industry. Engaged phone lines, problems in finding the right person to inform and possible misunderstandings of technical information were all potential pitfalls in communicating vitally important messages to staff responsible for safety. But now, thanks to a personal computer and telex network launched yesterday, information and advice on accidents and emissions can be relayed within a maximum of two minutes, and often within seconds, to Teesside sites handling hazardous materials. They, in turn, can relay information back as fast, using the same system, to fire brigade HQ, which will then disseminate it via the network to other hazard sites, including chemical and petrochemical manufacturers and storage companies and Hartlepool nuclear power station. The system includes information on wind speed, the risks posed by the accident or emission and details of substances released, including the name by which they are known on individual sites and their standard categorisation. Designed to be easy to use, it is intended to maximise speed and scope of information, while minimising the ambiguity and timewasting which, in the worst case, could cause serious injury or even loss of life. The new Pounds 125,000 Cleveland Chemical Alarm System was designed by British Telecommunications and paid for by 14 hazard-related companies on the network, which also includes Cleveland Police. The 14 include ICI, Tioxide, Phillips Petroleum, British Rail and BASF. Other Teesside companies have expressed interest in joining the network, which can be easily expanded. The new system replaces a less sophisticated telex and printer network introduced by Cleveland fire brigade and Teesside industry in 1981. The old network, although a vast improvement on the ring-around technique, was much slower, and sent information only in one direction, from the fire brigade to industry. BT claims the new network, which combines PCs, fast, dedicated telex lines and specially-written software, to be a world first and hopes to market it for other similar petrochemical complexes.</p>

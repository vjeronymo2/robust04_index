			<p>BFN     [Text] Home affairs minister and IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has denied that the  transfer of 1.2 million hectares of land to King Goodwill  Zwelithini shortly before the election had played a role in the  IFP's participation in the elections. He was answering  journalists' questions in Cape Town shortly before the first  cabinet sitting. He said the legislation adopted by Parliament  had persuaded him to participate in the elections.    Dr. Buthelezi said he had held talks lasting an  hour-and-a-half with President Mandela, during which he had  explained that the land had been transferred to the KwaZulu  government three years ago. The KwaZulu government had decided  to transfer the land to communities. Dr. Buthelezi insisted that  there was nothing new or secret about the transaction.    President Mandela said after the talks that he was satisfied  with the outcome and that the matter would be referred to the  IFP and the ANC.</p>

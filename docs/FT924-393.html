			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Books: Hardly a case of mind over matter - Michael Horovitz analyses a psychiatrist IN THE PSYCHIATRIST'S CHAIR by Anthony Clare Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 304 pages THE NAME of 50-year-old Dubliner Anthony Clare has probably become known to more people in Britain than that of any other living psychiatrist. Two decades ago, the same probably was true of the Glaswegian RD Laing (1927-89), but for different reasons and via different media. Laing retained a high public profile from when when The Divided Self, his first book, polarised the mental health establishment with its radically human approach to schizophrenics - but he went on communicating mainly through books, the experimental community houses he founded, and the private practice of 'anti-psychiatry.' Every summer since 1982, Radio 4 has broadcast In the Psychiatrist's Chair, a series of interviews between Clare and sundry literary and arts celebrities. There have been about 70 to date, of which 12 are transcribed in Clare's book with his introductions and afterthoughts. One of the more intellectually energetic of these turns out to be the dialogue with Laing, who arrived at the studio drunk but gradually sobered up in response to Clare's questions and gave an unsparingly lucid exposition of his life and work. At one point, Clare suggested Laing might be 'too sensitive to be a doctor.' The Scotsman admitted he had not bothered to keep his sensitivity 'within a fairly formally ordered frame of conduct. I get tossed and turned.' The contrasts between the operations of these two shrinks underline, for me, some distinctions between the counter-culture which Laing helped to define in the 1960s and the more commercial, careerist and conformist simplifications of the Thatcher years. Laing, though often apparently self-indulgent, capricious and extreme, was committed intensely to his diverse patients and controversial causes. Clare, for the most part, endorses passively the vanities of his collaborators: the extent to which you might relish the results will depend on your reactions to the respective personalities being explored. No more than a handful of moments in these published broadcasts feel at all challenging psychologically. The chats with Ken Dodd, Peter Hall, Eartha Kitt, Jimmy Savile and other showbiz pros are, patently, programmed by the subjects, not the interviewer. Clare's mask of clinical detachment did prompt novelist Tom Sharpe, agony aunt Claire Rayner, tennis star Arthur Ashe, and actor Anthony Hopkins into convincingly spontaneous examinations of their childhood, family and love-hate vicissitudes. But most of these interviewees are content to spin out their long-rehearsed and well-received yarns. It seems a pity that the 'Top 12' mentality ruled out of this selection the few dramatically revealing self-portraits induced by Clare's blandly professional couch-side manner. For example, the most glaringly unpleasant subject I remember from the broadcasts, David Irving (famed apologist for and historian of Nazi Germany), provided the most staggering vindication I have ever heard of Dr Johnson's view that 'No man was ever writ down but by himself.' Perhaps future series and publications will yield more such enlightening encounters.</p>

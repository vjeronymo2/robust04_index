			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN, 80, KILLED AS CAR RAMS INTO FLOWER SHOP  </P> <P> An elderly woman was killed and another seriously injured Wednesday when their  car allegedly ran a red light and plowed through a La Habra intersection,  ramming two cars before smashing through the front of a flower shop.  </P> <P> Ilma Caple, 80, of El Monte died of massive internal injuries, while the  driver, Nannie Herford, 81, of Duarte, suffered internal injuries and was  hospitalized in serious condition.  </P> <P> The drivers of the other cars, Mireya Ortega, 26, of La Habra and Marie Garcia,  41, of Brea were not injured in the 9:25 a.m. accident, La Habra Police Sgt.  Phil Stufflebean said.  </P> <P> Witnesses told police that Herford was southbound on Beach Boulevard when she  went through a red light at the La Habra Boulevard intersection, Stufflebean  said. Her Chevrolet Chevette hit the other two cars, and the accelerator  apparently stuck, he said.  </P> <P> The car jumped a curb, sped across a parking lot and bashed through the  storefront, coming to rest inside, Stufflebean said.  </P> <P> No one inside the flower shop was injured. But the building, nestled inside a  small commercial center, was deemed uninhabitable by authorities because of  extensive damage, Stufflebean said.  </P> <P> A medical helicopter took Caple to UCI Medical Center in Orange, but she died  shortly after arrival, Stufflebean said. Herford was taken to Friendly Hills  Regional Medical Center in La Habra, where a spokeswoman said she was treated  in the emergency room before being admitted.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Area Source Finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The HAP emitted from this source category include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benzene, toluene, hexane, xylene, and ethylbenzene from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline and crude oil loading as well as approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 HAP from alcohols and specialty chemicals. Of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 1,800 marine vessel terminals in this source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category, at least 60 emit 25 ton/year of HAP or more, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are therefore considered major sources. In addition, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 112(a)(1), a marine vessel terminal may be a part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a major source if it is part of a ``group of stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources located within a contiguous area and under common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control that emits or has the potential to emit considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons per year or more of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of hazardous air pollutants.'' There are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 600 refineries and chemical production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities in the United States; all of these are considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be major sources. While the Agency does not have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data in its marine vessel data base to estimate how many of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these facilities have bulk marine loading terminals that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contiguous to and under the same control as the main  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility, there is a high correlation between large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refineries and production facilities and large bulk loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminals. Therefore, at a minimum, for purposes of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, the Agency assumed that approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 300 terminals are major sources because they are likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be located at major sources such as refineries or chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production facilities. This leaves approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,200 facilities that are considered likely area sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the emissions data contained in the Agency's data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base, these 1,200 facilities represent only 2 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide HAP emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 112(c)(3) states that categories of area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources emitting HAP may be listed and regulated if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator finds the sources, individually or in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate, present a threat of adverse effects to human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health or the environment. Based on limited data available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Agency, the Administrator is unable to determine a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threat of adverse effects at this time. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency is proposing not to regulate such area sources in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rulemaking. This is consistent with the Agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision not to include in its initial list of source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories those categories that contained no major sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and for which the Agency had not made a finding of threat of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse effects (57 FR 31576, July 16, 1992). The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may, however, revisit these sources in the future, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional data become available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Determination of Subcategories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The source category to be regulated is major sources of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine vessel loading and unloading operations. As part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NESHAP development process, the source category was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated to determine if subcategorization of the source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category was justified. Although the Act does not specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criteria from which subcategories can be developed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 112(d)(1) of the Act states that the ``Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within a category or subcategory *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Agency believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these same criteria are acceptable criteria to use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making subcategory determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Size appears to be a likely candidate for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguishing feature, and using total estimated HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions as an indicator for size, the EPA evaluated marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank vessel loading operations to determine whether it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to subcategorize the source category on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis of size. The limit for determining subcategories was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined in 0.5 Mg increments of HAP emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.5 Mg/yr to 2.0 Mg/yr. A subcategory based on 1 Mg of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP emissions per year was selected for the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons. First, facilities that emit less than 1 Mg of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions are likely to be area sources and therefore not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the proposed standards, or are facilities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are represented by relatively minimal, episodic emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, a typical river barge holds 10,000 barrels or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 420,000 gallons of gasoline. An uncontrolled facility below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a 1-Mg cutoff could be loading less than 30 barges per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These facilities also typically emit less frequently than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities emitting more than 1 Mg/yr and typically only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> load a single commodity. Additionally, these facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also tend to load (and therefore emit) commodities having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower vapor pressures than commodities loaded at other,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larger, facilities. Also, facilities that emit 1 Mg or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of HAP emissions contribute approximately 98 percent of HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions to the national inventory.

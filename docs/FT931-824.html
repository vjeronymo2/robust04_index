			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Your last chance of the tax year to make savings - John Authers explains how you can take advantage of the next few days to choose the right investments and tax options THE TAX clock is ticking. Next week is your last chance to take advantage of several tax allowances for 1992-93. Tax-planning is a bedrock of long-term financial planning, but it is less important than choosing investments with the right risk profile, and the right flexibility, to suit you. There is no point in losing money, or tying it up when you need it, just for tax-efficiency. This may not chime with what you hear from sales representatives. A large proportion of the financial services industry describes the end of the tax year as its 'harvest season', and the need for urgency provides them with a great selling opportunity. As John Cole, of Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, says: 'There's nothing this industry likes more than a deadline.' So two questions need to be asked: would the investment make some kind of sense without the tax advantages, and do the tax savings outweigh any extra charges? These tax-saving opportunities are still open to you: Personal Pensions These offer the most tax-efficient form of retirement saving, as all contributions paid into a personal pension are grossed up at your top marginal rate. The fund then builds up free of income and capital gains tax. The snag is that the money has to stay in the pension fund until you retire. Then you can take 25 per cent of it as tax-free cash, but the rest must go towards buying an annuity, which will be taxed as income. The amount you can contribute in one tax year is expressed as a proportion of your earnings, and varies according to your age at the beginning of the tax year. The scales are as follows: up to 35: 17.5 per cent 36 to 45: 20 per cent 46 to 50: 25 per cent 51 to 55: 30 per cent 56 to 60: 35 per cent 61 to 74: 40 per cent. If you did not use your personal pension allowance in the last tax year (1991-92), then you can top it up this year. To qualify for this carryback relief you must pay the contribution by April 5, and then make the election to the Inland Revenue by May 5, according to Cole. Topping up a personal pension is sensible if you genuinely do not need excess income. As ever, try to choose a company with low charges. Additional Voluntary Contributions If you contribute to a company pension scheme, you are not allowed to have a personal pension on top. However, if your company scheme contributions are less than 15 per cent of your salary, you can make up the difference in Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs). Your total contributions must not be more than 15 per cent. AVCs are virtually identical to personal pensions, but differ in one important respect - all of the fund from an AVC when it matures must be used to buy an annuity, and there is no tax-free cash. The annuity is not tax-efficient, and you may prefer to retain the flexibility. Personal Equity Plans Peps, which allow investments in shares, investment trusts and unit trusts, are increasingly considered as an alternative to AVCs. You pay net income into them, so there is no tax relief on entry, but then the funds, like pension funds, can grow free of income and capital gains tax. Those wanting income can draw gross dividends. Then the big advantage over pensions and AVCs is that the plans can be exited at any time, tax-free. If that sounds rosy, however, remember that Peps are only as strong as the equity investments they hold, and it may not be wise for those with small portfolios to enter the stock market at present. Peter Smith, of Hill Martin, says: 'I find it amusing that the stock market, as usual, is high just as the Pep deadline is approaching.' He does not bother with Peps for basic-rate taxpayers, as the extra charges needed to administer the plans can out-balance the tax advantages. For those who do not pay CGT (see below) gross dividends are the only advantage, and this has been reduced by the budget's changes to Advance Corporation Tax. Top-rate taxpayers wanting to invest in equities are still best advised to do so through a Pep, but basic rate payers should be very careful. Investments in Peps should normally be made on March 29, as most Peps offer a cooling-off period. By using an execution-only broker, however, some providers, such as Mercury, will allow you to invest until Monday, April 5. Married Couples Allowance Thanks to a provision of the 1992 budget, married couples have until April 5 to elect to have the married couples' tax allowance of Pounds 1720 transferred from the husband, to whom it is paid automatically, to the wife. They must do this using Inland Revenue Form 18. There is little point in doing this if both pay the same rate of tax, or if the husband pays top-rate tax. However, if the wife pays top-rate tax, the relief will be more valuable with her - a saving of Pounds 258 according to accountants Westbury Schotness. For non-taxpayers, it can increase their tax-free income. Mortgage Interest Relief Lower mortgage rates could carry with them a nasty tax sting in the tail, according to accountants Touche Ross. Those who want to avoid it will need to act now to have their tax codes changed. Falling interest rates mean a reduction in the amount of relief due on them. Most people get their relief via MIRAS, which adjusts automatically to changing interest rates, but those with unusual types of mortgages, such as those which allow the borrower to vary repayments, receive the relief through their PAYE code. This will reflect the interest paid in 1991-92, and so too much relief will have been given. The Inland Revenue could then send a bill for payment, in a lump sum. According to Maurice Parry-Wingfield of Touche Ross, some 'will be caught unawares by the unexpected bill, which may come to Pounds 375, or thereabouts'. Inheritance Tax Planning Some gifts made while you are alive can be exempt from inheritance tax irrespective of when the donor finally dies. First, there is an allowance of Pounds 3,000 per year which can be given away tax-free. All of this can go to one person, or it can be shared among several. The relief can be carried forward one year, so if you did not use this allowance in 1991-92 you can give a maximum of Pounds 6,000. In addition to this, you can make limitless small gifts of up to Pounds 250, without affecting the main Pounds 3,000 exemption. Gift Aid Philanthropists who have to pay top-rate tax for this tax year might make a donation via Gift Aid. Provided you give at least Pounds 250 to a charity this will be treated as net of basic rate tax. That allows the charity to reclaim 25 per cent from the Revenue, so they will receive Pounds 333. Top-rate taxpayers can reclaim the difference between the top and basic rate, which will be 15 per cent of the amount received by the charity (Pounds 50). So the charity would have received Pounds 333 for a total outlay of Pounds 200. Capital Gains Tax This most labyrinthine of taxes allows you to realise a maximum capital gain in any tax year of Pounds 5,800, without paying any tax. On gains greater than this, you must pay tax at your highest marginal rate of income tax. A top-rate income taxpayer will pay 40 per cent CGT. This gain is calculated once indexation, to reflect the rise in the retail prices index, has been taken into account. If you have realised a gain which has done no more than keep pace with inflation, then for CGT purposes you have made no gain at all. It is possible to make a loss in CGT terms, even though you have made a profit, if your investment failed to keep up with inflation. The accompanying table, updated monthly by the Inland Revenue, helps you calculate your indexation allowance. Multiplying the original investment by the indexation figure for the month in question shows the amount you can gain free of tax liability. For example, if you invested Pounds 10,000 in March 1982, CGT liability is calculated on the indexed cost of Pounds 17,470. Only if you sell it for more than Pounds 23,270 (the indexation allowance plus the Pounds 5,800 annual allowance) will any CGT be payable. 'Bed and breakfasting' - selling the shares one afternoon and buying them back the following morning - can limit the bill further by establishing gains or losses for the tax year. You can also realise gains this year to reduce the potential liability in future years, but this requires quite ambitious projections about the future. Business Expansion Schemes The BES is as tax-efficient as they come - the problem is whether the underlying investment stacks up. Investors in BES companies, most of which own housing and rent it under assured tenancy legislation, receive income tax relief at their top marginal rate. This means that those investing Pounds 1,000 will receive tax relief of Pounds 400. Maximum total BES investment for one tax year is Pounds 40,000, and shares must have been issued by the end of the year to qualify. The drawbacks are that you must hold on to the shares for five years to avoid forfeiting the relief, and that the underlying investment, residential property, might not make sense without the tax relief. Anyone in any doubt as to the danger of deadlines need only look at the BES  -tax relief on loans was disallowed in the Budget, catching several BES sponsors unawares, while schemes put together in a hurry last year ahead of the general election may also forfeit their tax relief. But the advantages for top-rate tax-payers are strong. Schemes with cash-backing from third-party banks can covenant to convert an effective investment of 60p into 115p after only five years, so top-rate taxpayers who are prudent could benefit greatly.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ CGT INDEXATION ALLOWANCES: FEBRUARY 1993  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Month        1982     1983    1984    1985    1986    1987  ------------------------------------------------------------------ January         -    1.680   1.598   1.522   1.442   1.388 February        -    1.673   1.592   1.510   1.437   1.382 March       1.747    1.670   1.587   1.496   1.435   1.380 April       1.713    1.647   1.566   1.464   1.421   1.363 May         1.701    1.640   1.560   1.458   1.419   1.362 June        1.696    1.636   1.556   1.455   1.419   1.362 July        1.695    1.627   1.558   1.457   1.423   1.363 August      1.695    1.620   1.543   1.454   1.419   1.359 September   1.696    1.613   1.540   1.454   1.412   1.355 October     1.687    1.607   1.531   1.452   1.410   1.349 November    1.679    1.602   1.526   1.447   1.398   1.342 December    1.682    1.597   1.527   1.445   1.393   1.344  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Month        1988     1989    1990    1991    1992    1993  ------------------------------------------------------------------ January     1.344    1.250   1.162   1.066   1.024   1.007 February    1.338    1.242   1.155   1.060   1.018 March       1.333    1.236   1.143   1.056   1.015 April       1.312    1.214   1.110   1.043   1.000 May         1.307    1.207   1.100   1.040   1.000 June        1.302    1.203   1.096   1.035   1.000 July        1.301    1.202   1.095   1.037   1.000 August      1.286    1.199   1.084   1.035   1.000 September   1.280    1.190   1.073   1.031   1.000 October     1.268    1.181   1.065   1.027   1.000 November    1.262    1.171   1.068   1.024   1.000 December    1.258    1.168   1.069   1.023   1.000  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Inland Revenue  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

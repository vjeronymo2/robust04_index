			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (CNS) -- The Beijing Higher  People's Court passed final judgment on Hong Kong reporter Xi  Yang and rejected his appeal by upholding the 12-year jail  sentence and deprivation of political rights for two years,  handed down by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court on March  28. The co-defendant Tian Ye, the deputy director of the office  of the foreign affairs bureau of the People's Bank of China, had  his original sentence of 15 years imprisonment and deprivation  of political rights for three years confirmed.    Xi Yang, on assignment for the newspaper MING PAO, went to  Beijing last June and July purportedly to cover the Sino-British  talks and the establishment of the preliminary working committee  to prepare for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The  court papers said that he did not apply to the authorities for  coverage as was required in accordance with state regulations.  Instead, he sent Tian Ye to steal and pry out state financial  and economic secrets. Tian Ye stole classified documents  involving sample banknotes, information on the sale of gold by  the central bank in the international market, and on the  adjustment of the exchange rate as well as documents on raising  the interest rate by the central bank. The court papers noted  that he illegally offered Xi Yang the documents which were, in  turn, included in articles published in MING PAO, an action  causing great economic damage to the state. The court said that  the crime committed by the two defendants was undeniable and  there was solid evidence to justify the sentence.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rhode Island failed to meet a deadline for eliminating prison overcrowding and  faces potential fines of $50 a day for each of the 147 excess inmates. The  intake center at the state prison complex held 397 people, said Joseph A.  DiNitto, assistant to Corrections Director John Moran. U.S. District Judge  Raymond Pettine, responding to a complaint from the American Civil Liberties  Union, had set a limit of 250 prisoners at the intake center and threatened to  impose fines of $50 per day for excess inmates. Pettine warned state officials  Jan. 31 that he would be "very hard-nosed about this" when he considers levying  fines at a March 13 hearing. DiNitto said the state has made a good-faith  effort to comply with the judge's order, removing 135 inmates from the intake  center since Wednesday.  </P></p>

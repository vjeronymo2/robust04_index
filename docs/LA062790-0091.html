			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTINENTAL BANK TO REVAMP, CUT 900 JOBS  </P> <P> Continental Bank Corp. said Tuesday that it would cut 900 jobs and certain  services, redrawing parts of a battle plan formulated by Chairman Thomas C.  Theobald after a 1984 federal bailout.  </P> <P> After undergoing the largest bank bailout in U.S. history, Continental has  focused on sophisticated corporate and institutional banking, downplaying the  traditional consumer.  </P> <P> It maintains that its restructuring is not a change in basic strategy but a  realignment of services with changing customer demands.  </P> <P> However, it is retrenching from a roughly three-year expansion into several  specialized areas, particularly global trading services. About 60% of the job  cuts will be from that segment.  </P> <P> The bank holding company, with assets of $31.3 billion, said it will set aside  $50 million to cover costs of the cuts. As a result, it expects to post an  unspecified second-quarter loss.  </P> <P> While analysts viewed the job and product reductions as essential to reducing  expenses, they said the retraction may not be enough to improve the bank's  profit performance this year.  </P> <P> "I certainly expected something greater than 900 people," said County NatWest  USA analyst Stephen Berman. "I don't know whether it's enough."  </P></p>

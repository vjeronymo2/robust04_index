			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: Through a glass darkly - Style What is it with Ray-Bans, exactly? How is it that they've become the optical equivalent of Levi's - casual-dress Americana that no-one can now live without? Heretical as this may sound, are they necessarily the best sunglasses, or even the ones with the most desirable label? Is there an alternative to trying to look like Tom Cruise or one of the Blues Brothers? Well, if you want to get away from that Ray-Bans gangster/used car dealer look, but are desperate for a name with which to impress your friends, the most obvious alternative is Armani. Armani sunglasses (as opposed to the cheaper Emporio Armani range) not only come in the latest styles (little lozenge-shaped James Joyce-style sunspecs being very popular at the moment), but are also surprisingly durable. They carry a two-year guarantee - most sunglasses are only guaranteed for one year - use glass lenses (for better vision) with anti-reflective coatings, and will stand up to considerable wear and tear. Prices range from Pounds 115 to Pounds 180. Serengeti and Vuarnet are also worth mentioning. Serengeti are American, traditionally-styled, well-made, appealingly low-key glasses with photochromic glass lenses; and are aimed heavily at car drivers who want something that will cut out the glare but still allow them to see where they're going. Prices are between Pounds 89 and Pounds 125. Vuarnet - somewhere between Pounds 50 and Pounds 75 - are French action men's sunglasses, extremely tough, extremely black and wrap-around. They are ideal for skiing and other dynamic sports activities. But if you really want to be different, you must hit California: this is where Oakley and REVO sunglasses come from - sunglasses which, if you are a serious fan, leave Ray-Bans standing. REVO's frame styles are smart mainstream; but their lenses are full of NASA technology - pricey but extremely effective. Their H20 range, for instance, has a glare-reducing treatment which allows fishermen and water sports enthusiasts to see through the surface of the water to what's below. Moreover, most REVO's come not with the usual drab black or brown lenses but with those bearing the most stunningly coloured reflective surfaces, transforming them into objects of weird beauty. Expect to pay between Pounds 120 and Pounds 170. Even REVO's, however, have a hard time matching Oakleys. Oakleys are science fiction: radically-styled one-piece wrap-around shades with detachable arms and nosepieces, available in an extraordinary, lurid rainbow of colours. Pounds 110 will buy you a complete pair, while a further Pounds 60 will buy you a different, interchangeable lens set. They and the other brands mentioned can be found at Sunglass Hut, Selfridge's and good opticians.</p>

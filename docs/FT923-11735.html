			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Benetton MD steps down BENETTON, the Italian clothing group, suffered an unexpected blow yesterday with the announcement that Mr Emilio Fossati is to step down as managing director. The news triggered a slump in the share price to L10,788 from L11,320 on Tuesday. Benetton, which is controlled by four members of the founding family, has had some difficulty retaining senior executives from outside the immediate family circle. In 1990, Mr Aldo Palmeri, a former Bank of Italy official and Mr Fossati's immediate predecessor, left the company for a top job at Citibank in Milan. Mr Fossati, a former managing director of the Mondadori publishing group, is to begin a new career as an entrepreneur. He will remain on Benetton's board until 1994. His functions as managing director will be taken up by Mr Gilberto Benetton, the chairman, pending the appointment of a successor. Mr Giuseppe Bruno, for eight years in charge of the London branch of Credito Italiano and most recently the head of the bank's domestic and foreign markets division, has been appointed joint managing director.</p>

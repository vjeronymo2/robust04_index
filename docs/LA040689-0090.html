			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITTIER UNDETERRED BY LEGAL SETBACK;  </P> <P> SEARCH FOR ADULT-BUSINESS LAW CONTINUES  </P> <P> Only hours after the city lost its last legal fight over the constitutionality  of an ordinance regulating X-rated businesses, City Manager Thomas G. Mauk was  enthusiastically talking about a new way to keep adult entertainment out of  Whittier.  </P> <P> "I think it was and continues to be an important issue in this community," Mauk  said of the battle that began 12 years ago, after the Pussycat Theater in  Uptown Whittier began screening adult movies. "I think we'll come right back  with some recommendations for a new ordinance."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal Rebuffed  </P> <P> This week, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider Whittier's appeal of a  federal court ruling that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it would  have effectively forced the city's adult businesses out of town.  </P> <P> In 1977, when the City Council first passed the ordinance, there were about 15  adult businesses in Whittier. Now, there are none. The Pussycat, the last  remaining X-rated business, closed after being damaged in the October, 1987,  earthquake and its owners say it will switch to general audience movies when it  reopens in about six months.  </P> <P> Yet Whittier officials are determined to continue the battle that has cost the  city close to $500,000 in legal fees. Mayor Victor A. Lopez says it is  important to keep Whittier, a 101-year-old city with Quaker roots, "free of  those kinds of things" in the future.  </P> <P> "I've got eight grandkids here and I want this to be a nice place for them to  live," Lopez said. "I'm ready to fight for this principle. . . . People have  died for a lot less principle than that."  </P> <P> Jonathan Coda, president of theater owner Walnut Properties Inc., called the  battle "a total waste of taxpayers' money." Whittier has spent about $300,000  on the case, and the Supreme Court's decision means the city will also have to  pay Walnut's court costs of $150,000 to $200,000, Mauk said.  </P> <P> "They want to go more, more, more?" Coda asked when told of Whittier's plans  for a new adult business ordinance. "Why don't they just forget about it and  use the money to improve their city?"  </P> <P> At issue is a zoning ordinance that would have prohibited businesses from  selling sexually explicit material within 1,000 feet of churches or schools and  within 500 feet of residences. The City Council passed the ordinance in 1977  after Walnut Properties bought the old Wardman Theater in the heart of the  Uptown business district and began showing movies that included "Take My Body"  and "Things My Mother Taught Me."  </P> <P> Such risque fare raised the eyebrows and the ire of local residents, some of  whom began picketing the theater. The ordinance passed by the City Council  would have forced the Pussycat to move since it is within one block of four  churches, and would have affected another 15 or so adult businesses in town  during the late 1970s. The other businesses either closed or moved in the four  or five years after the City Council adopted the adult business ordinance, Mauk  said.  </P> <P> Walnut Properties, which owns a statewide chain of adult theaters, immediately  sued to block enforcement of the ordinance, beginning a legal battle that ended  Monday when the Supreme Court refused to consider the case. The refusal meant a  1988 U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals court ruling invalidating the ordinance  will stand.  </P> <P> "We are thrilled to death," Coda said. "It's a victory not just for Walnut  Properties, but for the people who choose to go into an adult theater."  </P> <P> Walnut Properties officials believed they were through fighting Whittier in  1985, when a panel of 9th Circuit Court judges decided the ordinance was  unconstitutional because the city did not provide justification for the  1,000-foot limit. But in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a similar case  involving the Seattle suburb of Renton and decided that such limits were  constitutional as long as there were alternate sites for adult businesses.  </P> <P> The appeals court, ordered to reconsider Whittier's ordinance in light of the  Renton decision, found a "glaring" absence of alternate sites in Whittier.  </P> <P> "Not only does it effectively deny (the theater owner) a reasonable opportunity  to open and operate an adult theater within the city," the 9th Circuit Court  opinion said, "but it also would force the closure of all adult businesses  existing at the time the ordinance was passed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Ordinance Mulled  </P> <P> City Manager Mauk said Whittier may now try to regulate adult businesses  through an ordinance that would require owners to obtain a special permit from  the City Council. The new ordinance would include the 1,000-foot limit upheld  in the Renton case, Mauk said, but would increase the number of alternate sites  for adult businesses by allowing exceptions through a special permit.  </P> <P> Walnut Properties attorney Stanley Fleishman predicted that such an ordinance  would be rejected by the courts. "What they're trying to do is say there will  not be any adult businesses in the city of Whittier," Fleishman said. "The  reason they keep on failing (in court) is because they're trying to do what  they're not allowed to do constitutionally."  </P> <P> Although Walnut's court challenges have kept Whittier from enforcing its adult  business ordinance, Fleishman noted that the controversy has accomplished what  the city set out to do.  </P> <P> The legal fight is "not just a waste of money," Fleishman said. "They have  driven everybody out."  </P></p>

Consequently in the two stage RO  process using SU-700 for the first stage and SU-900S for the  second one, high resistivity of product water, which is equal to  the primary ion exchange process (5-10 M_O_-cm), can be  obtained.    ``SU-700P'' is the RO membrane module for post-treatment of  ion exchange process, and has high rejection of TOC and special  cleanliness without self-elution. Consequently an induction  period to attain an original TOC level of feed water can be  shortened to less than several hours, and the TOC level finally  reached can be 8-10 ppb lower than the original level of feed  water TOC concentration (10-20 ppb) by using this module.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   We have already developed several kinds of high performance  polyamide composite membranes for reverse osmosis. They have  replaced cellulose acetate membranes in the field of ultrapure  water production, seawater desalination, softening and  desalination of brackish water, and recovery of valuable  materials. In the conventional ultrapure water production  system, which example is shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced], the  RO process is already indispensable fundamental technique  because it is the most suitable separation technique for  production of ultrapure water from raw water such as municipal  or well water.    As Large Scale Integration (LSI) circuit technology has  progressed and its micro-processing technology requires ultra  clean environments and materials, the need for higher quality  ultrapure water is growing and consequently organic extractables  come out of ion exchange resins[.sup]1-3[/] are becoming a  main problem. Table 1 shows the ultrapure water quality target  for semiconductor manufacturing in Japan.[.sup]4[/]       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Furthermore, regeneration of resins is required every several  days and needs plenty of chemicals.    An an effective solution to these problems, using ``two  stage  RO process'' and/or using RO for the post-treatment of ion  exchange processes are proposed.  <H5>  The Second Stage Membrane Module in Two Stage RO Process </H5>   Figure 2 [not reproduced] shows promising examples of a two  stage RO process in the ultrapure water production system for  mega bits LSI. The process uses RO membranes in two stage and is  designed to remove ions, TOC and silica in the primary pure  water system and acts as a substitution for the primary ion  exchange process.    The purpose of two stage RO process is to substitute  regeneration type ion exchange process by RO. Therefore, the  need for chemical regeneration and possible organic substances  from ion exchange resin are eliminated. The resistivity of  product water in this process is required 5-10 M_O_-cm. But  until now it is ordinarily 1-3 M_O_-cm using conventional  membrane modules such as SU-700 when the feed is typical tap  water, owing to its low cation rejection at low feed  concentration and insufficient removal of carbon dioxide. For  the second stage membrane in such process, it is required high  cation rejection at low feed concentration and effective removal  of carbon dioxide.    The principle of carbon dioxide removal is shown in Figure 3  [not reproduced]. In water, carbonic acid shows equilibrium  among dissolved carbon dioxide gas, bicarbonate ion and  carbonate ion. Since carbon dioxide gas dissolved in water  cannot be effectively removed by RO membrane, it is necessary to  make the raw water alkaline so as to convert the carbon dioxide  gas to bicarbonate ion or carbonate ion, which can be  effectively rejected by RO membrane. The carbon dioxide almost  perfectly dissociates into bicarbonate ion and carbonate ion at  approximately pH 9. Therefore, the pH of feed water is adjusted  to be approximately 9 to greatly reject these ions by the RO  membranes.[.sup]5[/]    The electrolyte rejection of conventional fully-aromatic  polyamide composite membranes, such as SU-700, from aqueous  solutions containing more than several hundred ppm of  electrolytes are extremely high. However, if the electrolyte  concentration is lowered to several ppm such as the feed of  secondary membrane in the two stage RO process, the electrolyte  rejection of these membranes is usually reduced. Especially if  the operation of the RO is carried out at an alkaline pH, cation  rejection is drastically reduced.    Therefore, high rejection of ions at pH 9 are required to  attain the high resistivity value, and the elimination of silica  and TOC is also expected. The requirements for the second  membrane in the two stage RO process are as follows:    1) high cation rejection at high pH (ordinarily 9)    2) high bicarbonate and carbonate ion rejection    3) high silica and TOC rejection    4) low operating pressure    We have developed the RO membrane module designated  ``SU-900S'', which is based on fully-aromatic polyamide  composite membrane but chemically modified by cationic  functional group, and it has a high rejection of cation at low  feed concentration and alkaline solution compared to SU-700,  which is widely used as a primary RO module, and any other  membrane modules. Figure 4 [not reproduced] shows the pH  dependence of sodium and chloride ion rejection of SU-900S and  SU-700 when the feed is 1 ppm NaCl.    Figure 5 [not reproduced] shows the pH dependence of  resistivity and sodium ion concentration of product water  attained by the two stage RO process. The first membrane is  SU-710 and the second membrane is SU-910S. There are two cases  concerning adding points of alkali solution; one is at the inlet  of the first membrane (process A), the other is at the inlet of  the second membrane (process B). Feed water is tap water in  these experiments and the inlet pH at the second membrane is  accurately measured. The recovery ratio of the second membrane  is 30 percent. In both cases, high resistivity of product water  is obtained. In process A, the resistivity of product water  becomes 7.5 M_O_-cm at pH 9, and 3.6 M_O_-cm in process B.    In process B, because of a high amount of carbon dioxide in  the feed to the second membrane, more alkali is needed to adjust  the pH. By degasification of carbon dioxide the resistivity of  product water will become higher.    In the two stage RO process using SU-700 for the first stage  and SU-900S for the second one, high resistivity of product  water, which is equal to the primary ion exchange process (5-10  M_O_-cm), can be obtained.    It may be difficult to measure the concentration of  carbonate  ion at low concentration, so we tried to calculate the behavior  of ion concentration, pH and resistivity of product water as a  function of the feed pH from the cation and anion rejection at 1  ppm NaCl feed. In this calculation, we calculated under the  conditions that the feed is 1 ppm NaHCO[.sub]3[/] and NaOH is  added to control feed pH, cation and anion rejection are 98  percent and 95 percent respectively. The result is shown in  Figure 6 [not reproduced] compared with observed values. The  calculated curve shows good fitting to the observed values. As  the pH of feed water is increased (i.e., quantity of added NaOH  is increased), sodium ion concentration of product water is also  increased. On the other hand, the concentration of total  inorganic carbon (TIC, due to dissolved carbon dioxide gas,  bicarbonate ion and carbonate ion) is decreased because the  rejection of TIC is increased as a result of the dissociation of  dissolved carbon dioxide becomes larger at alkaline pH. The pH  of product water is determined by the difference of  concentration of sodium ion and TIC, and the pH of product water  becomes approximately 7 when their concentrations become equal.  And then the resistivity of product water attains to the highest  value.  <H5>  RO Membrane for Post-Treatment of Ion Exchange Process </H5>   Another application of RO membrane in the ultrapure water  production system is the post-treatment of the ion exchange  process. The main purpose of the RO is reduction of organic  substances eluting from the ion exchange process, especially  from the cartridge polisher, which is set in the final stage of  the primary pure water system or in the subsystem. Therefore,  high TOC rejection and special cleanliness without contamination  by self-elution are required for the RO membrane modules.    We have developed the RO membrane module designated  ``SU-700P'', which is assembled with the best suited crosslinked  fully-aromatic polyamide composite membrane and designed in view  of the total clean system including the proper choice of  materials and effective module structure with an internal flow  path to eliminate stagnant space. Figure 7 [not reproduced]  shows the start-up characteristics of TOC using SU-700P. In view  of electrolytes and organic substances, low contamination by the  module is shown by quickly reaching the value of ultrapure water  (feed water) in which the level of resistivity is more than 18.1  M_O_-cm and the TOC concentration is 10-20 ppb. In the process  using SU-700P as the post-treatment of ion exchange processes,  an induction period to attain an original TOC level of feed  water can be shortened to less than several hours, and the TOC  level finally reached can be 8-10 ppb lower than the original  TOC level of feed water concentration (10-20 ppb).    In the typical ultrapure water production system, organic  substances are eluted from ion exchange resins after  regeneration of them. These impurities are electrolytes and  nonelectrolytes. The former can be removed by a cartridge  polisher, but the latter cannot be removed by a cartridge  polisher or UF membranes. Only RO membranes can remove these  nonelectrolytes.    In this point, the RO module for post-treatment of the ion  exchange process is able to act as a buffer and controls the  concentration of TOC when organic substances elute from ion  exchange resins.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   1. For the second membrane in the two stage RO process, we  have developed the SU-900S RO module which has high rejection of  cations at low concentrations and high pH.    2. For post-treatment of the ion exchange process, we have  developed the SU-700P RO module which has high rejection of TOC  and has a special cleanliness without self-elution.    3. We can prepare all of the RO modules that are applicable  in the ultrapure water production system.  References    1. F. M. Cutler, Ultrapurewater, 5(6) (1988) 40.    2. A. P. Emery, J. E.

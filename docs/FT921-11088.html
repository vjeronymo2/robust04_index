			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Strengthening the UN's role SCEPTICS have described the summit of the 15-member United Nations Security Council at the end of last week as no more than a 'photo opportunity', allowing various world leaders to burnish their images. But that is a very short-sighted view of an event which, if it did not produce any dramatic results, nevertheless has important longer-term implications for what some call the 'new world order'. The foundations of this new international system were laid by the ending of the Cold War and the new spirit of collaboration between the US and the former Soviet Union, which made the UN-backed military operation to oust Iraq from Kuwait possible. However, with the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the departure of its leader, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the rosy international outlook of only a few months ago quickly changed again. The decision by Mr John Major, in his capacity as current chairman of the Security Council, to call a members' summit was therefore well-judged. The replacement of the Soviet Union by Russia as a permanent member, the arrival on the international scene of Mr Boris Yeltsin as Russia's new president and the appointment of a new UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Ghali of Egypt, all justified both a solemn rededication to UN principles and a reappraisal of the organisation's tasks and functions. Collective security The first, though not the second of these objectives was satisfactorily attained. Mr Yeltsin has enthusiastically committed himself to the principle of collective security and a stronger UN peace-keeping and peace-enforcement role. His proposals for sweeping new cuts in nuclear arms and endorsement of stricter controls over the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction also augur well for the continuation of the disarmament process. But the 15 leaders have done no more than scratch the surface of how the UN should fulfil its strengthened peace-keeping and peace-making role. Mr Boutros Ghali has been given only a very general mandate to prepare by July 1 recommendations on enhancing the UN's capacity for preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping. He is known to be a fundamentally cautious man and it might have been better, at the beginning of his term of office, if he had been given more detailed guidelines by the Security Council. Indeed, in view of all that was said about the need for the world organisation to play a more active role, it was surprising that there was so little enthusiasm for the proposal of French President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Yeltsin for a permanent UN standby force. Article 43 of the UN Charter specifically provides for such a force, and the international climate will never be more propitious than it is now for setting it up. 'Winning team' The failure of the summit to have even the most cursory debate about the composition of the Security Council was also disappointing. 'You don't change a winning team,' Mr Major is reported to have said. But that, surely, cannot be the decisive criterion when the permanent members of that team no longer include some of the strongest players in the world, Germany and Japan. The make-up of the Security Council no longer reflects present-day realities. The defeated powers of the second world war are now among the top three most powerful economies in the world. Japan alone contributes 12.5 of the UN's total budget, nearly half the US contribution and larger than the British and French shares combined. Their absence from the permanent ranks of the Security Council is nothing less than an aberration at a time when the UN wants to enhance its role and can only undermine its authority and credibility. It is true that changing the composition of the Council could lead to demands from many other nations for permanent membership or a change in the functioning of the UN institutions. Yet however complicated the solution might be, that cannot be considered sufficient reason for permanently ignoring a problem of such significance for the new international order.</p>

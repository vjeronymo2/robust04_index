The foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, told the visiting  U.S. assistant secretary of state, Ms. Robin Raphel, in New  Delhi today that any addition to Pakistan's offensive military  capabilities will escalate tension in the region and seriously  affect India's security environment. The foreign secretary also  voiced reservations on the U.S. proposal to discuss the nuclear  nonproliferation issue within a small group of countries.    On India's relations with Pakistan, Mr. Srinivasan  reaffirmed  New Delhi's willingness to resume foreign secretary-level talks  with Islamabad under the Simla Agreement. He hoped Pakistan  will end its support to transborder terrorism. He drew her  attention to the Indian parliament resolution on Kashmir and  asserted that Pakistan's efforts to internationalize the issue  will not succeed in fulfilling its territorial ambitions.    The American official expressed the hope that the prime  minister would find it convenient to pay a visit to Washington  at President Clinton's invitation. Mr. Raphel also called on  the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia.  The minister outlined India's preference for a global,  comprehensive, and nondiscriminatory approach to nuclear  nonproliferation.    Referring to India's relations with the United States, he  said development of still friendlier bilateral ties is a major  priority in New Delhi's foreign policy. She also called on the  commerce secretary.</p>

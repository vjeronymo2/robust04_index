			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Night News" program] </F>   [Text] At a time when the incidence of imported chemical  wastes at Nanjing Port has not been satisfactorily solved,  Ningbo Environmental Protection Department and Customs found  another shipment of illegally imported hazardous industrial  wastes at Ningbo Port.    A check showed that the total tonnage of the industrial  wastes imported from Japan by the Ningbo branch of Haikou  Yongchang Enterprise Company was 1,080 tonnes. Among the  industrial wastes were 300 tonnes of scrapped steel and 780  tonnes of scrapped electric motors and refrigerator compressors.  Toxic materials were found among the imported industrial  wastes. There had been no prior reports on the import of these  industrial wastes to environmental protection departments for  inspection and approval.    Ningbo Environmental Protection Department and Customs had  ordered the Ningbo Branch of Haikou Yongchang Enterprise Company  to stop importing industrial wastes. As for the industrial  wastes already imported, all, except the scrapped steel, were  blocked for release for future handling.</p>

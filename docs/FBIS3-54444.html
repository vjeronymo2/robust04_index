The spokesman however, said that in view of the importance  of  the issues between India and Pakistan and as a courtesy to  India, it was studying the papers carefully.    The spokesman was giving official reaction to New Delhi's  proposals to Islamabad over the outstanding Issues between two  countries and prospect of further dialogues. He said Pakistan  hoped that non-papers sent to India early last week would have  evoked similar serious response as Pakistan was now giving to  six non-papers delivered by India.    The proposals sent by India include Indian suggestion to  resolve Siachen problem, demarcation of the boundaries in Sir  Creek area and Tulbul Navigation project controversies.    Much to the disappointment of Pakistan and other friendly  countries India has not mentioned any proposals, core issue of  Kashmir and modalities of holding plebiscite in held Kashmir  under the UN resolutions.</p>

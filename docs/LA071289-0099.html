			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE TO BE ONE OF FIRST SITES FOR INACOMP-MITSUBISHI 'SUPERSTORE'  </P> <P> In an effort to tap the booming home-office market, Inacomp Computer Centers,  one of the nation's leading computer retail chains, has joined forces with  Mitsubishi of Japan to create a new group of computer "superstores," starting  in Orange County.  </P> <P> The first of the new outlets, which will be the size of small supermarkets, is  scheduled to open in Garden Grove in September.  </P> <P> Rick Inatome, chief executive of Inacomp, said the new stores were conceived as  "total small-business resource centers" that would take advantage of the  "explosive" growth in demand for personal computers and office products among  home-based businesses and other small firms.  </P> <P> "This segment is a very fast-growing portion of the PC industry, and in the  distribution business there is a trend toward segmentation," Inatome said. "You  used to go to a generic computer store, but now there's an orientation toward  servicing particular segments."  </P> <P> Inacomp will be the managing partner of the joint venture, dubbed Computer  Supercenters International, and will retain a controlling interest, according  to Inatome, who co-founded Inacomp with his father, Joseph Inatome. The elder  Inatome will be chairman and chief executive of the new venture, which will  invest about $6 million for the initial phase.  </P> <P> Plans call for the establishment of four centers in 1990-1991, and up to 20  over the next five years.  </P> <P> The Computer Supercenters will feature a broad range of computer hardware and  software as well as fax machines, copiers, and books and magazines. In  addition, they will boast a family drop-in center, a theater for vendor  demonstrations, and some small business services such as PC publishing. "They  will have a trade-show like appeal," said Inatome.  </P> <P> Computer stores, such as the existing Inacomp outlets, Businessland and  ComputerLand, focus primarily on larger business customers, and the stores tend  to be about 3,000 to 6,000 square feet. The Inacomp Supercenters will be 20,000  to 25,000 square feet.  </P> <P> John Russell, editor of the trade newspaper Computer Reseller News, called the  company "a major endorsement of the home office market, and an example of how  the larger chains are starting to diversify." Up to now, he said, there had  been a smattering of computer superstores, such as Businessland subsidiary  Computer Craft, that had done reasonably well. Now, he said, these retailers  are ready to "start hitting their stride."  </P> <P> Mitsubishi is interested in the venture "first and foremost" as an investment  opportunity, according to a company spokesman, and also views it as a way to  gain some retailing experience. In addition, Computer Supercenters could  benefit from the Mitsubishi trading company's purchasing power around the  world. The electronics products branch of the Japanese firm is not involved.  </P></p>

Foreign investors or those from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao  once were forbidden to invest in the Chinese commercial retail  business. Trial utilization of foreign funds in this field in  some large cities including Beijing and Shanghai was approved by  the State Council only in recent years to meet the growing  demand of consumers.    Since then, Shanghai commercial departments have approved  300- plus foreign invested retail projects with a total capital  exceeding one billion U.S. dollars. Investors are from Japan,  Hong Kong, Taiwan and some transnational corporations.    Following the Eastern Shopping Mansion, another large-scale  complex named the Hongqiao Friendship Shopping Center and partly  funded by Hong Kong investors opened to service recently in  Shanghai.    Equipped with high-standard facilities and stocked with  world- renowned brands, these shopping centers manage to provide  elegant and comfortable shopping environments and greater  selection for those consumers with high income.    In order to attract more local wage-earners, the  newly-opened  Hongqiao Friendship Shopping Center offers affordable daily  necessities in conjunction with expensive luxuries in its  beautifully-decorated shopping halls. Its commodities amount to  more than 30,000 varieties in total.    "If you want to make your brands known in China, Shanghai  can  help you do it," general manager of the Hongqiao Friendship  Shopping Center said, which is also what most overseas investors  in Shanghai's retail business firmly believe.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / All work and no pay for many on leap day BLAME IT on Christopher Clavius. But for the 16th-century astronomer, salaried people would not have to work a day extra for nothing this year. Clavius, astronomer to Pope Gregory XIII, invented the Gregorian calendar which added a 29th day to February every fourth year. While today's date means that employers of salaried staff will benefit from an extra day's work at no cost, those paid weekly can expect to receive a day's extra pay this leap year. The extra day's production is expected to bring a rise in gross domestic product of at least 0.3 per cent. The Central Statistical Office said, though, that much of the leap-year effect would be smoothed out by seasonal adjustments. Annual season tickets for public transport come this year with an extra day free, but buyers of weekly tickets will pay for the leap day. Monthly passes tend to cost the same for a calendar month no matter how many days are in it. The same applies to anyone paying rent by the calendar month. Homebuyers will find their monthly mortgage payment the same as ever - most building societies divide the annual interest payment into 12 equal instalments. Savers may think they are getting a good deal if interest is credited daily. But banks and building societies have thought of that, and calculate rates so that the annual total remains the same. Travel companies have tried to exploit the leap-year tradition of women proposing marriage on February 29 by offering special romantic breaks. FT readers canny enough to have bought an annual subscription will receive this issue gratis. Meanwhile Oxfam, the overseas-aid charity, is asking people to use the extra time given by the leap day to help raise money for charity, with events such as a leapfrog human draughts match in Covent Garden, London.</p>

A notice of application and proposed no significant hazards consideration determination for the September 16, 1992, submittal was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 21, 1993 (58 FR 5429); this notice supersedes the January 21, 1993, notice in its entirety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would modify the Technical Specifications (TSs) related to containment air locks to make them as close to the Improved Standard TSs in NUREG&hyph;1431 as the plant-specific design will permit. The proposed changes in TS 3.6.1.1 and 3.6.1.3 would modify surveillance requirements and limiting conditions of operation and effect numerous administrative and format changes. The changes relate to air lock operability, leak testing, and door interlocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The probability of occurrence of a previously evaluated accident is not increased because the containment air locks do not effect the initiation of any design basis accident [DBA]. The consequences of an accident are also not significantly increased because the proposed revisions to the action statements will continue to ensure that at least one door in each air lock is maintained closed. A single door in each air lock is capable of withstanding a pressure in excess of the maximum expected pressure following a DBA. The structural integrity and leak tightness of the containment will not be changed by this proposed revision. For the brief period of time that the operable air lock door is open and the inoperable door is providing the single containment barrier, the consequences of [2an] accident may be increased. However, the probability of an event occurring requiring containment integrity is sufficiently remote to justify limited access when required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the continued ability of the containment air locks to provide a barrier to limit leakage from containment during a DBA, this proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air lock operation does not interface with the reactor coolant pressure boundary or any other mechanical or electrical controls which could impact the operations of the reactor or its direct support systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Containment air locks are designed for the purpose of containment entry and exit. During this operation, the air lock maintains containment integrity by providing at least one door which is capable of providing a leak tight barrier during a DBA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes will continue to ensure that air lock operation is performed as assumed in the original design of the plant. During the period when the operable door is open and the other door inoperable, at least one door is being maintained closed as designed. This condition is ensured due to the subatmospheric conditions that exist during plant operation. The operable air lock door cannot be safely opened unless the inoperable door is closed due to the approximately 5 psi pressure differential that exists. The operable air lock door would only be opened long enough to allow personnel to enter the air lock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicable margin of safety consists of maintaining the primary containment leak rates within the assumptions of the DBA analysis. These leak rates are maintained provided at least one operable air lock door remains closed during the event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revisions will continue to ensure that at least one air lock door is maintained closed. During the brief period of time that an operable air lock door is open and the inoperable door is providing the single containment barrier, the margin of safety is decreased. The inoperable door may not limit containment leak rates within the assumptions of the DBA analysis. However, the probability of an event requiring the inoperable air lock door to limit containment leakage occurring during this time period is sufficiently low and the overall margin of safety would not be decreased by a significant amount. The proposed increase in allowable door seal leakage will not affect the overall ability of the containment air locks to restrict the release of fission products to the environment. The overall air lock leakage limit of less than or equal to .05 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  remain unchanged. The amount of leakage which the air lock(s) are permitted to contribute to the combined containment leakage limit of 0.60 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  remain unchanged. Therefore, the margin of safety due to increasing the door seal leakage limit remains unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> B.F.

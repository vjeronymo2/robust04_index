The president has, for the time being, ruled out declaring a  "state of emergency" to halt the public workers' stoppage, which  affects mostly education and health sectors due to the strike of  some 12,000 teachers and 32,000 health sector workers, including  9,000 doctors.    De Leon, who ordered that workers who join the strike be  reported, ruled out fears by the Catholic Church that the strike  may destabilize his government and for the time being did not  accept a mediation offer by Archbishop Propsepero Penados del  Barrio to seek a solution to the crisis. "It is not necessary  because we are open to negotiations," the president underscored  and asked that the full weight of the law fall on those doctors  who may turn out to be responsible for the death of a woman for  alleged lack of medical attention. The case was reported to the  Attorney General's Office.    Penados has stated that the workers' demands are "fair,"  even  though he regrets it is affecting the poorest people.    The National Federation of Public Employees Unions  (FENASEP),  which has about 40,000 members who do not support the strike, on  Thursday began talks with the government to put forth their  demands.    In view of the general strike called by the National  Federation of State Workers Unions (FENASTEG) and the State  Workers United Instance [Instancia Unitaria de Trabajadores del  Estado -- UITE], the president ratified that he will not grant  any salary increases. "It is impossible that in order to grant  an increase to about 150,000 workers we will harm 10 million  inhabitants," the president emphasized and explained that to  give in to the demands of the workers means printing money  without backing or investing funds, earmarked for social  development programs, in operating expenses. De Leon reiterated  that workers who are on strike will not be paid in full.    Despite the president's warnings, UITE leader Nery Hernandez  told ACAN-EFE that they will not give up holding a national  strike, which is not only to demand a readjustment, but also so  that the government suspends the privatization process. Hernadez  described as "regrettable" the position FENASEP has taken by not  supporting the workers' movement, which according to him,  includes Guatemala's 22 departments. "We are reaching a social  and economic disaster due to government negligence," the union  leader said.    Meanwhile, FENASTEG Secretary General Armando Sanchez also  told ACAN-EFE that with the exception of the municipalities, the  Finance [Ministry], the Judicial Branch, and the Labor and  Social Security Ministry, the remaining government offices back  the strike. Sanchez described the president's stance of not  agreeing to the increase as "intransigent" and warned that they  will not back down on their demands.    Labor and Social Security Minister Anabela Morfin also  reiterated that her office will continue to open file cases on  workers who go on strike to ensure that they are punished  because "we cannot allow services to be affected."</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAKE US WHEN YOU'RE READY  </P> <P> The best news we've heard in a long time is that sleep researchers now think a  little shut-eye in the afternoon is precisely what nature intended for the  refreshment of mankind.  </P> <P> We ourselves have always been acutely aware of the biological urge to cork off  as the day drags on, but that's something we thought it prudent not to talk  about in polite society. The truth of the matter is that our inclination to  catch a nap has always been accompanied by a feeling of profound moral  irresponsibility, no doubt arising from the culturally imposed notion that  after the age of 5, real people sleep only when it's dark outside. Now, thanks  to the studies of scientists around the world, that terrible burden of guilt  has been lifted. From here on we will feel at liberty to nod off any afternoon  we feel like it, without regret, resistance, shame or remorse.  </P> <P> Of course, any such naps will have to be enjoyed only on weekends and holidays,  since our employer -- like others -- frowns on the prospect of paying people  for snoozing on the job. As it happens, employers may be doing themselves a  disservice by holding to this traditional attitude. It's long been known that  work performance declines in mid-afternoon as loginess takes hold. Worse, the  accident rate rises significantly in the afternoon hours, a fact that seems  directly linked to a fall-off in mental alertness.  </P> <P> Conventional wisdom has long held that afternoon sleepiness is the price we pay  for eating heavy lunches. Not so, say researchers. What studies have determined  is that drowsiness sets in, lunch or no lunch, about 12 hours after the  midpoint of the day's main sleeping period. Thus if a person sleeps from 11  p.m. to 6 a.m., chances are that by 3 or 3:30 in the afternoon the body is  ready -- if not frantically in need of -- a nice restorative doze.  </P> <P> People in tropical climates have always been smart enough to go with the flow  instead of trying to fight what nature has programmed, making the siesta a  normal and salutary part of their lives. Maybe it's time for people in other  parts of the world to get back in touch with their biological imperative and  set aside a portion of each afternoon for an efficiency-raising,  grumpiness-reducing nap. That's a splendid idea for someone to drop into the  boss's suggestion box. Don't forget to wake us if you get an answer.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT-RUN BROTHEL PROMISED NICE TURNABOUT  </P> <P> Regarding "Mustang Ranch Seized," (Sept. 20), I was very excited when the  federal government took over operation of the infamous Mustang Ranch (a  105-room brothel in Nevada now being liquidated by the IRS).  </P> <P> I was equally disturbed when they changed their mind. It would have been the  first time in history that the people could do to the government what the  government has been doing to them all these years.  </P> <P> DARRYL O.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moti Amir in Taba] </F>   [Text] There is no longer any dispute over the size of the  autonomy in Jericho, which was decided on in the Cairo  understandings. The dispute now is over the corridors the PLO  is demanding to Jericho. In the wake of the understandings  reached in Cairo, the Palestinians demanded three corridors be  put under the control of the autonomy: from the holy sites of  (al-Manta), north of Jericho; al-Nabi Musa, east of the town,  and a corridor to the Dead Sea's Lido beach, south of Jericho.  The Jericho issue has therefore not be resolved.    On the other hand, a breakthrough has apparently been made  on  the border crossings, on which there is agreement. Yesterday,  the Palestinians were shown an outline of the two border  crossings points in Jericho and Rafah. They did not react and  up to this moment they have not disputed the main points they  saw in the diagrams last night.    In the meantime, the Taba negotiations are taking place in  two working groups. One group is discussing the joint drafting  of an agreement. It started with the issues on which there is  already agreement. A sort of civilian cabinet, in which the  heads of delegation -- Amnon Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th -- are  participating, is holding a discussion prior to the convening of  the subcommittee on civilian affairs.    We have already said that there is apparently an  Israeli-Palestinian agreement on border crossings, as well as on  an agenda for the negotiations, and an agreement that the  negotiations would be based on the Cairo understandings.    We are now waiting for the two committees to conclude their  deliberations and for the negotiations to resume in a limited  plenum with seven representatives from each side discussing the  issues in dispute.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 11 January in a  report by Netan'el Semrik quotes 'Ami Glusqa, spokesman for the  Israeli delegation, as saying in a recorded passage: "The aim  is to conduct businesslike negotiations in order to draft the  understandings and agreements." The members of the Israeli  drafting team are Foreign Ministry legal adviser Yo'el Singer,  Brigadier General David Agmon, and Brig. Gen. Tzvi Stauber.]</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: FO aware of needs of exporters Sir, May I assure the president of the Export Group for the Constructional Industries (Letters, September 8) that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is well aware of the commercial potential of the former Soviet Union and Baltic states. Our exports to the area for the first seven months in 1993 show an increase of 64 per cent over the same period in 1992. We currently have posts in nine of the 15 countries there, four of them opened in the last year. The six countries where we have no resident missions are all covered by other posts. We would hope to open other missions as funds become available. The first priority of these posts is to help British exporters, in particular by establishing close relations with the local government. We recognise the excellent contribution which the construction industry has made to British exports and know of its interest, not just in the former Soviet Union but in other important markets such as the Asian Pacific Rim and the Middle East. We are acutely aware of the requirements of British exporters for diplomatic posts and staff, and will be examining, in the light of the outcome of the current public expenditure round, how we can best respond to them. Alastair Goodlad, minister of state, Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, London SW1A 2AH</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EXPOS BEAT PIRATES, PULL WITHIN HALF-GAME  </P> <P> Few expected the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Montreal Expos to be battling for  first place in the National League East in late June, but there they were  Friday night, playing each other in a style worthy of the division's 1-2 teams.  </P> <P> Mike Aldrete doubled home Andres Galarraga from first base in the eighth inning  at Montreal to give the Expos a 4-3 victory.  </P> <P> The Expos, who had trailed, 3-1, are only a half-game behind the slumping  Pirates. However, bearing down on both are the division favorites, the New York  Mets. The Mets, who were 9 1/2 games behind June 7, are only three back.  </P> <P> Barry Bonds gave the Pirates their early lead by hitting a two-run single in  the third. With runners in scoring position, Bonds is 25 for 49 (.510) and has  driven in 38 runs.  </P> <P> He also singled, stole second and scored the Pirates' other run on Mike  LaValliere's single in the sixth.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Pirates' Walt Terrell went into the seventh inning with a  two-hitter, one of the hits a home run to center field by Larry Walker.  </P> <P> But, with one out, the Expos' Tom Foley , who had struck out twice, singled.  Pinch-hitter Otis Nixon then doubled down the left-field line to score Foley.  Nixon stole third and scored the tying run on Dave Martinez's fly to medium  right field.  </P> <P> The Expos are in contention despite having lost lost three top pitchers -- Mark  Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez -- and outfielder Hubie Brooks to free  agency.  </P> <P> "We took a lot of heat when we let those fellows get away," Manager Buck  Rodgers said. "We decided to go with younger, inexperienced players. We weren't  surprised when we split the first 36 games. It was expected.  </P> <P> "But this team has shown tenacity. We have an ability to come from behind. We  also have a knack for winning close games. I'm proud of these kids."  </P> <P> New York 5, Philadelphia 1 -- The Mets have found a way to take the pressure  off their pitchers.  </P> <P> For the 10th game in a row, the Mets scored in the first two innings. For the  ninth time, the early lead paid off.  </P> <P> In this game at New York, Frank Viola had five runs before he went out to pitch  the third inning and he easily became the league's first 10-game winner.  </P> <P> The Mets, finally playing up to their potential, chased former Dodger Ken  Howell (8-4), who had won six in a row, before the second inning was over.  </P> <P> Dave Magadan, whose hitting has sparked the Mets' drive into contention and put  Mike Marshall on the bench, drove in two runs in the inning and extended his  hitting streak to 11 games. He is 22 for 43 (.512) during the stretch.  </P> <P> "I made up my mind I wouldn't lose this lead," said Viola (10-3). "Last  Saturday they gave me a four-run lead and I blew it."  </P> <P> Viola gave up eight hits, struck out eight and walked only one in eight  innings.  </P> <P> "I was really fighting myself at the start," Viola said. "There's no good  feeling when you walk the first batter on four pitches. I knew I had to go to  work."  </P> <P> San Francisco 4, Houston 3 -- The Giants resumed their pursuit of the  Cincinnati Reds in this game at Houston.  </P> <P> After losing two in a row, the Giants took a 3-0 lead and held on for their  17th victory in 20 games this month.  </P> <P> Scott Garrelts (5-6) won his fourth consecutive decision. He left after eight  innings with a 4-2 lead, but relief pitcher Steve Bedrosian opened the ninth by  giving up a home run to Eric Anthony. Finally, with the potential tying run on  second, Jeff Brantley got the last two outs.  </P> <P> The Giants' Robby Thompson hit his eighth home run of the season in the second  inning.  </P> <P> St. Louis 7, Chicago 0 -- Most pitchers aren't too fond of Wrigley Field.  Except on the few occasions when the wind is blowing in, the ballpark is a  hitter's paradise.  </P> <P> It isn't for the Cubs when Cardinal left-hander Joe Magrane pitches there.  Magrane pitched a three-hitter and struck out a career-high 11 in getting his  third shutout in four starts at Wrigley. One was a one-hitter.  </P> <P> "I have not had a good season," Magrane (4-9) said. "Today was one of those  days when I had it.  </P> <P> "But the park had nothing to do with it. When I'm right I have a good sinker.  It's tough on guys trying to hit it into the seats."  </P> <P> The Cardinals' Pedro Guerrero and Todd Zeille hit home runs and teammate Willie  McGee had three hits and drove in two runs. It was only the Cardinals' fourth  victory in their last 14 games. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

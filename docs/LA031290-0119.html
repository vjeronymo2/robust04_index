			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> COMMUTER TRAIN SERVICE IS OKD  </P> <P> Southern California's first commuter train service was approved today, giving  Orange County residents who work in Los Angeles an alternative to driving the  perpetually clogged northbound freeways.  </P> <P> The proposed commuter-friendly service, similar to those found on the East  Coast, could begin as early as April 2 under the agreement unanimously approved  by the Orange County Transportation Commission, which met in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The plan calls for a morning rush-hour train to leave San Juan Capistrano at 6  a.m., delivering commuters to Los Angeles' Union Station by 7:25 a.m. after  stopping for passengers in Santa Ana, Anaheim and Fullerton.  </P> <P> Ticket prices would be 20% cheaper than current Amtrak fares.  </P> <P> Amtrak now provides two trains from Orange County to Los Angeles, but the  earliest morning train arrives at 8 a.m., a time considered too late for many  workers who must take buses or cabs from the downtown Union Station.  </P> <P> Before the service can become operable, the proposal must be approved by Santa  Fe Railway, which owns the tracks.  </P></p>

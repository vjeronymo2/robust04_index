			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> TROUBLED KIDS: Juan Cardenas, 12, assigned to Juvenile Hall for accidentally  shooting and killing a friend in the Mall of Orange last December, doesn't  belong in the California Youth Authority with hardened offenders, county  juvenile authorities said. . . . Only 2 to 3% of the county's youthful  offenders go to a CYA institution. . . . The county's traditionally low  commitment rate to CYA, Deputy D.A. John Conley said, is in part due to the  variety of optional facilities not available in some other counties. Dana  Parsons and Kristina Lindgren  </P></p>

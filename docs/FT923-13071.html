			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Letter: Nothing new after 67 years Sir, Mr Brian McEvoy (Letters, July 11) wonders how the rail service will ever improve. By coincidence I came upon a letter written by my father in June 1925, on his return home from Waterloo. Aged 25, he told his cousin that he had already had enough of commuting, which had driven him that day to compose: 'This Beautifully Painted And Bloody Awful Train By everything that's holy I will not take again. I'll sell my season ticket And buy a private hearse. It may not travel faster, It cannot travel worse. And you, Sir Herbert Walker, When all men's patience fails Take up your true vocation Of cultivating Snails.' (In a footnote he says that Sir Herbert Walker was the then general manager LSWR). So it seems that things have not changed much in 67 years, which may give Mr McEvoy food for thought as he next waits at the signal.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F> Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by an unidentified DER SPIEGEL  correspondent; place and date not given: "An Attack Would Mean  War"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Serbia has been waging war against  Bosnia for two years. Is Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM] also threatened with military aggression?    [Gligorov] I am not plagued by excessive fear, but I cannot  rule out the possibility of this conflict spreading to the south.    [DER SPIEGEL] You called for UN protection as far back as in  November 1992; since last July U.S. blue helmets have been  patrolling the border with Serbia. Does this guarantee peace?    [Gligorov] These units came when the danger of war was  acute. The presence of the Americans should be sufficient  warning to the Serbs.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Serbian army could occupy Macedonia within  a few days; in the war against Bosnia NATO reacted only after  almost two years. Are you deceiving yourself by believing that  you would be able to defend your young republic in case of an  attack by Belgrade?    [Gligorov] The Macedonian problem is far more complex than  the Bosnian one. In Bosnia the war is a war in an enclave,  which is hardly in danger of spreading. An attack on Macedonia  would be a war on NATO's northern [as published] border, in  which all the Balkan states would be involved. In addition,  there could be a conflict between the two NATO states, Greece  and Turkey.    [DER SPIEGEL] Last spring Serbia's President Milosevic  arrived unexpectedly for a brief visit to Lake Ohrid. What did  he want from you?    [Gligorov] He presented a proposal for intensive  cooperation; however, when I asked him why he did not recognize  our republic, his answer was: This will be done only when  Greece has diplomatically recognized Macedonia. Because for him  Athens is his only true ally in the Balkans....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...with whom Milosevic would like to divide  Macedonia.    [Gligorov] Athens' former Prime Minister Konstandinos  Mitsotakis says that Milosevic did indeed suggest this to him.  But he refused.    [DER SPIEGEL] The plans are probably not yet off the table.  Three weeks ago Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias visited  Belgrade to discuss the renaissance of the former Yugoslavia.    [Gligorov] We will not join a new Yugoslav Federation  voluntarily at any price.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does the quarrel between Skopje and Athens  really just revolve around the name of Macedonia, which the  Greeks claim for themselves?    [Gligorov] Nonsense. If this were so, the issue would have  come up 50 years ago. This is how long we have used this name  without anybody being bothered by it. Nationalism is reigning  in Greece now.    [DER SPIEGEL] How long can you resist the threat from the  north and the embargo from the south?    [Gligorov] We are waiting. Our economic situation is  difficult; there are no alternative trading routes. However, in  the long run, the routes to and via Greece will be open again to  us.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you fear tensions with the Albanian  minority, who, after all, constitute a third of Macedonia's  population?    [Gligorov] Even in our worst times we did not have any  problems with our Albanian fellow-citizens. The only thing we  do not permit is the demand by certain circles to declare them  Macedonia's second state-constituting people. We give the  Albanian minority all the rights that are set down in the  Helsinki Final Act.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will this prevent radical Albanians from  striving for unification with the Albanian motherland in the  long run?    [Gligorov] It is no secret that there is the idea of a  greater Albania. However, all these dreams of greater Serbia,  greater Croatia, greater Albania -- what is their point?</p>

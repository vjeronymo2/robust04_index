			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Appleby Westward shows 22% decline Appleby Westward Group, the USM-quoted company which distributes groceries to Spar and VG outlets, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.28m for the 52 weeks to February 28. That represents a 22 per cent downturn from Pounds 1.64m for the previous 53 week period and was struck on sales of Pounds 70.7m against Pounds 72.9m. Mr Roger Harvey, chairman, said the reduction in turnover reflected the shorter reporting period and a fall in the number of accounts served. A maintained final dividend of 5.8p is proposed for an improved 9p (8.8p) total. The dividend is payable from earnings down from 20.7p to 15.7p.</p>

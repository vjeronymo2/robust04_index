			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Labour outlines crackdown on tax abuses Labour yesterday outlined plans to tackle tax avoidance by scrapping allowances and tightening rules on inheritance and capital gains. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, also called for a one-off tax on the 'excess profits' of the privatised utility companies. Mr Brown said a Labour study had identified more than 25 tax abuses which could be closed to provide billions of pounds to help reduce long-term unemployment. Officials said final decisions on tax reform would be taken nearer the election. The main proposals are: Higher taxes on utilities, and a windfall tax on the Pounds 3.5bn profit that will accrue to the regional electricity companies when National Grid is sold or transferred later this year. Statutory powers for the Inland Revenue to investigate the 'financial substance' of tax avoidance schemes, even where no rules are broken. Ending 'unfair' tax relief on executive share options, private medical insurance and payments in kind such as jewellery and exotic untraded chemicals. Closing 'offshore' tax loopholes by tightening the rules on non-residence and non-domicile claims, ending the 'abuse' of offshore regulations by trusts and companies, and abolishing sovereign immunity, under which profits on some investments by overseas governments are free of tax. Preventing the treatment of income as capital and ending reinvestment relief, intended to stimulate investment in unquoted companies, which Labour claims is misused to avoid tax. Simplification of corporate taxation, including tightening rules on group structures, companies with foreign control, and foreign income dividends. Dropping government plans to scrap stamp duty on securities, and preventing avoidance of the duty on contracts, which Labour claims are kept offshore to avoid payment. Preventing using trusts for tax avoidance by bringing them into line with the treatment of individuals. Closing loopholes such as investments in farmland and insurance schemes to avoid inheritance tax. The tax reform plans are intended to demonstrate Labour's determination to reduce taxes for middle-income taxpayers by forcing the better-off to pay a bigger share. Proposals for using the money saved from tackling tax abuses are planned to be published in a Budget submission to the Treasury in two weeks. Mr Brown will continue, however, to resist pressure to forecast income tax rates under a Labour government.</p>

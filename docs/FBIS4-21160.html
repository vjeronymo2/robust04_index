			<p>Narcotics   Control Strategy Report  <H4>  Panama's Endara `Examining' Draft of Protest Note to U.S. </H4> Government   <F P=102> PA1204202894 Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 12 Apr 94 p 2 </F> <F P=103> PA1204202894 </F> <F P=104>  Panama City LA PRENSA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>   [Text] Local diplomatic sources have reported that  President Guillermo Endara is currently examining the draft of a  protest note that his government will officially present to the  U.S. Government in light of a U.S. report that Panama is an  international money laundering center.    Jaime Ford, the Panamanian ambassador in Washington, D.C.,  met yesterday with Foreign Minister Jose Mulino to draft the  protest document. Government sources told LA PRENSA that the  president is carefully analyzing the draft note before signing  it.    Officials from the Clinton administration recently affirmed  that Panama has become a major drug money laundering center.  Endara and Foreign Minister Mulino later rejected the  accusation.    Jaime Ford stated that there has been no major reaction from  the United States since the report was released. The ambassador  explained that ``we are working very hard to draft this protest  note. That is the reason for my visit to the Foreign Ministry.''    Last week Endara said that Panama is helping in the fight  against drug trafficking and money laundering.    Ford added that the Foreign Ministry and the presidency are  drafting the protest note together and ``will deliver it as soon  as it is ready.''    The diplomat also said that the world, as it faces the  invasion of drugs, must create an organization that can combine  efforts, with proper respect for the sovereignty of each nation,  to fight drug trafficking and its effects.    U.S. Government sources have also said that there is more  money being laundered in Panama now than during the days of drug  dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.    The Endara administration has rejected the charges, arguing  that this is a campaign to tarnish the country's image.</p>

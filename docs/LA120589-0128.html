			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. GOES AGAINST LOW TIDE IN TURNOUTS FOR DAY WITHOUT ART  </P> <P> Unlike most Southern California museums participating in the national Day  Without Art observance last week, those in Orange County reported  better-than-average turnouts for activities marking the impact of AIDS on the  arts community.  </P> <P> At the Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport Beach, a performance Friday by Tim  Miller drew "a much larger and wider audience than we had anticipated," said  museum spokeswoman Maxine Gaiber.  </P> <P> Miller, a Los Angeles-based performance artist, presented "Sex/Love/AIDS:  Stories From Life," a solo focusing on his experiences as a gay man, to a  standing-room only crowd of 140 people. The museum's attendance overall totaled  215, Gaiber added, noting that fewer than 200 typically attend on Fridays.  </P> <P> Attendance was up from the usual 100 to about 120 at the Laguna Art Museum,  where a Red Cross representative offered information on AIDS and signs referred  to the day's observance.  </P> <P> And while attendance was normal, about $150 was raised in admission fees at the  Fullerton Museum Center in Fullerton, which will donate the money to AIDS  services of the local Red Cross.  </P> <P> The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, which showed films on AIDS throughout  the day, also reported one of the best responses in terms of turnout: About 150  people visited the museum on Friday, up from the usual 100, according to museum  spokeswoman Diane Maxwel. In addition, the museum collected about $100 in its  two donation boxes.  </P> <P> Still, "we didn't particularly attract crowds, despite the free admission,"  Maxwell said. "I think it's reflected the fear -- I don't think people  particularly wanted to deal with (events promoting AIDS awareness)."  </P> <P> At the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles, which also offered  free admission, attendance was down to about 290 visitors from the usual 400,  although about $650 was raised for AIDS Project Los Angeles. Spokeswoman  Cynthia Campoy said that the museum attributed the low turnout to publicity  reflecting that several museum and galleries were closed for the day.  </P> <P> There were about 35 people at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, about a third of  the regular Friday attendance, according to executive director Tom Rhoads. He  attributed the low attendance to the fact that the museum's windows were  blacked out, making it appear closed. About $100 was raised for AIDS Project  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego had a smaller crowd than usual  Friday but collected about $200 for donation to a local AIDS research  organization, said director Arthur Ollman.  </P> <P> At the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, which darkened its photography gallery  to display a photograph of Samuel Wagstaff Jr., an important collector who died  of AIDS in 1987, staff members said the reaction of museum-goers was very  positive, although attendance was "pretty normal for a Friday."  </P> <P> The Getty will donate about $800 from Friday's sale of 47 copies of Wagstaff's  book, "A Collection of Photographs" to the American Foundation for AIDS  Research.  </P> <P> At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which also admitted all patrons for  free and passed out envelopes for patrons to mail donations to AIDS Project Los  Angeles and other AIDS organizations, 843 people visited the museum -- about 50  more than usual for a Friday, museum officials said.  </P> <P> The museum also darkened a Robert Longo artwork called "Black Planet (for  A.Z.)," which the artist dedicated to Arnie Zane, a friend who died of AIDS in  1988. Instead, a spotlight was made to shine on a sign explaining the  significance of a Day Without Art. Howard Fox, curator of contemporary art,  said that museum-goers' response was "very effective. It was very poignant. It  was in a place that everybody had to stop by, and everybody was stopping to  read (the explanatory sign)."  </P> <P> Response at the few participating local commercial galleries was dismal. Not a  single painting was sold at LJB Gallery in Newport Beach, which planned to  donate 10% of the day's proceeds to AIDS research, and at Dorothy Goldeen  Gallery in Santa Monica, which requested that visitors make $3 donations to  APLA, Goldeen estimated that less than $20 was raised.  </P> <P> Zan Dubin and Mary Helen Berg contributed to this article.  </P></p>

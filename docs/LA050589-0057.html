			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO-SMOKING LAW DRAFTED  </P> <P> Smoking will be banned in city-owned buildings and public areas of banks,  restaurants and other establishments under a new law drafted by El Segundo  officials.  </P> <P> Council members are expected to adopt the ordinance when they meet May 16. It  will go into effect 30 days later.  </P> <P> City regulations will follow those advocated by Americans for Non-Smokers  Rights, which lobbied council members to draft the ordinance.  </P> <P> Besides prohibiting smoking in city buildings and public areas, the ordinance  will require restaurants with more than 40 seats to create a nonsmoking area.  Eateries with fewer than 40 seats will be required to post a sign telling  customers whether smoking is allowed or prohibited.  </P> <P> Also, employers must maintain nonsmoking areas in lounges and cafeterias, and  establish smoke-free areas for nonsmokers "to the maximum extent possible."  Employers will not be forced to create smoke-free areas if it requires them to  incur any expenses.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL HUNG UP OVER AN AREA CODE  </P> <P> Some people live by the book, others by the numbers. For the second category,  the creation of a new telephone area code out of venerable old 213 seems to  have caused some trauma. After all, many in the San Gabriel and San Fernando  valleys felt rejected when they were kicked out of 213 in 1984.  </P> <P> When Pacific Bell and General Telephone announced last week that the entire Los  Angeles County coast would be carved into a new 310 area code beginning in  1992, the search began for social reasons or psychological consequences. What  would it mean for Malibu and San Pedro both to be in this new sub-state? What  was the political fallout of dividing West Hollywood between the two code  areas?  </P> <P> Patient telephone company personnel explained that the split was done purely of  the numbers, by the numbers and for the numbers, with no discrimination  intended. The technological explosion has outrun available digits. No one  anticipated having to create a new area this soon, but the phenomenon of fax  machines, paging devices and cellular telephones ate up numbers like a hungry  Pac-Man. Pacific Bell cannot tell how many lines are devoted to fax machines,  but there are 258,000 cellular phones now in use and paging devices have  consumed 42 prefixes.  </P> <P> If any Southlanders feel slighted by being turned out of good ol' 213, consider  Oakland and the rest of eastern San Francisco Bay. They are being ejected from  sophisticated 415 and given a 510 area of their own in 1991. Gertrude Stein's  great line about Oakland will have to go. Now there is a there, there.  </P></p>

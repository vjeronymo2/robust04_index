			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Clinton's campaign at new high CHEERING crowds and buoyant polls are carrying Governor Bill Clinton's campaign to new highs after the Democratic convention last week sealed his nomination as the party's presidential candidate. Convention euphoria lifted him in the opinion polls, as expected, and the withdrawal of Mr Ross Perot appears to have further widened his lead over President George Bush. Accompanied by Senator Al Gore, his vice-presidential running-mate, he drew 8,000 supporters yesterday to a rally at Columbus, Ohio, the latest stop in his 1,000-mile bus tour of eight states in the US heartland. A Gallup poll, published yesterday by CNN and USA Today, showed Mr Clinton as the choice of 56 per cent of those questioned, compared with 34 per cent for Mr Bush. It also showed Mr Clinton ahead by 20 percentage points in the south and mid-west, and by 36 points in the north-east. In the west, he led by 13 points. Clinton campaign officials recognise this advantage will fade. The question is - how much of it will last, and for how long? Political analysts such as Mr Charles Cook warn that the euphoria could lead the campaign into wasting resources on states which might appear winnable now but in which it will have no real chance in November, as happened to Mr Michael Dukakis in Florida in 1988. Texas will offer the hardest choice for the Democrats, Mr Cook warns, as many believe Mr Perot's withdrawal places the state firmly within the Republican president's grasp. Feature, page 14.</p>

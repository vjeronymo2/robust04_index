			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anton Buteyko, Ukrainian presidential </F> adviser, by Francoise Delstanche in Brussels on 18 January:  "Kiev Expresses Its Faith in the Face of the Agreement on  Denuclearization"; first four paragraphs are L'ECHO introduction]    [Text] Anton Buteyko believes that the West is focusing too  much attention on nuclear affairs. Moderately optimistic about  the nuclear agreement for the future since, according to him,  the president has met Parliament's demands, Kravtchuk's adviser  sees no progress being made on the dossier regarding the Black  Sea fleet.    The tripartite agreement between the United States, Russia,  and Ukraine, signed last Friday in Moscow, was saluted yesterday  by the European Union as "an important contribution to  international security and stability," albeit on condition that  it be implemented rapidly, failing which any delay would be  considered with great anxiety.    The practical implementation of the agreement effectively  depends on the backing of the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev. Not  directly, but with respect to the conditions that it imposed on  the ratification of the Start I agreement on the reduction of  strategic nuclear arms, and on the ratification of the treaty on  nuclear non-proliferation, both of which Washington had laid  down as preconditions. However, the Ukrainian leaders are  proving relatively confident on these points. That is what was  explained to us yesterday by Anton Buteyko in an interview given  while passing through Brussels. However, he believes that the  West is focussing too much attention on the nuclear problem and  forgetting that other elements are emerging as definitely just  as important. Consequently, he argues, the development of equal  relations with the European Union would contribute to the  stability of the region.    Moreover, in his opinion, only Ukraine can check the  pressure  in Russia caused by new political forces like that of  Zhirinovskiy. For, in his view, the renaissance of these fascist  movements is a menace not only to Ukraine, but also to Europe as  a whole.    Delstanche: Do you think it will be easy to obtain  the Ukrainian Parliament's support for the tripartite agreement  on denuclearization?    Buteyko: The agreement does not formally require  ratification. On the other hand, when Parliament ratified the  Start I treaty, it voiced a certain number of reservations, in  particular concerning the security guarantee for Ukraine, and  the provision of technological and financial assistance in the  context of disarmament. In fact, it must be clear that when  Start I was negotiated, all the arms to be destroyed had to be  eliminated using the combined economic resources of the USSR as  a whole, whereas now we would have to destroy them using our own  resources. That, however, is impossible in view of the economic  crisis ravaging our country. Furthermore, the destruction of  this arsenal will benefit the Western nations at which the arms  in question were aimed. Therefore, it is logical that they  should contribute to that process, for we are contributing to  their security. Then again, Parliament has asked for  compensation for the material contained in the tactical and  strategic arms handed over to Russia.    In addition, it must be remembered that the negotiations  were  launched at the initiative of Ukraine, but that neither the  United States nor Russia took our interests into account. It  was Parliament's decision regarding the Start I treaty that  provided a positive impulse in the negotiations. All the more  so since we also understood that it was impossible to resolve  certain matters on a bilateral basis.  Horyn: Well, this high-ranking German official  explained his idea in approximately this way. Ukraine is  presently in a state of crisis. We do not have enough food.  However, some 10 years will pass, and our state will finally be  standing on its own two feet. It will be a competitor on  European agricultural markets. At the same time, traditional  exporters, such as Germany and France, will find themselves in a  difficult situation....    I replied to those arguments by saying that had Ukraine  remained within the empire, the entire Europe would have been  compelled to spend huge amounts of money on armaments in order  to insure themselves against the imperial threat. Europe would  have trembled before the Moscow empire as it did after World War  II.    Ukraine is not only a dream of the people and the form of  their survival. Ukraine is a factor of stability, peace, and  de- imperialization in Europe. Ukraine must become a therapist  of the imperial moods that prevail among the Russian people.  The recent elections in Russia are disturbing.    Pasichnyy: After all, the consequences of the  recent elections in Russia have again placed before the world a  threat of direct invasion from Moscow. Chauvinism is still  alive, and it has now acquired features of communo-fascism....    Horyn: Yes, they showed that it is not only the  ruling circles in the Kremlin that are infected with the virus  of imperialism. Many Russians display deep nostalgia for the  empire, because its very existence raised our neighbors in their  own eyes.    The results of the elections in Russia have also contributed  to a change in orientations in the West's attitude toward  Ukraine. Instead of diktat, we see a striving for a dialogue.    Pasichnyy: Pan Mykhaylo, you, as chairman of  Ukraine's Republican Party, are a candidate for deputy of the  Supreme Council at the coming elections. What is the attitude  of the Republicans toward Ukraine's nuclear status?    Horyn: We believe that the very fact of nuclear  missiles in Ukraine is a guarantee for us and a warning for all  of our neighbors that they should refrain from playing with  fire. We are not opponents of disarmament and we are not  against dismantling those missiles whose service life has  expired. However, in our opinion, 46 missiles must be left and  dismantled only after all nuclear powers make identical steps.    One more thing. Russia, after it received from us a large  number of medium-range missiles, has not to this day paid us for  the nuclear fuel -- this sum constitutes several billions of  U.S. dollars.    I, for example, do not agree that, while dismantling the  nuclear warheads, we should also be compelled to dismantle the  missiles themselves. They are our separate property -- they  were built at our factories. We will be able to use them to  protect ourselves from territorial encroachments by aggressors.    I hope that the president will not hasten to sign the  necessary documents that would fully disarm Ukraine. It would  be an irreparable blunder.</p>

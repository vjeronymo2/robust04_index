			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eastern up on US buying Eastern Electricity, the UK's leading regional electricity company (Rec), jumped as US investors bought the stock heavily in anticipation of further gains. The shares rose 26 to 848p on turnover of 4.4m and in expectation of a generously priced share buy-back by the company. US investment banks Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers were both said to be pursuing the stock, and the price was pushed additionally higher following heavy options turnover the previous day. Also, agency broker James Capel had been telling clients that, although the shares were technically on a market rating, they were cheap if the value of the National Grid flotation - due next year - was stripped out. The details of the flotation are as yet unknown, but the Recs are keen to hand surplus cash back to shareholders and Capel believes it makes no sense for the Recs to sell their stake in the National Grid or to retain any of the stake for themselves. If they are to give it all away that would strip almost 200p from the share price and put them on a yield relative of around 120 per cent to the market.</p>

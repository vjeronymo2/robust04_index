			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Award for woman over pay cut AN EXPLOSIVES worker who resigned when she was told her wages would be cut by Pounds 10 a week was awarded more than Pounds 6,300 compensation by an industrial tribunal yesterday. Mrs Janette Elliot, chief quality inspector at Brock's Explosives, Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway, was given 24 hours to sign a letter agreeing to the wage cut or lose her job. Mrs Elliot, who earned Pounds 162 a week, considered the matter overnight and resigned. The tribunal heard there was no consultation whatsoever about the change. The company, which did not attend the hearing, said it had a legal right to vary her wages without her consent. She was justified in leaving, the tribunal decided, because the company's action was a unilateral breach of her contract carried out in demeaning and humiliating circumstances amounting to unfair dismissal. The letter made clear the company was fully aware her consent to the change was necessary and that it was determined to push it through with or without her consent.</p>

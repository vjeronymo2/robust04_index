			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Brussels refers Steetley deal back to UK THE European Commission said yesterday it would allow the UK government to examine the proposed merger of Steetley and Tarmac's brick, clay tile and concrete businesses. It is the first time Brussels has given up its right to investigate a large EC takeover since new rules on merger investigations came into force. EC competition lawyers said the decision would help clarify the use of the specific clause in the 1990 regulations which gives national merger control bodies the right to ask for jurisdiction over cases being examined in Brussels. Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, stressed the 'very exceptional circumstances' of the Tarmac-Steetley joint venture. Officials played down the significance of the Commission's decision for future EC mergers, which they said would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The reference of the merger to British authorities could have an important bearing on the outcome of a rival Pounds 600m bid for the whole of Steetley by Redland, another large British building materials group. The UK Office of Fair Trading is considering whether to recommend an investigation of the Redland bid by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). It will now also consider the Tarmac-Steetley joint venture plans. Sir Leon said that had he harboured any doubts about referring the Tarmac-Steetley deal back to London, they would probably have been dispelled by Redland's bid. 'It is much better for related cases to be dealt with by one regulatory authority if at all possible,' he said. A preliminary European Commission investigation into the joint venture had been triggered automatically because of the large size of the combined EC turnover, including UK sales, of Tarmac and Steetley. The Commission said the deal would raise 'significant competition issues' in the UK market for bricks and clay tiles and threatened to create a dominant position for Steetley-Tarmac in both sectors. The merged group's markets, however, would be limited to Britain, and, in the case of bricks, to a region within 70 miles of the companies' factories, minimising the merger's effect on the European market, the Commission said. Mr Peter Lilley, UK trade secretary, now has to decide whether to order a full investigation by the MMC or clear one or both proposals. A third option under the 1989 Companies Act would be to require the companies to give undertakings to dispose of businesses which would give them an overbearing market position. If undertakings were not forthcoming, an investigation would go ahead. Since August 1990 the Department of Trade has asked the MMC to investigate 16 takeover bids. On five other occasions it has allowed bids to go through after companies gave undertakings. Mr Gerald Corbett, Redland's finance director said last night: 'We have always said that we would be prepared to give undertakings if that became necessary.' Mr Richard Miles, managing director of Steetley said his company and Tarmac would discuss with the Office of Fair Trading and the Industry Department competition issues raised by the EC decision. On the stock market, Redland shares fell 1p to 464p, Steetley gained 4p to 344p and Tarmac was up  1/2 p to 119 1/2 p. National authorities have asked for the right to examine large EC mergers only three times since the merger regulations came into force in September 1990. Lex, Page 20</p>

According to RID sources, the People's Movement of Belarus  [NDB] has reaffirmed its intentions to participate in early  elections. It has also claimed that it has better chances than  its opponents expect.    Moreover, in the course of preparation for its congress, due  in February, NDB will select candidates for the Shadow  Government of National Salvation. A recently released statement  confirms NDB aspirations to play an important role on the  political Olympus: "No `coalition' or `alternative' government  will be approved without NDB's acceptance. Any new government  is doomed to failure without our approval."</p>

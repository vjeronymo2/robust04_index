			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE COVER:  </P> <P> Shirley Temple Black will be playing a return engagement in Pasadena when she  presides over the Tournament of Roses Parade on Monday.  </P> <P> As a curly-headed child star, she was grand marshal of the 1939 parade 50 years  ago, the youngest in the parade's history. Now, she's been invited back to be  grand marshal of the 100th Rose Parade, which starts Monday at 8 a.m. (to be  covered on various TV stations; see Watchables for details). She joins a select  group of others who have been grand marshals twice: Bob Hope, Richard Nixon and  Earl Warren.  </P> <P> Riding in the parade with Mrs. Black this year will be her granddaughter,  Teresa Falaschi, shown with her on the cover.  </P></p>

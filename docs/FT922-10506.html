			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: A Quantum leap by CMB with a ring-pull fluted can THE DAYS of the can opener may be numbered. CMB, the Franco-British packaging group which makes about half of the 6bn food cans manufactured in the UK each year, is launching a new product with a radically different fluted body and a ring-pull end. It claims this is the most significant development in can technology since the invention of the two-piece can some 20 years ago. Mr Francisco Serrano, the marketing manager responsible for launching the can, said CMB was close to finalising a deal with a big consumer products company and expected it to appear on supermarket shelves by the late summer. The Quantum can, as it is known, has a vertically-fluted shell which gives it a distinctive appearance and greater strength enabling the use of thinner steel. The new can's wall is 0.17mm thick compared with the 0.21mm in existing straight-walled cans. The can is likely, however, to cost more than the conventional product because of the ring-pull end which tears away completely. The company believes the extra cost means it will initially be used only for premium products. But the smooth texture of the can allows direct printing onto the metal, dispensing with the need for a wrap-around printed label. Steel cans were first produced 180 years ago to preserve food for military forces. In those days cans were manufactured at the rate of six an hour. Modern production lines turn them out at a rate of 500 to 1,000 a minute. CMB says its new product can be used on existing filling lines with only minor modifications. Its launch follows a three-year development programme at CMB Foodcan's research facility at Wantage, Oxfordshire. In market research studies, CMB found the can was preferred by more than 80 per cent of shoppers. But whether consumers with arthritis will be so appreciative of the 'easy-to-open' ring-pulls remains a matter of doubt.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf has one-month deadline CANARY WHARF has only a month to bring in new investors and to persuade the government to move civil servants to the office development if it is to avoid a liquidation which could make it a ghost town. This was the bleak message yesterday from Mr Michael Dennis, the Olympia &amp; York director who masterminded Europe's biggest office development, and from Mr Michael Pickard, chairman of the London Dockland Development Corporation. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, also made clear yesterday that the government planned to tell Canary Wharf's administrators, who took control of the project on Thursday, that the Pounds 400m contribution agreed by O&amp;Y towards the extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line was 'non-negotiable'. Meanwhile the administrators, who are three partners of Ernst &amp; Young, have been deciding which of Canary Wharf's running costs need to be cut immediately. There are fears that an early victim will be the Riverbus Partnership, which provides the only commercial passenger service on the River Thames. O&amp;Y has only a minority holding in Riverbus, but it has been covering the losses generated by the service. Mr Pickard, the main policy maker outside central government for Docklands, said rapid decisions had to be taken by government and potential investors in Canary Wharf if it was not to be damaged irreparably. A number of companies, including American Express and Texaco, are understood to be reviewing whether they should move to Canary Wharf as they had planned. Both Mr Pickard and Mr Dennis said a government commitment to move 2,000 civil servants to Canary Wharf needed to be made quickly, to reassure these companies and prevent the occupancy rate falling to level where liquidation would be inevitable. Mr Pickard pointed out that the Canary Wharf buildings were technologically more sophisticated than most UK buildings. Unless they were maintained, which might not take place if the project was liquidated, the buildings could deteriorate badly. He said the regeneration of Docklands could be set back by three or four years if Canary Wharf was not kept as a going concern. He said the costs of such a delay far outweighed the 'small sums' needed from government and investors to keep Canary Wharf afloat. Mr Dennis disclosed that O&amp;Y had drawn up a list of 20 investors with sufficient resources to rescue Canary Wharf. It began its search for such investors three months ago, at the suggestion of Citicorp, the US bank with a substantial exposure to O&amp;Y's worldwide operations. The potential investors include the investment offices of most of the oil-rich Gulf states, the Singapore government's investment office and a handful of international insurance companies. Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong investor, is also on the list but yesterday that Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, may become involved in helping to raise outside finance. P&amp;O has been closely involved in Canary Wharf's development as owner of Bovis, the building contractor. Mr Major yesterday underlined that the government was not prepared to increase its contribution to the Jubilee project. It had already contributed well over Pounds 1bn to Docklands. His policy remained that the line would go ahead only when the owners of Canary Wharf provided the amount agreed. Mr Dennis pointed out that the contribution which Canary Wharf said it would make to the Jubilee line was not Pounds 400m in today's money, since the payments are staggered over 25 years. The value in today's money of the contribution is between Pounds 150m and Pounds 160m. Senior officials close to the prime minister said any flexibility in the government's negotiating position would be restricted to the timing of payments.

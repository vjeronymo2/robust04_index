			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Profits of gilts dealers decline Dealers in UK government bonds - gilts - saw a decline in their profits last year in spite of the continued strong performance of the market, the Bank of England says. The dealers showed a combined post-tax profit of Pounds 59m, down 8 per cent from Pounds 64m in 1992. The post-tax return on average capital fell to 9 per cent last year from 13 per cent in 1992, according to the Bank, which released its annual report on developments in the gilt market yesterday before the publication of its February Quarterly Bulletin. The fall in dealers' profits is set against a strong market, which benefited from the improvement in inflation and the decline in UK interest rates, and which remained undeterred by the government's large borrowing requirement. Turnover in the market rose from a daily average of Pounds 4.9bn in 1992 to Pounds 6.3bn last year. At the end of March UK investors owned 80.3 per cent of total gilt holdings and overseas investors owned 19.7 per cent. The rate of return on 10-year gilts was 19.4 per cent last year, up from 18.7 per cent the previous year, the Bank said. Last year was particularly good for the European government bond markets, and the gilt market was one of the better performing fixed-income markets although it was outstripped by the high-yielding Italian and Spanish markets. The Bank points out that dealers made more money in 1992 helped by 'two particularly sharp market movements . . . associated with the general election and the period following the suspension of sterling's membership of the ERM'. But profits were made on a more consistent basis last year, helped by the sustained rise in gilt prices for much of the period. The decline in the post-tax return on capital reflects the increase in capital employed, as the number of dealers involved in the market rose and individual firms injected capital for their various other fixed-income activities.</p>

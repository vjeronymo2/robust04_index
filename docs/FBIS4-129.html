			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Black Empowerment in Mining Sector -- "For decades, not to  say centuries, blacks have been barred by economic and  historical forces from ownership of South Africa's top layers of  business: the mining and industrial sectors," begins the  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 31 March in a page-14  editorial. "Today, both justice and economic realism demand  that this imbalance should be urgently redressed."  Consequently, Anglo-American's "plan to unbundle its 40  percent-controlled JCI [Johannesburg Consolidated Investments],  enabling black investors to acquire significant blocks of  shares, is a highly promising move," while "a black-run mining  house would be the cherry on the top."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Financing the ANC's RDP -- The Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in  English on 31 March in a page-14 editorial warns that "it is  becoming increasingly clear that South Africa's post-election  government will be fiscally challenged. The TEC's [Transitional  Executive Council] promise to the IMF that budget deficits will  be contained by curtailing expenditure rather than by increasing  taxes will be a major constraint, if it is kept," because the  BUSINESS DAY questions whether major reductions in current  spending are "really feasible at a time of affirmative action  and creation of new government structures? In time,  rationalisation opportunities will present themselves, but it is  wishful thinking to count on too high an 'apartheid dividend'."  "It is difficult to see where the savings can be made in the  short run to finance the massive investment promised in the RDP  [Reconstruction and Development Program]."  <H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>   `Battle of Johannesburg' -- The Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL  &amp;  GUARDIAN in English in its 31 March to 7 April edition in a  page-16 editorial states that the Zulus who died in front of the  ANC's Shell House in Johannesburg were not "lambs." "They had  come looking for trouble. Nevertheless, it was impossible to  escape the impression that they had been led to the slaughter,  victims in an increasingly cynical political game of  oneupmanship. They were men who had become more valuable to  their leaders in death than they could ever have been in life."  Concluding, the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN blames the police for  the "complete failure of public order." "This was first and  foremost their disaster," states the editorial.  <H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>   Johannesburg Violence -- "In a country of endemic  violence...we suppose we should not be shocked by what happened  in central Johannesburg yesterday, but we are," begins the  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 29 March in a page-6  editorial. THE CITIZEN is "deeply shocked" because of "snipers  who killed marchers like they were shooting at a flock of  birds." Inspite of this "horror" now is "not a time for  overreaction, not a time for retaliation, not a time for  reprisals. It is a time for calm. A time for an awareness of  what violence is doing to this country." In conclusion the  paper states that it has "over and over again" said "let there  be peace."    Meeting of National Leaders -- "We are pleased that Zulu  King  Goodwill Zwelithini will attend a meeting with State President  de Klerk, KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and ANC  president, Mr Nelson Mandela, next week to discuss steps to  contain violence and to seek solutions to Zulu aspirations"  because "the ugly events in downtown Johannesburg have sinister  implications not just for the election but for peace itself,"  begins an editorial on page 6 of the 30 March edition of THE  CITIZEN. Regarding the declaration of a state of emergency in  Natal/kwaZulu, THE CITIZEN states that "since the ANC, which  dominates the TEC, has condemned previous states of emergency,  it is hypocritical to support one now." "The solution does not  lie in introducing Draconian measures, but in reaching an  understanding on the holding of the election without  interference, intimidation or violence." Later the paper states  "we expect the government to act firmly but evenhandedly," and  to stop "treating the Zulu issues as an aberration on the part  of the king and Chief Buthelezi. The Zulu demands are  deep-rooted and cannot simply be ignored." In a final demand  THE CITIZEN states that "the ANC must stop protesting its  innocence about the events in downtown Johannesburg."</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (13): Rules and beyond - Avoiding the legal pitfalls BUILDING A legislative framework for inbound investment is one of the most important tasks facing the post-communist governments of eastern Europe. Foreign investors demand transparency and need to know not only the rules for investment but the rules of the process by which their capital is admitted. They also need to know which criteria are used by those involved in reviewing privatisation proposals to differentiate between good and unacceptable proposals. These are the necessary basis both for commitments from foreign investors and the warranties and indemnities given by the selling state authority. Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovkia have made the most progress in all of these areas, but they all have some way to go. All three have eliminated the key early legal hurdles to foreign investment, namely, 'who owns the property?' and 'how do we get our money out?' Their privatisation laws spell out the nature of state ownership and who is entitled to sell property on the state's behalf. Profits can be repatriated thanks to foreign exchange laws that allow for easy convertibilty of domestic currencies into foreign exchange. Poland and Hungary have been criticised by some foreign investors for limiting investment opportunities by adopting a 'top down' approach to privatisation, in which companies or industrial sectors are hand-picked by the government for privatisation one at a time. Czechoslovakia, on the other hand, requires all state enterprises to prepare their own privatisation projects by June This 'bottom up' innovation has now been borrowed by Russia and important elements are being considered by the Poles and the Hungarians. The Czech Ministry of Privatisation has also helped smooth the entry of foreign capital by developing standardised positions on key legal and environmental issues. Environmental indemnities are of crucial importance given the 'production at any price' philosophy of the old regimes.' The fear of inheriting responsibility for environmental sins of the past has emerged as a considerable deterrent to inbound foreign investment throughout the region. The Czech republic has addressed the problem by creating a tough but clear legal framework for environmental responsibiltiy. Current policy says the state will reimburse foreign investors only to the extent of their initial share purchase price, and then only for the legally mandated cleanup of conditions which could not have been disclosed prior to signature of the deal. The Czechs are also limiting to a bare minimum the warranties which will be given to prospective investors about the financial and business condition of the companies they will be buying. These are tough positions, but they are nevertheless welcomed by foreign investors for their certainty. Even in Czechoslovakia foreign investors complain about the length and uncertainty of the project review process. Foreign investment proposals must be reviewed by at least two ministries and the Czech cabinet, then finally negotiated with a state fund that becomes the selling shareholder. With differing mandates and priorities, these stakeholders, and their advisors, rarely speak with one voice. This results in points understood as 'agreed' by one government party occasionally having to be re-negotiated to suit others who become involved later in the review process. Foreign investors, who are used to 'one-stop shopping' when negotiating corporate acquuisitions, often find this bewildering and frustrating. Another complication arises from the absence of transparent guidlines from the supervising authorities involved in the review of foreign investment projects. Such guidelines would put all sides on notice as to what considerations, apart from price, will be given priority. Although investment bankers to the Ministry of Privatisation have evidently been applying a set of their own criteria, so far these have not been published or widely distributed. This means that foreign investors and target company management generally do not know what the reviewing minstires will be looking for as they prepare their proposals. It also allows losing bidders to allege that obtuse or non-commercial factors, like personal preferences and the nationality of prospective investors, affect the decision-making process. With thousands of companies in the privatisation pipeline, Czechoslovak authorities are now grappling with the next major issue: how to govern, restructure and encourage foreign investment in the companies slated for privatisation. Foreign investment, technology and know-how will be essential for the oversized and inefficient state enterprises struggling to survive privatisation. But it is an open question whether all this will be allowed to enter quickly enough. Initial delays might be caused by the fact that the companies will continue to be owned by a state fund at least for the next several months until voucher 'bidding' ends. It is not yet clear whether the boards of these companies will be allowed to negotiate deals in the interim. If not, it remains to be seen whether the fund will be an active owner and make timely decisions. After voucher privatisation holders to sort out the companies' strategic and investment strategies. These shareholders will have to overcome their own inexperience and the virtual absence of Western means of corporate governance such as proxy voting. Such problems might have been fatal were it not for the fact that most of the 8.5m voucher books issued to Czech and Slovak citizens have been deposited with a handful of institutionally managed investment funds Nevertheless, recent regulations prohibiting funds from owning a controlling stake in any single company mean that some shareholders will have to consult and agree before decisions can be taken. How serious the resulting delays will be remains to be seen. Also unclear is whether secondary markets will develop quickly enough and will be robust enough to allow foreign buyers to buy control through the exchange. The fate of thousands of companies and possibly Mr Klaus' voucher programme itself hinge on the answers to these questions.

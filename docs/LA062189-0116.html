			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAY DIRECTORS NAMED TO RUN VATICAN BANK ROCKED BY '82 SCANDAL  </P> <P> In a major shake-up prompted by the scandal that depleted its coffers, the  Vatican on Tuesday announced appointments to an international board of lay  directors that will run the Vatican bank.  </P> <P> Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the board, or Supervisory Council,  would meet for the first time on July 18, when U.S. Archbishop Paul Marcinkus  was expected to formally end his involvement with the bank after 18 years as  president.  </P> <P> Marcinkus was caught up in the damaging 1982 scandal in which the bank, known  officially as the Institute for Religious Work, was linked to the alleged  fraudulent collapse of Italy's private Banco Ambrosiano.  </P> <P> A statement said the board of five bankers and businessmen from Italy, Spain,  Switzerland, West Germany and the United States had been named by a control  commission of cardinals appointed by Pope John Paul II as the bank's supreme  authority.  </P> <P> It is the first time in the 47-year history of the bank that laymen have  exerted such powerful control over its affairs.  </P> <P> The board will be responsible for the administration and management of the bank  and will oversee its financial activities in much the same way as the board of  a commercial bank, Navarro-Valls said.  </P> <P> It will also nominate a lay director and deputy director to be responsible for  day-to-day operations, replacing the post of president, and three lay auditors.  </P> <P> The board members, all Catholics, are Angelo Caloia, president of Italy's  Mediocredito Lombardo; Thomas Macioce, a New York lawyer and chairman of Allied  Stores Corp.; Jose Angel Sanchez Asiain, president of the Spanish Banco Bilbao  Vizcaya; Philippe de Weck, a former president of Union de Banques Suisses, and  Theodor Pietzcer, a director of West German Deutsche Bank.  </P> <P> The sweeping reforms were first announced in outline form in March after a  commission of 15 Roman Catholic cardinals met to discuss the Vatican's mounting  budget deficit.  </P> <P> The changes are widely regarded as a response to calls for greater transparency  at the Institute for Religious Work, whose links to the Banco Ambrosiano affair  prompted a drop in contributions to Vatican coffers from Catholics around the  world.  </P> <P> The Vatican bank owned a small part of Banco Ambrosiano, whose Chairman Roberto  Calvi was found hanging under London's Blackfriars Bridge shortly after his  bank collapsed with $1.2 billion in debts.  </P> <P> The Vatican denied any responsibility for the scandal but paid $250 million to  Ambrosiano creditors in what it called a good-will gesture.  </P> <P> Italy's constitutional court last year definitively quashed arrest warrants  against Marcinkus and two Vatican bank executives on charges of fraudulent  bankruptcy in the Banco Ambrosiano case.  </P> <P> Marcinkus was asked in March to help with the transition of the bank but his  future has not been formally announced. Vatican sources say they expect him to  devote his time to another job he already holds as governor of Vatican City.  </P> <P> Tuesday's statement said the control commission of cardinals had also appointed  Italian Monsignor Donato de Bonis to act as prelate to the Institute for  Religious Work under the new statutes.  </P> <P> De Bonis, currently listed as the bank's secretary general, will essentially be  a liaison between the control commission and the board, but Navarro-Valls said  he would have no executive powers.  </P></p>

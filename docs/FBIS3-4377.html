The UN Children's Fund and Population Fund have decided to  prolong the term of the project called "Health Care for Mothers  and Children, and Population-Control Services in China," and  continue to shore up the project by adopting interim measures.    "This is because China has won credit from the international  organizations in carrying out the project plan and achieved  marked progress in lowering the mortality rate of mothers and  infants," said a spokesman for an ongoing work conference held  by the three sides in Yichang, in central China's Hubei Province.    The program started in 1990 to cut the mortality rate of  mothers and infants in the country's poor areas, and to enable  the grassroots medical bodies to provide better health care for  them as well as effective birth-control services.    The project covers 300 poor counties in 27 provinces and  autonomous regions.    The authorities believe that it is imperative for China to  meet its promise of "Health Care for Everyone by 2000."    Chinese government agencies at all levels have poured 275  million yuan into implementing the programs. A total of 360,000  medical workers have received special training, and 6,850 towns  and 97,753 villages have received basic medical equipment  through the project.    Another five counties are to be included in the project.    The officials disclosed that the mortality rates of mothers  and infants in China are respectively 0.95 per 1,000 and 3.1  percent, much lower than the averages for developing countries.</p>

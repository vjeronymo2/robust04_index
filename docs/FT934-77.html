			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Management: A vision of superhumanity - How do today's managers see tomorrow? Peter Herriot concludes our series with the view from the sharp end Management gurus have already been free with their predictions for the management tasks of the next century. The senior executive of the year 2000 will be a composite of the business acumen of Lord Weinstock, the innovative genius of Bill Gates, and the integrity of the Archangel Gabriel (in no particular order). To prepare for this superhuman role, he or she will have rowed across the Atlantic (twice) and written a seminal text on moral philosophy. Gurus have pontificated, but we have heard little from those at the sharp end. What do the people currently doing the job believe the requisite roles will be? What are their recommendations regarding the most appropriate ways of developing such skills? Sundridge Park surveyed 260 CEOs and general managers to find out. They were asked what the biggest changes in their own business environment were going to be by the year 2003; what were the role requirements for coping with these challenges; and how might people best be developed to fill such roles. The three biggest business changes predicted were these: innovative, high-quality products and services will be even more essential than they are at the moment if competitive advantage is to be achieved; there will be much greater collaboration with customers and with other organisations; and the business environment will be yet more unpredictable and competitive. So much for a return to a mythical pre-recessionary steady state. As for the necessary role requirements in the next century, there was more than a hint of the Archangel Gabriel syndrome. The strategic manager of 2003 will have to be, above all: A Truster, who allows others to take risks and lives with their mistakes. An Ally, who networks and forms alliances. A Changer, who manages change consultatively. Although the traditional role of Pointer, who sets and communicates objectives, was considered important, it did not relate especially closely to the new business issues. How are such paragons to be developed? Not surprisingly, to be a Truster one needs to have been trusted oneself. It is vital that developing strategic managers are allowed to take risks and responsibility themselves. It also helps to have done a wide variety of jobs, perhaps because this reveals the skills and knowledge which others have had to develop to fulfil their roles. As for the role of Ally, it is important to have managed one's career so that both at the corporate level and at the sharp end of a business one has had real contact with other organisations. Aspirant Allies are also urged to involve themselves in teams and project work, where they can play, and become skilled at, a variety of roles. And the Changers, the movers and shakers - what of them? The important qualification here is that the Changer does it consultatively. Red meat eating is therefore not a good preparation. Rather, the skills of persuasion are required. These are best honed in the context of project teams. The overall picture is that a considerable increase in interpersonal skills will be needed. The strategic manager of 2003 will have to establish and maintain working relations with a much wider range of people than at present. He or she will need to understand where people from all levels of their own organisation are coming from; to appreciate the different assumptions, values and practices of people from other organisations and sectors; and to get inside the hearts and minds of different national cultures. There was, incidentally, a very interesting prediction about organisational size. Our respondents felt that the numbers of employees overall, and of managers, would decline. However, the number of professionals would increase. When we looked at the financial and professional services sector from among our respondents, they placed much less importance on the three key role requirements than did respondents from other sectors. So the professionals, the only people who are going to become more numerous, are less likely to value the skills of forming and maintaining relations with others. They will certainly be a challenge for the remaining general managers. Organisations will need to concentrate on helping their people to develop the appropriate role skills, though much will depend on which business changes will have the most powerful impact on them. For some of the methods suggested by our respondents, there are no short cuts. It is simply not possible to cram varied cross-functional and cross-national job experience into a year or two. It is also noteworthy that fast track schemes are losing their popularity - they hardly encourage the others, and there is no time for the fast-trackers to learn from the consequences of their mistakes. On the other hand, some of the recommended developmental techniques have shorter time horizons. For example, teamworking on projects permits a variety of roles. It also makes learning from outcomes much more immediate. Teams can monitor and evaluate their progress during their task. They can discover and learn from the outcomes after it is over. One of the most important processes in successful teamworking is managing the boundaries - keeping sponsors and clients informed and happy. Again, this is ideal preparation for the role of Ally and for the business requirement for increased collaboration. So, viewed from the perspective of the senior executives of today, their successors will tread an ever-expanding stage, full of a variety of players. They will not be strutting around as isolated, heroic figures, bearing visions back down from the burning bush up on the mountain. Rather, they will have learned from others to understand and utilise diversity. The author is head of research at Sundridge Park Management Centre</p>

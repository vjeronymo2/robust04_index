			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Samara, 7 Feb -- The main aim of the working visit  by representatives of the Russian Armed Forces command to the  Volga Military District is to test issues concerning the  coordination of military doctrine and practice, on the spot, and  to study problems of military training and the stationing of  troops. Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  stated this at a meeting in Samara with managers and officers of  the Volga Military District.    Touching on the problems of Russia's Armed Forces, Pavel  Grachev noted that the army draft was carried out in a  reasonably organized fashion last year. Russia's Armed Forces  currently have 60 percent of their full complement of staff. It  is proposed that 70-75 percent of the posts in Russia's Armed  Forces should be filled after this year's spring recruitment and  85-90 percent by the end of the year. In the minister's  opinion, this will enable the Russian Army to carry out the  tasks it is faced with in guaranteeing the state's security.    The defense minister noted that he has prepared a  directive on the reform of the system of educational work in the  troops, the focus of which is to be moved to the localities.  Touching on problems of housing Russian Army subunits withdrawn  from abroad, Grachev noted that since 1992 270,000 servicemen,  around 3,000 tanks, 6,000 armored vehicles, and around 1,500  aircraft have been withdrawn onto Russian territory. In  connection with this, providing facilities for servicemen is one  of the most important tasks facing the Russian Defense Ministry  today. Speaking about the reduction in the overall numbers in  the Russian Army, the minister stated that Russia's Armed Forces  have to be reduced to 2 million by 1 January 1995. This,  according to him, is the limit for troop reduction. At the  present time Russia's Armed Forces number 2,341,000.    Grachev also spoke of the planned transition to the  territorial command principle. All arms of service on his  territory should be subordinate to the district commander. In  the minister's opinion, this should ensure that they are  reliably controlled. Touching on the financial position of  Russia's Armed Forces, Grachev noted that the government was in  debt to the army to the tune of around 2.3 trillion rubles in  1993.    This evening the Russian minister held a meeting with heads  of the Samara Oblast and town administrations. Problems  concerning social provision for the district's troops were  discussed.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bethlehem Steel back in black after three years BETHLEHEM Steel, the US's second largest producer, recorded its first quarterly profit in three years as the effects of cost-cutting and this year's steel price rises took effect. At the same time Mr Hank Barnette, chairman, indicated a continuation of the recovery, pointing to a 'moderate recovery' in the economy and most of the company's markets. 'Orders for light flat rolled products remain at moderately strong levels,' he added. Bethlehem recorded net income of Dollars 31m, or 23 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with a Dollars 58m loss the year before, on sales up 5 per cent to nearly Dollars 1.1bn. Operating costs fell 10 per cent, to Dollars 926m. The latest figures are flattered by a one-off tax benefit of Dollars 25m.</p>

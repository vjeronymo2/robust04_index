			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / A battle on the Italian front: Haig Simonian on the wide-ranging problems facing the new Japanese boss of a European state steel group For Napoleon Bonaparte, the island of Elba represented a brief period of exile before he moved on to greater glories. For Mr Hayao Nakamura, the Japanese manager who today takes over as managing director of Italy's Ilva state steel group, the company could be the stepping stone to a bigger corporate crown, or the unenviable termination of an impressive career. Ilva - the Latin name for the iron ore-bearing Mediterranean island - was supposed to mark a fresh start for the state steel industry after the collapse of Finsider, the former public-sector steel giant, out of which Ilva was born in 1988. Instead of rising from Finsider's ashes, Ilva has staged a remarkable replay of its demise. It has been trapped in a downward spiral of rising losses and soaring borrowing, estimated to have reached L8,300bn (Pounds 3.78bn) last year. Many of the problems at Ilva, Europe's fourth-biggest steel maker after Usinor-Sacilor of France, British Steel and Thyssen of Germany, are common to the industry. Prices in Europe have dropped by about 30 per cent since 1989 as a result of recession and oversupply, notably because of cheap steel imports from eastern Europe. Last month, the outlook worsened with the threat of US duties on European steel. Yesterday, the European Commission proposed a restructuring plan for the EC's ailing steel makers in return for financial aid of at least Ecu480m (Pounds 394m) to help cover social costs. An Ilva spokesman welcomed the Commission's suggestions for action against what he called 'suspected dumping' of eastern European steel in the EC. However, he warned that 'capacity cuts by EC producers must be accompanied by measures to alleviate the social impact of the job losses involved'. Ilva is likely to remain one of Europe's weakest producers, however. 'It is in an appalling mess,' says Mr Jonathan Aylen, a lecturer in economics and steel industry specialist at Britain's Salford University. 'If you take indicators such as labour productivity, product quality or innovation, Ilva is very much in the second rank in Europe.' In 1991, Ilva lost L504bn after minority interests and setting aside L411bn in extraordinary gains in a special restructuring fund. Recently its financial decline has become alarming with losses of L1,750bn in the first 11 months of 1992. Last month, IRI, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva, decided to draw the line. Shocked by the deterioration in Ilva's earnings - IRI had been forecasting a much lower Ilva loss of between L1,000bn and L1,300bn as recently as early January - it demanded the resignation of the steel maker's board of directors. The following day, it appointed Mr Nakamura, a former Nippon Steel executive, to the top job at Ilva. While the group's problems are symbolic of those facing most European steel makers, they are also a legacy of Italian state intervention in industry, where investments and strategic business decisions have been made as much on political as on commercial grounds. Under the government of Mr Guiliano Amato, which came to power last summer, the Italian authorities have demanded that public sector companies improve their financial performance. The government's sweeping privatisation plan is vital to lowering Italy's budget deficit, which at L163,150bn last year equals almost 11 per cent of gross domestic product. Where possible, profitable state enterprises such as the SME foods group have already been put up for sale. In the case of acute loss-makers such as Ilva, financial restructuring and management changes represent the first steps toward improving earnings and encouraging private investment. Last month's decision to seek the resignation of Ilva's former board of directors and choose a foreigner as managing director was an indication of Mr Amato's determination to minimise the influence of political considerations in industrial decision-making. Top management changes at Iritecna, the loss-making state-owned civil engineering and contracting group, suggests a similar strategy is under way there. The choice of a foreigner at Ilva was nevertheless unusual; the selection of a Japanese executive is unprecedented in one of Europe's most protected markets. But the appointment of Mr Nakamura indicates IRI, struggling to reduce group debts of nearly L70,000bn, is determined to sort out its wayward steel subsidiary. Mr Nakamura has impressive credentials. At 56, he has a solid background in the steel industry, most recently as Nippon Steel's Italian representative. Having lived in Italy for almost 30 years, he knows the country and language well. He is also one of a handful of Japanese businessmen who understand Italy's state sector. Mr Nakamura, who takes over today spent time in the 1960s as the Rome representative of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In the 1970s, he worked closely with Finsider on the expansion of its vast Taranto integrated steel works, still Italy's biggest but now a big drain on Ilva's resources. Later, he advised on the development of the Novi Ligure facility. In spite of his qualifications, observers are asking how Mr Nakamura will better the performance of his predecessor, Mr Giovanni Gambardella, in addressing Ilva's problems when most of Europe's steel makers are losing money. Mr Gambardella is blamed for many of Ilva's woes. He initiated its L1,500bn acquisition drive, which expanded its activities from basic steel making into more value-added and specialised products, such as coated steels for consumer durables. The strategy, however, drove up debts. Group borrowings surged from L3,500bn in 1989 to L6,300bn at the end of 1991. He is also accused of failing to control costs, although such attacks are harder to sustain in view of his success in closing 15 ex-Finsider plants, transferred to Ilva after 1988, and selling as many again. In the same period, the workforce was reduced by 30,000. The cut was 'quite an achievement', in view of Italy's tough labour laws, admits one IRI executive. But with earnings steadily deteriorating, the pace of cost-cutting was not quick enough, say Mr Gambardella's critics. Last November, IRI gave Ilva's former management a mid-1993 deadline to prepare a new restructuring plan. It is up to Mr Nakamura to finish the task. Speaking in Tokyo this month, Mr Nakamura indicated he would follow two paths to return Ilva to profit within three years. First, he hinted at further job cuts, notably at Taranto, and implied he would not seek consensus with the group's unionised workers at any price. Second, he hinted he wanted to change attitudes at the steel group. Ilva had some of the world's most modern plant - much of it built in collaboration with Nippon Steel - but suffered from weaknesses such as poor quality, bad marketing and unreliable delivery times. The three had fostered excessive wastage, inadequate attention to customers and lax financial controls. Improving such faults would require a greater sense of commitment from the workforce, he suggested. Joining the group as a rank outsider may help Mr Nakamura take painful decisions on further redundancies and closures. 'He has to do for Italian steel what Ian MacGregor (then chairman) did for British Steel about 10 years ago,' says Mr Aylen, of Salford University. But failing a surprise upturn in demand, it is hard to see how much extra room for cost-cutting Mr Nakamura will have. Mr Nakamura dismissed suggestions that his appointment marked a bridgehead for Nippon Steel to purchase a stake in Ilva or mount an outright takeover, although he left the door open for closer technological co-operation. Above all, he echoed Mr Gambardella in stressing Ilva's need for fresh capital to reduce borrowings. Last year, Ilva's former bosses openly discussed gaining a stock market quotation - and access to fresh money  - by buying out minority shareholders in its Dalmine tubes subsidiary and merging the two companies. That may still be on the cards, although the move will depend on first transferring the bulk of Ilva's debts to a separate company to make it more attractive to investors. A similar manoeuvre took place on Ilva's birth, when Finsider was retained as an empty shell containing about two-thirds of the group's L9,000bn debts. Just possibly, Mr Nakamura's arrival at Ilva could persuade outside investors that the company has the potential to be an interesting recovery stock. Contacts with foreign bankers had already taken place under the previous management. But before outsiders offer to help, the group will first have to show it is willing to tackle its problems fast and effectively.  ----------------------------------------- ILVA at a glance  ----------------------------------------- Group sales 1989   L10,556bn 1990   L10,611bn 1991   L10,608bn  ----------------------------------------- Group net profits and (loss)* 1989   L208bn 1990   L115bn 1991   (L504bn)**  ----------------------------------------- * After minority interests ** After setting aside L411bn in special restructuring fund  ----------------------------------------- Source: company reports  -----------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL TAX ON LOTS FACES A STIFF FIGHT;  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS: MOST RESIDENTS DON'T HAVE SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN, AND OF THOSE WHO  DO, MANY ARE INELIGIBLE TO VOTE.  </P> <P> Selling a tax increase to voters is an uphill struggle anywhere. Beverly Hills  school officials and their allies may find their own hill especially steep as  they try to persuade the city's voters to support a parcel tax next month  designed to bail the school district out of its financial troubles.  </P> <P> The parcel tax initiative, Proposition B on the June 5 ballot, must be approved  by two-thirds of the voters to take effect. The five-year tax would raise about  $4.5 million a year for the schools, or about $22.5 million in all, through  assessments on each of the 9,472 residential and commercial parcels of land in  the city.  </P> <P> Parcels would be taxed each year on a sliding scale ranging from $250 for  condominiums to $750 for commercial plots larger than 10,000 square feet.  </P> <P> Supporting the tax is a broad coalition of school officials, teachers, parents  and city officials. They say the tax is necessary to maintain the quality of  education in the Beverly Hills Unified School District and, indirectly, the  property values and the city's image. A low-key group of opponents is  fashioning a platform of tax revolt and back-to-basics in education.  </P> <P> Despite the apparent popularity of their cause, supporters of the tax know the  odds are not in their favor. Statewide, of the 80 school district parcel tax  elections held from 1983 through last November, only 30 have passed. (One  district that has approved them is the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School  District, where voters have twice approved a $58-a-parcel tax.)  </P> <P> Among the failures was Beverly Hills' last parcel tax attempt, in March, 1987.  In that election, the proposed tax was favored by 59% of the voters -- but was  well short of the two-thirds needed for passage. A criticism of that tax  measure was that since it proposed a flat fee of $270 on every parcel, small  plots would be taxed the same amount as sprawling estates. The variable rate  this time around will eliminate such inequities, supporters say.  </P> <P> But there remain some special circumstances in Beverly Hills that make it  particularly difficult to push a school tax increase through. Consider that:  </P> <P> * Beverly Hills contains an unusually high percentage of residents with no  current ties to the public schools. School district spokeswoman Hali Wickner  gives a rough estimate that less than one-fifth of Beverly Hills residents have  school-age children.  </P> <P> * Meanwhile, as a result of the influx of immigrants in recent years  (particularly from Iran), an unusually high percentage of parents with  school-age children are ineligible to vote because they are not U.S. citizens.  Sherman Kulick, a leader of the campaign against the tax, estimates that 40% of  the parents of the district's students are not eligible.  </P> <P> * Teachers, who in most school districts could be counted on for a significant  pro-tax bloc of votes, are mostly on the sidelines in Beverly Hills, because  few teachers can afford to live in the city. Judy McIntire, president of the  teachers union, the Beverly Hills Education Assn., estimates that just 12% of  the district's 300 teachers, nurses, counselors and librarians live in the  city.  </P> <P> If the tax passes, teachers will receive an additional 3% pay increase for the  1990-91 school year, on top of a 7% raise already provided in the settlement  reached after the teachers' 13-day strike last fall.  </P> <P> If the tax is rejected, a lot more than the 3% raise is at stake. Union and  district officials say it will be necessary to lay off 48 teachers, counselors,  librarians and nurses. All told, the district will have to cut $3.2 million in  spending to balance the projected $30-million budget for 1990-91. Among the  casualties will be elementary music teachers, elementary computer and science  lab specialists and the Academic Decathlon coach. Two nurses will also be cut,  leaving only one for the entire 4,700-student district.  </P> <P> Although it serves a city of extraordinary wealth, the Beverly Hills school  district has had chronic money problems in recent years. As a result of a 1976  state Supreme Court decision, the state allocates money for public schools  based on enrollment rather than on the amount of property taxes a community  generates. Declining enrollment has brought further cuts in state funding, and  Proposition 13 and other laws require any additional local taxes for schools to  be approved in a referendum by two-thirds of the voters.  </P> <P> Despite these restrictions, the Beverly Hills school district still manages to  spend more money per student than any other unified school system in Los  Angeles County. The district receives a substantial direct subsidy from the  city of Beverly Hills -- $4.6 million this year. It gets about $350,000 a year  from a nonprofit fund-raising foundation and sells clothing emblazoned with the  logo of its famed high school.  </P> <P> McIntire, the teachers union president, said one high-school teacher has  already accepted a position in another district for next year, and others are  looking, rather than face the uncertainty of the election. "You can't wait  (until after the tax election), because the majority of the best jobs (in other  districts) will be taken," she said.  </P> <P> While non-resident teachers cannot vote, they are not sitting out the campaign.  About 100 teachers have pledged to work for passage of the tax, McIntire said.  This weekend, for example, teachers will join parents, residents and other  members of the Yes on Schools Committee in distributing flyers door to door. In  addition, the teachers union has contributed $4,000 to the campaign chest and  its parent organization, the California Teachers Assn., has given $8,000,  McIntire said.  </P> <P> The tax also has the support of the City Council, the Chamber of Commerce and a  student committee at Beverly Hills High School, which is registering  18-year-olds to vote.  </P> <P> The Yes on Schools Committee, which launched its campaign with a rally last  Sunday, plans a vigorous, high-budget effort to try to sell the tax to voters.  "If we can raise $75,000, $100,000, we'll raise it, and not apologize for doing  so," said committee co-chairman Bernard Nebenzahl. "We don't feel that's vulgar  or obscene. . . . This is not a campaign of silence. We have to get  (two-thirds) of the vote."  </P> <P> Opponents of the tax have formed the Beverly Hills Citizens for Cost-Effective  Quality Education. They say they will only spend $500 and will prevail.  </P> <P> "You can't fool the public. You're asking the public to tax themselves on a  nebulous record," said group chairman Kulick, adding that his organization has  more than 200 supporters. "It's a tax revolt," he said.  </P> <P> Kulick, who was a leader of the anti-tax drive in 1987, contends that the  district is not spending its money wisely. San Marino, La Canada, Palos Verdes  Peninsula and other school districts in wealthy communities spend less money  per student, yet their scores on statewide tests are just as high as in Beverly  Hills, he noted.  </P> <P> "Money does not buy an education," he said.  </P> <P> The expenditures of Beverly Hills schools are "way out of line," he added. "We  don't trust people who are in government to be responsible for spending within  their means. If you give them $2, they'll spend $3," he said.  </P> <P> Pro-tax campaign leader Nebenzahl disagreed. "The parcel tax is not about  throwing money at the district," he said, "it's about retaining programs. We're  not adding to the budget."  </P> <P> Nebenzahl acknowledged that some other affluent districts spend less per pupil  and produce test scores as good or better than in Beverly Hills, but the more  diversified programs offered by Beverly Hills -- including Advanced Placement  drama, art and computer programs -- mean that it is offering education "for the  total person," he said.  </P> <P> He continued: "What we don't want to have is our district homogenized to be the  same as all other districts."  </P> <P> Unlike in 1987, the district has no reserves to fall back on, he said. "The  district is in fact out of money."  </P> <P> Kulick scoffed at the need for computer, music and other specialist  instructors. "Education has to do with the basics, not the frill courses," he  said. "You shouldn't have to learn math on a computer. We had to do all the  adding in our head, by hand -- that's the essence of learning."  </P> <P> The district, he said, is crying wolf. "They told us the school district would  go to hell" if the tax lost in 1987, Kulick said. "The school district didn't  get destroyed," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Background  </P> <P> The proposed parcel tax grew out of an acrimonious 13-day teachers strike last  fall, which was settled only after a group of frustrated parents intervened.  They persuaded the teachers union and the district officials to return to the  bargaining table, pledged to raise up to $600,000 to go to employee salaries  and benefits and helped hammer out a contract containing a two-year, 12% pay  increase. As part of the deal, all parties to the settlement also agreed to  support a parcel tax, on the understanding that if it passed, some of the  revenue would be used to add 3% to the teachers' salary schedule in 1990-91.  </P> <P> Heated Meeting: Parcel tax is praised and denounced at heated Beverly Hills  council meeting.

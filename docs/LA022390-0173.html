			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LLOYDS POSTS $1.2-BILLION LOSS  </P> <P> Lloyds Bank of Britain posted a pretax loss of $1.2 billion today after a huge  provision against loans to developing countries undermined hefty profits made  in 1988.  </P> <P> "The fact that our 1989 figures show a substantial loss arises from the large  provision we have made for Third World debt," Lloyds Chairman Sir Jeremy Morse  said in a statement.  </P> <P> "As a result we are fully covered for that part of the debt which is doubtful,  and the worst of this long-running problem should be behind us," he added.  </P> <P> Lloyds Bank PLC became the third of the top four British commercial banks to  see shrunken profits after making a provision of $2.9 billion to cover the debt  of less developed countries, amounting to 70% of total exposure.  </P></p>

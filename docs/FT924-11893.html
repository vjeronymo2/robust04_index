			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Bush on path to improve Vietnam links PRESIDENT George Bush said yesterday he had a 'road map' for normalising relations with Vietnam and 'significant progress' to that end had recently been made. But he questioned a published report that his goal was to achieve this by Inauguration Day in January. In a TV interview he said it was 'a major breakthrough' that officials in Hanoi last weekend showed a visiting US delegation 4,000 pictures and other documents relating to Americans held prisoner of war or missing in action during the Vietnam war. But he added 'I need to know exactly how major' this breakthrough was. There would be no full normalisation of relations, including an end to the 17-year US trade embargo on Vietnam, 'until I can say in total clear conscience' to the families of POWs and MIAs that there was a full acounting of the fate of their relatives. Mr Bush is to be briefed in the White House today by the US delegation, led by retired general John Vessey and Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona who spent 1967-73 as a prisoner of the Vietnamese. Mr McCain said he recognised pictures of himself taken as he was fished from a lake near Hanoi after his aircraft was shot down. He added: 'I have seen no proof of live Americans' still in Vietnam, an assertion that contradicts claims made at Congressional hearings this year that some are still being held. The Los Angeles Times, quoting mostly Asian diplomatic sources in Washington, reported yesterday that the US 'road map' involved a series of steps, some of which, including allowing group travel by Americans to Vietnam and the restoration of telephone links, have already been taken. Among the next moves would be to permit US companies to sign contracts in Vietnam and open representative offices there. Assuming a full accounting of missing Americans, this could be followed by the ending of the embargo and, after a democratically elected government is installed in Cambodia, by the restoration of full diplomatic relations. In the course of this process Vietnam would be allowed to borrow from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to help in its infrastructural reforms. Japan and France are among nations actively pushing the US to end its block on such credit. US commercial interests are also concerned they might lose out in competition for new business in Vietnam. Mr Bush confirmed this approach by saying: 'I'd like to see full relations. . . and see that nation become democratic and to fit into Asia.' But he went on: 'We're not there yet.' If Mr Bush loses the November 3 election, he would still be free to pursue this course before a new president takes over in January. This might let Governor Bill Clinton, if he wins, off a hook since he may be reluctant quickly to restore full commercial and diplomatic ties, given controversies about his opposition to the Vietnam war.</p>

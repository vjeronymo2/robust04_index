			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Oil strike threat to foreign workers Foreigners working for multinational oil groups in Nigeria said yesterday they were taking seriously threats by striking oil unions and pro-democracy groups against expatriate strike-breakers, Reuter reports from Lagos. An oil industry official said the threats had forced companies to tighten security at terminals. Both striking oil unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, have warned oil companies that action would be taken if expatriate staff did not stop work and back the strike to force an end to military rule in Nigeria and gain better management of the oil industry. The unions blame the use of expatriate staff and some senior Nigerian management staff for the failure of the strike, now in its fourth week, to cause serious disruption to crude oil production and exports.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] The head of Russian diplomacy is not interested in  what the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, says about Russia's foreign policy. Kozyrev has  no intention of commenting on Zhirinovskiy's numerous  statements. He urges public opinion "not to focus" attention on  them. The foreign minister said so in a conversation with a  group of journalists on the eve of his visit to Tashkent and  Almaty.    As Kozyrev said, such attention "feeds the embryos of a  furer  [as received]" the LDP leader actually is. "If we begin to  listen to what Zhirinovskiy says, and comment on his escapades,  we'll have no time for anything else. As a result we'll find  ourselves in a fantastic, not to say stupid, world," said  Kozyrev.    According to him, Zhirinovskiy, with his discourse on the  tasks of Russia's foreign policy, is reminiscent of a clown who  "distorts reality." "In fact, this is what he is doing,"  Kozyrev pointed out.    Long before the emergence of Zhirinovskiy he, as Russia's  foreign minister, raised the issue of "ethnic cleansings" taking  place in some Baltic countries, particularly in Latvia and  Estonia, he stressed. "About one-third of the population is  mistreated on the basis of ethnicity. This relates to the  Russian speakers -- ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians,  Jews and even Finns, who are denied the right to citizenship,"  the minister said. "They wish to receive such citizenship, but  it is denied to them for only one reason, their ethnicity. If  this is not ethnic cleansing, what is it?"    According to him, in some cases, in Bosnia-Herzegovina for  instance, ethnic cleansing is expressed in the form of "criminal  violence," and in other cases in the form of denying large  groups of the population their civil rights, particularly the  right to citizenship. "If -- wherever this takes place -- people  are called "invaders" and "aliens," they begin to behave  accordingly. A result of this is instability," Russia's foreign  minister said.    He referred to one more example of how the rights of  Russian-  speakers are infringed upon. "In the former USSR everyone was  obliged to undergo military service. Estonians and Latvians  were no exception -- they served in the Soviet Army. Now they  want to evict from Estonia and Latvia not all the former Soviet  servicemen, but only Russian-speakers. Obviously what underlies  the demands for eviction is the ethnic, not political,  principle," Kozyrev said.    According to him, "the attempts to take revenge on ordinary  people for the crimes committed by the Stalinist regime reflect  political foolishness." "I recognize that the Stalinist regime  committed crimes, but one must not forget that they were  committed by political powers -- Stalin and Hitler -- who  concluded the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. To avenge these  political crimes 45 years later on thousands of ordinary people,  and use the ethnic principle when doing so, is inadmissible."    Russia, in the vicinity of whose borders such things are  happening, cannot remain indifferent to them, Kozyrev stressed.  "The world must pay attention to this inhumane and potentially  dangerous situation," he concluded.</p>

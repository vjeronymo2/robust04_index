			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. of Military Sciences Professor Ivan Vorobyev </F> under "Information To Ponder" rubric: "`Gaps' in Theory, or  What We Lack in Order To Carry Out Peacemaking Actions"]    [Text] Russia is the only state on the territory of the  former USSR which today is actually voluntarily carrying out the  peacemaking functions which it has taken on. More than 16,000  Russian servicemen have now been mobilized to fulfill tasks in  various parts of the former Union. The problem of "peacemaking"  has acquired such topicality for our Army that this circumstance  was reflected in the "Main Provisions of Military Doctrine of  the Russian Federation." As is known, the document defines the  main internal sources of military threats, to counteract which  the Armed Forces may be used.    Such actions are by no means a novelty for the world  community. Considerable experience of carrying them out has been  accumulated. Thus, since the adoption of the UN Charter (1975),  when their legal status was defined, 26 peacemaking operations  have been carried out under UN auspices, of which 13 have been  completed to date and the rest are continuing. At the same time  this problem has not yet been worked out in our military theory  -- which is fraught with unjustified combat losses when carrying  out actions of this kind. I believe that it now appears  possible, on the basis of the accumulated experience, to draw  certain theoretical and practical conclusions in respect of the  conditions, forms, and means of preparing for and conducting  peacemaking operations and the participation of armed forces in  them. All the more so because great attention is being devoted  to this question in a number of states -- for example, in the  United States, the FRG, France, and Britain. Thus, U.S.  politicians believe that under conditions of increasing  instability in various parts of the world there will be an  increasing likelihood of military interference in events which  do not attain the scale of a war. This is also confirmed by the  main provisions of the new U.S. military doctrine, which is  known unofficially as the "Clinton doctrine." Special  regulations on the conduct of peacemaking operations are being  drawn up in accordance with this doctrine.    In principle, a peacemaking action is aimed at settling a  conflict which arises and normalizing the situation by peaceful,  diplomatic means, without bloodshed. In practice, however, this  is not always achieved. While in the buffer zone, the "blue  helmets," who are called upon to separate the warring sides and  to monitor observance of a truce, frequently find themselves as  kind of hostages when the situation becomes exacerbated, as is  happening in Yugoslavia, for example -- they fall between two  fires. In this instance the UN Charter (Article 42) does not  rule out the use of strong-arm methods to restore peace.    But in our case, as already stated, a great deal in this  matter has not yet been settled. It is, above all, necessary to  settle legal questions within the CIS relating to the conduct of  peacemaking actions and to elaborate and realize in practice the  main principles for building and utilizing both Russian and  interstate, coalition peacemaking forces of the CIS. To this it  should be added that the problem of carrying out peacemaking  operations concerns not only the specialized peacemaking forces  but also other troops which under certain conditions can also be  drawn into the maelstrom of crisis events.    Let us recall tragic events in the USSR, particularly in  Tbilisi (1989), Vilnius (1990), Baku (1990).... The sending in  of troops to resolve the crisis that had arisen not only did not  yield the desired result, since it had no legal basis, but also  elicited an extremely negative reaction in society and helped to  fuel anti-army hysteria. That is, practice has shown that troop  forces, just like law enforcement organs, are not in themselves  capable of eliminating a crisis situation caused by political,  economic, social, ethnic, and other contradictions. They are  only capable of creating the necessary preconditions for  normalizing the situation.    Which principles, by which we should be guided in the use of  peacemaking (troop) forces to resolve a conflict situation, have  been formulated to date?    The principle of legality should be numbered among  them above all. This principle requires the personnel of the  peacemaking forces to know well and carry out most stringently  the legal norms and legislative acts laid down for operations in  an emergency situation and to infringe in no way the freedom of  the individual or human rights. This predetermines the  conditions and limits of the use of physical force, special  means, weapons, and combat hardware to maintain public order.    Complying with the principle of  preventive-precautionary actions means envisaging measures  well in advance and taking them in time so as to prevent the  development of a conflict situation, while at the same time  managing, as far as possible, without the use of strong-arm  methods and relying on the mechanism of talks. But moderation  [mera] is needed here -- tolerance and indecision must not be  manifested when the situation starts to get out of control and  illegal forces go over to armed violence.    The success of a peacemaking action further depends on the  thoroughness of its preparation. The Americans  believe, for example, that it takes at least four to six weeks  of intensive exercises and individual drill and training  sessions to prepare subunits of the peacemaking force.    The important principles also include the principle of  efficient cooperation between the peacemaking forces  and the local administration, law enforcement organs, and  internal troops of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs].    Thus, the nature of the peacemaking forces' operations in a  conflict zone depends on many circumstances. In some cases they  assist the local administrative and law enforcement organs and  MVD internal troops to ensure the maintenance of public order  and public security. In others they bear the brunt of  normalizing the situation in a region in the grip of combat  operations.    In the event of the exacerbation of a conflict, when it  assumes the form of an armed confrontation, the peacemaking  forces must take control of the development of events so as to  stop insurgent actions in time, to prevent the seizure of  weapons by gunmen, and to avert acts of terrorism, shooting, and  attacks on state establishments, the population, military camps,  military columns, railroad trains, etc. The package of measures  to be implemented in this case can conventionally be divided  into three types: reconnaissance actions to expose illegal  groupings, gunmen, and bandit formations; precautionary measures  taken for the purpose of patrolling, cordoning off, and  monitoring road traffic; strong-arm measures conducted to search  for and disarm gunmen and bandit formations and, in case of  resistance, to render them harmless.    At the same time it should be emphasized once again that a  peacemaking action which takes the form of combat operations  against illegal armed formations can only be justified if there  is no alternative to it.    It is understandable that in this case the actions of the  peacemaking forces are highly specific. What is needed here is  a special tactic, which we also have not yet elaborated.  Although it is possible to make certain recommendations on this  score on the basis of an analysis of the existing experience  accumulated in Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan, Abkhazia, and the  Dniester region.    So, on arriving in a conflict zone, it is important for the  commander of the peacemaking forces to establish contact  primarily with the local administration, the law enforcement  organs, and the temporary operations group of the Internal  Affairs Administration in order quickly to gather data on the  operational situation, analyze them, and adopt a decision on  implementing the necessary measures for the peacemaking forces'  participation in ensuring the legal regime of the state of  emergency. In a number of instances it will at once be  necessary to create special reconnaissance and search groups for  helicopter patrols of the terrain and monitoring of traffic on  roads and in population centers. By analyzing the operational  situation which has taken shape in the zone of responsibility,  it is necessary to make a forecast: how the crisis situation  might develop further, what new hotbeds of tension might arise,  what is the composition of bandit groups, their armament, their  base regions, their operating tactics, and their control and  support system, what are the sources of reinforcement and  supply, what is the local population's attitude toward them.    In particular, it is known from experience that  uncoordinated  detachments of 100-160 gunmen armed with assault rifles and  pistols are created in a conflict zone at first. Centralized  leadership of the gunmen's actions is organized subsequently,  individual detachments unite into larger formations, base  regions, training centers, and dumps are created, weapons are  accumulated, including heavy weapons, and a system of  observation and identification is established over an extensive  territory. Gunmen usually employ the tactics of partisan  operations and periodically carry out night sallies and surprise  raids, chiefly against weapons dumps and military camps. The  chief purpose of their actions is to acquire weapons, means of  transport, and ammunition.    Depending on the nature of the gunmen's actions and their  equipment and training, the decision is made to carry out a  special operation for the purpose of rendering them harmless.  One of the most widespread tactical methods used for this  purpose is the search. It is carried out in those cases where  the gunmen's exact base has not been established and only the  approximate area of their operations is known. Therefore ground  and air (helicopter) reconnaissance is primarily organized.  Special groups are created for a search, and their actions are  backed up chiefly by combat helicopters. The pace of a search  on a moderately rough semiopen terrain is of the order of 1-1.5  km per hour.    As the gunmen's location is established, the decision to  comb  the terrain might be adopted for the purpose of rendering them  harmless. Combing can be unilateral and bilateral (from  opposite directions). The starting point and the finishing  point (meeting point) on a terrain offering concealment are set  for subunits, and, in addition, the direction of movement is  defined. When combing, subunits at first advance in a column  and are then deployed in a chain, with intervals of 12-15 meters  between servicemen on semiopen terrain. It is particularly  important to provide for security measures and to establish  clear mutual identification signals. If, when a detachment of  gunmen is detected, it offers active resistance and there prove  to be inadequate forces and means for an immediate rout, then it  is expedient to organize blocking by means of erecting obstacles  so as to neutralize its actions. Given a favorable situation,  the bandit grouping is surrounded and subsequently broken up and  routed.    The most acceptable tactic for rendering harmless a large,  well armed bandit formation operating over an extensive area can  be the tactic of search and strike operations according to the  "seek and disarm" ("destroy") principle. In this case active  air and ground reconnaissance conducted over a wide front is  combined with a prompt strike by helicopters and airmobile  detachments (groups) landed in the region of operations against  the groupings of gunmen which have been brought to light. The  decision to rout a bandit formation includes the selection of  the most dangerous groupings to be rendered harmless first of  all and the determination of the combat structure and modi  operandi of the reconnaissance and search, strike and fire, air  assault (airmobile), raid landing, and blocking detachments  (groups), of the means of organizing killing zones [ognevyye  meshki], ambushes, and obstacles, and of the system of control,  cooperation, and support.    This is just a small proportion of the questions connected  with the preparation and implementation of peacemaking  operations. Information to ponder, you might say. But it can be  seen from this that the practical preparation of the peacemaking  forces is a problem which concerns the Armed Forces to one  degree or another.</p>

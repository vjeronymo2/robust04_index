			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LIVING ON THE EDGE AND LOVING EVERY BIT OF IT  </P> <P> I live in Encinitas, on the edge of the shopping centers that surround the  mega-intersection of Encinitas Boulevard and El Camino Real.  </P> <P> Folklore would have it that such centers are deadening to the soul, redolent of  modern greed and plasticity. That's bushwa, of course, like much that is  written about suburban life.  </P> <P> For a devout consumer, it is a daily celebration to live credit card-by-jowl  with Village Square I, Village Square II, Wiegand Plaza, Village Encinitas  Plaza, Little Oaks Plaza, Camino Encinitas Plaza, Camino Village Plaza, De La  Plaza Encinitas, et al.  </P> <P> Color me PIMBY: Please, in My Back Yard.  </P> <P> Atop a hill, the most visible landmark of our community, sits a Target store,  its large, glowing red sign beckoning all, a Parthenon of discount retailing.  </P> <P> Our shopping centers offer cures for all that ails those with Excess Disposable  Income. Where else would zombie teen-agers find employment?  </P> <P> We feel protective of our shopping centers. They are a part of the cycle of  life-death-rebirth of our community.  </P> <P> They give us succor, eyeglasses while you wait, designer pet food, one-hour  photo development, Southern barbecue, dental work and day care.  </P> <P> A pasta market closes but Jenny Craig takes its place (same customers). An H.  Salt Esq. fast-food fish place closes and is reborn as Kentucky Fried Chicken.  </P> <P> Generations ago, fathers took sons into the forest to hunt bear. Now we go  shopping.  </P> <P> My son Wes, who is 3, knows that Target opens late on Sundays. He could say  "Ralphs" before he could say "Daddy." He worships at the altar of Play Co Toys.  </P> <P> We go to B. Dalton. I buy "The Closing of the American Mind." He gets "Sneak  Attack: A Tasty Pop-Up Book." Same theme, really.  </P> <P> We go to Video Depot (one of six video stores within a quarter of a mile). As  always, I ask if there's anything new with lots of sex and violence. Wes zeroes  in on "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Close Escrow," or something like that.  </P> <P> Last month, our Video Depot was named store-of-the-month for North County.  We're all so proud.  </P> <P> Wes and I go to Great News, which sells knickknacks and novelties and cards and  similar stuff, a great place for last-minute husbands who forget anniversaries.  It's closing at the end of the month. Angst everywhere.  </P> <P> I swear I hear Wes explain to a friend, "They lost their lease."  </P> <P> Kids learn so early in the suburbs.  </P></p>

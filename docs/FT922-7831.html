			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Bundesbank chief warns of E Europe funding shortage THE developing countries of eastern Europe face a growing shortage of funding unless action is taken to redress a global imbalance between the supply of and demand for capital, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank, warned yesterday. Speaking at the annual conference of the International Securities Market Association in Munich, Mr Tietmeyer forecast that long-term interest rates in the world economy (and hence bond yields) would remain high because of an imbalance between the supply and demand for capital. While the developed industrial nations would face no major problems in satisfying their capital needs, the developing countries - in particular those of central and eastern Europe - would be hampered in efforts to finance economic restructuring, he said. Mr Tietmeyer argued the major exporters of capital - Germany, Japan, and the OPEC oil-producing nations - would be less able to finance the world economy in coming years because of problems close to home. Germany needs to make substantial fiscal transfers to the eastern part of the country, Japan faces a massive decline in asset prices and the OPEC countries faced low oil revenues and the need to rebuild after the Gulf war. However, demand for capital remained very high, he said. Mr Tietmeyer said the low savings ratio in the US, combined with the growth of federal budget deficit, meant 'that country will continue to suck in a major proportion of world savings'. In a wide-ranging defence of the Bundesbank's policy of high interest rates, Mr Tietmeyer said high short-term rates were a major element in promoting additional saving and reducing excess demand for capital in the private sector.</p>

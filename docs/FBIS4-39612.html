			<p>BFN     [Text] Today Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev left  for the Caucasian republics on a working visit in order to  discuss with the Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian leaders  issues on the establishment of Russian military bases on the  territory of their countries, Grachev's aide Yelena Agapova told  INTERFAX.    Grachev will first stop in Yerevan and meet Armenian  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Subsequently, Grachev will meet  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze in Tbilisi.    The Azerbaijani leadership has asked Grachev to come to Baku  in order to speak to Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev.    Russia intends to have about thirty military bases and  facilities in neighboring countries, namely, three in Georgia,  two in Armenia and a station for warning against a military  attack in Azerbaijan.    During his meetings with the Caucasian leaders Grachev is  expected to discuss peace-keeping operations in Nagorno-Karabakh  and in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.    Well-informed sources in Tbilisi suggested in an interview  with an INTERFAX correspondent that during Grachev's visit to  Georgia the peace-keeping operation may begin in the zone of the  Georgian- Abkhazian conflict. The same sources said that at the  first stage the conflicting parties would be separated by the  Russian units stationed in Caucasus.</p>

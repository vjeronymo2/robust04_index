The military command and the church have been recommended to  encourage priests to visit garrisons and organize educational  religious conferences.    Aleksey II told journalists that the signing of this  document  was an event of great importance. "There are many believers  among servicemen and we shall meet their spiritual needs," he  said.    Grachev stated that since the formation of the Russian armed  forces, its commanders established mutual understanding with the  church. "The younger generation's spiritual education has never  been so important before," he said. He also announced that in  many garrisons commanders cooperated with priests.

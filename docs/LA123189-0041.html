			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 1989 RETROSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> VILLAINS  </P> <P> Four years after Southland residents were terrorized by a savage series of  random attacks, Night Stalker Richard Ramirez was convicted of 13 counts of  murder and sentenced to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin. The  devil-worshiping drifter from El Paso delivered a chilling monologue before  being escorted in chains from a Los Angeles courtroom for the last time. "I am  beyond good and evil," he declared. "I will be avenged." Also sentenced to  death was Randy Kraft, a Long Beach computer consultant convicted of murdering  16 young men in Orange County and suspected of 50 more killings, several of  them in Los Angeles County. Southwest Los Angeles street gang member Durrell  DeWitt Collins received a term of 27 years to life in state prison for the 1988  Westwood stray bullet shooting death of Long Beach graphic artist Karen  Toshima. The slaying, having taken place in one of the city's few fashionable,  pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods, stunned Los Angeles and brought the problem  of gang violence to center stage. Another South Los Angeles resident was  ordered by a federal judge to spend the rest of his life in prison without  parole for possession of 4.4 ounces of crack cocaine. Richard V. Winrow, 22,  was the second person in the nation to be sentenced under a new federal  narcotics-trafficking statute that provides for vastly stiffer sentences  whenever defendants have two or more prior drug offenses. The year also saw the  first overturned conviction resulting from an ongoing scandal involving  jailhouse informants. A judge ruled that a Montebello man serving a life  sentence for murder, was entitled to a new trial. The ruling came after the  district attorney's office admitted it had failed to disclose knowledge that  informant Stephen Jesse Cisneros, a convicted rapist who testified against  Vargas, was an inveterate liar.  </P></p>

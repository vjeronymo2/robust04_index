			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHITE ACTOR WILL PLAY LEAD ROLE IN 'ROMEO AND JULIET';  </P> <P> THEATER: WITH THE DIRECTOR'S ORIGINAL PLAN TO SELECT A BLACK ROMEO HAVING BEEN  REJECTED, CASTING FOR THAT CHARACTER IN LA HABRA COMMUNITY THEATRE'S PRODUCTION  HAS BEEN NARROWED TO TWO MEN, BOTH WHITE.  </P> <P> A white actor will play Romeo in a controversial production of "Romeo and  Juliet," after the director's original plan to cast a black actor as Romeo with  a white Juliet was rejected.  </P> <P> Casting for Romeo in La Habra Community Theatre's production of the  Shakespearean classic has been narrowed to two actors, both white, director  Marla Gam-Hudson said this week.  </P> <P> Gam-Hudson had placed an ad seeking a "black Romeo" in her intention to cast an  interracial couple in the lead roles, but the company's board of directors  nixed that idea in an emergency vote last week.  </P> <P> Board members said that an interracial romance in the play would be too  controversial for local audiences, and instructed Gam-Hudson to cast actors of  the same race to portray literature's best-known star-crossed lovers.  </P> <P> Gam-Hudson, who had said she would respect the board's decision, said "seven or  eight" black actors auditioned for Romeo during two days of open auditions  earlier this week.  </P> <P> Race was not a factor in her choice of the two finalists, the director said.  </P> <P> Most of the black actors who auditioned "were not even close to Romeo's age.  Most of them were late 30s," Gam-Hudson said. "Even if (the board) decision had  never come down, they would not have been considered."  </P> <P> A black actor is being considered for one of the other major roles in the play,  Gam-Hudson said.  </P> <P> The director said she does not know the ethnic background of the woman she cast  as Juliet.  </P> <P> About 60 actors auditioned for the play, which will open Oct. 26 at La Habra's  Depot Playhouse.  </P> <P> Gam-Hudson said she had expected a bigger turnout and believes press coverage  of the board's decision deterred some from trying out. Gam-Hudson said the low  turnout hurt her plans for a multiracial cast.  </P> <P> "Because I didn't have a lot to choose from, as far as that went, it is  predominantly white," she said.  </P></p>

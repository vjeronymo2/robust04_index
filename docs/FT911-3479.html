			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: NCR eases opposition to AT&amp;T bid NCR, the Ohio-based computer company which has been fighting the bid advances of AT&amp;T for the past five months, yesterday modified its lingering opposition to AT&amp;T's revised all-share offer proposal. In a letter to his counterpart at AT&amp;T, Mr Charles Exley, NCR's chairman, said that he would be willing to recommend the offer if AT&amp;T was prepared to ensure that it was worth Dollars 110 per NCR share while the AT&amp;T share price stayed at, or above, Dollars 32.50. The target company claimed yesterday that it was adjusting its position in attempt to be 'flexible'. Its earlier stance had worried some investors - in particular, the arbitrage community - who felt that its demands were 'onerous'. There was no immediate response from AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T commenced the bidding for NCR five months ago with a Dollars 90-a-share cash offer, while NCR said that it was looking for Dollars 125 a share. However, NCR subsequently dropped this request to Dollars 110 a share, and at the weekend AT&amp;T said it would meet this figure, but switched from cash terms to a paper consideration. Mr Exley then said that he was concerned about a fall in the AT&amp;T share price between now and the stage at which the offer closed.</p>

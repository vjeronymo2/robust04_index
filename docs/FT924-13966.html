			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Italy gains 10 per cent on moves in political arena EUROPEAN equity markets remained volatile last week, amid sporadic hopes that Germany would ease monetary policy. This helped both Italy and Spain register substantial gains in the FT-Actuaries World Indices while senior European bourses recorded falls. The FT- Actuaries World index was 1 per cent lower on the week. Italy rose 10 per cent in local currency terms as investors were encouraged by moves in the political arena and proposals to suspend capital gains tax. With no one wanting the collapse of yet another coalition government, there were hopes that the budget package would be passed by parliament in the next few weeks, in spite of opposition from trade unions. At the weekend four subsidiary laws to the budget, dealing with local government finance, health and pensions, were passed, clearing the way for approval of the main legislation. Ms Marie Christine Keith, Italian analyst at County NatWest, says short-covering also boosted the market's performance last week, helping to push Friday's turnover to a high L238bn. She noted that the devaluation effect lifted the share prices of companies with strong export markets, such as Benetton, up 14 per cent on the week, while Generali's 13 per cent gain also contributed largely to the advance in the Comit index. Another insurer in demand was Ras, ahead of Friday's news that its planned share capital increase was to commence this week. Spain saw a negative start to the week, a 3.6 per cent decline on Monday, one of the year's steepest one-day falls, followed by strong gains during the sessions to follow. By mid-week domestic and foreign investors returned to the market, as the threat of a further devaluation in the peseta waned and the Spanish government said it had no plans to raise interest rates in the short term. In contrast to Monday, the 3.2 per cent rise in the general index on Thursday was one of the best sessions of the year. However, Mr Stephen Hughes, Spanish analyst at Nikko Europe, remains cautious about the market. 'Foreign investors are rightly still wary of the forex controls . . . and a consensus remains that the peseta will have to devalue further in the short term,' he said. 'For a sustainable rally to be established, the currency risk for foreign investors must be relieved.' Nordic countries remained depressed last week with Denmark limping along under the weight of a shattered financial sector. Last week two more banks were downgraded by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, and another placed on the watch list. The market continues to lack direction, analysts say, while uncertainty over the Maastricht process lurks in the background.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change  % change in                % change in local currency**      sterling** US Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of    Start of   Start of                                         1992        1992       1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -2.42    +2.32   -23.14   -11.07       +0.99      -8.73 Belgium      -0.92    +1.13    -4.67    -5.29       +7.01      -3.28 Denmark      -4.52    -5.06   -31.77   -29.82      -19.84     -27.55 Finland      -0.96    +9.38   -23.82   -17.55      -19.59     -27.33 France       -1.55    -7.14    -8.45    -5.36       +7.78      -2.59 Germany      -2.24    -4.81   -11.80   -11.01       +0.55      -9.13 Ireland      -2.82    -7.07   -22.60   -20.52      -10.72     -19.31 Italy       +10.77   +11.01   -20.56   -18.59      -20.42     -28.07 Netherlands  -1.10    +0.47    +1.12    +2.02      +15.55      +4.43 Norway       -3.57    +1.56   -34.97   -22.47      -15.20     -23.36 Spain        +4.38    -7.30   -26.56   -21.37      -20.67     -28.30 Sweden       -0.38    -4.08   -23.47   -15.10       -6.74     -15.71 Switzerland  +0.23    +2.18    +9.48   +10.59      +26.19     +14.04 UK           -0.37    +7.76    -2.89    +1.53       +1.53      -8.24 EUROPE       -0.36    +1.61    -7.57    -4.33       +1.84      -7.96 Australia    -1.32    -2.80   -10.09   -13.64       -9.70     -18.39 Hong Kong    +0.76    +1.90   +37.40   +30.96      +45.78     +31.76 Japan        -0.34    -5.45   -29.56   -23.67      -13.47     -21.79 Malaysia     +0.56    +4.16   +18.15    +6.44      +27.78     +15.48 New Zealand  -3.44    -6.17   -10.76   -16.07       -6.93     -15.88 Singapore    -0.89    -3.05    -5.75   -16.58       -6.87     -15.83 Canada       -0.64    -6.66    -6.01    -9.79       -7.69     -16.58 USA          -1.71    -3.77    +7.48    -3.10       +7.21      -3.10 Mexico       +3.54    +9.62    +7.32    -3.11       +4.74      -5.33 South Africa -3.62    +0.10   -11.24   -13.36      -29.51     -36.29 WORLD INDEX  -0.92    -2.70    -9.08    -9.80       -1.04     -10.56  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on October 9th 1992.

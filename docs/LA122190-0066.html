			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SKIERS SUSCEPTIBLE TO MULTITUDE OF INJURIES  </P> <P> Doctors who treat athletes say they see more injuries to skiers than to  participants of other popular recreation sports, with the exception of  skateboarding. Cycling has spills, tennis has problem elbows and softball has  beer guts, but skiing is multifaceted in its danger.  </P> <P> Not only do skiers routinely fall -- often at breakneck speeds -- and sometimes  run into trees, they also put unnatural stress on their knees.  </P> <P> "I see sprained knees day to day in the ski season," said Dr. Frank Bredice, a  Van Nuys chiropractor.  </P> <P> With modern-day boots virtually eliminating ankle injuries, Bredice said, a  sprained knee is now the hors de combat for skiers. Unfortunately, a knee  injury is usually a lot more serious than a broken or sprained ankle: It often  requires surgery.  </P> <P> The torquing involved in skiing puts extreme strain on the medial and lateral  collateral ligaments, Bredice said.  </P> <P> Bredice also sees a "tremendous amount" of swollen knees, a condition that can  be avoided. It happens when the quadriceps are overworked and go into spasm.  Bredice said he is "amazed" by how many people ski without first strengthening  their quads.  </P> <P> He recommends doing wall squats with knees bent as "the bare minimum." To best  prepare for the slopes "you should get to a gym and do complete, whole-body  exercises emphasizing legs and abdomens."  </P> <P> Of course, no amount of exercise will counter the effects of an accident, of  which falling is the most prevalent. Falling, even at moderate speeds, can  cause shoulder injuries, usually because the skier tries to brace himself with  an extended arm and winds up separating his acromion-clavicular joint.  </P> <P> Head injuries are also a byproduct of a fall. "I see a lot of concussions,"  Bredice said.  </P></p>

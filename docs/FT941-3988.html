			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Clash in Malaysia over state poll call A crisis was unfolding in the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah last night, as local leaders and the state governor clashed over whether the state assembly could be dissolved and new elections held. In a bitter state election less than a month ago, the locally based Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), led by Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, Sabah's chief minister, narrowly defeated Malaysia's ruling National Front coalition led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister. At the weekend, three PBS deputies to Sabah's state assembly announced they were joining the National Front. Mr Pairin said he had no alternative but to dissolve the assembly and call fresh elections. The chief minister said he had followed the constitution in obtaining the Sabah governor's signature to authorise the dissolution. At a news conference last night, Mr Pairin distributed what he said were copies of the signed document. But, on national news broadcasts controlled by the federal government, the governor denied signing and accused Mr Pairin of 'mischievous and unbecoming behaviour.' Dr Mahathir has made no secret of his antagonism towards the PBS and to Mr Pairin in particular. After the PBS election victory, Mr Pairin was forced to wait for 36 hours outside the gates of the Sabah governor's house before being sworn in as chief minister.</p>

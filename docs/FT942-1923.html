			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Coal sell-off fails to attract foreign bidders Government efforts to attract foreign bidders for British Coal appear largely to have failed after it emerged yesterday that at least 23 of the 25 companies considering tenders for the corporation's five core regions are based in the UK. NM Rothschild, which is advising the government on coal privatisation, is thought to have sent out preliminary sales memoranda to almost 100 companies, 30 to 40 of them in other countries including the US, South Africa and Australia. However, only 33 companies applied to qualify to bid for the five packages and six mines that are being sold separately. Rothschild considered 25 companies eligible to tender for the five regions. Research by Coal UK, a Financial Times newsletter, has identified 23 of the companies - all of them British. Rothschild has refused to name the companies, but it is possible that none of the 25 is based overseas. Although there are enough UK companies to ensure that each of the regions will attract one bidder or more, a tender from an overseas company would have added prestige to the privatisation and could have increased the amount raised. Coal UK's research shows the deep-mine areas of the central south (mainly Nottinghamshire) and central north (mainly Yorkshire) regions are the least popular, with 10 and nine potential bids each. South Wales and Scotland have 14 potential bids each, followed by the north-east with 13. Some of the qualifying companies are thought to have only limited interest. Larger companies such as RTZ, the international mining conglomerate, and National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, are considered unlikely bidders even though they have qualified to bid for all five regions. Apart from them, only three companies, CP Holdings, NSM and RJB Mining, have qualified for all five regions, although Coal Investments, the company headed by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, has done so through a mixture of direct and indirect interests. It is considering bids for the English regions with the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, has qualified separately for south Wales and is part of the Mining Scotland consortium bid for Scotland. Other potential bidders are: AMEC, the construction group, for cotland and south Wales; Banks mining company for the north-east; Caledonian Mining for Scotland and south Wales; a management buy-out team headed by Mr Alan Houghton for central north; Kier Mining for Scotland, the north-east and south Wales; Law Mining for Scotland; Rackwood mining group, for Scotland; a management buy-out team headed by Mr Bryan Riddleston for South Wales; Ryan Group for south Wales; Ryan/Alcan for the north-east; ScotCoal for Scotland; a management buy-out team headed by Mr Alan Siddall for the English regions; Taywood for all regions except central north; Wimpey and Powell Duffryn for the north-east and south Wales.</p>

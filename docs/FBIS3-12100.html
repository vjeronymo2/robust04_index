			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 29  March.    The possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve may tighten  its  monetary policies and increase interest rates in the short term  once again made the prices of Venezuelan foreign debt bonds  decrease to the same level reached on 27 November 1992, a coup  day. Chemical Bank reports indicate that the price of foreign  debt bonds fell by four points and closed at 53.50 points. There  is also a possibility that U.S. T-bills, whose profitability  registered 6.97 percent, will continue to decrease. On 21 March,  all these scenarios combined made the Caracas Stock Exchange  index lose 3.6 percent and close at 24,654.82 points, which is a  level similar to that reached on 16 August 1992. (Caracas EL  NACIONAL in Spanish 22 Mar 94 p E-1)    The Central Bank of Venezuela, BCV, is offering a record  amount of 50 billion bolivares worth of zero-coupon bonds. About  40 billion bolivares will mature in 90 days, and the remaining  10 billion bolivares will mature in 182 days. The  90-day-zero-coupon bonds registered a 52.13 percent  return-on-equity, ROE, rate, which in turn will make fluctuating  interest rates increase. (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in  Spanish 23 Mar 94 p 9)    Ferrominera Orinoco and Edelca, subsidiaries of the  Venezuelan Guayana Corporation, CVG, will not be included in the  privatization process that the Executive Branch is promoting.  CVG President Francisco Layrisse said Caroni Aluminum Inc. is  the only subsidiary that in six months, at the latest, will sell  55 percent of its stock to private companies. As for Ferrominera  Orinoco, the private sector will only have access to invest in  the iron transformation process. Ferrominera Orinoco President  Andres Caleca said the law stipulates that only the state has  the right to tap iron. (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network  in Spanish 1550 GMT 23 Mar 94)    The BCV's Board of Directors has decided to modify the  mechanisms that control interest rates on loans. For instance,  it decreased the ceiling rate that banks can charge with  fluctuating interest rates from 20 to 15 points above the ROE  rate on zero-coupon bonds. It is worth mentioning that the six  largest banks currently charge an average fluctuating interest  rate of 63.8 percent. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 24 Mar  94 p 1-1)    The European Union's Nomenclature Committee recently decided  to categorize Orimulsion as a bituminous substance. This  decision opens new opportunities to sell larger amounts of this  type of fuel to world markets. Frank Alcock, Venezuela  Petroleum, Petroven, acting president, appeared before the  Senate's Energy and Mines Commission and said that this new  category for Orimulsion will prevent a reduction of its  competitive edge in the Old Continent. The Council on Customs  Affairs will issue its final ruling on Orimulsion on 4 April.  Orimulsion exports amounted to 721,000 tons in 1992 and 2.79  million tons in 1993. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 24 Mar 94  p E-6)    On 23 March, Petroven Acting President Fred Alcock said  Petroven will reduce expenses in 1994 by an additional 6 billion  bolivares. He added that this reduction will bring to the  treasury additional revenues amounting to 26 billion bolivares.  Alcock appeared before the Senate's Energy and Mines Commission  to explain Petroven's business plan. He also said that Venezuela  will continue to sell gasoline to the United States. (Caracas EL  DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 16)    The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest  rates has landed a heavy blow on the already vulnerable  Venezuelan economy because the price of its foreign debt bonds  will drop. This means, however, that the risk to investment  could fall, which in turn could attract more capital to the  country. In short, the loss generated by lower prices on foreign  debt bonds could be compensated by reinvesting said bonds on  securities with higher interest rates as long as the bonds  mature in the short term. (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in  Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 8)    Carlos Pulido Salvatierra, Association of Venezuelan  Exporters president, said nontraditional Venezuelan exports to  Colombia amounted to $500 million during the first quarter of  1994. He added that it is expected that said exports will amount  to almost $2 billion in 1994, which is 40 percent higher than in  1993. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2038 GMT 25 Mar 94)    The Finance Ministry estimates that the 1995 budget will  amount to 1.7 trillion bolivares and that gasoline prices will  increase in 1995. Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said the  mass transit system may receive additional subsidies in 1995.  Jorge Serrano, vice president of the Venezuelan Federation of  Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Fedecamaras,  underscored that gasoline prices must drastically change because  gasoline receives 40 billion bolivares worth of subsidies  annually. The Fedecamaras believes that the price of high-octane  gasoline must increase. (Caracas Venezolana de Television  Network in Spanish 2350 GMT 25 Mar 94)    New Petroven Director Luis Giusti has said Petroven reduced  its investment costs by $4 billion due to drops in hydrocarbon  prices. He added that Petroven reduced other expenses by $3  billion. Giusti pointed out that there is an international  consensus on the opening of the national oil industry to private  capital and that oil prices will not recover soon.

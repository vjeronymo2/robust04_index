			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At the beginning of today's  parliament session, Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik first  introduced the members of his Cabinet, with the exception of two  who are abroad.    Then he delivered a short speech that focused on the chief  objectives of the new Slovak Government:    [Begin Moravcik recording] Everyone who was born in  Slovakia,  everyone who lives here and considers Slovakia his or her  homeland, is, for us, a loyal citizen of this state. The  government will protect his or her freedom and democratic  rights, including the right to criticize the government.    I would like to emphasize, in this respect, that it is  against our national interests if people are divided because of  their nationality, ethnic group, or any other allegiance.    We consider it necessary to create space for the initiative  of individual citizens, particularly in the economy. The  advancement of business is a prerequisite and a guarantee for  prosperity of democratic society. To create space for  individual initiative means, above all, to continue economic  transformations more effectively. The state still owns too many  enterprises. Privatization is part of solving economic problems  in society. When privatization gets out of hand and all ethical  values are negated, the result is wild privatization, a wolfish  struggle instead of an organized procedure. This, undoubtedly,  deepens the crisis of ethical values in society.    If the government is to support business, the state's  financial system must be completed. Among other things, this  means abandoning putting excessive emphasis on the fiscal angle  and creating space for individual initiative.    Social security is an area with acute problems. There is a  need to emphasize greater individual responsibility for social  security of individuals. When this individual responsibility  fails, state support takes over. In this system, too, it is  necessary to reserve a greater space for the involvement of  specialist nonstate institutions, endowments, and charitable  institutions.    The development of the nonprofit sector reinforces civic  solidarity, which should be important to us.    More significant progress in creating a new image of  Slovakia, along the lines I have mentioned, cannot be  implemented without the advancement of science and education.  Education is an important value and a guarantee for future  prosperity. We are losing speed in this area. We cannot go on  delaying finding solutions to the problems in this area.    I would also like to speak briefly about the foreign  political aspects of the government's policy. I would like to  say clearly that Slovakia's foreign political strategy is not  changing from the concept endorsed by the Slovak parliament. I  will promote those elements that lead to deepening cooperation  with and integration into European economic, political, and  security systems and groups. In the same way, we shall  accentuate our interest in good-neighborly relations with the  neighbors of Slovakia.    What we need for this policy to succeed is to make our  internal policy credible. Not everything I have mentioned can  be secured and fulfilled in the time available to this  government. This government is to get Slovakia to early  parliamentary elections. We are prepared to make full use of  the time to create foundations for development in the directions  I have outlined.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: ShareLink ShareLink's over-subscribed flotation suggests private investors are still eager to invest in new issues, especially those of smaller companies. Since the returns on cash have dwindled and small company shares have risen steadily - the FT-SE SmallCap index has roundly outperformed the FT-SE 100 this year - such enthusiasm is understandable. That is doubly good news for ShareLink, which profits from individuals' willingness to buy and sell shares. The question for both the company and the new issues market is whether retail interest will evaporate at the first hint of a bear market. The number of small shareholders has already fallen by almost 2m from the 11m peak reached in 1991, thanks in large part to recession. With few big privatisation issues in the pipeline, there seems little to tempt the first-time buyers out of alternative investments. Tougher disclosure rules for life insurance might just help the cause of equities. But without further tax incentives from government, the high ideal of a share owning democracy will remain no more than that. That will not bother ShareLink, though, so long as the remaining core of private shareholders are prepared to trade. Its figures point to a hardened band of investors dealing more regularly, in greater size, and  - one hopes  -aware of the risks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Julius Lorincz report on "recent" news conference in Vienna </F> with Austrian President Thomas Klestil: "Our Region Has a  Tremendous Future" -- first paragraph is editorial introduction]    [Text] Thomas Klestil, President of the Republic of  Austria, recently received a group of Slovak reporters -- from  NARODNA OBRODA, PRACA, SLOVENSKY DENNIK, UJ SZO, SLOBODNY PIATOK  weekly, and PRAVDA. The reason for this meeting in his study at  the Vienna Hofburg was the upcoming visit by the Slovak  president to Austria. Although in the meantime domestic events  in Slovakia resulted in a postponement of the visit, the  frankness and stimulating nature of the discussion with Klestil  undoubtedly warrant our passing on some of the ideas and views  of the Austrian president.    In the introduction, he pointed out that Austria has for  decades endeavored to remove the Iron Curtain, to create the  conditions for good neighborhood despite the diverse ideological  views. "Austria was like a window, but the Iron Curtain is  gone, and we are very close neighbors capable of extensive  cooperation. There are no two capitals as close to one another  as Vienna and Bratislava. Moreover, as I study our relations on  a daily basis and in the long- time perspective, I believe that  this region has a tremendous future. You know that at this time  we have problems concerning the transit of automobile transport  through Austria, and we are also discussing it with the European  Union. We have, however, the great option of transferring the  transport not only to the railroad but also to the Danube River.  After all, there is the Rhine-Main-Danube Channel, there soon  may be also a Danube-Oder channel, and if some facilities are  added, Vienna and Bratislava can become important reloading  centers. There are great possibilities for an important power  center to emerge in our region -- oil and gas pipelines from  Russia pass through here, and the Adria oil pipeline. I am also  thinking of cooperation between Vienna and Bratislava airports,  of the entire infrastructure of the two great cities."    In the subsequent part of the discussion, Klestil pointed  out  that just a "nice picture" of the proximity of Vienna and  Bratislava is not enough for Austrian-Slovak relations -- the  cooperation requires the entire background of the two states  and, in this context, he acknowledged that Austria is the  "number one" foreigner in founding joint firms and various forms  of joint ventures in Slovakia.    A lot of the discussion was dedicated to Central Europe and  relations in this part of the continent. According to Klestil,  Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia are  interesting neighbors who are undergoing the transition to  democratic states with a market economy: "Do you know that in  the last few days, we have progressed on the road towards the  European Union, and the firmer embedded we are there, the better  we will be able to optimize your being our neighbors. We are in  a certain sense merging again. No, I do not mean to be nostalgic  about history -- I am a republican and a democrat -- but when I  sit here in the room that once belonged to Josef II, and next to  it is Maria Theresia's room -- it is only natural to perceive  the bonds of Central Europe. The unnatural borders have  disappeared, actually old possibilities have been revived and  new possibilities of cooperation have been created."    The president of the Republic of Austria continued in these  reflections when the conversation turned to the meeting in  Litomysl [eastern Bohemia] of the presidents of the Central  European countries planned for April at the instigation of  President Havel: "We should discuss there what Central Europe  is, what our cooperation should be like, and political  developments in this region. Yes, we should talk about the use  of nuclear power, which is a very sensitive and aggravating  issue for Austria. We have problems with the Czech Republic  because of Temelin [nuclear power plant under construction], we  are afraid of Jaslovske Bohunice and Mochovce [Slovak nuclear  power plants]. You know, years ago, we decided in Austria -- I  did not support this view then -- not to manufacture nuclear  power. It must be understood that we expect Slovakia and other  states to respect the population on the other side of the border  -- a radioactive cloud such as Chernobyl's cannot be stopped by  borders. Hence, the dangerous consequences of a conceivable  nuclear accident has nothing to do with state sovereignty and  borders.    The discussion also touched upon Austrian neutrality and its  present meaning. Thomas Klestil said: "When I entered the  presidential election campaign, I brought up the question of  neutrality for a public discussion. Some of my advisers asked  me then with consternation whether I am giving up hope of being  elected. I declared, however, that neutrality is not a goal in  itself, that it is a matter of security and guarantees. The  security issue no longer has just a military dimension, it does  not mean only protection against a military threat. In today's  world, the threats have changed -- there are floods of refugees,  migration flows, organized crime, drugs, nuclear accidents, and  polluted environment. It was demonstrated that the public is  ready for a down-to-earth discussion about these issues and is  willing to accept a reasonable explanation. We succeeded in  getting Austrians to accept Austria's joining the European Union  in accordance with the law on neutrality. It states that we  would not join any military grouping or agree to having foreign  units enter our territory. So, Austria moves towards the  European Union as a neutral state and it does not cause any  problems here or in Brussels. I am glad it is so."    Klestil favorably commented on Slovakia joining the Council  of Europe, and in this context he spoke also about the problems  surrounding the Hungarian ethnic minority, about the anxiety in  Slovakia resulting from a statement made once by the deceased  Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall that he regards himself  as the "spiritual prime minister of all 15 million Hungarians,"  i.e., including the more than 5 million Hungarians living  abroad. He recommended that a reasonable basis be found for  talks on these questions, the mistrust and concerns be gradually  vanquished, and said that it would be good to view these issues  in a long-term perspective: "If we consider Europe democratic  and liberal, borders in their present antiquated form have no  meaning." We observed that such a vision is nice and attractive  but, unfortunately, at present we still keep encountering the  tendency to close oneself, which has something to do with the  advanced and well-to-do Europe apparently is justified in  fearing millions of people who "sit on their travel bags" and  contemplate whether it would not be best to set off from their  country in search of a more stable and better life. The  Austrian president responded to this, among other things, with  the following:    "The question of mass migration is a significant part of the  threat presented by today's world. The prosperous countries of  Europe must offer other countries the hope and prospects of a  good future so that the local population decides to stay at  home. Austria is helping refugees. Those coming from  Bosnia-Herzegovina are a real problem for us -- there are 74,000  of them in Austria officially. We have no idea how many are  there illegally. Just in Vienna, 8,000 children from Bosnia are  attending school. What to do about these people? Will they  integrate into our society?"    "The West undoubtedly must help more speedily, efficiently,  and diversely -- the best help seems to be efficient cooperation  and investments -- to the countries that are passing through a  complex transformation process, so that their citizens find  meaning for their existence and future."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the decision by OPEC oil ministers to  maintain OPEC's output at the current level for the rest of the  current Christian year, the price of oil rose on international  markets. Our correspondent in Bonn interviewed Iranian Oil  Minister Gholam Reza Aqazadeh on the outcome of the current OPEC  session and its effect on international oil markets, to which we  draw your attention.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh,  please tell us the outcome of the OPEC conference.    [Aqazadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. Of course, we only managed to reach a final decision  on one of the issues on the session's agenda, and it was the  most important item on the agenda. It was determining the  production ceiling for the next six months.    The announcement of the decision that OPEC will not raise  its  current output for the next six months was very important for  the market, particularly since OPEC also announced that its next  session was cancelled. It is very important for consumers to be  sure that OPEC does not intend to raise its output for the rest  of the year, considering the fact that it is predicted that  there is demand for OPEC's oil stocks of about 26.5 million  barrels for the fourth quarter of the current Christian year.  Therefore, the decision made yesterday was important and had an  immediate effect on the market.    [Correspondent] We heard that the price of Brent oil and  U.S.  oil has gone up. What do you know about that?    [Aqazadeh] Yes, that is right. From the start of the  session, the positive attitude of the OPEC members strengthened  the market. We even heard that U.S. oil had risen to $20. North  Sea oil will also show a reaction today; it rose to $17 last  night. [end recording]</p>

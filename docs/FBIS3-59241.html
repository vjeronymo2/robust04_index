			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Odd Inge Skjaevesland report: "Steady Increase in Trade </F> With the EU Countries"]    [Text] Figures from the Central Statistical Bureau show  that exports to the developing countries are growing faster than  imports from these countries. Norway's exports and imports from  January to November 1993 have been compared with the figures for  the first eleven months of last year. The figures embrace all  types of goods, including oil and gas.    The trend is that we are trading less with the Nordic area  and EFTA [European Free Trade Association], of which we are a  member today, and more with the EU [European Union], of which we  have applied to become a member. Norwegian exports increased  from 198 billion to 206 billion kroner, while imports rose from  147 billion to 154 billion kroner in the first eleven months of  last year.    In particular, there was no increase in exports to EU  countries Britain and the Netherlands. By tradition we have  never sold more to anyone than we have to the British, and last  year there was an increase of over 3 billion kroner to a total  of 51 billion kroner. Another large market for Norwegian goods  is Germany.    While we have bought a little more from Denmark, exports to  Denmark fell by 2 billion kroner -- almost one fifth. Exports  and imports to and from Sweden both fell by 1 billion kroner.    The import of goods from Asia to Norway increased in value  from 18 to 22 billion kroner. Trade with China increased  markedly. Norwegian exports to the huge Chinese market almost  doubled in a year. But we still buy almost twice as much from  the Chinese as well sell to them.</p>

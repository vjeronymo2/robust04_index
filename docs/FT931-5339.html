			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / The Conservative Central Council at Harrogate: Tories play the loyalty card THE Conservatives yesterday launched a new test of party loyalty by following Labour and the Liberal Democrats in putting the party's name to a credit card. The cash-strapped party hopes members will cut its debts by using their cards to pay bills. The party is launching an 'affinity' card backed by the Royal Bank of Scotland. Like the Labour and Liberal Democrat cards, both backed by the Co-operative Bank, it will cost members Pounds 10 a year. Under the affinity card scheme, the linked political party or charity receives a payment for each account opened, plus an annual sum based on cardholders' use of the card. Banks that back such cards have found their success depends on how tied members feel to the cause. Royal Bank of Scotland runs affinity cards for four groups, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Woodland Trust and the National Canine Defence League. The bank says its RNLI card has been the most successful because many yacht and boat club members support the lifeboat cause.</p>

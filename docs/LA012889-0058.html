			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> OPENING OF PACIFIC SERENADES CHAMBER SERIES  </P> <P> Pianist Delores Stevens, horn player Richard Todd and violinist Debra Price  presented four chamber works Thursday evening for the opening concert of  Pacific Serenades' third season. Taking place in the ornate, at times noisy,  Crystal Room of the Biltmore Hotel, the concert included the world premiere of  Roger Bourland's "Recent Dreams," a fantasy for this combination of  instruments.  </P> <P> "Recent Dreams" makes few bold statements, shying away from any new frontiers  of music-making. Writing in an immediately accessible tonal language, Bourland  obviously drew much of his influence from film music -- a field to which he has  contributed three scores.  </P> <P> Whole-tone scales, a sudden, unannounced waltz and a few mild dissonant chords  at times create curiosities that attempted to entice the listener. But the  music rarely reflects a great deal of soul-searching or vision.  </P> <P> Stevens, Todd and Price managed the gentle, dreamy music with expertise. Lush  melodic fragments and various solo passages were given due attention and care  even if the overall piece contained few, if any, moments of demanding  virtuosity.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the centerpiece of the evening, Brahms' Trio in E-flat, gave  the players a substantial workout. In the opening Andante and Scherzo,  technical prowess was in abundance, sometimes at the expense of expressiveness.  But the Finale achieved the right amount of ebullience leading the work to a  satisfying conclusion.  </P> <P> Also on the program was a stunning performance of Debussy's "Pour le Piano"  suite by Stevens, who took the Toccata at a remarkably rapid clip. Opening the  program, Stevens and Todd combined forces for a lively performance of  Beethoven's Horn Sonata. GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

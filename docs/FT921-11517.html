			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BT slips 4% to Pounds 759m in third quarter BRITISH Telecommunications pleaded for fairness and flexibility in its pricing structure being reviewed by the industry regulator, as it unveiled a 4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 787m to Pounds 759m in the third quarter to December 31 1991. The group brought forward the announcement of its results by two weeks to coincide with the publication yesterday by Oftel of a consultative document which began the review of BT's prices by the industry regulator. This was the second successive quarter in which BT saw a profits decline despite continuing efforts to raise productivity, said Mr Iain Vallance, chairman. The performance reflected, above all, the first full quarter impact of a price cap at RPI minus 6.25 percentage points, followed by recession and increased competition. 'As you can see the current price cap is pretty tough,' Mr Vallance said. By bringing forward its third quarter results, BT had hoped to counter criticism that its high prices have led to excessive profitability. Turnover in the third quarter was 'almost flat' at Pounds 3.29bn (Pounds 3.28bn) as growth was insufficient to counter the effects of regulatory and competitive pressures, the group said. Earnings per share declined 5 per cent to 8.2p (8.6p). 'Near term prospects remain depressed,' BT said. The group had indicated that staff levels would be reduced by about 10,000 but yesterday it confirmed that the cuts would be substantially more than that at between 10,000 and 15,000. Revenue from inland telephone calls declined slightly to Pounds 1.27bn (Pounds 1.29bn) due to overall price reductions which were only partly offset by the new directory enquiry charges introduced in April, it said. International telephone call revenue fell to Pounds 442m (Pounds 447m) while international call volume increased by 3 per cent over the 12 months to December. However, this volume increase was more than offset by the effects of the 9.6 per cent price reduction on international calls from the UK which were introduced in September, BT said. The two areas which saw revenue growth were telephone exchange line rentals and other sales and services, a division which was boosted by the increase in interconnect receipts from other UK telecommunication operators and a better performance at Cellnet, the mobile communications network operator. For the nine month period to December 31 turnover rose by just under 2 per cent to Pounds 9.92bn (Pounds 9.75bn), pre-tax profits increased by 2 per cent to Pounds 2.37bn (Pounds 2.32bn) and earnings per share rose by 1 per cent to 25.6p (25.4p). Responding to charges that BT's local call rates were the most expensive in the world and that it was more expensive to make an international call from the UK than to the UK, Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director, said that those were 'myths.' Mr Hepher pointed out that the UK had a larger area covered by local call charges than the US, Germany and France and that for a three minute call made during business hours it was more expensive to call the UK from the US, France, Germany and Spain than the other way round.</p>

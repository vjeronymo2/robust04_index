			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Kohl plays up the Saxon angle: Summit diary Chancellor Helmut Kohl has clearly not forgotten last year's remark by Mr Theodore Pangalos, Greece's European affairs minister, that the re-united Germany has 'a bestial giant's strength and a child's brain'. Both he and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, managed to arrive too late for the Corfu summit's opening dinner, in honour of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Greek officials were not convinced by their excuse of being delayed by a last-minute campaign trip to Saxony-Anhalt ahead of Sunday's state elections. Still, Mr Pangalos demonstrated that six months of chairing EU meetings have done nothing to make him more tactful. Having criticised the neo-fascists in Italy's government, he refused to shake hands with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, in full view of the television cameras yesterday. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister whose uncertain health is a constant worry to the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, appeared to have put on a new face for a meeting of European Socialist parties on the eve of the summit. From a distance he had a suntanned glow to his complexion. Close up, however, delegates noticed that he was wearing a thick layer of make-up. His young wife Dimitra visited the shrine of St Spyridon, the patron saint of Corfu and the islanders' health. His mummified remains are carried around the town every three months, recalling a miraculous escape from the plague in the 17th century. Mrs Papandreou was seen to light a large candle to his memory. There were unkind comments - and not just from the Greeks - that President Yeltsin had kept everyone up too late on Wednesday night. Dinner dragged on until 1am, while a cheerful Mr Yeltsin talked and drank toasts to the EU's economic pact with Russia. But he left most of his food untouched, causing consternation among the waiters at the Corfu Palace Hotel, who postponed removing his plate long after the other guests had finished each course. Mr Yeltsin then bunked down aboard the Alexandros, a yacht belonging to Mr John Latsis, reputedly the wealthiest Greek shipowner of all, berthed in Corfu harbour and surrounded by a flotilla of Greek warships. Last week, Mr Latsis took former US President George Bush and his family for a cruise of the Greek islands on the Alexandros. This weekend, he is is rumoured to be discussing with Mr Yeltsin a multi-billion-dollar deal for shipping Russian oil to Greece through a pipeline to be constructed through Bulgaria. One EU leader has the right sense of priorities. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, arranged to leave yesterday's session of talks early and head for the press centre so he could watch Ireland's World Cup soccer game against Mexico on television. Greek state television, broadcasting the match, arranged a special hook-up with RTE, its Irish counterpart, so Mr Reynolds could listen to an Irish rather than a Greek commentary. However, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, turned down an offer to play in a Saturday cricket match on Corfu between two local clubs. His advisers were quoted as saying it would be 'too frivolous'. Cricket, a leftover from a period of British rule in the Ionian islands, flourishes on a pitch just outside the palace where the summit is being held. Mr Major, who played a stylish cover drive before injury in a car accident, will probably regret his decision. He may have to spend much of the afternoon waiting his turn in the queue to leave the island. Because Corfu airport is too small to accommodate all the EU leaders' flights, most of them are parked at a Nato airbase on the Greek mainland. Bickering among member states over the order of departure is causing headaches for the Greek Defence Ministry.</p>

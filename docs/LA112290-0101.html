			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LITTON CONFIRMS 10% CUT IN L.A. WORK FORCE  </P> <P> Litton Industries Inc. confirmed Wednesday that it has cut about 600 jobs, or  10% of its Los Angeles area work force, over the past year mainly by  eliminating jobs at its Van Nuys and Woodland Hills facilities.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Rocketdyne division of Rockwell International also confirmed  that it has laid off 161 hourly workers at its Canoga Park plant since June,  mainly because of spending cutbacks on the proposed space station and certain  other space projects.  </P> <P> But Rocketdyne said it also has hired 736 people this year for other programs  where spending has been maintained or raised. The company employs 8,900 people  in Canoga Park.  </P> <P> At Litton's Woodland Hills plant, which makes guidance and control systems for  military aircraft and missiles, Litton has pared about 400 positions, in part  by laying off 100 workers, spokesman Robert S. Knapp said. In Van Nuys, where  Litton makes military electronic systems, the company has cut about 150 jobs,  including 90 through layoffs, he said.  </P> <P> Litton, based in Beverly Hills, joined a long list of military contractors that  have slashed employment in the face of slowing defense spending. The company  now employs about 5,400 workers in the Los Angeles area, with no additional  reductions planned, Knapp said.  </P></p>

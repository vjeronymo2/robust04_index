			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / PSBR figure better than expected PUBLIC-SECTOR finances deteriorated by less than expected last month, although government tax receipts continued to be restrained by the recession. The public sector borrowing requirement in August was Pounds 2.9bn, more than Pounds 500m lower than forecast. Privatisation proceeds in the month were close to zero. That brought the cumulative PSBR total since April - the beginning of the financial year - to Pounds 14.3bn compared with Pounds 7.9bn in the same period last year. Excluding privatisation proceeds, the cumulative total was Pounds 17.8bn. In the March Budget, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, forecast a PSBR of Pounds 28bn, double the size of the previous year's deficit. However, with the chances of an economic upturn this year looking increasingly remote, the Treasury's forecast is likely to be exceeded as tax receipts fail to live up to expectations and high unemployment keeps government spending high. The latest view of forecasters is that the PSBR will reach Pounds 32bn this financial year. Last month's better-than-expected figure was helped by net repayments from local authorities and public corporations.</p>

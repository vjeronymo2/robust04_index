			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government  on Tuesday urged North Korea to give up their "undue intent" of  withdrawing from the Military Armistice Commission and instead  show sincerity toward settling the nuclear question.    Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku said North Korea's planned  withdrawal from the truce commission is an express violation of  the existing Armistice Agreement and the basic South-North  agreement. "Their move is an irresponsible act of scheming to  neutralize the existing armistice agreement," Yi said. He is  concurrent National Unification minister.    In an interview with three major broadcasting stations, the  deputy premier said that any issue related to the existing truce  agreement should be discussed duly through South-North dialogue.  He noted that the basic South-North agreement stipulates in its  Article 5 that issues related to the Armistice Agreement should  be resolved through inter-Korean concurrence. Yi said, however,  that this is no time to discuss the issue with North Korea. "It  is not desirable to raise another question at a time when the  nuclear issue has arrived at a vital point," he said.    Meanwhile, spokesman Kim hyong-ki of the National  Unification  Board said the North Korean intent represents an outright  violation of the provisions of Article 61 of the Armistice  Agreement and Article 5 of the basic South-North agreement. "Our  unchanging position is that the issue of changing the existing  armistice system including replacement of the truce agreement  should be resolved independently between the direct parties  involved, namely, South and North Korea," Kim said in a  statement.    The spokesman charged that the North Korean act of  threatening the existing truce mechanism at this time when the  nuclear issue has reached an important juncture, cannot but be  an attempt to delay the resolution of the nuclear issue and  becloud the essence of the nuclear question. "The existing  armistice system should be preserved faithfully until an  alternative to the system is worked out," Kim said, adding that  no attempt to neutralize the existing truce mechanism can be  justified.</p>

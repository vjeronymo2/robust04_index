			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / China and US to boost military ties Beijing and Washington have agreed to increase the frequency of their military consultations in a further sign of improving relations. The move follows President Bill Clinton's decision earlier this year to sever the link between human rights issues and renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said in Beijing that the two sides would enhance their military contacts in a series of regular high-level briefings which would begin next month. The US would lead the way in providing the Chinese with the briefings, he added. 'Dialogue is in the security interests of both countries,' Mr Perry told reporters after meeting China's prime minister, Mr Li Peng. Washington has been pressing the Chinese military to become less secretive. 'We pointed out that transparency can reduce the concern of China's neighbours that its modernisation programme could provide a threat,' Mr Perry declared. 'I was very clear that we were not looking for secrets. It's strategy, budget and broad planning where we are looking for an exchange,' Mr Perry said. The US had also offered the Chinese data from computer simulations of its nuclear tests. The purpose had been to persuade the Chinese to stop carrying out tests. China drew protests from western governments on October 7 when it detonated a nuclear device at its Lop Nor test site. Beijing has refused to join a Washington-sponsored moratorium on testing, but says it is committed to a comprehensive test ban when this comes into effect in 1996. Mr Perry made it clear his visit to China was aimed at improving day-to-day contacts, to offset fears of a deterioration in Sino-US relations, strained over such issues as human rights and arms proliferation. 'We are putting into place one dimension of the overall policy of President Clinton's programme of broad constructive engagement with China,' Mr Perry said. Earlier, the US official had warned in a lecture to People's Liberation Army officers of the dangers of an arms race in Asia arising from a proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mr Perry called on China to exercise restraint in the transfer of nuclear technology. The US has long suspected that Beijing has been assisting Pakistan develop a nuclear capability. 'We are on the brink of a nuclear weapons race on the sub-continent, where relations between India and Pakistan have been tense for years,' Mr Perry said. 'As in Korea, China has a huge stake in this issue, since it involves nations on its border. With so much at stake, it is essential that countries with influence in South Asia try to stop the potential arms race before it gathers momentum.'</p>

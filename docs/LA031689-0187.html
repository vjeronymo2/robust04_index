			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL NEED TO BE TOUGH AT PENTAGON;  </P> <P> LIKABLE DICK CHENEY CAN GET MAD WHEN HE HAS TO  </P> <P> This time, mild-mannered Dick Cheney was really mad. House Speaker Jim Wright  had broken the one ironclad rule of politics: a deal is a deal.  </P> <P> After barely losing a key vote on a budget bill in October, 1987, Wright  adjourned the House temporarily, reconvened it shortly afterward and twisted  the rules to bring the measure up immediately for another vote. Wright let all  time for voting expire, then won back the allegiance of a Texas Democrat who  had strayed on the issue -- thus carrying the bill for the majority.  </P> <P> The next morning, Cheney, then the third-ranking Republican in the House,  unleashed his anger in an interview with the National Journal, a magazine  widely read on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> Calling Wright a "heavy-handed son of a bitch," Cheney accused the Speaker of  arrogant abuse of power. "He doesn't know any other way to operate," Cheney  fumed, "and he will do anything he can to win at any price, including ignoring  the rules, bending rules, writing rules, denying the House the opportunity to  work its will. It brings disrespect on the House itself."  </P> <P> Was this Dick Cheney, the soft-spoken conciliator, the political scholar who  can disagree without being disagreeable? The man President Bush described last  week as "a thoughtful, a quiet man"?  </P> <P> Absolutely, says his wife, Lynne V. Cheney, director of the National Endowment  for the Humanities. "It's a quiet, cold sort of anger, not an outburst," she  said. It's a tool, one he uses selectively, but to great effect, she added.  </P> <P> And on the rare occasions that her husband loses his temper, it is usually at  "somebody double-dealing, somebody not keeping a bargain," she said in an  interview Wednesday.  </P> <P> Dick Cheney, 48, today is on the verge of being confirmed -- anointed, some say  -- as the nation's 17th secretary of defense. He is portrayed by political  friends and rivals alike as bright, articulate, fair, unflappable and eminently  likable.  </P> <P> But he will need to be tough, too, and sometimes angry, as he moves across the  Potomac to the Pentagon, which sits mired in scandal and virtually paralyzed by  an absence of top managers in the aftermath of the nasty and prolonged  confirmation battle over John Tower, President Bush's first choice as defense  secretary.  </P> <P> Cheney, a Wyoming Republican in his sixth term in the House, is everything  former Texas Sen. Tower is not. Cheney is balding, gray-suited and soothing;  Tower is pomaded, London-tailored and abrasive.  </P> <P> Cheney is cool, Tower is hot. Cheney is dull, Tower is sharp. Cheney has no  enemies on the Hill. Tower, in the end, did not have enough friends.  </P> <P> And Cheney shortly will be defense secretary. Tower will not.  </P> <P> Former Rep. Tom Loeffler (R-Tex.), a close friend and political ally of both  Cheney and Bush, said that no one could serve Bush better than Cheney.  </P> <P> "He is a strong, stable and stout negotiator," Loeffler said. "Dick has  tremendous respect and credibility among his peers in the House and Senate and  on both sides of the aisle. There is no question that the President's selection  of Dick Cheney is a slam dunk."  </P> <P> Cheney came to Washington as a young man in the late 1960s, quickly rising by  virtue of brains and astute connections to become former President Gerald R.  Ford's chief of staff in 1975-1977. After Ford was defeated in his bid for  election in 1976, Cheney was briefly a banker in Washington, then moved back to  his native Wyoming to run for the state's sole seat in the House.  </P> <P> During that campaign, Cheney good-humoredly made a point of the fact that he is  not a lawyer or a Washington sharpie. Referring to his home town, Cheney used  to tell delighted crowds: "It was so cold up in Casper that all the lawyers had  their hands in their own pockets."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small-Town Exchange  </P> <P> At another point in the race, Cheney entered a small town, stopped by the  saloon in search of votes and found one elderly voter alone at the bar. Cheney  introduced himself.  </P> <P> "You a Democrat?" the man asked. "Nope," Cheney said.  </P> <P> "You a lawyer?" the man asked. "Nope," Cheney said.  </P> <P> "I'll vote for you," the man said.  </P> <P> Cheney demonstrated a sense of humor and a healthy dose of humility during that  campaign, his first run for public office, after suffering the first of his  three heart attacks early in the race.  </P> <P> After spending several weeks recovering, he formed a mythical group called  "Cardiacs for Cheney" and wrote a highly personal two-page letter to all the  state's Republicans, explaining that he had given up his three-pack-a-day  cigarette addiction and learned a lot about life from the crisis.  </P> <P> "No one," he later told reporters, "had ever tried the heart-attack gimmick  before."  </P> <P> It worked. He won the 1978 race and has been unassailable ever since.  </P> <P> "He's tough as nails when he needs to be," said Republican Jack Gage, who lost  a 1978 primary race to Cheney. "He's like a father who doesn't need to raise  his voice."  </P> <P> For Wyoming's citizens, Dick and Lynne Cheney's childhood in Casper and their  ascent into Washington's political stratosphere has been "like a movie script,"  as long-time family friend Mary Meyer of Casper put it last weekend.  </P> <P> "He's the same guy with the funny little smile -- quiet, steady, good for his  word," said another childhood chum, Michael Golden, now a Wyoming Supreme Court  justice. "You don't see anything he does or says that suggests he considers  himself important. He puts on no airs."  </P> <P> Cheney's small-town childhood was undiluted Norman Rockwell.  </P> <P> His mother, Marjorie Cheney, said that as a young child Dick would sit for long  stretches on his grandfather's lap while he read the Saturday Evening Post  aloud. The Cheneys built a modest ranch house on the edge of the Casper city  limits, where the side yard extended out for miles of high prairie to the  mountains east of town. Dick delivered the Casper Star-Tribune and worked at  the dime store in town.  </P> <P> His boyhood friend Joseph Meyer, now Wyoming's attorney general, recalled that  his and Cheney's families could not afford a motorboat for water skiing. So  they improvised, making crude water skis from old boards and using Meyer's 1950  Plymouth convertible to pull skiers along an irrigation ditch.  </P> <P> The boys met for weekly poker games in Cheney's parents' garage. They shot  pool, fished in nearby streams and hunted rabbits on the plains outside of  town. On Saturday night, said Cheney friend David Nicholas, a former Wyoming  state senator, they would cruise Casper's main drag "from one A&amp;W root beer  joint to the other" and park with girlfriends on C Hill overlooking town.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Age of Innocence'  </P> <P> "It was an age of innocence," said Karen Nicholas, another Casperite who grew  up and married her high school sweetheart.  </P> <P> Dick, the brainy captain of the football team and senior class president, fell  in love with Lynne Anne Vincent, the studious homecoming queen and chief of the  baton squad. A six-year courtship spanned their early college years and  culminated in a 1964 wedding.  </P> <P> Casper oilman Tom Stroock, a Yale graduate, saw in Cheney "the kind of young  man I would like to see Wyoming send out in the world." He persuaded Cheney to  apply to his alma mater.  </P> <P> But for Cheney, Yale was a painful encounter with unfamiliar territory and  better-prepared classmates from the nation's top prep schools and big suburban  high schools.  </P> <P> He dropped out after his second year, having lost his scholarship because of  poor grades. He returned to Casper and worked as an electrician, laying power  lines from F. E. Warren Air Force Base to ballistic missile silos.  </P> <P> When he returned to college classes at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, he  was more serious and more comfortable with his surroundings and his classmates.  After he earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in political science, he  and Lynne moved to Madison, Wis., to pursue advanced degrees at the University  of Wisconsin in 1966. He never finished his, but she earned a doctorate in  19th-Century British literature.  </P> <P> Cheney is remembered by his former professors at the University of Wisconsin as  an outstanding student, a serious, scholarly type who successfully juggled the  demands of graduate school, family and jobs as both a teaching assistant and a  staff aide to Wisconsin Gov. Warren Knowles, a Republican.  </P> <P> "During that period of time, the University of Wisconsin was second only to  Berkeley as a so-called hotbed of student unrest, but many of us attended  graduate school at the time without getting caught up in that," said Gerald  Whitburn, who was a student there at the same time as Cheney.  </P> <P> He avoided the military because his family and his student status won him  deferment from the draft.  </P> <P> With the help of his professors, Cheney won a congressional fellowship. He  worked for the late Wisconsin Rep. William A. Steiger and met then-Rep. Donald  H. Rumsfeld of Illinois, who became his friend and mentor.  </P> <P> After his brief career on Capitol Hill, Cheney took a succession of jobs in  Richard M. Nixon's Administration, serving as assistant to the director of the  Office of Economic Opportunity, White House staff aide and assistant director  of the Cost of Living Council under Rumsfeld.  </P> <P> When Nixon resigned in 1974, President Ford appointed Rumsfeld White House  chief of staff, with Cheney as deputy. A year later, when Rumsfeld became  secretary of defense, Cheney moved into the chief of staff job at age 34.  </P> <P> "He's always been mature past his years," said David Hume Kennerly, a  photographer who served with Cheney in the Ford White House.  </P> <P> Kennerly recalled that Cheney also had a knack for finding solutions to sticky  political problems. Cheney thought that Ford looked stupid wearing all the hats  that people presented him as gifts and he did not want any more front-page  pictures of the President in ludicrous headgear. When a West Virginia  politician insisted on presenting the President with a coonskin cap, Cheney  found a way out -- to nail the cap to a board so that Ford couldn't wear it.  </P> <P> "The perfect solution to a difficult problem," Kennerly said. "Cheney could  deal with a small matter or a big one with equal aplomb."  </P> <P> Phillip Buchen, Ford's White House counsel, said that the chief of staff job  under Ford was not what it was under Nixon or, later, Ronald Reagan. Cheney did  not function as Ford's principal adviser and door-keeper, Buchen said,  insteading serving as coordinator of the work of other top staffers.  </P> <P> After Ford's close loss to Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election, Cheney went to  work for the small Washington investment house of Bradley Woods &amp; Co.,  where he did research on economic and legislative issues. "I can't think of  anything he's not qualified to do," said the firm's vice president, Tony Brush.  </P> <P> But Cheney quickly grew restless and decided to run for Congress. Moving to  Capitol Hill as a first-term lawmaker after holding a top White House job was a  difficult adjustment, but one Cheney handled deftly, according to Rep. Tony  Coelho (D-Merced).  </P> <P> "His problem was, did he come in as freshman or as former chief of staff? He  came as a freshman," Coelho said. "He understood his role and he performed it  excellently. So well, in fact, that he quickly gained the trust and support of  his colleagues and ended up in a leadership role."  </P> <P> Late last year, Cheney was unanimously elected minority whip, the House  Republicans' second-ranking post. He was able to unite the party's radical  right-wingers with its moderate and progressive blocs because of his  personality and his diligence in defending his party's -- and his President's  -- interests in Congress.  </P> <P> As the ranking House Republican on the Iran-Contra investigating committee in  1987, Cheney won a reputation as a hard-liner in support of President Reagan  and his aides. He fought hard on rules of evidence and argued persuasively that  the President had the sole right to conduct foreign policy.  </P> <P> Former Rep. Jim Jones, an Oklahoma Democrat who has opposed Cheney on policy  but admires him personally, said that his old rival has grown more partisan in  the past couple of years. "I defend him," Jones said. "It's very hard to be a  Republican in the House of Representatives. You're not in charge and never will  be in charge. That's been hard for Cheney."  </P> <P> Cheney admits that he dislikes the minority role.  </P> <P> "You do not win by being a nice guy," Cheney said in a magazine interview last  year. "The problem is that (the Democrats) run the House, and the minority can  go along and get crumbs or we can be tough."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good to Work For  </P> <P> Cheney is tough, his staff acknowledges, but he is a pleasure to work for. He  puts in long but not unreasonable hours. "He's not obsessive," one aide said.  </P> <P> Despite three heart attacks in 10 years and quadruple bypass surgery last  summer, his doctor has pronounced him fit for all activities. He skis, plays  tennis, backpacks and rides horses for relaxation.  </P> <P> He indulges in an occasional Budweiser but does not qualify as even a social  drinker, friends say. He loves popcorn and enjoys cooking for his family and  friends. When he can't prepare trout from the streams of northern Wyoming, he  is often spied hanging around the fish counter at a supermarket in suburban  McLean, Va.  </P> <P> The Cheneys have two daughters, Elizabeth, 22, who works in Washington at the  Agency for International Development, and Mary, 20, a sophomore at Colorado  College.  </P> <P> Coelho considers Cheney uniquely qualified, intellectually and temperamentally,  for the demanding job of defense secretary. "He knows himself, he's not afraid  of himself and he's not afraid to stand up for what he believes in," Coelho  said. "I call that inner peace.  </P> <P> "We don't agree at all on a lot of political and philosophical things; we're  totally different politically. But he's the kind of guy you'd want as a friend.  He won't turn his back on you. And that's very important in my business."  </P> <P> Staff writers James Gerstenzang, Eric Harrison and Art Pine contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

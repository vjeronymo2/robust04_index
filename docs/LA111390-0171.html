			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGING YOUR MONEY;  </P> <P> THE RIGHT PATH;  </P> <P> HOBBY INCOME CAN BE TAXING;  </P> <P> THE IRS VERDICT ON WHETHER AN ACTIVITY IS BUSINESS OR PLEASURE IS SOMETIMES A  JUDGMENT CALL.  </P> <P> American taxpayers who mix business with pleasure have to be careful not to get  tangled up with the Internal Revenue Service.  </P> <P> As old as that precept may be, it carries an up-to-date message for  moonlighters who earn income from a hobby or other sideline activity.  </P> <P> Whether the endeavor in question is composing greeting-card verses, breeding  show dogs or growing vegetables in your back yard, Uncle Sam has a claim on any  proceeds it brings in.  </P> <P> The size of that claim may well depend on whether the enterprise qualifies as a  business or is deemed a not-for-profit hobby.  </P> <P> In the case of a bona fide business, taxpayers are normally allowed to write  off all expenses, even if to do so produces a loss that reduces their other  taxable income.  </P> <P> With a hobby, by contrast, expenses can be deducted only against income from  the activity itself. "Hobby losses are considered non-deductible personal  losses," point out the authors of the just-published 1991 edition of "J.K.  Lasser's Your Income Tax."  </P> <P> Just how do you distinguish between the two? Through legislation and rulings  over the years, a series of standards has evolved.  </P> <P> First of all, any venture that shows a net profit for three out of five  consecutive years is presumed to establish itself as a business in earnest.  </P> <P> If you breed or train horses for racing or show, the requirement is two years  out of seven.  </P> <P> In the event that those criteria aren't met, notes the United &amp; Babson  Investment Report, a Boston-based advisory service, "the status of an activity  is judged on a case-by-case basis, since the circumstances and facts of each  are unique."  </P> <P> Among the yardsticks that can be applied: Is the venture operated in a  businesslike manner, with a substantial amount of expertise, expenditure of  time and effort and diligent record-keeping?  </P> <P> Does it hold out the prospect of some reasonable return on investment? Is there  a practical basis for hope that assets used in the activity will increase in  value?  </P> <P> And, conversely, does it involve spending a lot of time in pursuits that are  recognized as sources of recreation and personal enjoyment? Can the money it  brings in make a real difference in your personal financial affairs?  </P> <P> "While none of these tests alone would qualify an activity as a hobby, the  general picture that evolved from all the tests would," United &amp; Babson  says.  </P> <P> With all the effort that has been devoted to defining the difference between  hobby and business, the verdict often comes down to a judgment call.  </P></p>

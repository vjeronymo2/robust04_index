This has been shown by the fact that the  Zionist assailants withdrew freely with all their weapons under  the cover of the enemy troops surrounding the Ibrahimi Mosque.  Al-Tamimi asked: How can an individual -- as the occupation  authorities are claiming -- kill and wound 400 people? He said:  We have made a clear and specific decision deeming every  Zionist inside the occupied territory a target of our  revolutionaries' bullets. He added: We will carry out the  Palestinian response inside the occupied territory before the  blood of martyrs dries. He urged all other Palestinian factions  to stop their denunciations and to embark on real action that  restores the dignity of the blood that has been spilled at the  Ibrahimi Mosque.

The plea, he said, was made at a recent national  meeting on SEZs in Zhuhai attended by central government  officials. "There are some powers that we believe should be  delegated to the SEZs.... Power over the vetting of some  projects should belong to the zones. Now the vetting process is  too complicated," he said.    "These powers have been recentralised during the economic  rectification and much (of the sharing of power between central  government and the SEZs) has yet to smooth out. In order to  allow the SEZs to go one step ahead in reform, these powers and  conditions should return to the zones," he added. According to  the mayor the SEZs should have the authority to approve most  investment projects and investors should be spared the trouble  of applying to Beijing for their investment.    Meanwhile, Mr Liang confirmed that Zhuhai has for the time  being shelved its plan to build the Lingdingyang Bridge linking  Zhuhai with Hong Kong. But he said the SEZ, which borders  Macao, has already started the construction of the Qiao and  Lingdingyang sections. He said these sections were necessary to  the development of the island resources of Zhuhai.    The project has been delayed partly because of a shortage of  funds and queries by Beijing over the technicalities of the  project. Mr Liang said Beijing had asked Zhuhai to conduct more  feasibility research and at one point suggested Zhuhai consider  the option of building a tunnel instead of a bridge.    "But we have restudied the idea and still believe that the  bridge is a better option." Tunnels, he said, were more  vulnerable to disasters such as earthquakes and they cost more.    According to Mr Liang, at least eight consortiums had  expressed interest in the bridge project and negotiations were  under way. While he said the Government would guarantee  investors a reasonable return, Zhuhai would not lease out the  islands to those who invested in building the bridges.</p>

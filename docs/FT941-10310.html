			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / MPs rap Pounds 48m computer 'waste' Much of the Pounds 48m spent on a government computer network was a waste of money, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday. Its report on the Department of Employment's attempts to introduce a new computer network called the Field System comes after similar criticism from the National Audit Office, the watchdog on government spending. The department said yesterday that it did not accept that the project was a failure or represented poor value for money. It decided in 1988 to introduce the system for its regional and area offices responsible for delivering training and enterprise programmes. Later that year the government announced plans to set up employer-led training and enterprise councils in England and Wales to replace the area offices from 1990. But the department decided to continue implementing the Field System in order to assist Tecs. 'They experienced problems in developing and implementing it,' the public accounts committee said. 'By spring 1993, when they ceased supporting the system and Tecs became responsible for determining their own information technology requirements, the department had spent Pounds 48m on it.' The MPs said that although in August 1992 most Tecs were using the system only partially or not at all, the department hoped the Tecs would 'tend to decide to develop the system rather than move away from it'. The department told the MPs that Tecs, had they been fully operational, would not have asked for such a system. The committee reports that by pressing ahead the department 'ignored a major lesson' from previous computer projects about the need to involve potential users fully. The committee said: 'We are disturbed that although the department spent Pounds 48m on the Field System, most Tecs considered that the system had not enhanced their performance. 'In such circumstances, we do not share the department's view that the system can be regarded as any sort of success, even a partial one. In our view, with so few clear benefits, this expenditure does not represent value for money for the taxpayer. This was money that could have been spent on providing training for unemployed people.' Public Accounts Committee. HMSO. Pounds 8.10.</p>

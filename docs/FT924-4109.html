			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Aspinall fails to block rival MR JOHN ASPINALL, the casino and zoo operator, failed in a court move to close down a rival club, The Sportsman, yesterday. London Clubs International, which owns the West End casino in Tottenham Court Road, was granted a new licence by North Westminster Licensing Committee at Horseferry Road magistrates court at the end of the four-day hearing. Mr Aspinall had told the magistrates he was making a stand because he loved the gambling industry and felt the sheer size of LCI would have an adverse effect. Six weeks ago Mr Aspinall was left with a bill for Pounds 160,000 of costs after failing to block similar gaming licences for five other London Clubs casinos - The Ritz, The Palm Beach, Les Ambassadeurs, The Golden Nugget and The Rendezvous at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane. The latest case brought another Pounds 75,000 of costs.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Inheritance and house prices IN JANUARY 1991 my father died leaving an estate in which I was to inherit four tenths of the monies remaining after the estate and probate had been sorted out. The estate had been placed into the hands of a solicitor as 'trustee and executor' along with one other person. The house was put on the market at Pounds 165,000 and with the remaining bank accounts and shares the total was approximately Pounds 180,000. I believe that a sum of around Pounds 20,000 has been paid to the Inland Revenue, by the solicitor, in respect of inheritance tax. Subsequently however, given the recession and the bad housing market, the house was sold for Pounds 104,000 leaving the total amount of estate left at Pounds 119,000. My question is, can I reclaim the inheritance tax already paid to the Inland Revenue as the final figure does not reach the NIL rate band. You should be able to take advantage of the provision which allows you to substitute the sale proceeds of an asset for the probate value if that asset is sold within three years of death. The claim to make this substitution must be made by the executors who were liable to pay the tax. If the sale price of the house together with the other assets falls within the nil rate band, the inheritance tax paid could be reclaimed.

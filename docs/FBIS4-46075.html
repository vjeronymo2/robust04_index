			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea on  Tuesday [24 May] agreed with U.S. plans to go ahead with a third  round of high-level talks with North Korea in Geneva in early  June.    The United States is seeking to encourage North Korea to be  more transparent with its nuclear activities, including allowing  full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci discussed  the North Korean nuclear question with South Korea's special  envoy for nuclear issues Kim Sam-hun on Monday and the two met  Tuesday with Yukio Takeuchi, deputy director general of the  Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau.    Washington has approved of North Korea's readiness to go  along with IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and  decided to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang, suspended  last July, in an effort to reach a political resolution to the  stalemate.    In Washington, U.S. Government sources said an announcement  on the scheduling of the talks will be made in the near future.    Tuesday's meeting in New York reportedly went smoothly as  the  three parties agreed on their position in dealing with North  Korea in the future, the sources said.    The sources stressed that the high-level talks could be  forfeited and the issue referred to the U.N. Security Council if  North Korea continues with the refueling of its experimental  nuclear reactor in the Yongbyon complex north of Pyongyang  without an agreement with the IAEA on inspecting the spent fuel  rods.</p>

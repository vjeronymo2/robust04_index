The petition is denied, because the agency concludes that its authority to grant relief extends only to vehicles for which the odometer reading is not relied upon as an indicator of mileage or condition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  John Donaldson, Attorney Adviser, Office of the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590; (202) 366&hyph;1834.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title IV of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 1981&hyph;1991) (``the Act'') sets forth certain requirements concerning odometers in motor vehicles. Among other things, the Act prohibits disconnecting, resetting, or altering motor vehicle odometers and requires the execution of an odometer disclosure statement incident to the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle. The Act also subjects violators to civil and criminal penalties, and provides for Federal injunction, State enforcement, and a private right of civil action. The provisions requiring odometer disclosure statements on titles were added by the Truth in Mileage Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;579), and reflect Congress' intent to address the growing national problem of odometer tampering in motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 408 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1988) directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules governing the making of odometer disclosure statements. In accordance with that mandate, NHTSA published a regulation (49 CFR part 580) which requires, in connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle, that each transferor must disclose the mileage to the transferee in writing on the title (or in some cases on the document being used to reassign the title). The regulation details the minimum contents of the disclosure, requires the disclosure to be signed by both the transferor and the transferee, and provides that no person shall sign an odometer disclosure statement as both the transferor and transferee in the same transaction, except in limited situations (described below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation allows a number of exemptions of relevance to the instant petition. Section 580.6(b) provides that ``[a] transferor of a new vehicle prior to its first transfer for purposes other than resale need not disclose the vehicle's odometer mileage.'' In practice, this provision exempts a motor vehicle manufacturer from the odometer disclosure requirement with respect to a vehicle transferred to a dealer for purposes of resale as a new vehicle. Section 580.5(h), which prohibits a person from signing an odometer disclosure statement as both transferor and transferee, allows an exemption in situations where the exercise of a power of attorney is authorized under &sect;&sect;580.13 or 580.14. The power of attorney allows a transferee to make an odometer disclosure on behalf of his transferor only in cases where the transferor's title is held by a lienholder or where the transferor to whom the title was issued by the State has lost his title and the transferee obtains a duplicate title on behalf of the transferor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The American Car Rental Association (ACRA) filed a petition dated November 29, 1993, seeking an amendment to NHTSA's regulation, under which its member car rental companies would be relieved of certain odometer disclosure requirements when purchasing new vehicles. ACRA describes a process, referred to as ``drop-shipment,'' by which many nationwide car rental companies purchase fleets. According to ACRA, the companies receive vehicle deliveries directly from the manufacturers but, due to franchising agreements between manufacturers and dealers, the purchase must be handled through a dealer. In some cases, the manufacturer ships both the vehicles and the title documents directly to the car rental company, while in other cases, it ships the vehicles to the car rental company and the ownership documents to the dealer. In either of these cases, ACRA asserts, car rental companies experience significant logistical problems in complying with the odometer disclosure regulations, because they must secure odometer disclosure statements from dealers that never take possession of the vehicles or, in some cases, the title documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACRA explains that the required odometer disclosure is currently accomplished through the grant of a power-of-attorney from the dealer to a third party (not related to the limited power of attorney between transferor and transferee authorized under &sect;&sect;580.13 and 580.14). The third party certifies the vehicle's odometer reading on behalf of the dealer, conveys the manufacturer's certificate of origin (MCO), and performs other services incidental to titling and registering the vehicle. ACRA acknowledges that this system works, but claims that it imposes a significant cost on the car rental industry, because the dealers pass on the costs associated with third party services to the car rental companies. ACRA estimates the cost to the average nationwide car rental company to be in the tens of thousands of dollars per year, and asserts that the process delays the introduction of vehicles into a car rental fleet without a legitimate law enforcement purpose, given the extremely low mileage on these new vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that the  Japanese reactionaries overheated in their ambition for  reinvasion are trying to move up the time of action.    The news analyst says:    "Studies of an emergency on the Korean peninsula" proposed  by  Sakuma may be called a plan for a Korean war in the 90s after  the end of the Cold War.    Such move of Japan is all the more grave because it is timed  to coincide with the intensified activities of the United States  and the South Korean puppets for a war against the North. Its  gravity lies in that Japan has been put in the position of "a  party concerned" with a new Korean war.    The Japanese reactionaries have chosen the Korean peninsula  as the first target of their military aggression overseas.    Their haste in "studies of an emergency on the Korean  peninsula", in fact, suggests that they, together with the South  Korean puppets, are rounding off an operational plan to start a  war of aggression in Korea and watching for a chance to carry it  into practice.    The Korean people will never allow the repetition of the  history of aggression by the Japanese imperialists and we are  prepared to resolutely react, if anybody attempt to infringe  upon our sovereignty and dignity.    Japanese samurais must act with discretion, mindful that  aggression and war will lead them to destruction.</p>

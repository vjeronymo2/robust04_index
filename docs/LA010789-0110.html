			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE;  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY SCRAMBLES TO GET LEAD, KEEPS SCRAMBLING TO DEFEAT OCEAN VIEW  </P> <P> Having started the fourth quarter 5 points behind, it figured that once  Fountain Valley High School got a lead on highly touted Ocean View -- ranked  No. 4 in Orange County -- it would finally take a deep breath and slow down.  Who knows, maybe even hold the ball for 10 seconds or so.  </P> <P> But Fountain Valley just kept shooting on the way to a 73-69 victory in the  Sunset League opener for both schools in front of 1,500 at Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> "We were on a good run and I figured why mess with it," said Dave Brown,  Fountain Valley coach.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley's run started 40 seconds into the fourth quarter with Tim  Hellbusch's 15-foot jump shot, which cut Ocean View's lead to 58-55. It ended  with a second to go as Mike Cook's free throw gave Fountain Valley a 73-69 lead  and took away any possibility of a 3-point shot coming to the rescue.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley, which took a 59-58 lead lead on Hellbusch's tip-in with 5:45  remaining, never pulled the ball out to run time off the clock even when it  went ahead 64-58 with 4:18 left.  </P> <P> "We're a 3-point shooting team," Brown said. "We have to play our way."  </P> <P> Fountain Valley did make 5 3-point shots in the game, though none in the fourth  quarter. In the fourth quarter it simply pushed the ball upcourt then shot it.  That set off a frenzy of activity in the game's last 4 minutes, when the teams  combined for 22 points, 3 blocked shots, 4 turnovers, 2 steals and a couple of  offensive fouls.  </P> <P> "This was a great high school game," Brown said. "The people got their money's  worth."  </P> <P> Fountain Valley (13-2, 1-0) outscored Ocean View, 20-11, in the fourth quarter.  Ocean View didn't score its first points of that quarter until 4:05 remained.  </P> <P> That came on Darren Ernst's layup, but Ocean View (10-4, 0-1) still found  itself trailing, 64-60. Ocean View's troubles scoring in the fourth quarter  were out of character for a team that had scored 22 points in the second  quarter -- to take a 34-33 halftime lead -- and 24 points in the third quarter  to take a 58-53 lead.  </P> <P> Ocean View trailed, 15-12, after the first quarter but started pushing the ball  inside and getting fouled in the second quarter. Ocean View outscored Fountain  Valley, 22-18 in the second, 15 of Ocean View's points coming on free throws.  Guard Mike Frohn, who finished with 18, had 10 points in the quarter, all on  free throws.  </P> <P> "We were letting them get the ball in too deep, and then we were trying to  reach in and take it away," said Mike Merle, Fountain Valley forward.  </P> <P> Merle, who led Fountain Valley with 19 points, had 6 in the fourth quarter. He  would have had 8, but he was called for an offensive foul on a driving layup  with 1:31 left, and his team leading, 68-66.  </P> <P> On the exchange, Ocean View's Ernst seemed ready to tie the score with a layup,  but Fountain Valley's Tom Weaver, a 6-foot 1-inch guard, blocked the shot.  Fountain Valley's Derrick Corcoran made 2 free throws to put his team up,  70-66, with 52 seconds left.  </P> <P> Edison 47, Huntington Beach 46 -- Bryan Murphy made an 8-foot jump shot with 40  seconds left to give Edison (8-9, 1-0) a 47-46 lead. Huntington Beach worked  for the last shot, but Jeff Long missed an 8-foot jumper with 8 seconds left.  Murphy scored 17 points and Bill Martineau 11 for the Chargers. Long scored 14  points for the Oilers.  </P> <P> Marina 68, Westminster 41 -- Sophomore forward Cherokee Parks scored 20 points  to lead Marina at Westminster. Marina led, 19-8, at the end of the first  quarter and, 32-13, at the half.  </P></p>

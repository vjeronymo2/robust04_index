			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLAROID WINS COURT ROUND  </P> <P> Shamrock Holdings' is running out of luck in its takeover bid for Polaroid  Corp. following a St. Patrick's Day ruling by a Delaware court upholding key  anti-takeover measures Polaroid is using to fend off the Burbank company.  </P> <P> Both Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and its huge propsed stock  buyback were ruled legal on Friday.  </P> <P> Validation of the ESOP puts about 14% of the company's stock in friendly hands.  In addition, the stock repurchase plan calls for Polaroid to buy back $1.1  billion in stock from the public. New investors friendly to management would  put up $300 million for part of the stock buyback.  </P> <P> Together, these two defenses would put about 30% of the company's stock under  Polaroid's control.  </P> <P> With another 30% held by individual stockholders who are generally regarded as  sympathetic to current management, the Shamrock bid seems profoundly  handicapped. Another 30% is held by institutional investors who analysts say  are less likely to favor the status quo.  </P> <P> Shamrock, an investment firm controlled by Roy E. Disney and his family, said  it would appeal Friday's decision. A hearing has been set for today on  Shamrock's request for an injunction pending the appeal.  </P></p>

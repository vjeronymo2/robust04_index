			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRAZY EDDIE ELECTRONICS STORES SEEKING CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION  </P> <P> Crazy Eddie Inc., the flamboyant electronics retailer, filed for protection  from creditors Tuesday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code but  pledged to keep its stores open.  </P> <P> Five creditors had filed a petition for involuntary bankruptcy against Crazy  Eddie on June 6, seeking to recover $860,000.  </P> <P> The company initially said it would fight to have the filing dismissed. But  Peter A. Martosella, acting president and chief executive officer, said the  petition caused a series of problems that forced Crazy Eddie to turn to Chapter  11.  </P> <P> "The action of the five creditors, which we believe was ill-advised, caused a  disruption in our bank-credit facility and related business and cash flow  problems requiring the company to seek the protection afforded it under Chapter  11 of the bankruptcy code," he said in a statement.  </P> <P> Martosella added that the company had been negotiating an out-of-court debt  restructuring with its creditors.  </P></p>

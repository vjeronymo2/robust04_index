			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters strong News and financial information agency Reuters Holdings pushed forward in response to positive weekend press comment over last week's announcement of US expansion. Acquisition of the Quotron equity dealing arm of US bank Citicorp saw the Reuters share price up 41 at best before being dragged back by US selling to close a net 18 ahead at 1920p. Most analysts recommend the stock up to at least Pounds 20 a share, with the more bullish seeing it hit Pounds 22 to reflect an American Depositary Receipt price of Dollars 100. There is also growing conviction that Reuters will shortly announce a share split, probably with end-of-year figures on February 8, in order to make the stock more attractive. The earthquake in Los Angeles rumbled through sections of the insurance community, with BAT Industries and Willis Corroon the two groups to suffer from nervousness over heavy claims. Tobacco-to-insurance conglomerate BAT has a US subsidiary called Farmers. Although Farmers merely manages mutual underwriting pools and has very little exposure, BAT shares declined 5 1/2 to 521p. Meanwhile, insurance broker Willis Corroon, which has a US associate that does place earthquake insurance, dipped 4 to 229p. However, insurance analysts said few property owners in the San Fernando valley took out subsidiary premiums to cover earthquakes. Food retailers managed to stay in mostly positive territory, continuing their strong new year run. BZW, one of the leading houses in the sector, yesterday reiterated its neutral stance, a move which was taken as a positive signal, given the one-way flow of negative news undermining the sector in the past 12 months. With peace breaking out in the niggling price war, BZW said that price stability between the supermarket protaganists is now a 'real possibility'. The broker forecasts the sector to outperform the market by 10 per cent in the first quarter. Yesterday Kwik Save moved ahead 6 to 624p, Argyll 2 to 303p and Nurdin &amp; Peacock 11 to 200p. However, J. Sainsbury, which moved on to the BZW buy list, slipped 2 to 476p. Television group Carlton Communications jumped 20 to 971p after it was announced that the company had received acceptances for 78.4 per cent of the shares in Central Independent Television by Friday afternoon and the offer was unconditional. Acquisition of Central will render Carlton the biggest independent television group in the UK and remove worries over competition in its video production side. Central shares rose 17 to 2980p. Speculation of a rights issue at Stanley Leisure, the gambling and gaming group, found some support among leisure analysts, who pointed out that the acquisitive company's shares were at an all-time high. Yesterday they put on a further 2 to 335p in spite of the cash call rumours. 'It is preparing a war chest,' said one seasoned hand, with small betting chains said to be in the company's sights rather than one large acquisition. Figures showing subdued inflation and talk of interest rate cuts, both in the UK and Germany, lifted several building and property stocks. Among construction companies, Banner Homes rose 12 to 159p, Wilson Bowden 13 to 520p, Bryant Group 5 to 182p, Persimmon 12 to 345p, John Laing 4 to 333p, Barratt Developments 14 to 252p, John Mowlem 8 to 155p and Taylor Woodrow 6 to 161p. Building materials groups were also firm. Marley moved forward 7 to 205p, Ibstock Johnsen 5 to 90p, Tarmac 8 to 196p and Pilkington 6 to 192p. Adding to the positive tone, British cement producers said conditions looked to favour an increase in cement prices this year. Rugby Group climbed 7 to 326p, but Blue Circle retreated after an initial burst and closed unchanged at 366p. Costain was lifted by speculation that Hanson may be eyeing its US coal interests, finishing 3 1/2 up at 36 1/2 p. Bank note printer De La Rue was held back to a rise of 3 at 914p as one broker recommended a switch into Bowater, up 12 at 510p. Spirits and brewing group Guinness was the worst performing Footsie stock as a number of brokers expressed caution over the company's trading outlook. Analysts said recent meetings with the company have done little to dispel concern over its prospective dull earnings flow. Yesterday, SG Warburg and Nomura were among those said to be making negative comments on the stock, which closed 11 down at 463p. Whisky producer Burn Stewart was recommended by NatWest Securities and the shares gained 6 at 125p. BZW trimmed its forecasts for Unilever on worries over US detergents, among other things, and the broker retained its 'hold' stance due to the low yield and slack earnings per share growth. However, reiterating its positive stance, Strauss Turnbull pointed out the stock's undemanding rating and recent underperformance. The shares closed 10 ahead at 1175p. Conglomerate Tomkins was the best performer among FT-SE 100 stocks, advancing 12 to 267p, after Hoare Govett turned buyer of the stock, having previously had an 'undervalue' rating on it. BTR, which has underperformed the market in recent sessions, improved 5 to 365p after it confirmed plans to seek a listing on the LSE for Graham Group, which comprises its two distribution businesses. Volume was 5.8m. Clayton, which said on Friday that it was in talks that could lead to a bid for the company, jumped another 42 to 145p as further developments were awaited.</p>

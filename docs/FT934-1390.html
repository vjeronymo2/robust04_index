			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Simply mad Macbeth - Malcolm Rutherford reviews the new RSC production Very broadly speaking, there are two ways of playing Macbeth the man. One is that he is too full of the milk of human kindness to be a natural villain. He is egged on to dreadful deeds by his ambitious wife. In the end he is 'in blood stepped so far that, should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o'er.' Thus in the final scenes he fights bravely, rather like Richard III. The other is that he is a calculating, ruthless fellow in the first place and Lady Macbeth is none-too-relevant to his motivations. There is, or course, a considerable overlap between the two approaches, the main interest being to which side the actor leans. In the new production by The Royal Shakespeare Company, Derek Jacobi adds a third possibility: namely that Macbeth is simply mad. Not mad in the conventional criminal sense of being a regicide and more, but psychologically, certifiably insane. If this Macbeth came up in court, a competent defence counsel might plead that he acted while the balance of mind was disturbed, and a liberal judge might let him off with a caution. There is some - not much, but some - evidence in the text for this novel interpretation. For example, Macbeth sees a dagger before his eyes which plainly is not there. He sees the ghost of Banquo, invisible to everyone else. He believes in witches. And here comes the clinching line. When the forces of good are closing in on Dunsinane, the Scottish nobleman, Caithness (not one of Shakespeare's most fleshed-out characters), comments on Macbeth: 'Some say he's mad; others, that lesser hate him, do call it valiant fury'. Adrian Noble, the director, has gone for the 'some say he's mad' view. This is a fatal mistake, just as it is always dangerous to try to impose a single, minority interpretation on a Shakespeare play. All the rest of the evidence is in favour of valiant fury. The only excuse is that Jacobi is very good at playing madmen. There are other weaknesses, stemming from a similar genuflexion to academic theories. A literary critic, Terry Eagleton, has written that 'it is surely clear that positive value in Macbeth lies with the three witches. The witches are the heroines of the piece'. Noble has plainly read him. The witches in this production occupy a huge amount of time. They speak very slowly and are exceedingly boring. The slowness is catching. It is quite a feat to make the shortest of Shakespeare's major plays last for just over three hours. When Jacobi speaks the famous 'tomorrow' line, it almost seems that the second tomorrow will never come, let alone the third. Some other comments. This is the second botched production of Macbeth in London in the last year or so. Richard Eyre fell down at the Royal National Theatre by casting a young Lady Macbeth who was not up the part. She was meant to be the sex kitten behind Macbeth's ambition. Cheryl Campbell's Lady Macbeth at the Barbican is altogether more mature. If it were not for the rest of the production, one would say that her performance is outstanding. Yet if her husband is as mad as she becomes, the balance is distorted. At times - at the banquet scene, for instance - she seems the only sane person in the play. Both Eyre and Noble seem to have a distaste for Scotland. Is it necessary to present the place as being so full of Stygian, Knoxian gloom? If you can have glamorous parties in Elsinore, after the death of another king, surely you can be allowed to live it up a bit north of the Tweed? The most that is offered here is a dreary Scottish reel, performed in semi-darkness. And the message is that the Scots, unlike the Danes, do not know how to dress. If you can make a character out of Osric in Hamlet, it must be possible to differentiate between the Scottish lords, Lennox, Ross, Menteith, Angus and Caithness. Denys Hawthorne's Duncan, clad in a long blue woolly sweater with a nightshirt underneath, and flowing flaxen hair, adds nothing to the play, though there is a very good Macduff played by Michael Siberry. Noble's previous Shakespeare productions for the RSC have been comprehensively excellent. This is a lapse from which he will recover: even Newcastle United can't win every week. The result of the Noble/Eyre contest on Macbeth is a goalless draw: replay soon. Sponsored by Unilever. Barbican (071) 638 8891</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAXICARE WILL CLOSE BIG HMO IN ORANGE, LAYING OFF 500;  </P> <P> TROUBLED HEALTH-CARE FIRM ENDING SERVICE TO 55,000 MEMBERS IN AN EFFORT TO  REDUCE LOSSES  </P> <P> Maxicare Health Plans Inc. said Tuesday that it is closing Family Health  Services Inc., its 55,000-member health maintenance organization based in  Orange, effective at the end of the month.  </P> <P> FHS, which was acquired by Maxicare in 1986 when it bought HealthCare USA,  operates 15 medical clinics under the FHS and General Med names in Los Angeles,  Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange and San Diego counties. Maxicare said it is  notifying members, employers and health-care providers of the planned closing  so they can make alternative arrangements.  </P> <P> The greatest impact of the closing will be in Orange County, where seven  clinics operate under the General Med name. Of the 500 FHS employees to be laid  off with the closing, about 300 work in Orange County, the company said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Maxicare, which is in the midst of a financial restructuring  that may be critical to its survival, said the closure of FHS is part of that  broad program. The restructuring included selling unprofitable plans. However,  the company said it is dismantling FHS because it could not sell the unit,  despite nine months of intense effort.  </P> <P> "We talked to a lot of people, but the deals were never consummated," said Tobi  Nyberg, vice president for corporate communications. FHS has some assets,  including buildings and medical equipment, that can be sold, but the Maxicare  expects the net effect of the closure to be a loss, Nyberg said.  </P> <P> In most cases, Maxicare doesn't provide medical care directly but contracts  with independent health-care providers for services. Since FHS is a  self-contained unit providing services directly, its members won't  automatically be covered by other Maxicare plans. Those members will have to  enroll in other medical plans offered by their employers.  </P> <P> Maxicare said it is encouraging employers to hold special open enrollments so  that FHS members will have access to alternative services immediately after  March 31 when FHS' clinics stop seeing patients.  </P> <P> A handful of FHS employees will remain for a few months to handle  administrative tasks, the company said.  </P> <P> "We were concerned that Family Health Services' financial condition could  affect its ability to deliver quality health care for its members," said Harley  Blankenship, Maxicare's executive vice president and chief operating officer.  The closure will also help Maxicare meet its goal "to cut debt and losses so we  can pay provider claims on a timely basis," he added.  </P> <P> The company, which has suffered huge losses over the past two years, has said  it must improve its payments schedule for contractors in order to preserve  crucial relationships.  </P> <P> In a separate announcement Tuesday, Maxicare said it changed financial advisers  for the recapitalization plan. The company said it "concluded its agreement"  with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the New York investment banking firm hired last  fall to help devise the plan, and instead hired Oppenheimer &amp; Co. for  advice.  </P> <P> Maxicare's board authorized New York-based Oppenheimer to "immediately review  strategic alternatives, including financing alternatives and additional asset  sales," the company said in a statement.  </P> <P> Blankenship wouldn't specify the reasons for changing advisers but said Goldman  Sachs' departure was by "mutual agreement." Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  </P> <P> Larry Selwitz, an analyst with Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach investment  banking firm, said the change in advisers was a surprise. "I don't consider  this kind of a deal a great sign. This is especially disturbing when you are  talking about a situation where doing something expedient is really critical.  This restructuring should have gone ahead before now."  </P> <P> Analysts expect the recapitalization to involve converting its debt into  equity. "The question is whether there is going to be a long haggling over how  much equity for debt," Selwitz said. He said he was surprised that the company  hasn't made an attempt to communicate with its senior creditors and  bondholders.  </P> <P> "To get this thing off and running, the company has to take the first step and  go to the bondholders. This is a very critical step to the restructuring," he  said.  </P> <P> Company officials said in December that they expected to announce a plan in  January.  </P> <P> However, Blankenship said Tuesday that the recapitalization plan is on schedule  and no further delays are expected as a result of changing advisers. "I would  not be surprised if we may be in a position to make an announcement next week,"  although he said the company hasn't yet approached bondholders.  </P> <P> Maxicare needs to recapitalize because it can't meet interest payments due its  bondholders and a group of banks holding about $150 million in debt. The banks  have given Maxicare some "breathing room," Blankenship said, by agreeing to a  120-day standstill agreement that allowed Maxicare to use funds to pay  providers. When the agreement expires on April 1, he said, "we expect  continuing our obligations to the banks."  </P></p>

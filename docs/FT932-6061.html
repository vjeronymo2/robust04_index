			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Stoiber elected as Bavarian premier Mr Edmund Stoiber was yesterday elected as the new state premier of Bavaria, Reuter reports from Munich. Mr Stoiber won support from almost all his fellow Christian Social Union (CSU) deputies in the state assembly, the majority faction that Mr Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, had tried unsuccessfully to woo this month in his bid for the premiership. The job became available when former premier Max Streibl stepped down over scandals about accepting free trips from a businessman.</p>

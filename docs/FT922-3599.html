			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / From bare shelves to blue jeans: Western groups are building brand names in central Europe In Warsaw, where housewives once waited hours to buy the everyday necessities of life, the only queue nowadays is for jeans from the Levi Strauss boutique - at Dollars 50 a pair. Nearby, in the shadow of Stalin's towering 'Palace of Culture', giant tents house a supermarket and stalls selling everything from Beluga caviar to compact discs. In central Budapest, the signs of new affluence are even more striking. Gleaming BMWs and Mercedes glide past shop windows filled with designer-label clothing, Mont Blanc pens and other icons of the status-conscious. Blink, and it could almost be Vienna or Milan. In spite of the parlous state of local economies, such visions of plenty are increasingly common across central Europe. After years of enduring shortages, shoddy products and dreary shops, shoppers are tempted on every street corner by western consumer goods which have become tangible symbols of their liberation from communism. For many western manufacturers, the attraction is mutual. In the past 18 months, large household name companies such as Coca-Cola, Pepsico Foods, Levi Strauss, Philip Morris, BAT, Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble and Electrolux have moved in to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to acquire local production bases and distribution systems. Though their strategies differ, all are making the same calculated gamble. By braving the region's political and economic uncertainties and often chaotic business conditions, they hope to come to dominate some of the fastest-growing markets of the future. 'Central Europe today is like America in the 1930s and Britain in the 1950s,' says John Lindquist, a consumer industry specialist with the Boston Consulting Group. 'There is a golden opportunity to establish brands and strong market franchises from scratch.' But what are the chances of the gamble paying off? Hungary and Poland offer contrasting yardsticks. A much longer history of economic liberalisation has given the former a head start, but the latter's larger population makes its market potentially a much bigger long-term bet. Both, however, face many similar challenges. In each country, much of the recent conspicuous consumption is froth on the surface of shaky economies gripped by a savage monetary squeeze. In Hungary, overall consumer demand has been plummeting for two years. In Poland, a retail boom has recently started to sag. Equally, consumer spending is dominated by small elites who have rapidly grown rich by methods of varying legality, while much of the rest of the populations has grown poorer. In both countries, as few as 10 per cent of consumers are estimated to control half the purchasing power. Gabor Varszegi, an entrepreneur who is probably Hungary's wealthiest man, reckons the easy killings will soon be over. Having rapidly built an empire by setting up photo-processing and cosmetics shops and importing luxury goods such as Ray-Ban sunglasses - which he sells for three times the US price - he says his next moves will be outside consumer markets in areas such as energy supplies. Some of the pain among the very poorest classes has been eased by flourishing black economies, visible in continuing large volumes of smuggled imports which often sell at bargain prices. Until recently, the Polish and Hungarian governments have accepted such activity as an antidote to social friction. However, the budgetary costs of doing so are rising. In a desperate effort to raise revenue, both governments have piled taxes on locally produced goods. However, higher prices have simply encouraged smuggling. In coffee-loving Hungary, where the drink carries heavy taxes, about 40 per cent of the market is supplied by illegal imports. There is also a darker side. In Poland, where the customs service has an unenviable reputation for corruption, cigarette smuggling has acquired the hallmarks of highly profitable organised crime. Such developments raise a basic question. Can central European countries build efficient and competitive markets which will support the solid wealth creation needed to fuel rising consumer demand? Or will they become candyfloss economies, shaped by the values of local yuppies, wheeler-dealers and a sleazy assortment of conmen? The role of the multinational investors may be decisive. Though still small in numbers, only they possess the skills and resources required to translate the goals of economic reform swiftly into functioning business reality. Furthermore, in countries desperately short of practical experience of capitalism in action, the local operations of multinationals are the only role models at hand. The impact of consumer products companies is particularly crucial. Because their activities directly affect the daily lives of millions of people and require an extensive distribution, marketing and sales infrastructure, they impinge on local economies across a wide front. Many of them have seen acquisitions in central Europe as a quick way to achieve market share - a goal helped in Hungary by the rushed privatisation of some near-monopoly producers such as NMV, a margarine producer bought by Unilever and Ferruzzi in February. However, such monopolies face growing competition from imports and newly arrived western manufacturers. Local production also enables goods to be priced at affordable levels - typically about two-thirds of those in the west. But the condition of plants varies widely. A few were so bad that their new western owners scrapped them. Others have required limited work to achieve acceptable standards. Most western newcomers are impressed by the quality of local employees, many of whom are technically proficient, adaptable and eager to learn - though woefully lacking in financial and marketing skills. But few companies have yet seriously tackled the over-manning which exists in many plants - an especially sensitive issue in Poland, with its politically powerful trade Obtaining indigenous raw materials is relatively easy - suppliers just turn up outside the factory gate. But importing can be much more problematic, particularly in Poland, where western manufacturers complain of long delays at customs unless they pay bribes. The toughest challenges, however, begin once goods leave the factory. Because local producers traditionally ignored sales and marketing, most larger western companies have had to recruit and train local sales forces and educate retailers in how to promote their products from scratch. Much the biggest headache is physical distribution. In Poland, state-owned monopoly wholesalers collapsed almost overnight after liberalisation. In Hungary, the process has been more gradual, as former regional monopolies - some of which own shops - have retreated in the face of competition. But though the privately owned businesses which have sprung up to fill the gap are often energetic and enterprising, most are poorly financed and organised. 'Nobody has any capital and nobody takes credit,' says Andrzej Szwarc of DMS, a small Dutch-Polish company which markets products for Mars, the US food company. 'We have started to extend credit, but we go to bed with the thought that if a wholesaler goes bust, so do we.' Many bigger companies are training local wholesalers. Even so, Kzrysztof Sokolik, Philip Morris's manager in Poland, says none yet covers the whole delivery chain all the way to retail outlets. Some companies are also supplying outlets directly. Coca-Cola, for instance, has 150 sales and delivery trucks on the road in Poland. However, in the first six months, Coke found that 60 per cent of its retail customers had changed. Though hundreds of thousands of retail outlets have sprouted across central Europe in the past two years, many are little more than hole-in-the-wall operations with fragile finances. Even in bigger stores, basic techniques such as managing shelf space and stock turnover are still almost unknown, and supplies erratic. 'When my wife sees imported products she wants in the shops, she buys 10 of them at a time,' says Patrick Knight, head of Colgate-Palmolive in Hungary. Distribution has received little attention from western retailers which, unlike multinational manufacturers, have so far been slow to enter central Europe. The Austrian Julius Meinl supermarket group and Tengelmann of Germany have invested in Hungarian chains, which they are helping to modernise, and some franchise boutiques have been established. But in Poland, the government appears reluctant to sanction big investments by foreign retailers for fear of jeopardising the survival of the many newly created small shops which it regards as one of the proudest achievements of reform. Yet most western managers in central Europe remain optimistic that, with patience and energy, these obstacles can be overcome. In the words of Robert Combee, Dutch-born head of Compack, a Hungarian coffee company bought last year by Sara Lee of the US: 'People here feel it's a chance of a lifetime.' How far locally owned producers will share in that chance is another question. Some, notably Polish breweries, have reasonably strong brands and quality and are trying to go it alone. But most are reeling from the loss of former Comecon markets, fierce import competition and massive debts. Their managers are often remarkably clear about what needs to be done to make them competitive by improving quality, packaging and marketing. However, they are equally aware that the challenges are probably too big to handle alone, and that they can only hope to survive by rapidly finding western owners. Acute capital shortages are an obvious barrier to expansion. However, many local managers feel that other handicaps are equally important. They include outdated technology, minimal management and marketing skills and - above all  -an almost total lack of experience of how modern businesses work. The dilemma is crisply summed up by Krzystof Bialowolski, president of Hortex, a large Polish food processor which is looking for foreign investors while struggling under a mountain of debt. 'If you gave me Dollars 50m today,' he says, 'I would simply have to turn around and spend Dollars 10m hiring advisers to tell me how to invest it in the business.' That admission is a measure of the distance central Europe has yet to travel to create modern market economies. But the fact that such issues are being recognised and talked about also says much about how far the region has already come.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   WHAT'S IN STORE FOR CENTRAL EUROPE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Acquirer             Target*                 Business           Value                                              of target       (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HUNGARY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Unilever (UK/Netherlands) &amp; Ferruzzi           NMV                     Margarine, soap    100 (Italy)                                      and detergents Sara Lee (US)        Compack                 Coffee and tea      60** Ferruzzi             40 percent each of      Sugar               40                      Szoinok sugar factory,                      Szrencs food factory                      and Matravidek BAT (UK)             Pecsi factory           Tobacco             36 Tate &amp; Lyle (UK)     30 percent of           Sugar               20                      Hajdusagi Cukorgyar Nestle (Switzerland) 97 percent of           Confectionery       NA                      Intercsokolade United Biscuits      84 percent of           Biscuits            NA                      Gyori Keksz  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- POLAND  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Unilever             Pollena Bydgoszcz       Soap and            44                                              detergents PepsiCo (US)         40 percent of Wedel     Confectionery       24 Henkel (Germany)     Pollena Raciborz        Soap and                                              detergents          16 Gerber (US)          Alima                   Baby fruit juice    11 Benckiser (Germany)  Pollena Nowy Dwor       Soap and                                              detergents           5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CZECHOSLOVAKIA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Philip Morris (US)   Tabak                   Tobacco            413 BSN (France), Nestle and EBRD      Cokoladovny             Confectionery      126 Coca-Cola Amatil     Kyje soft drinks (Australia)          facility                Soft drinks         82 Procter &amp; Gamble (US)                 Rakona                  Soap and                                              detergents          44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Values include commitments to further investment where published * More than 50 percent acquired where no percentage is given **Dollars 60m paid for 40 percent stake, later raised to 100 percent   for undisclosed further amount  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

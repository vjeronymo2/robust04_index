			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 8 Jun (MTI) -- "The prime minister of the  new Hungarian government should meet with the Slovak Prime  Minister at the earliest possible date," runs a message to  Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik from Gyula Horn, the  chairman and prime minister candidate of the Hungarian Socialist  Party (MSZP). The message was presented to the Slovak Premier  in Bratislava on Wednesday by MSZP acting Deputy Chairman Imre  Szekeres.    In an interview with MTI's correspondent after the hour-long  meeting with Moravcik, Szekeres said:    "The meeting was extremely constructive. I detailed the  probable essentials of the foreign policy of the new Hungarian  government: that we shall strive for European integration, for  settling our relations with neighbouring countries, and for  ensuring the rights of the Hungarian minority living outside the  borders of Hungary".    "I also said that though the new government will be the  government of 10.5 million Hungarians, it will feel  responsibility for the fate of the Hungarian minority living  beyond the country's borders."    "We consider it important to open talks on the basic  agreement between the two countries as soon as possible, and for  these to lead to success as early as possible."    "There are two major issues from our point of view:  recognizing the inviolability of the borders, and mutual  ensurance of the rights of Hungarians in Slovakia and Slovaks in  Hungary."    "I also informed Prime Minister Moravcik that the new  Hungarian government will hold talks about the debated issues of  the Gabcikovo power plant on a professional, rather than an  ideological basis."    Jozef Moravcik also met the press. He said he had told the  MSZP delegation that the Slovak Government considered the  election manifesto of the Hungarian socialists very interesting,  "as it holds out the promise of successful bilateral  cooperation." "We agreed that the foreign policy concepts of  our countries are identical as regards basic aims, but that  settling bilateral relations now requires firmer steps,"  Moravcik said.</p>

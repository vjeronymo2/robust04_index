			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Major invites new Dublin leader for talks MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, has stepped up his initiative on Northern Ireland by inviting Mr Albert Reynolds, premier-elect of the Irish Republic, to visit the UK for talks later this year. Downing Street yesterday said Mr Major would meet Ulster's political leaders on Tuesday to discuss security after one of the most violent months in the province's history. This year 26 people have been killed by terrorists. Officials said that Mr Major wanted locally elected Unionist and nationalist politicians to take more of a role in expressing the hostility of most people to terrorism. Mr Major agreed with Mr Charles Haughey, the departing Irish prime minister, that they would hold six-monthly meetings when they met in Dublin in December. No date has been fixed for the meeting with Mr Reynolds. Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland Office is playing down any expectations that next week's meeting will make significant progress. Although Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, believes any dialogue is helpful, he is aware of the danger of the Unionists believing they have begun to set the agenda. Some Unionists' hopes have been raised by signs from Mr Major and Mr Brooke that the Tories might consider a pact in a hung parliament. The proximity of the general election has already stalled Mr Brooke's efforts to start formal 'round-table' negotiations on the province's future. However, Unionist demands for the internment of terrorist suspects are expected to be rejected at next week's meeting. The Northern Ireland Office would prefer not to discuss the measure, if only because internment would need an element of surprise in order to be successful. Although Mr Major spoke earlier this week of how local politicians could help restore peace if they talked together more, the Downing Street meeting is described as more of a listening opportunity for the prime minister. Local politicians have not had responsibility for security in the province for 20 years and Mr Brooke has always acknowledged that his political initiative would not necessarily end terrorist violence.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Election called in Algeria peace bid Algeria's military-backed government is to hold a presidential election by the end of next year - in an apparent gesture to Moslem fundamentalists. The decision, announced yesterday by President Liamine Zeroual, will cut short his term of office by at least a year. Algeria has been convulsed with conflict since parliamentary elections were cancelled in January 1992, when the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) appeared on the verge of victory. In the ensuing turmoil, the FIS was banned and thousands have been killed, including 68 foreigners targeted by Moslem extremists. The Algerian government recently opened contacts with militant Islamic leaders, but President Zeroual said at the weekend there was an impasse because they still supported insurgency. 'The moment has come to remove the obstacles to people's expression and to allow them to speak directly,' he declared yesterday. 'I have decided that the presidential elections will take place before the end of 1995.' Mr Zeroual stressed his 'determination' to pursue the 'eradication of terrorism and violence'. His willingness to move towards elections appears to be a gesture of conciliation to the more pragmatic fundamentalists, as well as to Algeria's legal opposition parties. He said the elections would be free but did not specify whether the FIS could run.</p>

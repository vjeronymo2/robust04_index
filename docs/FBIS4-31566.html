			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gligorov-Nimetz Talks"] </F>   [Text] The President of the Republic of Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Kiro Gligorov  held talks in Skopje yesterday with the U.S. special envoy for  the Macedonian-Greek dispute Matthew Nimetz, which were also  attended by the Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski.    According to the announcement from the President's cabinet,  they exchanged opinions on the present situation in the  Macedonian-Greek negotiations and the possibilities of  continuing the dialogue on the controversial issues. Also on  this occasion, Macedonia's position in relations to the urgent  need for a lifting of the blockade and the concept -- to discuss  and solve all of the questions in a package, was reiterated.    President Gligorov placed an emphasis on the difficult  consequences from the Greek embargo suffered by the Macedonian  economy and the real threat this imposes to a broader  destabilization in the region. He was also uncertain whether  the latest round of negotiations with the mediators in New York  would be able to provide a greater certainty as to the outcome  of this situation, which is already becoming an evident element  of threat to the stability in the south. During the talks, they  also exchanged opinions on the further development of the  relations between the United States and the Republic of  Macedonia.    Mr. Crvenkovski stated that other topics were the situation  in Macedonia, the damages caused by the embargo and the entire  situation in the region. He expressed hope that it would soon  come to another meeting with Nimetz, and that the talks with  Cyrus Vance would be continued.    The U.S. special envoy Nimetz explained before the press  that  all of the sides in the negotiations have agreed that it is  better not to disclose the essence of these sensitive  negotiations in public, as it is a better way of conducting them  more successfully. He stated that the talks were of great help  to him in understanding the problem better, and that his  function was to convey the stances of the two sides individually.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE MARSHALS CLOSE STUDIO CITY THEATER  </P> <P> All weekend performances of John Susman's "Tiger Treadwell Takes Tinseltown" at  the Ventura Court Theatre in Studio City have been canceled after Los Angeles  fire marshals closed down the theater Thursday just before the performance was  to begin.  </P> <P> The reason for the shutdown, according to Capt. James L. Gaffney, was the  theater management's failure to secure the proper licenses -- specifically a  particular permit "that allows that kind of business to be run out of that  occupancy."  </P> <P> The newly opened theater on Ventura Boulevard has 99 seats.  </P> <P> "We'd been promised since January that all the city building codes would be met  and that we would be handed a legal building," said Carolynn Botticelli, who  produced "Tiger Treadwell" for the Los Angeles Theatre Unit. "Twenty paying  customers filed in last night followed by the fire marshal."  </P> <P> Neither the theater's owner, Max Rubinchik, nor his legal counsel, Richard  Niederberg, could be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> Botticelli said the show would resume Thursday only if Rubinchik is able to  secure the needed clearances. Otherwise, the show will remain closed.  </P> <P> Anyone holding tickets or reservations for this weekend can reach Botticelli at  (213) 851-8106. SYLVIE DRAKE  </P></p>

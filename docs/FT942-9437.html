			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Observer: Up in court Observer has to confess, without a trace of sycophancy of course, that it is becoming impressed by the global reach of Pearson, the FT's parent - and we are not talking about circling the world in the company of the BBC. The nomination by Bill Clinton of Judge Stephen Breyer from Massachusetts to the Supreme Court extends the connection into the highest US bench, something that Rupert Murdoch certainly cannot boast For Judge Breyer was married in 1969 to the former Joanna Hare, which makes him the brother-in-law of Viscount Blakenham, the current Pearson chairman, and nephew-in-law of the Hon Alan Hare, ex-chairman of the FT. In a story we could never use last summer, because Breyer lost out to Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the last Court vacancy, the family was quizzed about its in-law, but remained discreet. 'He likes a spot of good claret,' one of them said, in itself a pretty fair recommendation for the world's most famous judicial body.</p>

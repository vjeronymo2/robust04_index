			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Gao Shangquan Says Renewal of China's MFN Trading </F> Status is Important to Hong Kong"]    [Text] Gao Shangquan, head of the mainland's Preliminary  Working Committee's economics sub-group, maintained: It is  unwise for the United States to apply pressure against China and  set all kinds of conditions on the issue of most-favored-nation  [MFN] treatment. Yu Xiaosong, vice minister of the State  Economic and Trade Commission and a mainland member of the  economic sub-group, stated: If the United States takes measures  against China's state- owned enterprises, this will mean  creating new contradictions in Sino-U.S. economic development.    After visiting the One Country, Two Systems Research Center  on 2 May, when asked about the question of the U.S. extension of  MFN treatment to China, Gao Shangquan said: Whether or not the  United States grants China MFN is also extremely important to  Hong Kong. If China's MFN treatment is not renewed, Hong Kong's  interests will suffer. Moreover, not only does the issue have a  bearing on Hong Kong, but it is also very important to the  United States itself. It is thought that entrepreneurs and  ordinary people in the United State all hope that China will  have MFN renewed.    He criticized the United States for always setting all sorts  of conditions every time the MFN question is discussed. This  has also been the case in the past. It applied pressure against  China on the issue.    In regard to a report that the United States will take  measures against China's state-owned enterprises and levy heavy  tariffs on their products, Gao Shangquan said: State-owned  enterprises constitute a very big part of China's national  economy. Reforming state-owned enterprises is the focal point  of economic reform. What is detrimental to China's state-owned  enterprises will also be detrimental to U.S. enterprises,  because China's state-owned enterprises are involved in all  cooperation and trade activities between China and the United  States. Moreover, Hong Kong will also be affected as a result.    Prior to the visit, Yu Xiaosong remarked: The United States  should not take measures against China's state-owned  enterprises, otherwise, it will create new contradiction in  Sino-U.S. economic development. This will have very bad effects  on both sides. If the United States take measures against  state-owned enterprises, this will affect other fields in its  economic ties with China.    He did not think that current Sino-U.S. relations had become  quite tense because of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan or a meeting  with the Dalai Lama by American leaders. He maintained that  these issues had nothing to do with the economy. When asked of  his confidence in MFN renewal, he stated: This is a matter for  the Americans. You must ask U.S. President Bill Clinton or the  secretary of state.</p>

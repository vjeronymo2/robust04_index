			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Qudaybergen Seyitmambetov, deputy chairman </F> of the administration of the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast  Agro-Industrial Bank, Inc., recorded by Yerkin Qydyr: "Where Is  the Return on Our Investment?"]    [Text] Carrying out resolute measures in such areas  as exchange of farsighted experiments, training, and the  strengthening of order in the banking system in order that the  economy of our independent Republic achieve stability is one of  today's vital concerns. What is being done to this end in the  southern Kazakhstan region, where industry and agriculture have  developed, and where recently the number of banks has grown  rapidly? What kind of unresolved problems are there between  central and local banking layers? Our reporter spoke on this  theme with Qudaybergen Seyitmambetov, deputy chairman of the  administration of the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast Agro-Industrial  Bank, Inc., one of the largest organizations in Shymkent in its  sector.    [Qydyr] The view has frequently been expressed recently that  the independence and sovereignty of a country without its own  financing and means of exchange are uncertain. As an experienced  specialist with 20 years experience in the banking system what  are your views on this issue?    [Seyitmambetov] What you say is true. Even among the people  there are those who would have us think that our failure to  introduce our own currency is because our leaders are  unenterprising and indecisive. I cannot agree with this  position. To be sure, arrogance and sometimes pomposity have  created problems with Russian ruble policy. However, there have  been complaints about this and hurried measures have been taken,  and we should not repeat the Ukrainian example. At a time of  economic relations which have been entangled like a spider's web  for 70 years, it is presently beneficial for us to remain within  the ruble zone. What we need is for the head of state to make  known his adherence to such a policy. In addition, we have still  not fully resolved the question of foreign exchange, goods, and  gold stocks which would serve as a basis for issuing a national  currency in our Republic which for long years has developed only  as a source of raw materials. For that reason, it would be  proper for us to think about developing production and about how  to expend correctly and properly our existing financial  resources.    [Qydyr] Two or three years ago the number of bankers in the  southern part of Kazakhstan could be counted with the fingers.  There are at present more than 60. However, financial resources  and hard cash have not grown along with the increase in the  number of banks. There are those who say that this has made it  possible for a few bankers to get rich. Some of those  administering banks have had nothing to do with financial  activities, and there is nothing special [i.e., they have no  special qualifications] about those in control. This no doubt  means that the prestige of these new activities has sunk...    [Seyitmambetov] As in the Soviet Union, all accounting in  our  country until 1988 was carried out through the state banking  system. After that perestroyka began, and banks became  specialized for sectors such as agriculture and industry.  Starting in 1990, commercial banks began to appear. We can say  that these things were the first manifestations of a transition  to market relationships. Unfortunately, just as you have said,  twice as many banks have now been established. However, those  establishing banks with private capital are very few if not  nonexistent. However, it is written in articles 20 and 22 of the  "Law on Banks in the Republic of Kazakhstan" that, during their  first two years of operations, banks are to live off their own  resources, and that the heads of banks are to be professionally  qualified and prepared. However, are these provisions being  carried out in fact?    During recent years, with the rapid growth in banks, sources  of finance have not increased. In addition to this honest  competition has not gained ground. We have been deprived of tens  of large-scale agro-industrial sector enterprises whose accounts  were kept by us for a number of years. That was the reason why  they opened the new bank. It was the livelihood of officials  with power in their hands. They forced those enterprises to  establish accounts with the new bank. Can we talk of honest  competition under such conditions? When these same enterprises,  encountering market pressures, found themselves suffering from a  shortage of capital, the new bank could give them no help  whatever. It came about that some [of these] enterprises again  became our customers. Thus the stability and administrative  methods of the banking system and even the national economy have  been harmed. It is a fact that V.I. Lenin said: "There are  26,000 banks in America. All are small and will not survive for  long." In truth, whereas there were 30,139 large and small banks  in the United States in 1920, at the end of the 1960s, as a  result of consolidations and sector mergers, only 13,986 of them  remained. However, during that period bank financial resources  rose from 52 billion to 293 billion dollars. The Americans are  not concerned about the number of banks but their quality. And  what about us? Some banks even perform various subterfuges to  provide the reserves required by law and go over to deception.  For example, the recently established "Zhaqsylyq" Commercial  Bank gave a loan of 50 million rubles in the form of a check to  a client of ours, the "Ordabasy" Trade House. The "Ordabasy"  Trade House, however, returned the money to the bank according  to agreement, unused and untouched. Only through the  intervention of officials of our bank was this illegality  stopped. The reason is that "Ordabasy" had obtained a loan of  millions of rubles from our bank. The matching capital obtained  from the second bank was only to come from net profit. Here we  must recall the wise proverb of our people: "Do not wear a club  you cannot lift" [Do not bite off more than you can chew].    Let me take advantage of the situation to made the following  suggestion through your newspaper: We must henceforth (up  until 1994) re-register [i.e., recharter] only banks with  reserve funds exceeding one billion rubles. In fact, it  would be suitable if this suggestion were discussed by the  appropriate authorities and made into law. In particular, the  opening of so many new banks is reducing the status of a complex  service of importance for our independent country just like the  saying: "if you are going to be a bootmaker, do not be a slow  one."    As I have said above, due to a lack of completely honest  competition, it is no secret that the proliferation of new banks  is creating difficulties for our well-established organization.  We would like to express our feelings of thanks to the managers  and chief bookkeepers of the "Qazaqitalqarakol" Consolidated  Industry, "Shymkentsyra," "Shymkentsut," production unions  carrying out the procurement and primary processing of Kazakh  cotton, and producing oblast grain products, the grease and  antifreeze plant, the confections factory, and the  "Angsat-Shymkent" trade firm for withstanding the pressures and  constraints under such conditions and remaining our customers.    [Qydyr] Qudaybergen, you are aware that, at the time the  Republic law on banking was ratified at a session of the Supreme  Kenges, there was considerable discussion about the central  accounting clearing house. Does our Republic, which has achieved  its independence and has entered upon the path of a market  economy, need such a center?    [Seyitmambetov] This is a question which was hitherto raised  in the Kazakh press, which only led to an exchange of opinions  among specialists. Now as for the central clearing houses of the  National Bank, the state bank of former times, they are one of  the last of the tricks thought up by the state bank prior to the  collapse of the Soviet Union to keep the republics under control  and dependent. During June of 1991 for the first time in the  Soviet Union such centers were established in the Republic in  Southern Kazakhstan Oblast, without any preparations or  preliminaries. A great deal has become known in the two years  that have passed. As has been stated, it has become known that  such centers are an unnecessary layer [of the banking system],  and that they have created difficulties for the economy of our  nation from the very beginning. Whereas clearings and exchanges  of documents between organizations and between banks used to  take a day at the time of the former state bank, things have now  gotten so bad that it takes several months using the clearing  houses within a city.    If is fine to go slowly and take months, but how many  organizations are there where all traces of the funds sent have  been "lost?" All of this is doubtless leading to the formation  of a false image about the newly opened banks and about the  entire banking system. The reason is that the public as whole  does not know that all clearings are carried out solely through  the State Bank Center...    I think I should mention one thing: the clearing house of  the  National Bank in Turkistan City got together with the governor  of the city, and during May of last year abolished the  operational tellers of the bank in Turkistan. The clearing house  is itself providing payment and income services to the customers  of the bank. Although this action is against the "Law on Banks  in the Republic of Kazakhstan," it still continues to this day.  We have informed the oblast administration of the National Bank  about this illegality orally and in writing but to no avail. All  in all, this illegal action must be very beneficial for them.  Such illegalities are a barrier to our work. There is one more  thing I wish to say on this issue. Prior to the neighboring  Republic of Kyrgyzstan introducing its own currency, the  clearing center of the state bank was abolished. I hope that we  too are thinking of taking this step.    [Qydyr] Last question: it would seem as if there was  laziness  in the matter of training national specialists in a banking  system from which Kazakhs have previously shied away. Why is  there reluctance about placing national specialists, who will be  devoted and will not go off the foreign countries after they  have filled their purses, into the highest levels of the economy.    [Seyitmambetov] This is a question which should be directed  at the leaders who are deciding the fates of specialists in our  Republic. Let me try to answer as best I can. In order that our  county become an independent, fully-developed nation, we must  develop stable, well-financed, full-service banks equipped with  the most modern technology, capable of establishing  communications with the world banking system. That is to say, we  must understand that banks are one of the arteries of the  economy. This being the case, such banks should be managed by  managers who are devoted to their nation and their people, who  have mastered their specialties in all aspects and well, who are  competent and knowledgeable, and young national specialists must  be prepared for these roles. Unfortunately, we lack a tried and  true official policy in this area. One of the most important  questions facing young specialists is that of housing. Only if  they have housing over their heads and a suitable salary will  they work to their full capacities and be productive. As for our  bank, the housing question has been settled fundamentally in the  last two years. More than 20 young women and men have been given  housing at company expense. The existing employees of the  company have also not been left out of consideration. We have  purchased in the last few years computers to ease the work of  bank employees and to bring bank operations up to date. We, the  bank managers, while doing things for our workers, have strongly  maintained the work ethic. We have devoted attention in our  organization to the learning and teaching of the official  language, and have hired a special expert for this purpose. This  expert, in addition to making translations, helps those learning  Kazakh. At the same time, we gave aid last year in the amount of  6 million rubles out of net profits to national programs and  activities, to social organizations and to individuals with  special needs. May this benefit people and create good will.    [Qydyr] Let us not forget good intentions, good works, and  philanthropy. Thank you very much for the interview!</p>

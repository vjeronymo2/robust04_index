As a result, the economic team is "reviewing the  figures" so that the deficit does not surpass 0.5 percent of the  GDP, Economy Minister Ignacio de Posadas said.    In an interview granted to radio station CX 24 Nuevotiempo,  the minister confirmed in broad outline the economic measures  contemplated for 1994. He made a positive balance of the  government's economic policy and, analyzing his recent  interpellation by Congress on the national industrial situation,  he again criticized Congress for what he called its rejection of  the implementation of structural reforms.    The minister justified the hard tone he used to reproach  opposition congressmen over their "double discourse."    He said that the promoters of the interpellation had  "political intentions," particularly Senator Hugo Batalla, and  added that they had thus been trying to "recover a lost role as  protagonists."    De Posadas held the Broad Front, the New Sector coalition,  Crusade 94, and the Batalleist Forum responsible for increasing  the expenses approved by Congress during the debates for the  approval of the last national budget.    The minister emphasized the "contradictory position" adopted  by these parties and said that, while proposing a constitutional  reform to allow a more smooth administration, they "prevent the  administration from governing the country, and paralyze the  Executive Branch."    After pointing out that despite the unfavorable  international  situation the national employment and salary indexes are  acceptable, the minister criticized the opposition's "refusal to  accept the government achievements, and their drastic attitude  in calling for an interpellation." The minister said this  attitude is motivated by political reasons.    Regarding the industrial area's situation, the minister  admitted that several industries are facing hard times, and said  that these difficulties are "normal in a process of  transformation."    He denied the need to protect the industries, and pointed  out  that Uruguay has the largest list of exceptions in the Mercosur  [Common Market of the South] customs fees reduction process, as  well as several mechanisms -- such as the minimum export prices,  reference prices, and a board to evaluate imported products --  to protect its industry. He said there are some 50 such  measures.    "No administration can guarantee economic welfare; this does  not exist. It is senseless and entirely absurd, in addition to  harmful, to ask the government to say which economic sector will  survive and which will not," he said.    He deemed the Chamber of Industries document analyzing the  situation of the industrial sector "slightly inconsistent." He  said the Chamber "criticizes the idea of reducing customs fees,  and says that this has not been reflected in the economy or  forced prices down, because the middlemen keep the difference.  If this were true, however, the industries would still have no  reason for concern, because any other effective protection is  similar to what we had previously."    He also refuted the assertion that the government is not  stimulating the productive sector. As an example, he said that  the tax exemption granted to the companies deemed of national  interest represents a $50 million to $60 million drop in  government revenue.</p>

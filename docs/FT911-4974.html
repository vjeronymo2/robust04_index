			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Beith admits middle incomes would be hit - Local income tax THE Liberal Democrats' proposals for a local income tax would mean higher bills for households with an income of more than Pounds 20,000, according to figures put out by the party yesterday. Introducing the party's plans, Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, acknowledged that if it had to increase the amount being raised from the poll tax this year, middle- and higher-income households, including many with two earners both on relatively modest wages, would pay more. 'What people hated most about the poll tax was that it was not related to ability to pay,' he said. 'Any reform of the poll tax system will lead to people generally on higher incomes paying more - we can't duck that.' On average, a Pounds 40,000-income household would pay just over Pounds 1,150 a year, compared with an average poll tax for two people of Pounds 504. Households with incomes below Pounds 5,000 would pay nothing. The range of tax rates in local areas goes from 1.8 per cent in Rochester to 5.2 per cent in Haringey. The party's calculations are based on an average rate of 3.3p in the pound, which Mr Beith defended against the estimate from Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, that an average rate of 'around four pence' would be needed. The tax would be deducted at a single rate, and adjusted at the end of each year. Where local authorities had spent above that rate, their residents would have to pay a further bill; where they had spent below it, residents would receive a refund. This national rate for levying the tax would be set high enough to entitle some 70-80 per cent of people to refunds.</p>

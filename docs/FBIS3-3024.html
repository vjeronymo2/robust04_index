			<p>Language: <F P=105>Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference held at the Information Center of the </F> Second Sessions of the Eighth National People's Congress and the  Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference in Beijing on 14 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Unidentified moderator] We have the honor to  invite six members and Standing Committee members of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National  Committee to the news conference today, entitled: Energetically  Develop Education, Science and Technology, and Cultural and Art  Undertakings in the Process of Establishing a Socialist Market  Economic Structure. They are renowned Chinese educators,  scientists, and artists: Jin Kaicheng, CPPCC National Committee  Standing Committee member, Jiusan Society Central Committee vice  chairman, and Beijing University Chinese Language Department  professor; Wu Zuqiang, CPPCC National Committee Standing  Committee member and former Central Conservatory of Music  president; Ye Danian, CPPCC National Committee Standing  Committee member, China Democratic League Central Committee  Standing Committee member, and Chinese Academy of Sciences  Geology Institute member and researcher; Zhang Kaixun, CPPCC  National Committee member, China Association for Promoting  Democracy Central Committee member, and Beijing Machinery  Industry and Automation Institute senior engineer; Zhao Yufen,  CPPCC National Committee member, Chinese Academy of Sciences  member, and Qinghua University professor; and Guan Dongsheng,  CPPCC National Committee member, Central University of  Nationalities professor, and calligrapher.    [(Wen Guangwei)] (Wen Guangwei), from the Central People's  Broadcasting Station. My question is directed to Standing  Committee member Jin Kaicheng: Respect for knowledge and  talented people is the key for developing scientific,  educational, and cultural undertakings. Would you please  discuss how this concept is being implemented in actual work?    [Jin] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has all along advocated respect  for knowledge and talented people. Through the efforts by  higher and lower levels and in all sectors since the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, this concept  has gradually taken root in society and has been translated in  various concrete actions. For example, the Teachers Law provides  that the whole society shall respect teachers. This is a  concrete expression of respecting knowledge and talented people  in the education sphere. Therefore, in my view, some progress  has indeed been made in implementing the concept in education.  However, I would like to call attention to a more noteworthy  phenomenon in society, that is, the demand for talented people  under circumstances of a market economy. The demand for  talented people has become very acute in some places, though it  has not become burning yet. In the light of this, I believe  that in the future, the concept of respecting knowledge and  talented people will be translated as the demand for knowledge  and talented people rather than the continued practice of  everyone eating from the same big pot. Meanwhile, the view of  talented people will be changed from a static and dynamic state.  At present, the acute demand for talented people is reflected  not nationwide, but only at certain points, such as the  Zhongguancun Single Trade Lane and village and township  enterprises in southern Jiangsu. However, I dare to predict  today that so long as China continues its reform, development,  and stability for a long time to come, the demand for talented  people will pervade the whole country. By that time, respect  for knowledge and talented people will no longer be an issue of  understanding; it will be guaranteed by an irresistible force.    [Reporter] Hong Kong WEN WEI PO reporter. What is the  government policy regarding to Hong Kong and Taiwan singers'  performance tours in the mainland this year?    [Wu Zuqiang] Quite a few singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan  performed in the mainland over the past few years. They exerted  some good influences, strengthened exchanges in music between  the two sides, and brought along new songs to the delight of  mainland music lovers. However, problems also cropped up in the  past two years. They were caused mainly by poor quality of some  performers and their mainland agents' sheer profit-seeking  approach, thus creating confusion and harmful consequences. For  this reason, the culture departments, at suggestions from the  masses, have recently examined the work related to Hong Kong and  Taiwan singers performance tours, and will work out more  effective and rational administrative measures. I believe  singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan will continue to stage  concerts and performance tours in the mainland in 1994, but I  hope such activities will be conducted through proper channels  and will exert healthy influence on music and society.    [Reporter] RENMIN ZHENGXIE BAO [PEOPLE'S POLITICAL  CONSULTATIVE NEWS]. My question is directed to member Guan  Dongsheng. As I understand it, in the current session, CPPCC  members have attached great importance to the development of  ethnic minority regions. As a University of Nationalities  professor, do you have any suggestions or opinions for  developing culture and education in ethnic minority regions?    [Guan] As is known to all, due to historical, social, and  geographical reasons, the overwhelming majority of China's  ethnic minority regions are lagging far behind the coastal  regions in terms of the overall development of economy,  education, and culture. The party and government have always  paid keen attention to the development of minority nationalities  regions. The 1990 CPC Central Committee Proposal Concerning the  Formulation of the 10-Year Program for National Economic and  Social Development and the Eighth Five- Year Plan stressed the  need to bring into full play the ethnic regions' advantages and  to appropriately combine the exploitation of their resources  with their social and economic development to gradually change  the relative economic backwardness of ethnic regions. Facts  have proved that the party's policy toward minority  nationalities implemented since the PRC's founding is entirely  correct and has withstood the tests of time. Premier Li Peng's  government work report to the current National People's Congress  [NPC] session further emphasized the need to put education in a  strategic position for priority development and to increase  funds for educational undertakings. Premier Li Peng also  suggested that governments at various levels cut back  expenditures in other areas and do everything possible to  achieve concrete results in developing education. All NPC  deputies and CPPCC members attending the current sessions  believe Premier Li Peng's suggestion reflects the fervent hope  of the Chinese people of all nationalities. They have called  upon leaders at all levels to guard against formalism and to  earnestly implement the suggestion to the letter. They have  also urged leaders to thoroughly understand the great  significance of developing education in ethnic regions and to  make an effort at training ethnic talented people and raising  the quality of ethnic work force. This is the only way for  invigorating ethnic regions' economy, and the cardinal principle  for safeguarding national unity and the motherland's unification  and for building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Moreover, it is necessary to proceed from reality in all things  and fully consider the minority nationalities regions' ethnic  characteristics in increasing funds for basic education in  ethnic regions and continuing to adopt feasible and flexible  methods in running schools -- such as bilingual education,  technical schools, and schools run by the coastal regions -- so  as to keep up with the demand for development in ethnic regions.  In my view, to achieve initial prosperity in ethnic regions, it  is necessary to first promote education.    [Reporter] ZHONGGUO RIBAO correspondent. My question is  directed to Ms. Zhao Yufen. The government has drawn up a new  program for developing higher education. Would you explain the  program's contents and your assessment?    [Zhao] The most formidable task facing the Education  Commission is called Project 211, a project for training  talented people. As you know, the world contest for national  strength today will ultimately be a contest for talented people.  China is aware of the great importance of training talented  people. Project 211 aims at building 100 key universities that  will reach the world's most advanced level in a number of  subjects within a short period of time. At present, many  schools of higher learning, including famous national and  provincial universities, are vying with each other to become one  of the 100 key universities. In view of the fierce competition  to be included in the project, many local governments have  financed various universities to set up joint campuses so that  each can best utilize its strong points to become a key  university. As a result, we have seen a trend for joint  management of schools of higher learning. The Chinese nation is  now endeavoring to build a great wall of talented people.  Project 211 is as significant as the Three Gorges Project.  This is the largest-scale project to train talented people in  Chinese history.    [Reporter] Hong Kong SING TAO DAILY correspondent. My  question is directed to Mr. Zhang Kaixun. How do you raise  funds for popularizing technological innovations? Were any  illicit means ever used in fund raising, such as in the Shen  Taifu case?    [Zhang] If the topic of a scientific research project is  directly related to the development of production or a common  need of the people's everyday lives, such as medicine and health  care, disaster prevention and control, and new scientific  instruments, the project can find manufacturers of related  fields as sponsors. We have recently developed a new medical  device which can accurately detect possible infant suffocation  during sleep. The need for such a device already existed before  we started planning the project. After we disclosed our idea to  relevant enterprises and organizations, they were certain that  their sponsorship for the project would succeed because it was a  demand of society for scientific innovation and they had the  responsibility to meet this demand. In this way, we have  effectively combined the wealth, enthusiasm, and wisdom of  society to jointly carry out the project. Therefore, it is not  difficult for us to raise funds for developing new technology.  We do not use Shen Taifu's method.    [Reporter] KEJI RIBAO [SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DAILY]  correspondent. My question is directed to member Ye Danian.  While deliberating the government work report, what is the  issue of utmost concern to CPPCC National Committee members?    [Ye] My experience from attending the past seven CPPCC  sessions shows that inadequate input is the issue of most  concern to members from science and technology circles, and it  has been discussed time and again. Members are encouraged by  the Scientific and Technological Progress Law, which will become  effective soon. However, they deplore the absence of provisions  in the law for a fixed input in science and technology during a  given period of time. They feel that even though funds for  science and technology have increased numerically, the increase  is off-set by price rises and the funds are insignificant.  Another issue is the policy of holding fast to one end and  leaving the whole field open. Members support this policy, but  hope it will be more specific and easy to be implemented.    [Reporter] China International Broadcasting Station  correspondent. As we understand it, there are many cultural  relics around the Three Gorges Dam area. The CPPCC National  Committee last year organized members for a tour of the area.  As I know, Wu Zuqiang was one of the members. Would member Wu  Zuqiang explain measures to protect cultural relics in the Three  Gorges Dam area?    [Wu] We visited many places with cultural relics. It was  our general impression that vigorous efforts should be made to  promptly preserve cultural relics while building the dam. We  are pleased that our findings have provided a positive impact to  the efforts to preserve cultural relics. For example, the Three  Gorges Construction Committee has set an unprecedented rule that  requires companies and organizations bidding for any project to  include provisions for protecting cultural relics into the terms  of contracts.    [Moderator] This is the end of the news conference. Thank  you.</p>

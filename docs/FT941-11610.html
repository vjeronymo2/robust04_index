			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Brent Walker seeks debt extension Cash flow problems at Brent Walker, the property and leisure group which underwent a financial restructuring in March 1992, have forced it to seek changes to its loan agreements. In a circular to holders of its variable rate notes, Brent Walker said amendments were needed because of the 'continued deterioration in its balance sheet position' and projected cashflows. It said net liabilities, Pounds 629.8m at June 30 last year, had risen again by the year end. The circular warned that all Brent Walker's shares, notes and warrants were 'extremely speculative' investments. The group is asking its bankers to extend a Pounds 68.9m working capital facility, due to expire on March 31 this year, until December 31 1997. Further, it is seeking to extend the period when it can make interest payments on its Pounds 827m term loan and its notes in preference shares rather than cash from the end of 1995 to the end of 1997. Brent Walker had hoped that by 1996 it would be producing sufficient cash flow from its pubs and betting shop chains to start paying interest in cash. Other changes include setting up a Pounds 10m 'solvency support arrangement' for trade creditors. Brent Walker said that a majority of the term loan lenders had agreed in principle to the changes, and it expected to have the amendments completed by February 28. A meeting for holders of the notes, which were issued in part exchange for convertible bonds under the 1992 restructuring, has been called on February 25. The quorum is high at two-thirds of the value of the notes in issue, and the resolution to approve changes will need a three-quarters majority. Noteholders include some of Brent Walker's banks; Lonrho, the trading company; Jefferson Smurfit, the paper and packaging group, and its head Dr Michael Smurfit. Brent Walker is keen to finalise the changes before the March 1 deadline for refinancing the Pounds 350m loan secured on its William Hill betting shop business.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys by </F> Gintaras Vinickas in Vilnius; date not given: "Povilas Gylys:  `Success Always Has Many Parents'"]    [Text] A few days have passed since Lithuania expressed  its desire to be admitted to NATO. What has been the  international reaction? Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas  Gylys has answered this and other questions from our  correspondent.    [Gylys] Reaction has been coming in from all sides: We have  responses from our neighboring Estonians and Latvians, and from  Russia. I would say that they are normal.    I think that our desire was unexpected to many countries,  even though we have maintained close contacts with NATO. Last  spring, I met with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner.  Recently, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius visited the  NATO headquarters. Our president has been corresponding with  the secretary general. We have also expressed our position on  NATO at its Cooperation Council and the CSCE forum. I have  detailed our stand to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  during his meeting with the Baltic foreign ministers in Riga.    The reaction from the Baltic states is slightly different.  Estonia's response is more reserved. By the way, the Baltic  states were informed about our move in advance.    I would like to say that Russia could also contribute to the  creation of a new security system in Europe. This will become  possible when democratic tendencies win once and for all in  Russia.    Adopting this decision, Lithuania followed its interests of  national security. This decision is not directed against  anyone. We are moving into an era of nonconfrontational politics.    [Vinickas] We have heard some voices claiming that the  expressed desire to join NATO is the opposition's  accomplishment. Could you comment on this?    [Gylys] It is said that success always has many parents,  while failures are orphans.    I do not deny the opposition's contribution, but I remind  everyone that the joint Seimas [parliament] resolution on  foreign policy issues was supported by the votes of the  Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction. It is then  that the president was advised to apply for NATO membership.    The LDDP leadership considered this issue thoroughly for a  long time. Our stand was as follows: Lithuania should  participate in international security structures.    I admit that the opposition and the ruling force must look  for common interests, if this is possible, and seek a consensus.  However, the statements that, for example, all moves of the  opposition are positive, while those of the government are  correct only due to pressure, do not enlarge our possibilities  to conduct a national foreign policy, as our opponents say. I  see a contradiction between the urge to conduct such a policy  and a completely negative reaction to our each move which the  opposition approves.    [Vinickas] It is understandable that joining NATO is a  process. In your opinion, when will it be possible to find out  whether NATO approves of this process?    [Gylys] I would note that it was important to us to state  our  position.    I think that the NATO summit will discuss its future  strategy  and place in the contemporary world.    The rapprochement between NATO and Central and Eastern  Europe  should be mutual. NATO must make up its mind concerning its  approach to Eastern and Central Europe: It would either adhere  to old and tougher principles or lower the crossbar slightly and  speed up the process of integration in creating a common  European security system. Western politicians say that they  would not like to create conditions for a recurrence of  confronting blocs.    We could also speak about our preparedness. Lithuania's  current military budget is "transparent." On the other hand, we  must achieve public control of our military structures, because  such demands are being put on us.    I would confirm that the movement toward NATO is an  evolutionary process. We could only ask whether this evolution  would be intensified. This does not depend on Lithuania alone.    One is often left with the impression that some Lithuanian  politicians believe that foreign policy is conducted as if of  its own volition. However, this is not the case. As an  imposing organization, NATO understands its dilemmas and is  aware of its responsibility to preserve peace on the continent.    [Vinickas] Thank you for the interview.</p>

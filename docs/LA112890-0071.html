			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> U.S. Stepping Up Investigation: Federal engineers are stepping up an  investigation of reported seat belt failures in 1984 and 1985 Ford Mustang  automobiles, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced. The  NTSB said it had upgraded the probe from a preliminary evaluation -- an  examination of paper work -- to an engineering analysis, in which engineers  will study the possibly defective parts. The agency said there had been 21  complaints of plastic components in the seat belt buckles breaking, preventing  the belt from being able to be latched.  </P></p>

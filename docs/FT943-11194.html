			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Patience of multimedia investors sorely tried by research findings Providers of interactive television services will have to wait until the early years of the next century to see a return on their investment, according to estimates by Ovum, a London-based consultancy specialising in information technology. It says that interactive television, which many believe is poised to become the domestic face of multimedia, will generate revenues of Dollars 7bn in 2000 in the US and Europe, representing about 26 per cent of all revenues from multimedia in the home and four per cent of total household expenditure on consumer electronics. It points out, however, that the costs of providing products and services for interactive television will rise from slightly more than Dollars 1bn in 1994 to Dollars 24bn in 2005: 'Costs will be higher than revenues from subscriptions in the early years of deployment. The market will become cash-positive around 2002; until then, other sources of revenue such as advertising will be required.' Interactive television differs from the traditional variety in the freedom it affords viewers to control what and when they watch. Technically, it demands a network server capable of storing and delivering large amounts of information, a set-top box to control the programme, and a two-way transmission channel between the two. Ovum suggest the most popular services are likely to be near-video-on-demand (nvod): a choice of, say, 20 top movies; the ability to take part in games and opinion polls; control over the angle from which customers view sports and games; and home shopping. The concept of a two-way tv service has, however, existed for at least two decades. Current interest is being driven by technological advances which enable low cost distribution of digitised information, competition between telephone and cable companies, and political initiatives by leaders who see interactive services as a key to economic recovery. Interactive television is not, Ovum points out, the information superhighway: 'It is an extension of the existing cable and direct broadcast satellite markets.' Ovum sees developmental phases beginning with today's test of the technology leading to full service provision by 2005 when video telephones will be integrated with the tv set and teleconferences, interactive games and communication between subscribers will all be possible. The winners will be the customers who will have a broader range of services to choose from, the content owners (studios and picture libraries), creators of new programming and hardware suppliers. The principal losers, Ovum reckons, will be existing video distribution channels - video rental outlets and cinema chains.

			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: MOVIE SEEMS TO SIGNAL THAT MOST OF US YEARN FOR A CHANCE TO  DREAM  </P> <P> When we got home from a late evening out recently, we found a note in our front  door and, with it, a $20 bill. It was from a neighbor friend who would be  embarrassed if I used his name. That kind of generosity doesn't seek  recognition.  </P> <P> The note said that he and his family had just seen the movie "Field of Dreams,"  and he wanted us to see it so badly that he would pop for the admission.  "Please go," he wrote, and he signed the note, "One who still dreams."  </P> <P> We went on a Monday night. We had tried to go earlier but the line extended for  several blocks, so we gave up. There was a line on Monday, too, but it was  shorter so we stuck it out. And our friend was right.  </P> <P> "Field of Dreams" is about a young Iowa farmer who is frightened that he will  live his life out as his father did -- without dreams and, finally, without  hope. So when a dream is thrust before him, he follows it, even though it seems  wrong-headed and absurd to the practical people in his community.  </P> <P> Much has been written about the movie, and I don't intend to add to that here.  What fascinated me as I came out of the theater was not so much the message of  the film as the message of the people who are lining up to see it. They are  saying -- it seems to me -- loud and clear: "We want to dream, too. And just  give us half a chance, and we will."  </P> <P> These are people who live daily with public officials who cheat and lie, with  random killings, with shrill and clamoring pressure groups, with violence to  mind and body and soul, with a national pragmatism that says, "Get yours before  somebody else gets you." The ultimate dream in that society, I suppose, is the  $10-million lottery ticket -- the only dream left to many of our poor who see  no other way out of poverty and are thus eager to be exploited.  </P> <P> It's so easy living in the midst of this to assume that we've all been  corrupted in these same ways. That even if we don't support it, we silently  condone driving off our homeless, refusing care for our sick, withdrawing basic  rights from fellow citizens whose color or race or life style frightens us,  dealing with public issues through paranoia instead of reason, regarding  kindness and selflessness as weakness instead of strength. So easy to make such  assumptions.  </P> <P> Waiting for "Field of Dreams" to start the other night, we watched five  trailers for upcoming movies based on those assumptions. Four of them were  packed with violence -- wall-to-wall destruction of other human beings,  physically and psychically. Cynical commercial statements that this is what the  American public wants to see. Without question, watching vicarious violence is  one way of taking out our frustrations over the growing conviction that things  are not going well and we can't do much, if anything, about it. But it isn't  the only -- and certainly not the best -- way.  </P> <P> Those lines around the block to see "Field of Dreams" offer a very different  option. Those lines say to me that the soul-juice hasn't yet been squeezed out  of every American, and that there are a whole hell of a lot of us who still  dream and will leap at every chance.  </P> <P> "Field of Dreams" is giving us that chance. It isn't a great movie, but the  message is clear and sharp and welcome, and right now it's the only game in  town. Maybe some of the people who make commercial entertainment will get the  message. Maybe those who don't are incapable of making a film like this.  </P> <P> But I think there is a more important message to be drawn from "Field of  Dreams," perhaps an extension of what the movie has to say. And that message is  the real nature of dreaming -- and the dreamer. We have been taught by the  pragmatists in our midst that dreams are gauzy and impractical, and that  dreamers are people who have abdicated the real world to hide in their own  fantasies.  </P> <P> All of us, dreamers and non-dreamers alike, have to live in that real world and  deal with it reasonably effectively to survive. But the dreamer doesn't just  survive. He lives. And only in those dreams can he draw on the real and  enduring strength that matters.  </P> <P> I have over my desk a postcard my youngest daughter sent me from a trip several  years ago. It carried a casual message, and I'm sure she didn't see it as  portentous when she picked it out. But I'm also sure that something stirred in  her as it does in me each time I look at it. The drawing shows a man in his  bathrobe sitting on the peak of the roof of his house with a cup of coffee  watching a sunrise. And dreaming.  </P> <P> Baseball was an absolutely right symbol to convey this message in "Field of  Dreams" because it combines the pragmatic and the mystical in such delicate  balance. The friend who sent us to this movie understands that -- and he knew  we would, too. We thank him -- and we thank all those other dreamers who stood  in line with us.  </P></p>

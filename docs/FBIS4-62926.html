			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Olga Musafirova report under the rubric "Parliamentary High </F> Emotion": "Red Renaissance Advances in Free Ukraine"]    [Text] The opening of the new parliamentary session was  honored by the presence of the president. Dressed in a white  suit and looking very anxious, he did not congratulate the newly  elected deputies on the start of their work -- a rare, even  unique case in world practice of breaching the civilities of  protocol.    Instead, President Kravchuk conveyed a special message to  the  Supreme Council.    The president demanded that they deal with him precisely in  accordance with the law. Otherwise -- and Leonid Makarovich  remains opposed to an early presidential election in June  despite the lists of signatures of 100,000 supporters from  various oblasts of Ukraine essential for his participation in  the procedure -- as the message said, there could simply be  "confrontation, with serious consequences putting peace in  Ukraine at risk." Is it necessary to specify that the prepared  documents demanded by Kravchuk -- a law on the status of the  president and a new constitution -- do dot actually exist?    This kind of crisis has a long history and indeed was one of  the reasons for the premature relinquishment of deputies' seats.  The kolkhoz chairmen, long-standing dissidents, party  secretaries, and poets who declared Ukraine's independence on 1  December 1990 were able to do a lot, but they failed in the  fundamental job of creating a rational legislative basis for the  sovereign state. They hoped to be replaced by the professionals  of the "state renaissance" stage, whose advent the president  referred to several times -- liberal, market-oriented lawyers  and jurists would arrive and parliament would at last be abuzz  with the sound of intellectual labor. However, the election  law, which again assigned the major role in nominating  candidates to labor collectives rather than parties, led to a  quite different work force in the Supreme Council -- a big  contingent of pro-communist engineers and technical personnel.    It was no wonder that Aleksandr Moroz, chairman of the  Socialist Party of Ukraine Political Council (he is down to  become speaker, but Moroz himself hopes to become president in  June), should make clear promises at a May Day rally, as scarlet  banners flapped in the breeze: "We must change the authorities  in the state! We must adopt a law to ensure that the president  is elected in the Supreme Council rather than by direct ballot!"  Party discipline is a daunting thing, especially when one in  five of the people's elected representatives is a Communist.    Deputies were given a 1 July deadline to clarify their  working relationship with the Supreme Council (the majority want  to retain their posts and salaries at local level). If by 1  July the country sees the advent of socialism at working people'  request, such job-sharing will become feasible.    But for the time being everything is taking its own course.  President Kravchuk has flown to Donetsk in the hope of winning  round the miners. They once insisted on an early presidential  election and consequently could do the same again. Many  ministers, including the acting premier, have moved from the  government benches in parliament to sit in the body of the hall  as ordinary deputies.    In a country where laws have an arbitrary interpretation,  only one, unwritten, law is operating smoothly: The ladies and  gentlemen are unfailingly turning themselves into comrades...</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (11): Safety first is best advice abroad - Jim Kelly gives some hints on how to cope with a growing problem GOOD ADVICE on personal safety can do a lot for the average business traveller: it can preserve your health, save you money and protect your deal. And in rare circumstances, it can save your life. 'One of our executives was involved in a hijack and found himself confronting a terrorist,' recalls the head of security at a global multinational. 'Later he told me: 'I suddenly remembered what you had said. The words DON'T STARE HIM OUT flashed before me. I dropped my eyes'.' For most business travellers the dangers are more mundane - and so is the advice. The same security expert who trained his executive in how to handle a violent hijacker has some more earthy advice for those travelling abroad. 'I tell them to behave as if they are on holiday with their bank manager, their doctor, their boss and their mother-in-law.' That advice, modified by the fact that 23 per cent of all business travellers are women, boils down to a plea for normal behaviour. But normal behaviour is not always enough. Here is a checklist of useful hints. But every trip is different, so think about problems that may arise and take advice before setting out. Dress down. If you don't need a business suit, then don't take one. Don't travel with company logos emblazoned on your briefcases, etc. If finance allows, stay on the executive floor if the hotel has one. Go for an hotel with valet parking and card keys. On-site restaurants may be useful in some cities. Never hang a 'Please clean my room' sign on the door] Be guided on airlines. Think about regional tensions. If in doubt, take the national carrier out of any country with internal problems. Try to take direct flights. Don't wear conspicuous jewellery, watches, etc. If you are really worried, shop around and find a business travel agent with a 'meet and greet' service. Be guided by your host. At least, give yourself time to become acclimatised before any adventurous outings. Learn something about local customs. Try to find out specific areas of national reverence, both religious and political. Find out if taxis hailed in the street are safe. It may be better to get one from an hotel. Try to avoid taking close-up pictures of people without their consent. Read about your destination, especially in up-to-date newspaper coverage, prior to the visit. Do not discuss your travel plans with strangers. When travelling to a new country for the first time, it is extremely helpful to get some kind of briefing on the kind of environment in which you are likely to have to do business. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office publishes 'Dos and Don'ts' on many countries. It also gives verbal briefings on request - these may be over the telephone or in person - although the Department of Trade and Industry also gives advice on doing business abroad. The US government also has an information system which is normally restricted to its own citizens. However, the State Department's Citizens' Emergency Centre in Washington is open to all callers and producers Travel Info Sheets on every country in the world. This service can be accessed by ringing Washington 647 5225. (Beware: to trigger the correct sheet the first four letters of the country must be punched out on a digital phone. On US phones ABC = 2 and so on, until PQRS = 7, TUV = 8, and WXYZ = 9). Both the Foreign Office and the US State Department information is regularly updated. You can, of course, pay for security advice. The Control Risks Group has an information services division which publishes a Travel Security Guide, available on screen as well as in hard copy. It grades various destinations by safety category and tailors advice for the traveller. On the principle that information improves security, up-to-date guide books on the country of destination are helpful. More practically, considering the pressures on the average executive, an airport guide is the best way of getting off on the right foot. Thomas Cook's Airports Guide International is a good example: with plenty of information on hotel services, road and rail links. Pan Books' The Flier's Handbook is good for the regular traveller. The most difficult task facing a business traveller on a trip to a strange country is the need to keep a sense of proportion. On the day after the Gulf War started, for example, some internal European flights were almost empty. Some locations reach world attention through headline stories which do not reflect everyday working life. In contrast, dangerous destinations can appear innocuous. The recent incidence of lethal attacks in Florida, for example, should be seen against the fact that living there is still more dangerous than visiting the state. In 1992 1.8 per cent of all homicide victims were foreigners. As a spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office points out, the number of business travellers mugged each year abroad is 'very few'. Last year Britons made 31m visits overseas and there were 25 reported homicides. Part of the problem for many business travellers from Europe and North America is that they are often moving from a 'low crime' environment into a 'high crime' one. Because businessmen are usually well-insured and will probably want to return home promptly, crimes in which they are the victims are less often resolved that those concerning other tourists since the key witness may already be out of the country when the criminal is caught. There is a marked trend among business travel agents towards 'partnership' with the client company and this can only improve the services offered to travellers on arrival at their destination. A good example is Wagons-lits Travel which offers a 'meet and greet' service in Lagos and Moscow: and in the latter a taxi service with security cleared drivers. In the travel trade generally there is agreement that more travel information is needed. Who provides it is a more difficult question. Many travel agents and airlines are wary about giving advice: they fear legal liability either by omitting key information or including out-of-date or faulty advice. Business Travel World, the new trade magazine, recently canvassed the views of agents about the updating of safety information and the responsibility for providing it. The magazine concluded: 'Comments tend to reveal that agents in continental Europe are more anxious for action than are their counterparts in the UK.' For example Mr Jan Van Steen, of BBL Travel, Brussels, secretary of the Belgian Guild of European Business Travel Agents, says: 'It's not enough to read all the newspapers. On a national and international level, more exact information is needed.'</p>

Then on Aug. 27, Fox will inaugurate a new season of its  top-rated show, "Married . . . With Children," in its new 9 p.m. time period,  and also will debut "Open House," a new incarnation of Fox's "Duet," at 9:30  p.m.  </P> <P> Fox already had said it will present some new programming in July. On July 9,  Fox will launch a new series, "Totally Hidden Video," for a six-week run. And  it will air the much-publicized "Cops in Russia" episode Saturday, July 15 at 8  p.m., with fresh episodes of the "Cops" series beginning the following week and  continuing through the summer.

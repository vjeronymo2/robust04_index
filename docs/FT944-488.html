			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / ITT sells financial units for Dollars 3.7bn: Break-up speculation as Deutsche Bank and Norwest buy commercial finance and consumer lending arms ITT, the US conglomerate, is selling two of its financial services businesses for Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.3bn) to fund its expansion in the leisure and entertainment industries. The two units - ITT Commercial Finance and the consumer lending operation Island Finance - are being bought by the German banking group Deutsche Bank and the US banking group Norwest, respectively. ITT says it is near to completing the sale of another part of ITT Financial, including property services and small business finance, to an unnamed buyer for Dollars 1.8bn. The company said the remaining 25 per cent of ITT Financial - the reinsurance business - will be sold shortly. After debts, ITT expects that between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 3.5bn will be raised from the sales of the four parts of ITT Financial. The money will be used to finance acquisitions in the hotels, leisure and entertainment industries, and while ITT would not comment on its next move, the company is believed to be interested in acquiring a US broadcast television network. Although ITT has made clear its ambitions in leisure and entertainment (it already owns the Sheraton hotel chain, it is awaiting regulatory clearance for its recent Dollars 1.1bn purchase of the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment group, and a week ago it agreed to pay Dollars 1.7bn for the Caesars World gaming group) the company denied reports that ITT's aggressive expansion meant it was preparing to divest its other two main businesses, insurance and manufactured products. Analysts, however, believe that ITT may be considering breaking up the three main operations - hotels, leisure and entertainment (which has sales of Dollars 6bn), insurance (Dollars 10.5bn sales), and manufacturing (Dollars 8bn sales) - and floating them on the stock market as separate companies. Analysts believe the three units could be sold to the public for as much as Dollars 15bn, or Dollars 130 a share. ITT would not comment on reports of a planned break-up, but said that it was keeping its options open. Yesterday, news of the various deals involving ITT Financial and speculation about a break-up lifted ITT's share price to Dollars 88 1/8 up Dollars 4 3/8 at the close in New York. The bigger of yesterday's two deals was the Dollars 3.1bn acquisition of ITT Commercial Finance by Deutsche Bank North America, the US subsidiary of the German banking group. The acquisition, which is part of Deutsche Bank's programme of internationalising its activities as well as diversifying its financial services operations, 'will accelerate DBNA's strategy to become a leader in the rapidly growing business of asset-based lending', said Mr John Rolls, DBNA president and chief executive. After the deal is completed, DBNA's portfolio of asset-based lending will be worth more than Dollars 5bn. Through acquiring the ITT unit, Deutsche Bank believes it will also win greater access to commercial finance markets in North America, Canada and south-east Asia, 'regions which are becoming increasingly important particularly for our strategy', according to the company. Deutsche Bank has been expanding its banking and investment activities outside Germany and Europe recently. Last October it moved the investment side of its activities to London, while it has already established 40 subsidiaries in south-east Asia. In the other deal, the Minnesota-based bank, Norwest, paid about Dollars 595m for Island Finance, ITT's Caribbean and Central American consumer finance operations. Island Finance's main business is making small loans to individuals in Puerto Rico, Panama, and the Caribbean Islands.</p>

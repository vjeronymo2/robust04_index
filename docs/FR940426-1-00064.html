While the Department of Defense has traditionally by regulation required members to pay their just financial obligations, no mechanism previously existed to enforce payments of just debts with the exception of payments owned for child or spousal support. The proposed revision of Department of Defense Directive 1344.9 (32 CFR part 50) establishes a program for involuntary allotments to require members to pay their just debts. The impact to the government of this legislation is much greater than to the public. The Department of Defense must hire additional personnel to process and review applications, as well as incur administrative processing costs (e.g., mailing, record keeping, xeroxing, and providing of processing forms). Additionally, the program will require personnel time in the form of review and providing assistance (e.g., military legal assistance) to members against whom an application for involuntary allotment is pending. The cost to the applicant for an involuntary allotment against a member's pay will be minimal in terms of time and money. The applicant will have to provide information which should already be in the applicant's possession, incur postage costs, and expend approximately 15 minutes completing the application form. In return for their effort, applicants with enforceable claims will be entitled to receive from the military member an involuntary allotment of pay on a monthly basis towards satisfaction of the judgment debt owed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments on this proposed rule must be received by June 27, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Forward comments to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), Requirements and Resources, Legal Policy, room 4C763, 4000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;4000. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Major Alan L. Cook, (703) 697&hyph;3387. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix A to 32 CFR part 50 requires the use of two forms. The first form is an involuntary allotment application. Use of a standard form is required because the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1994 require a determination by competent military or executive authority that the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction giving rise to the involuntary allotment application complies with the requirements of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act. Additionally, in order to ensure due process for involuntary allotment applications, several certifications and acknowledgements are required by the applicant. In the absence of a standardized form, the cost to the government of reviewing non-standard forms for compliance would be unfairly burdensome in comparison to the minimum cost to an applicant of obtaining and using a standard form to make application. Furthermore, use of a standard form saves the applicant time and money by not requiring the applicant to obtain a copy of the Department of Defense Directive and reading it in order to ensure proper submission of information to obtain an involuntary allotment. The second form for involuntary allotment notice and processing creates a standardized methodology within the Department of Defense, to include the Military Departments, to ensure uniform processing procedures. This saves both time and money for the review authorities. Both forms are in the process of development. However, their basic contents and requirements are clearly delineated in appendix A to 32 CFR part 50. It has been determined that 32 CFR part 50 is not a significant regulation action. The rule does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. It has also been determined that this rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because it will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary financial effect on administering the rule will be a reduction in administrative costs and other burdens resulting from the simplification and clarification of certain policies. Finally, it has been determined that 32 CFR part 50 may impose reporting or record keeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520) and that the paperwork reduction process is under review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 32 CFR Parts 43a and 50 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Claims, Credit, Military personnel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 301, title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations, chapter I, subchapter C, is proposed to be amended to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 43A_[REMOVED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

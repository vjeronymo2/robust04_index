			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Personal View: Life's rich rewards When people think about the UK social security system, they think of a more-or-less efficient 'Robin Hood' device for moving money from rich to poor. Yet that is not the only or even the main effect of social security. Today's 50th anniversary of the Beveridge Report on 'Social insurance and allied services' is a good moment to reflect on the other main effect - redistribution not between people, but across the same person's life cycle. For Lord Beveridge the aim was to achieve a 'better distribution of purchasing power . . . as between times of earning and not earning, and between times of heavy family responsibilities and light or no family responsibilities'. In other words, we all pay into the system through taxes or contributions at times when we can afford to, but get something out at times when income is low relative to the rest of our lives. This 'smoothing out' of the ups and downs of income over the life cycle happens in two ways. First, through the insurance aspect of social security; we all pay in, but only some of us suffer unemployment which the insurance covers. Second, through a savings bank mechanism; we pay in during our working lives, and receive pensions later. If the system works well, poverty is reduced across the lifetime - what we each pay in equals what we each take out. Indeed, Beveridge suggested that poverty could be eliminated by redistribution within the working class, with no net transfer from the middle classes. Given that social security serves both 'Beveridge' and 'Robin Hood' aims, how can we tell which is more important? Here, there is a problem. Government surveys tell us how much people pay in tax, and how much they receive from different kinds of social security. But these surveys are just a snapshot of a single year. Relatively poor pensioners will be receiving more from social security than they pay in tax. Relatively well-off people in work will be paying more in tax. But this gives us little clue as to whether - looking across complete lifetimes - people pay for their own benefits or end up as net gainers or losers. Even if we had a survey following the same individuals since 1900 - which we do not - we would only get information about the overlay of changing tax and social security systems through which they had lived. It would not answer questions about the lifetime effects of today's systems. To answer such questions the London School of Economics has devised a computer simulation of the complete life histories of 2,000 men and 2,000 women. These people live their entire lives under conditions as they were in the UK in 1985. For instance, the proportion going to university reflects the proportions of 18 and 19-year-olds who did so in 1985. Wage levels for a given age and qualifications reflect the range in 1985. The 4,000 people in our computer simulation are a better educated lot than the actual 1985 workforce, with 17 per cent having been to university or polytechnic. They also live to an average age of 75. But other features of the 4,000 are more alarming. A third divorce and 37 per cent of women become single parents, an important factor in lowering living standards. On the basis of family circumstances and incomes in every year of their lives, we can calculate how much income tax each pays, how much they receive from child benefit, the state pension, etc. This enables us to tot up lifetime gains and losses from the welfare state. The model is still being developed, but the preliminary results are fascinating. On average, each of the 4,000 receives more than Pounds 60,000 (at 1985 prices) from the social security system over their lifetimes. Between 55 per cent and 65 per cent of these receipts represent returns to the same individuals of amounts they themselves have paid for. The exact proportion depends on benefits assumed to be financed by income tax and national insurance or from a share of general tax revenues, including VAT. Less than half of the Pounds 60,000 represents money moved between different people. This suggests that the 'savings bank' side of social security is, if anything, more important than the more commonly discussed Robin Hood aspect. Should this worry us? Not necessarily. A prime motive for Beveridge's idea of 'national' insurance was the failure of the market to deliver cost-effective insurance and pension coverage for all. A particular concern, for instance, was the door-to-door sale of insurance contracts to poor families. Under this system, most of the premiums disappeared in selling costs. There are good economic reasons why insurance markets may still 'fail'. We may also think it wrong for people to suffer in old age the consequences of decisions made when they were younger. 'Life cycle redistribution' is a rational aim of a state social security system. Beveridge might not recognise the details of today's system, but he would certainly not allow us to forget this aim.

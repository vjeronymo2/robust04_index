			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Channel 5 contender pulls out EDINBURGH-based Channel S Television yesterday abandoned plans to bid to operate the Channel 5 terrestrial television network, two weeks before the bid deadline, blaming uncertainty about costs. The contractor for Channel 5 will have to pay for the retuning of about 3m video recorders to prevent interference from the new channel. The costs of retuning video recorders accounts for about Pounds 50m of the Pounds 200m estimated overall cost of launching the channel. Mr Justin Dukes, former managing director of Channel 4 and in charge of the Channel S plans to bid for Channel 5, said that the retuning costs 'cannot be precisely predicted'. He added that cost estimates 'have taken the business from being possible to, in our opinion, an impossible one'. The two remaining serious contenders are the Entertainment Channel - a consortium of Time Warner, TV-am and the Daily Telegraph group - and the Five TV group, which includes Thames TV, Sony Pictures International and Canwest Global Communications, a Canadian-based international broadcaster.</p>

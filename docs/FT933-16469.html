			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Still waiting at the G7 table BEING A WORLD leader may, at times, be a hazardous and taxing business but it also has its compensations. One such perk, available only to the top seven developed country premiers, is the right to attend the annual meeting of leaders of the group of seven industrialised countries. For G7 summits, while often un-productive in terms of tangible decisions reached, are never short on pomp and circumstance. Next week's gathering in Tokyo is unlikely to be an exception - on either score. Yet G7 summits cannot be ignored. For the richest seven countries together account for about half the world's income and purchase nearly half of developing country exports. The policy decisions they may or may not make, either individually or collectively, will have a profound influence on economic prospects of the countries beyond their shores. So the rest of world is right to pay attention. G7 economic growth affects most things. It determines the volume of trade these seven countries conduct with the rest of the developed and developing world and it influences the commodity prices at which much of this trade occurs. It also determines the extent to which populations will tolerate trade flows, or whether they will embrace protectionism. On growth, the outlook remains bleak, as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development pointed put in its latest half-yearly report. The OECD expects G7 output to grow by a meagre 1.3 per cent this year, down from 1.6 per cent in 1992. G7 import growth is expected to slow to 3.3 per cent from 5.1 per cent last year. Downside risks Next year should be better, at least according to the OECD's statistics. G7 growth is expected to accelerate to 2.8 per cent. But the authors of the OECD report are sceptical, not surprisingly after three years of predicting recoveries which have failed to materialise. 'A general pick-up of activity across the OECD area is still some way off,' they write, pointing to four downside risks to the forecast, all of which have some bearing on the proceedings at next week's summit. First, those G7 countries which have been able substantially to cut interest rates - notably the US and Japan - remain dogged by heavy debts and depressed confidence and may not deliver growth next year of 3 per cent or more upon which the OECD forecast depends. The Japanese economy, despite feeling the stimulus of a substantial easing of fiscal policy, a royal wedding and now a G7 summit, shows no sign of taking-off. Meanwhile, yesterday's news from the US that manufacturing employment fell by 53,000 last month, and that total employment rose by only 13,000 against expectations of a rise of 139,000, confirms recent indications that the US recovery is faltering again. Pressure for further Japanese interest rate cuts will certainly be part of the American lobbying for more growth-friendly G7 policies, but for the US the evidence does not suggest that low interest rates are enough. Interest rates The second, and more serious, risk is that continental Europe will not even have the chance to discover whether low interest rates will do the trick for them. For, as the OECD points out, European interest rates remain much higher than warranted by domestic economic conditions. This week's half point cut in the German interest rate floor allowed Europe a little room for manoeuvre, which the increasingly daring Banque de France immediately gobbled up by again pushing its intervention rate below the Bundesbank's discount rate. Yet central bank rivalry aside, neither can claim to be defending anything other than an increasingly vulnerable currency given the depressed states of their respective economies. What the G7 and the world desperately need is either a decisive German rate cut of at least two percentage points or a political deal to release Europe's economies from Bundesbank control. There is no sign of either. The third OECD concern is that the beneficial effects on long-term interest rates of fiscal consolidation in the US, Germany, UK and Italy may be offset by the short-term effects on demand. This seems esoteric given the generally paltry scale of these fiscal measures. The more important risk is that the cuts in structural budget deficits will come too slowly, if at all, leaving long-term interest rates painfully high and thus cancelling out the beneficial effects of aid from the G7 to the developing world over the next few years. But the OECD's final concern is probably the most serious: that US and European fretting about Japan's trade surplus, combined with slow or no growth, will finally abort the Uruguay round of trade talks and usher in an era of protectionism from which everyone, but particularly the developing world, will lose. If they take steps to avoid this prospect, the G7 leaders can be indulged in their sake drinking and noodle slurping. If they do not, then it will be at Tokyo that the G7 failed the world.</p>

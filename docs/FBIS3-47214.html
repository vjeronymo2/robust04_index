			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- The government will not  separate a consumption tax hike from an income tax cut to be  included in the new economic stimulus package, Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [11 January].    "That's not possible," Fujii told a regular press conference  after the morning cabinet meeting.    He was referring to reported comments Monday by a senior  government official hinting at an economic package including  only an income tax cut in view of the strong opposition by the  Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] to a consumption  tax increase.    The SDPJ, the largest party in the coalition government,  decided Monday to set up an action group to call for a large  income tax cut without increasing the rate of the consumption  tax, now standing at 3 percent.    Fujii also strongly rejected the government official's  remarks that a November report by the Tax Commission, an  advisory panel to the prime minister, proposing an income tax  cut and a consumption tax hike in a single program, could be  reviewed.    The finance minister stressed that Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa has vowed to "respect the tax panel's report" and this  is publicly recognized.    Concerning the timing of the new pump-primer, Fujii  reiterated that the Economic Planning Agency is working to have  it ready by around mid-January as instructed by Hosokawa.    In press remarks earlier this week, Fujii indicated the  government may launch the package on schedule even without  including the tax cut, saying "inclusion of a tax cut was  unclear" in Hosokawa's instructions.    Turning to the budget, Fujii said the Finance Ministry has  never mentioned any intention of compiling a 15-month budget for  fiscal 1994, as rumored in some quarters.    He said the ministry just intends to handle a third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the fiscal 1994 budget  together.</p>

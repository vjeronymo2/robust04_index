			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the February 1993 proposal, EPA indicated that it planned to make several changes to the method used to develop the complex model. As discussed in that proposal and in the RIA, fuels can be characterized in terms of a number of different sets of fuel parameters. EPA used the results of individual fuel studies and its public workshops to select the set of fuel parameters used to model exhaust emissions in its February 1993 proposal. At that time, the Agency indicated that it might alter its choice of parameters to represent gasoline distillation characteristics from a temperature basis (using T50 and T90) to a percent evaporated basis (using E200 and E300, the percentage of the fuel's volume that evaporates when heated to 200 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F and 300 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F, respectively). For reasons outlined in the February 1993 NPRM and section IV.A of the RIA, EPA has chosen to make this change and has converted its exhaust emission models to a percent evaporated basis since the NPRM was issued, removing the T50 and T90 terms from its models in the process. The Auto/Oil Heavy Hydrocarbon and EPA Phase II Reformulated Gasoline Test Program studies have been added to the complex model database. Finally, EPA has changed the confidence level required to permit terms to remain in the model to 90 percent, in keeping with the approach used in developing the simple model. The Agency was not able to determine the influence of the type of aromatic compounds in fuels, specifically heavy aromatics, on exhaust emissions, and hence such terms have not been included in the complex model at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because vehicles can have different emission control systems, the Agency anticipated that fuel modifications would have different emission effects on different types of cars. To account for these differences, EPA's February 1993 proposal divided vehicles into two ``emitter classes'' (normal and higher emitters) based on their exhaust emission levels. EPA then subdivided vehicles in each emitter class into ``technology groups'' based on the emission control technology with which each vehicle was equipped. However, as discussed in the NPRM, EPA was concerned that technology group distinctions among higher emitters might not be appropriate, since such vehicles' high level of emissions indicated that their emission control systems were not functioning properly. In addition, the limited quantity of data for higher emitters made it difficult to identify genuine differences in emissions response between higher emitters of different technology groups. Many commenters expressed similar concerns. Hence the model promulgated today does not divide higher emitters into technology group categories but retains such distinctions when analyzing normal emitters. In response to numerous comments, EPA attempted to reduce the number of normal emitter technology groups. However, as discussed in section IV.A of the RIA, EPA was unable to identify an appropriate basis for consolidation. EPA considers its retention of emitter class and technology group distinctions to be justified by the presence of statistically significant fuel effects specific to individual emitter classes and technology groups in today's complex model. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, EPA recognized the validity of comments received from a number of sources that (1) many emission effects were likely to be consistent across multiple technology groups or across emitter classes, and (2) insufficient data were available to model many potential terms, particularly interactive terms. The approach used by EPA to construct the complex model proposed in February 1993 did not incorporate these legitimate concerns. To do so, EPA has utilized a modified version of the ``unified'' approach advocated by API and other commenters (as described in the RIA) to develop today's complex model. This modeling approach, the statistical criteria used by EPA in conjunction with this approach, and the techniques used to simplify the models are discussed in detail in section IV.A of the RIA and are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, interactive terms were permitted to enter the models only when sufficient data were available. The model proposed in the February 1993 NPRM permitted all interactive terms to enter the models, regardless of whether sufficient data were available to estimate such an effect, and it did not apply statistical criteria to evaluate whether terms added to the model introduced more risk of inaccuracy in the model than they removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

A 13-year-old boy was reportedly  shot dead when violence erupted after police rounded up nine men  aged between 17 and 23 and put them in a police vehicle.    Col Dowd said after the men were loaded in the police van  certain sections of the community outside the Luyolo community  centre, where the PAC meeting took place, began stoning the  police and police were forced to fire rubber bullets. The men  were taken to the Bellville South police station where they were  questioned about the Heidelberg Tavern attack and other  incidents. They were released soon afterwards.    "We wish to emphasise that the suspects (the nine men) who  were removed from the centre were removed with the cooperation  of the organisers of the meeting after Col Leonard Knipe, who  headed the operation, spoke to them," Col Dowd said. "We find it  strange that the organisers did not calm the crowd that attacked  the police."    He said incidents of this nature would not occur if the  police were able to use normal policing methods. "Unfortunately  we have to enter these areas armed and accompanied by members of  the Internal Stability Unit solely because police are always  attacked by stonethrowers carried out [as published] by a small  section of the community," Col Dowd said.    Col Dowd, who felt the community at large should protect the  police, confirmed that five people were being detained in  connection with the Heidelberg Tavern attack.    The regional organiser of the PAC in the western Cape, Mr  Michael Siyolo, and the movement's regional chairman, Mr Theo  Mabusela, were detained on Monday.    Earlier this week two "confirmed" members of APLA [Azanian  People's Liberation Army] were detained in Elliott, near the  Transkei border, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel announced  on Thursday.    Col Dowd said a fifth man, believed to be Mr Richard Dala, a  former executive member of the PAC, was detained in Khayelitsha  on Thursday. he five men were all being held in terms of Section  29 of the Internal Security Act, Col Dowd said.</p>

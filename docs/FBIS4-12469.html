			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Policies That Defy Reason"] </F>   [Text) Hardly a day passes by in the occupied Arab  territories without many Palestinians falling victim to Israeli  atrocities and violations of human rights. The killing of  Palestinians by Israeli soldiers or settlers is a daily reality  that has become of routine news value to the international  media, and even less significance to the international community.    Only a crime of the enormity of the Hebron massacre draws  the  attention of the big powers in the world to the suffering of the  Palestinian people and Israel's disregard for all international  norms and human values. This attention fades, though, sooner  than the blood of Palestinians dries on the ground.    Such is not the case with violence against Israelis. The  killing of any number of Israelis by frustrated Palestinians has  all world capitals racing to condemn "Arab acts of terrorism"  and offer support for Israel.    The world is serving neither the Palestinians nor the  Israelis through such exercises in hypocrisy. Nor is Israel  protecting its future and that of the region by failing to  address the root causes of violence in the occupied territories.    Israel is responsible for the 'Afula bombing as much as it  is  responsible for the Hebron massacre. Its policies in the  occupied territories provided the settlers with the means for  killing the Palestinians as they prayed in the Ibrahimi Mosque.  Those same policies left the young Palestinian who carried out  the 'Afula suicide attack no choice but to give Israelis a taste  of what their government has been allowing to happen to  Palestinians for decades.    Israeli politicians condemned the Hebron massacre. So should  Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat condemn the 'Afula bombing  demands the U.S. and other world powers. The naivety and  insensitivity of comparing the two unfortunate events are  appalling, even though the killing of innocent people and  civilians cannot be condoned by anybody or quarter.    Had the international community been genuinely interested in  ending the bloodshed in the occupied territories, however, it  would have had taken action to end it long before the 'Afula  bombing took place. That it could have done by putting enough  pressure on Israel to remove the injustices to which  Palestinians are subjected on a daily basis. Instead of  removing the settlers, admittedly a main obstacle to the  attainment of peace in the region, Israel threw a blanket curfew  on the West Bank and Gaza. That deprived Palestinians from even  providing for their daily needs. The suffering increased and  retaliatory action became an inevitable response.    The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman thus  found himself unable to condemn the 'Afula attack personally.  By doing so, he might have only infuriated his people whose  members are being killed by Israelis by the hour. Israel, on  the other hand, could affoprd to condemn the Hebron massacre  because it has within its reach tens of other measures to  appease its citizens.    The most the PLO can do in reaction to Israeli atrocities is  boycott the peace talks, and that it cannot do for long because  of the pressures that Washington and other world powers would  put on it.    But Israel does not boycott the talks, winning world praise  for not allowing "rejectionists" to abort the peace process.  What it does, instead, is put two million Palestinians under  siege again by closing the West Bank and Gaza totally. The  negative implications of this act for the peace process far  exceed those of withdrawing from the negotiation. Yet a few in  the world community seem to notice; and Israel gets away with  murder.    Thus only Palestinian desperation grows, and the cycle of  violence continues unabated. When inclination towards peace  becomes the ultimate causalty we can all be sure that the peace  process stands to suffer. Just when the Israelis get to realise  the folly of their policies is the question that we cannot  answer.</p>

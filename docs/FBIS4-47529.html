			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Editorial board] </F>   [Text] The republic's biolaboratory is involved in the  production and implementation of biological facilities in the  republic. The outcome of this effort speaks for itself: in 1992,  biological treatment was carried out in 42 Tatarstan rayons with  an area of 820,000 ha. Bactorodencide was used most frequently  on open soil. The preparation was used on an area of 600,000 ha  in 25 rayons, predominantly on winter cereal crops, perennial  grass, and in orchards. The total area of its application in  warehouse rooms and greenhouses exceeded 107,000 ha and in the  private sector--7,000 ha.    Rhizoplan testing was continued on cereal crop plantings  over  an area of 167,500 ha and on other crops in 27 rayons in the  republic. The effect of the preparation on potatoes was examined  by experts from the laboratory together with scientists from the  Niva Scientific Technical Association. At first, they treated  the tubers, then the preparation was applied to vegetating  plants. The outcome was positive.    The following microbiological preparations were used:  lepidocide on vegetable crops and in gardens and bitoxybacillin  primarily on potatoes. Curtene and belocide were tested for the  first time against the Colorado beetle in the private sector.    Commercial breeding of Trichogramma conducted  along four lines has been set up in the republic. Large-scale  production of the entomophagan is carried out between April and  August. The Trichogramma is marketed to enterprises  in 30 rayons where it is introduced into gardens, plantings of  peas and perennial grasses and vegetable crops over a total area  of 150 ha. Production of aphid lion and Encarsia is  continuing for open and protected soil; it is being conducted by  the Republican Laboratory and Greenhouse Integrated Productions.    The assortment of biological facilities and the scope of  their application are expanding every year. In addition to  producing Trichodermin, Phytoseiulus, Aphidius  gallcieae, and aphid lion, Cuban cycloneda and  Amblyseius were also bred during the last year. A  department for producing preparations against downy mildew is  being equipped.    The production of entomophagan at greenhouse integrated  enterprises makes it possible to produce the first yield of  vegetable and produce crops virtually without chemical  treatment. The integrated enterprises are partially marketing  their biological resources to subsidiary plots at commercial  enterprises.    The staff of the biolaboratory together with the experts  from  the enterprises are engaged in efforts to identify useful  insects and preserve them in the areas near beehives as well as  prepare regulation for canceling chemical treatment. Due to the  considerable spread of female aphids, aphid lions, aphidius,  ground beetles, tachyna flies, and other representatives of  useful entomophagan in nature, such chemical treatment was  canceled over an area of over 252,000 ha.</p>

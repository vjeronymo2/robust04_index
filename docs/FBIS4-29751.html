			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The chairman of the second  largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan,  SDJP] said Tuesday his party will not submit a no-confidence  motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority government  pending talks on the SDP's possible return to the ruling  coalition.    Tomiichi Murayama said he will seek a meeting with Hata as  soon as Wednesday to discuss the realliance issue. Murayama, who  has demanded voluntary resignation by the Hata government, also  said he will try to settle realliance and resignation talks  simultaneously.    The SDP left the coalition in April and has threatened to  join the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in  seeking a no-confidence vote if Hata refuses to step down  together with his ministers.</p>

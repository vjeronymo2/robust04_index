			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Arts: The Sleeping Beauty - Ballet Any Russian company offering Tchaikovsky ballets is, I'd hazard, justification enough for audiences to flock to a theatre. Quality, alas, is not considered - or is believed to be integral to the package  - and the shrinking of such grandiose works as Swan Lake or The Sleeping Beauty to the demands of a small theatre and undistinguished performance is part of the sadness of the affair. I am not one of those who believe that great art can be cut down to size, that Mozart operas or classic drama may be trimmed and under-played for the sake of showing Don Giovanni or Hamlet to audiences far from the theatres that can present them in decent style. Betraying the work betrays the public. Moscow City Ballet, returned to London this week at the end of a regional tour, brings Beauty and its version of swan-upping for a third visit. On previous appearances the company has at least served as a frame for a major artist - the glorious Ludmila Semenyaka, the noble Yury Posokhov - and I have sat through the stagings for their sake. For this Sadler's Wells season we have the company unbolstered. I saw Sleeping Beauty on Monday night, and I can report that Natalia Povago's tremulous designs seem somewhat amplified, though no less appealing or credible than on prior viewings; that the King is still outfitted in mustard sateen plus twos, a tinsel crown-ette, and has a page-boy bob and a moustache (a combination suggesting that he is in the middle of a sex-change); and that the whole affair looks as if a strong wind could blow it away. The company performance was brisk, and drilled to a point of efficiency that made the choreography meaningless. It is ballet as fast-food, and bears as much resemblance to the masterpiece it purports to show as a hamburger does to meat. Solos are rattled through; the court scenes are like bad pantomime; the dances for the first act waltz are tape-loop choreography. The Aurora was Yevgenia Vorobieva, extremely efficient in showing the steps, but on this occasion, giving us a coquettish and unnuanced view of the supreme challenge for a classical ballerina. The role was dead. I liked Dmitri Barmotin's Carabosse, big in scale, and not afraid to storm the stage, and in Mikhail Ronnikov the company has an intriguing Prince Florimund. Tall, elegant in physique, with a light jump, Ronnikov has a very youthful air. He acts the role not at all, offering instead an open-mouthed eagerness which is not the best indication of princely character. But he has real potential, and in better surroundings may well turn out to be a true premier danseur. In the vision scene, the corps de ballet was seen at its willing best. The score under Igor Shavruk was as brusque as the staging. Moscow City Ballet is at Sadler's Wells until January 15</p>

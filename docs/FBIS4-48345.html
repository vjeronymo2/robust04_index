			<p>BFN     [Text] We spoke to UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] spokesman Jorge Valentim in Lusaka a few  moments ago. He confirmed all the information we obtained today  from Rui Mingas, Angolan ambassador in Lisbon, and spoke about  the great news for the Angolan people:    [Begin recording] [Valentim, on the telephone] Yes, we are  negotiating, we resumed the talks today and, of course, the  theme we have on the table is national reconciliation. We feel  optimistic about reaching a positive result.    [Correspondent Salema] Can that result be reached by the  beginning of June?    [Valentim] Without getting into precise chronology, we can  say yes. We are even hoping to get it over very, very soon, we  have that sort of political will, we have very good  communications going on with the government and hope we will  reach the end of the journey within the same spirit of  understanding and open democratic debate.    [Salema] Will peace then arrive in Angola in June?    [Valentim] We hope so, this is great news for the people of  our country. Not only the news of peace but also that of  national reconciliation that will allow all Angolans to live  together, regardless of political conviction, racial, and ethnic  origins. [end recording]    That was UNITA's Jorge Valentim confirming to Madelena  Salema  that the Summer of 1994 may bring peace back to Angola.</p>

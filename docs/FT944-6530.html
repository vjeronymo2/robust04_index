			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Dollars 20.8m glass buy for CRH CRH, the building materials group, has expanded its interests in the US through the acquisition of Tempglass Group, a glass fabricator, for Dollars 20.8m (Pounds 12.6m) cash. The acquisition through Oldcastle, CRH's US holding company, will allow CRH to expand its market and product range, making it the largest independent glass fabricator in North America with total sales of Dollars 160m. It will provide increased purchasing leverage with glass suppliers, and a wider product range for the North American markets, where Oldcastle already has 14 plants in 12 states. Tempglass operates four plants in Ohio, Texas, Florida and California, producing tempered, insulated and laminated glass, mostly for the non-residential construction sector. Sales in 1993 were Dollars 54m and was expected to break-even in 1994. Tempglass, originally part of RTZ, was bought out by its management. On the death of the largest partner earlier this year, CRH bid for the shares of the other two partners, who will be retained as managers. The purchase brings CRH's total global acquisitions in 1994 to IPounds 120m Pounds 118m).</p>

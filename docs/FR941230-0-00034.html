			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 58b, an airport may be designated as a user fee airport if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the volume of Customs business at the airport is insufficient to justify the availability of Customs services at the airport and the governor of the state in which the airport is located approves the designation. Generally, the type of airport that would seek designation as a user fee airport would be one at which a company, such as an air courier service, has a specialized interest in regularly landing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inasmuch as the volume of business anticipated at these airports is insufficient to justify their designation as an international or landing rights airport, the availability of Customs services is not paid for out of the Customs appropriations from the general treasury of the United States. Instead, the services of Customs officers are provided on a fully reimbursable basis to be paid for by the user fee airports on behalf of the recipients of the services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fees which are to be charged at user fee airports, according to the statute, shall be paid by each person using the Customs services at the airport and shall be in the amount equal to the expenses incurred by the Secretary of the Treasury in providing Customs services which are rendered to such person at such airport, including the salary and expenses of those employed by the Secretary of the Treasury to provide the Customs services. To implement this provision, generally the airport seeking the designation as a user fee airport or that airport's authority agrees to pay Customs a flat fee annually and the users of the airport are to reimburse that airport/airport authority. The airport/airport authority agrees to set and periodically to review its charges to ensure that they are in accord with the airport's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to Treasury Department Order No. 165, Revised (Treasury Decision 53564), all the rights, privileges, powers and duties vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, by the navigation laws, or by any other laws administered by Customs, are transferred to the Commissioner of Customs. Accordingly, the authority granted to the Secretary of the Treasury to designate user fee airports and to determine appropriate fees is delegated to the Commissioner of Customs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this authority, Customs has determined that certain conditions must be met before an airport can be designated as a user fee airport. At least one full-time Customs officer must be requested, and the airport must be responsible for providing Customs with satisfactory office space, equipment and supplies, at no cost to the Federal Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nineteen airports are currently listed in &sect;122.15, Customs Regulations, as user fee airports designated by the Commissioner. This document adds eight more airports to the listing of designated user fee airports. These airports and phone numbers at which they can be contacted regarding service are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our colleague Saliha Bahri  asked Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri yesterday what he  thought about chances for transforming the Arab Maghreb Union  into a regional bloc and about its relations with the European  Union.    [Begin Dembri recording] In theory this is an easy option  for  us. However, when it comes to practice it is necessary to first  build the Maghreb bloc up as a strong economic group, a matter  which has yet to be achieved. The European Community has had 30  years of experience behind it before it was possible to realize  a strong economy and abolish borders between European countries.  As far as we are concerned we are still at the beginning; it is  necessary for us now to examine all aspects of trade: individual  movement and everything else. We have to build the Maghreb  house first before one can talk as a bloc with any other bloc in  the world. [end recording]</p>

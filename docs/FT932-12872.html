			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Worner presses Paris to take bigger Nato role FRANCE would have 'everything to gain and nothing to lose' by taking a more active role in Nato, Mr Manfred Worner, the alliance's secretary general said in Paris yesterday. Before an audience at the National Assembly which included the French foreign minister, the Nato top official clearly hoped that his impassioned appeal for France to shake off its historic chilliness towards the alliance would catch the Balladur government at an impressionable early stage in its life. Mr Worner brandished his 'European' credentials by noting that, as German defence minister in the late 1980s, he had helped 'father' the joint Franco-German brigade which the two countries hope to build into the 'Euro-corps' by 1995. But European defence efforts, he said, could not possibly substitute for the US security link enshrined in Nato, which now played an important role in establishing ties with Russia and east Europe and in providing military and logistic support for United Nations peace-keeping. France need not reverse its 1966 decision to leave Nato's integrated military command, Mr Worner said. It could follow Spain's example in keeping its troops outside Nato in peacetime, but sending its defence minister to Nato meetings to give the alliance 'the benefit of its (military) competence and experience in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and in UN operations,' Mr Worner flatteringly suggested, picking up an idea floated by Mr Pierre Joxe, France's former socialist defence minister. But Mr Alain Juppe, the new French foreign minister, was cautious in advance of a new defence white paper later this year. He did, however, signal that Paris might moderate its opposition to Nato extending its links eastward. Mr Juppe conceded that the new states in eastern Europe were looking for their security 'not to pan-European organisations such as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), but to organisations such as Nato which included the US'.</p>

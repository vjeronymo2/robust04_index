			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Lloyd's loss reviews 'should be halted' Lloyd's regulators should stop preparing loss review reports while legal actions brought by Names are still in progress, the High Court heard yesterday. In a judicial review, managing agents of syndicates 80 and 843 asked for the loss reviews to be halted because they were prejudicial to the court cases in which Names are seeking damages for alleged negligence. The agents claim the Names can obtain an unfair advantage because the transcripts of interviews with regulators can be used as evidence in court. The regulatory board of Lloyd's opposed the move, arguing that the loss reviews were for the benefit of all Names, not just those in litigation. Judgment is due today.</p>

Zhang pointed out: Patten is absolutely not qualified to  comment on China's affairs.    When asked by a reporter what he would like to say on  Patten's attack that the statement of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office a few days ago lacks legal authority, and his  remark that whether the three-tier assemblies will be able to  straddle 1997 should be determined by the National People's  Congress, Zhang Junsheng said: "What qualification does he have  to comment on the affairs of our country? This is an affair of  our country. It is surprising that he made such comments!"    Zhang Junsheng added: "The Basic Law is the law of the PRC's  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] rather than that  of Britain. What qualification does Patten have to interpret  our Basic Law?"    He said: Originally, in a bid to effect a smoother  transition in 1997, the Chinese side accepted the plan on the  through train proposed by the British side. However, Patten  dished out his constitutional package of "three violations,"  disrupted the Sino- British talks on the 1994-95 electoral  arrangements and, under the condition that no agreement had been  reached between China and Britain, unilaterally tabled his  constitutional package to the Legislative Council. This has led  to the termination of talks, and the issue of through train no  longer exists. I have said repeatedly that according to the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, the British rule over Hong Kong  will completely end on 30 June 1997, so he has no right to  meddle in any affair after our restoration of sovereignty in  Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997.    When asked by a reporter under what circumstances the Sino-  British talks can be resumed, Zhang Junsheng answered that it  was hard to say since the British side had terminated the talks  and unilaterally tabled Patten's constitutional package to the  Legislative Council in violation of its commitment. Zhang  Junsheng added: "What is to be discussed now? He has left the  negotiation table with his briefcase, and the door has been  closed. What else can we talk about?"    In Zhang's opinion, "whoever started the trouble should end  it." Hence, whether the talks can be resumed depends only on  whether the British side will now totally withdraw the package  that Patten has tabled to the Legislative Council and make  contacts again through diplomatic channels. Zhang Junsheng  pointed out: "Things are very plain now, just as Director Zhou  Nan said the day before yesterday, that for those who have  engaged in the `three violations,' the sea of bitterness has no  bounds, but there is another sentence following that which reads  -- those who will turn back can reach the shore."    Zhang Junsheng stressed: We said a long time ago that the  Chinese Government would certainly ensure the smooth transfer as  well as the prosperity and stability in Hong Kong together with  Hong Kong citizens. We have such determination and confidence  to effectively perform our work for the transition and recovery  of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997.    Zhang Junsheng said: The Preliminary Work Committee for the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR is entirely capable  of doing the preparatory work for Hong Kong's smooth transition  at the initial stage very well. Now that the Basic Law is  placed there, we will plan the transition issues of Hong Kong in  accordance with the Basic Law. Originally, the Chinese side  hoped to have British cooperation, but it refused to cooperate.  What should we do? Will we not take back Hong Kong and  establish the SAR Government without its cooperation?    As to some people's accusation that the statement of the  Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office was not in keeping with the Basic  Law, Zhang Junsheng pointed out: "These people simply have no  knowledge of the Basic Law, which is the basic law of the PRC's  Hong Kong SAR. Both the future Legislative Council or regional  organizations will all be organizations of the Hong Kong SAR,  whose nature will be diametrically different from that of the  current Legislative Council and regional organizations." "The  current British Hong Kong Government is one maintaining British  colonial rule, which, in terms of the nature of sovereignty, is  diametrically different from the future SAR Government -- a  local government with a high degree of autonomy and directly  under the jurisdiction of the central government of China as a  sovereign state," he concluded.</p>

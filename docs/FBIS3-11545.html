			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said Thursday  [17 March] that the government's military victory over the  guerrillas is certain. The president made this remark in Mexico  City on the last day of his official visit during a breakfast  with Latin American and Caribbean diplomats accredited in  Mexico. [passage omitted]    De Leon attended this breakfast with the officials who  accompanied him to Mexico, including several ministers. He said  his government is intent on establishing true democracy and  preserving institutions. The president assured his government  respects human rights, but that the armed conflict represents a  constant threat to those rights. [passage omitted]    The diplomats attending the breakfast showed great interest  in De Leon's remarks. Some ambassadors posed questions at the  end of the meeting with the Nicaraguan president; one was about  the future dissolution or reduction of the Guatemalan Army.    [Begin recording] [Jose Ernesto Fonseca Pasos, Nicaraguan  ambassador to Mexico] [Question indistinct]    [De Leon] The reduction in the Army in our case is not  (?feasible) [words indistinct] in general is not possible  because even those countries supposedly without armies have  them. Our Constitution clearly establishes its presence and  that there should be only one army. It does not accept any  other armed or unconventional group. For this reason, this  topic has no reason for being. As for the first part, the Armed  Forces have discussed a readjustment or even a reduction. We  are conducting a study in line with the Guatemalan Army plans  and the conditions that will exist. To be sure, the armed  conflict has to end to achieve that.    It is not possible to ask an army to shrink its size so long  as subversion exists or an enemy exists within the country.  Much has been said about the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols  [PAC], and [words indistinct] that they should be disbanded.  They are part of Guatemala's military defense. They are  persons who have grouped together. Much has been said about the  voluntary nature of these groups. The human rights ombudsman,  who replaced me, recently conducted a survey, and the result was  tremendously surprising in terms of the voluntary manner in  which the members joined the PAC, which are currently called  Voluntary Civil Defense Committees.    A lot has been said about dissolving the PAC's because of  the  abuses perpetrated by some of their members -- which is true, I  admit. I am aware of this and have issued instructions to the  effect that when such abuses are perpetrated, when PAC members  take advantage of their position and perpetrate illegal acts or  crimes, they must be prosecuted as would any other citizen.  However, it would be illogical and naive to eliminate groups  that have prevented the progress of subversion. Many groups in  Guatemala and abroad have called for the dissolution of the  PAC's and I have always said that such a request is the result  of either naivete or a desire not to hinder the progress of  subversion.    The PAC's have demonstrated to the entire world that it is  possible to counteract and prevent the progress of guerrilla  warfare, so much so that many countries are imitating them.  Unfortunately -- and I say unfortunately because this sort of  guerrilla warfare has also taken place in other countries --  they are imitating the actions of a people who, angered by their  sufferings, their orphans, their lives, etc., have organized for  preventive purposes.    An Army in Guatemala, or anywhere in the world, would find  it  difficult to control the progress of terrorism, but already in  those areas where these civilian groups have organized they have  unquestionably contributed militarily to the defense effort and  have prevented the progress of subversion. This is why,  militarily speaking, the war against subversion has been won.  The subversives have been militarily defeated. I would like to  add, although the minister of defense will discuss this in  greater detail, that we have already decided to establish PAC's  in areas that are free of subversion. Two-thirds of our  nation's territory is free of subversives and there are no PAC's  in the remaining third. [sentence as heard] Therefore, the  PAC's have gradually become committees of peace and development,  they are very well organized and in the future could prove very  advantageous, no longer with weapons but for the economic and  social development of their communities. I would like the  defense minister to expand on this issue.    [Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez] [passage omitted]  Concerning the dissolution, reduction, reorganization or  retraining of the Army, I have certain views, Messrs.  ambassadors, regarding the manner in which the Guatemalan Army  should be reorganized once we have overcome the insurgent  threat, and a bill to this effect will be presented to the  president. The constitutional president of the Republic has  already ordered the implementation of many of these actions, and  besides fulfilling a constitutional mission, I believe this  reorganization will allow for (?relocations) and the  strengthening of certain areas, such as [words indistinct],  which will be protected in a more effective manner and the Army  will be able to exchange quantity for quality.    These plans are already under way and include the  educational  systems at our military academy and our university or military  training center. No one will be able to graduate as an officer  unless he follows the curriculum [words indistinct] of a liberal  education. No one will be able to take an (?advanced) course,  let alone the General Staff course, if he does not have a  bachelors or masters degree in any of the liberal arts.    This plan, gentlemen, is already under way. However, this  education system will also be extended to specialists and  soldiers because our plan is to reduce time in service, to make  military service truly voluntary, and to thereby preclude  complaints. I am aware that at this time many of our plans for  the Army bear the heavy burden of [word indistinct] and  depoliticization, but this is because there is still an armed  conflict in Guatemala. However, we have planned numerous  improvements which include, pardon the repetition, an exchange  of quantity for quality within the Guatemalan Army, which the  president is aware of and which, moreover, he has approved. I  will not speak any further because I do not want to take up any  more of the president's time. Thank you very much. [end  recording]</p>

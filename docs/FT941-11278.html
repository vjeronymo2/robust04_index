			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Parliament maps out a cheaper route to Berlin Plans for rebuilding Berlin as the capital of a united Germany have been sharply curtailed by the parliament's budget committee, Reuter reports from Bonn. The budget committee of parliament agreed on Wednesday evening that all ministries should be housed in existing buildings, either former East German ministries or military headquarters left behind by departing Allied forces. Only the new chancellery and government press office due to be constructed near the old Reichstag parliament building were not mentioned in the resolution, implying they would be built, committee members said. Parliament voted in 1991 to move the government from Bonn to Berlin and has since been mired in debate over how and when to do it. The current target date for the move is the year 2000. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition, trying to reduce spending, has said the move should not cost more than DM20bn (Dollars 11.4bn). After unification in 1990 many Bonn cabinet ministers made quick 'house-hunting' trips to Berlin, after which they declared they needed new ministry buildings because the old East German offices were hopelessly outdated. The Foreign Ministry firmly opposed moving into East Germany's foreign ministry, an ugly 1970s high-rise building that mars the otherwise classical centre of old Berlin. Several ministries balked at the idea of taking over the squat building that once housed the Third Reich's central bank and became the Communist party headquarters after the war. But the committee, whose recommendations must still be debated in parliament, said Berlin had so many large buildings - some dating back to its time as the capital of Prussia - that the present government could certainly find enough space. The British, French and US forces that once defended West Berlin will leave the city by the end of this year, freeing a large number of barracks, office buildings and commandants' villas for government use.</p>

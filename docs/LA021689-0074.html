			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL PUTS BEAUTIFICATION UNDER NEW DEPARTMENT  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council on Tuesday established a new department, the  Environmental Services Section, to help beautify the city.  </P> <P> The new division will clean up graffiti, remove abandoned vehicles and make  sure that neighborhood yards are maintained.  </P> <P> "This is just another example of what this staff and, modestly, the City  Council, has done to make this a better place to live," said Councilman John F.  Day.  </P> <P> The council also approved a plan to spend $20,000 to get the program off the  ground.  </P> <P> The council's decision followed a staff recommendation. "We need to be  aggressive and take a pro-active approach," said City Manager David Ramsay.  </P> <P> Ramsay said that while all the environmental services are being performed  efficiently, the effort will be better coordinated by placing them under a  single department head.  </P> <P> Until Tuesday's resolution, different environmental services had been performed  by a variety of city departments: Public Works, Community Development, Fire,  Police, Parks and Recreation, Planning, Zoning and Management Services.  </P> <P> One of the first tasks of the new department will be to find a name that is  more "sexy" than Environmental Services, Ramsay said.  </P></p>

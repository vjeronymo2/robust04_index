			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / 'Referendum Movement' breaks from Christian Democrats Mr Mario Segni, leader of the 'Referendum Movement', yesterday ended months of speculation about his position inside the Christian Democrat party when he announced a clean break. His move is likely to have an important impact on the future composition of the party and its electoral support, writes Robert Graham. It could prove the first move in a more general political realignment. Mr Segni, aged 53, is one of the few politicians still with a strong rating in the opinion polls and has represented a vital clean image for the party. His decision has been directly prompted by the weekend news that senior members of the party, including Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister, were under investigation for alleged links with the Mafia.</p>

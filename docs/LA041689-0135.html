			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> END OF A TRADITION;  </P> <P> YOUNG BASQUE SHEPHERDS NO LONGER FLOCK TO CALIF.  </P> <P> For more than 100 years they have been coming to California and herding sheep,  working interminable hours, rarely taking days off, enduring months of  isolation in tents or primitive trailers.  </P> <P> It was a job few Americans wanted. But for the young men in the mountainous  Basque regions of Spain and France, shepherding was a way to parlay a few years  of hard work into a better life.  </P> <P> The Basques quickly developed an enduring reputation as the finest sheepmen in  the American West. Basque shepherds had an uncanny ability to find the richest  pastures, sheepmen said, rarely lost lambs to predators, and their ewes  routinely had the most offspring.  </P> <P> But during the 1970s, because of improved economic conditions in the Basque  countries, immigration to America almost ceased. Sheepmen, once assured of a  steady stream of young Basque men, were faced with a shepherd shortage.  </P> <P> "All of a sudden things changed, and people in the sheep business couldn't find  any shepherds," said Frank Iturriria, president of the Kern County Wool Growers  Assn., who started as a shepherd when he immigrated to America 28 years ago.  "Some people had to get out of the sheep business. Others switched over to  cattle."  </P> <P> The sheepmen eventually developed contacts in South America and began bringing  in shepherds from Peru and Chile who were able to stay three years as guest  workers and then return home. But for California's Basques, a way of life was  unalterably transformed.  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, 95% of the shepherds in Kern County -- the largest sheep  county in the state -- were Basque, Iturriria said. Today, fewer than 10% are  Basque, mostly aging men who have worked as shepherds for decades.  </P> <P> The sheepmen lament the end of a tradition, the changing order of their  business. Most young Basque men came to the United States with a few dollars in  their pockets, worked as shepherds for a few years, received their pay in ewes  and slowly amassed their own herds.  </P> <P> In Kern County today, every large sheep ranch except one is owned by a Basque,  and most of the owners began as sheepherders. But as they retire, young Basque  men are not taking their places, and they fear that the tradition of the Basque  sheepman will end.  </P> <P> "I'm 44 and I'm the youngest sheepman in Kern County," said Frank Iturriria's  brother, Antero, who also started as a shepherd. "The second generation of  Basques in America don't want to go into the business. They want to be  professional people. And the young Basques are staying home. What happens when  I leave the business? Who will take my place?"  </P> <P> At the edge of a pale-green alfalfa field speckled with hundreds of ewes and  their newborn lambs wobbling about on unsteady legs, Elias Aleman mended a wire  fence. It is the end of the winter lambing season in Kern County, and Aleman  has to protect his sheep from speeding cars, a danger his flock never faced in  the small Spanish town in the Pyrenees s where he was raised.  </P> <P> "In my home village, there were no cars. . . . There weren't even many  bicycles," he said in Basque, smiling shyly, as his employer, Frank Iturriria,  interpreted.  </P> <P> Because his hometown was so small -- about 300 people -- and isolated, Aleman  said, there was little opportunity. But a Bakersfield sheepman visiting  relatives in the Pyrenees offered him a job. So, at the age of 22, like most  young men in his village, he moved to America.  </P> <P> For 21 years Aleman has lived the lonely, nomadic life of a California  shepherd. After the winter lambing, Aleman spends April and May in the Mojave  Desert, watching his flock during spring grazing. He spends his summers on the  mile-high meadows of the Owens Valley on the slopes of the Sierra. In the fall,  he returns to the Kern County foothills.  </P> <P> At one time, Aleman and the other shepherds lived in tents and followed their  flocks' peregrinations by foot over the century-old California Sheep Trail. It  was one of the longest annual animal drives in the nation -- 400 miles over the  Tehachapis to Mojave, up past Lone Pine and Bishop to the high mountain summer  meadows of the Sierra and then back to Kern County. Now, the sheep are trucked  to the seasonal grazing spots, and Aleman follows, pulling a battered trailer.  </P> <P> But it is still a hard life, a life that young Basque men no longer are willing  to endure, Aleman said.  </P> <P> "When I was young, this was our only opportunity," he explained.  </P> <P> Aleman stooped over and picked a strip of foxtail grass. All was silent except  for the ringing bell from a running ewe and the bleating of newborn lambs.  "Today, in my home village, they all have cars now and can commute to  factories. They no longer have to live this life."  </P> <P> When the young men stopped coming to America, Basque neighborhoods in many  California towns faced extinction. But Bakersfield's Basques have endured, and  they have held onto a few remnants of their community. Basques are still  scattered throughout the sheep-growing regions of the San Joaquin Valley, but  the Bakersfield area has the largest community, with about 6,000 people of  Basque descent.  </P> <P> Like most Basque neighborhoods, Bakersfield's was founded near a railroad  station. For generations, shepherds speaking no English arrived on the train,  clutching scraps of paper bearing their destination, and walked to Basque  boarding houses nearby and waited for sheepmen to give them work.  </P> <P> The blocks around the Bakersfield Southern Pacific Railway station were once  filled with Basque boarding houses and hotels, Basque restaurants, social halls  and bakeries. Today, the Basque neighborhood is barely discernible. All that is  left are a few aging restaurants, hotels and a bakery in an industrial section  of town hard by the railroad tracks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handball and Card Games  </P> <P> But on Sunday the neighborhood is revived. After church, Basques line up  outside the Pyrenees Bakery for the thick-crust, sourdough "shepherds loaf" for  their Sunday meal. Others gather at the Basque Club for a game of pelota  (Basque handball) or a card game called mus. By late afternoon, the bar at the  Noriega Hotel is filled with sheepmen and the descendants of sheepmen drinking  Picon punch, a heady blend of brandy, grenadine, soda and Amer Picon aperitif.  </P> <P> The Noriega Hotel, a rooming house built in 1893, is the traditional center of  Bakersfield's Basque community. A generation ago, it was filled with young men  just off the train looking for work or shepherds spending their brief vacation  in town. The rooming house provided three meals a day and free storage space  while the shepherds were on the range.  </P> <P> Many young Basque girls obtained their first jobs in America at the Noriega,  and the hotel was the site of many marriages between chambermaids and visiting  shepherds.  </P> <P> The hotel still has eight boarders, including three retired Basque shepherds  who now work as gardeners, said the current owner, Janize Elizalde. And the  hotel still serves a traditional Basque meal at 7 p.m. sharp as boarders and  visitors sit side by side at long wooden tables. The dim dining room and the  ancient bar with a  </P> <P> linoleum floor and creaky overhead fans provide a Spartan decor.  </P> <P> Basque meals are famous for their plentitude, and no one ever walked away from  Noriega's hungry. A recent meal included vegetable soup, Basque beans, pickled  tongue, salad and Pyrenees bread for starters. The entrees were prime rib and  lamb stew, served with heaping platters of French fries, spaghetti, cottage  cheese and green beans. Dessert included large chunks of bleu cheese, followed  by ice cream.  </P> <P> Noriega's and the seven other traditional Basque restaurants in the area  attract tour groups and gourmands from throughout California. One of the  Basques' greatest accomplishments is that they have managed to transform  Bakersfield -- not considered one of California's cosmopolitan centers -- into  a city known for its cuisine.  </P> <P> The tradition of the Basque sheepman in America began during the Gold Rush. But  these first sheepmen were not from the Basque homeland; they were South  American cattle ranchers of Basque descent who had decided to try their hand at  gold mining.  </P> <P> A few discovered that because of the great demand for fresh meat in the mining  camps and the plentiful rangeland, they could make more money raising sheep  than panning for gold. These Basques attracted other Basques, relatives and  friends from the home villages in Spain and France, and soon there was a steady  flow of shepherds to the sheep-growing regions of California, Nevada and Idaho.  </P> <P> Basques are proud of their heritage and boast of having the oldest surviving  culture in Europe. Although their homeland straddles the mountains between  Spain and France, they do not consider themselves to be part of either country.  They inhabited the Pyrenees long before Spain and France became nations.  </P> <P> But opportunity was limited in the remote mountain villages, and by the turn of  the century, Basques were pouring into the United States. They quickly adapted  to the hard life of sheepherding and proved themselves "natural sheepmen," said  Martin Etchamendy, a Kern County sheep ranch owner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Early Start  </P> <P> "Basques have an ability around sheep we haven't found with any other people,"  said Etchamendy, who worked as a shepherd when he immigrated to America 27  years ago. "For centuries, people have been raising sheep in the Pyrenees.  Although not all Basques were shepherds in the old country, most had some sheep  on their family farms. Ever since we were 4 or 5 years old we have been caring  for the sheep, herding them, helping make cheese from their milk. . . .  </P> <P> "We adapted to the loneliness of sheepherding better than a lot of people  because most of us are from very small villages with few neighbors. We grew up  with the isolation."  </P> <P> Etchamendy drove his pickup to a grazing field north of Bakersfield where his  "No. 1 shepherd," Juan Maya, watched the flock. Maya, who looked like a figure  from Biblical times, stood motionless for minutes, hunched over a wooden Basque  shepherd's crook called a makila, silhouetted against the dying rays of the  late afternoon sun.  </P> <P> "He's been around sheep ever since he was born," Etchamendy said, flicking his  head toward Maya, 61, who continued to stand motionless in the distance. "He is  a man who really knows the character of sheep. Nobody has an eye like him."  </P> <P> Maya knows how to quickly tie together the rear legs of twins so that the  mother gets the smell of both and realizes she must nurse two instead of one.  He knows how to match a twin whose mother does not have enough milk for two  with an ewe who has lost a lamb after birth. He is an expert at skinning the  dead lamb and placing the pelt over the back of the twin so that the ewe is  fooled into thinking the lamb is her own.  </P> <P> These are arcane skills that Basque shepherds take pride in but few Americans  care to learn. Although Americans have mythologized every aspect of cattle  ranching, few have paid any attention to the travails of the sheepman, said  Larry Garro, director of the Western Range Assn., which locates foreign  shepherds for local ranchers.  </P> <P> That is why, for more than a century, the United States has imported its  sheepmen.  </P> <P> "Everybody in America wants to be a cowboy," Garro said. "But nobody wants to  be a shepherd."  </P></p>

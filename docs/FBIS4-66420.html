			<p>CSO     [Text] Ishikawajima Harima Heavy Industries, Ltd.  (President, Kosaku Inaba) has disclosed that they have been  negotiating with a major French space engine manufacturer,  Societe Europeene Propulsione (SEP, HQS in Le Ariane) Company,  for export of the bearing cage used for the H-2 rocket engine's  liquid hydrogen turbopump. The H-2 was launched successfully by  Japan. At SEP's request, IHI has already shipped samples at  cost. At present, SEP is conducting its technical evaluation. If  this deal is successful, it will constitute Japan's first  home-developed export in the field of space rocket components.    The bearing cage is the heart of the rocket engine supply  system, which plays a supporting role in light-weight,  high-horsepower, high-thrust turbo engines.    The cage was developed by IHI in cooperation with the  National Space Development Agency (NASDA) and the National  Aerospace Laboratory (NAL). Its value was verified during the  successful H-2 rocket launch. It proved extremely durable and  strong under the most severe environments, and demonstrated  lubricity at temperatures even 250 degrees C below 0. The life  span of the cage can be lengthened by using glass fiber  reinforced composite material for the base material. The glass  fiber on the surface was removed to an appropriate depth through  melting in order to bring the steel ball and lubricating  material into smoother contact.    SEP, which is in charge of a portion of production of the  large ``Ariane'' rocket run by the European Union (EU), had  maintained contact with IHI and showed special interest in the  processing technology for the bearing cage since its R&amp;D  stage.  IHI held discussions with the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry to be sure the cage will be limited to peaceful  purposes, and concluded that its export will create no problems.  Based on specifications and drawing prepared by SEP, IHI  produced and delivered 20 sample bearing cages with the property  test reports. SEP paid approximately &yen;20 million to cover  the cost. SEP is currently in the process of re-examining the  samples based on these test reports.    If this business deal goes through, 100 units per order,  depending on European rocket launch schedules, are expected to  be made. If the samples are acceptable for use, SEP is expected  to install them aboard the ``Ariane-5'' which is scheduled for  launch beginning in 1996.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Kohl ticks off MEPs for criticism Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a staunch advocate of greater powers for the European parliament, yesterday scolded the Strasbourg assembly for criticising Germany's six-month presidency of the European Union. MEPs had no right to belittle the results of the recent European Council summit in Essen which had marked an historic step towards integrating the former communist countries of eastern Europe into the EU, he said. He noted pointedly that barely a fifth of the 567 members were present in the chamber: 'If people could see this empty room, they would be horrified.' Many MEPs appeared taken aback by Mr Kohl's touchiness. Mr Gijs de Vries, the Liberal leader, said the chancellor had obviously been too long in power. 'He's suffering from the Thatcher-Lubbers complex. It seems to happen to everyone who has been in power for more than 10 years.' In the debate on the Essen summit, MEPs piled up complaints about the delay in concluding a convention to govern Europol, the Hague-based pan-European police network, as well as the failure to cut high unemployment, tackle poverty and stem the refugees from ex-Yugoslavia. In particular, the Socialists, the single largest group, called for an analysis of the effect on the EU budget and common agricultural policy of enlargement to include the farm-intensive countries of eastern Europe such as Poland and Hungary. Greek representatives spoke up, still rankled by the way Germany effectively took over the Greek presidency earlier this year by seizing control of the EU accession negotiations with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Mr Kohl is an irrepressible optimist about Europe, but his view that Essen had achieved a broad consensus on employment, the financing of trans-European infrastructure networks, and a balanced policy toward eastern Europe and the Mediterranean was widely shared by EU governments. Britain was especially delighted with the Ecu300m (Pounds 233m) aid programme for Northern Ireland, the strong commitment to future labour market flexibility, and the Council's decision to abandon efforts to force through an EU-wide Co carbon energy tax. The chancellor was clearly upset by MEPs' criticism about the delay in setting up Europol, a project to which he attaches the utmost importance. 'Why criticise me? Go back home and speak to your own representatives. They are rejecting Europol,' he said. France, which takes over the rotating EU presidency in January, has blocked a Europol agreement, although at Essen it offered a commitment to wrap up a convention before the next European summit in Cannes in June.</p>

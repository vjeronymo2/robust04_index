			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following review of the 13 May issue  of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Anger Over Lawyer's Death    2. Eyewitness Account of Detention, Torture    3. Islamic Writer Banned From AL-AHRAM    4. Sudanese Minister Interviewed    5. A Muslim Brotherhood Version of Pluralism  <H5>  ANGER OVER LAWYER'S DEATH </H5>   Expressions of anger by the Bar Association and other  quarters over the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in  police custody is featured in more than one article. A  front-page banner headline reads "Madani's Death Marks a Climax  in Government Terror." A 300-word front-page report by Ashraf  Khalil and Khali Yunus describe a gathering at the Bar  Association on 12 May and a planned demonstration on 17 May.  The report notes that: "The Arab Bar Association issued a  statement denouncing the crime and stressing its full solidarity  with the colleagues at the Egyptian Bar Association."    A 600-word letter by the New York-based human rights group  Middle East Watch to President Mubarak appears on pages 1 and 7.  The letter calls on President Mubarak "to take immediate action  to reveal the cause of death of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and ensure  that those responsible for the incident will receive the  harshest punishment under the law."    A 3,000-word report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im, Ashraf Khalil,  Khalid Yunus, and Tariq 'Abd-al-Hamid on page 3 describes a  rally held at the Bar Association in Cairo on 10 May to denounce  Madani's death. Various prominent lawyers, including a member  of the People's Assembly, Kamal Khalid, speak on the occasion,  denouncing "police brutality" and "human rights abuses."    Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn, in a  wide-ranging  5,000-word commentary on page 5, finds an epic dimension in the  lawyers' anger: "Let the upcoming strike by the lawyers be a  roaring expression of our pent-up anger. Let all other sections  of society come to the lawyers' support. Heads of professional  associations and of parties should march with the lawyers in  protest.    "Yes, we have to answer a challenge with a challenge. They  [the government] wanted to intimidate us, but we, God willing,  will turn this into an epic that will lead us to restore human  rights in this country."  <H5>  EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF DETENTION, TORTURE </H5>   An unattributed 350-word report on page 3 cites a former  detainee recounting his experience while in police custody. The  former detainee, Midhat Khalil Jalal, was also "the last witness  who saw martyr 'Abd-al-Harith Madani before his death."    Jalal says that he was arrested on 26 April 1994 on charges  of distributing leaflets "warning of sectarian strife" in the  al-Haram neighborhood of Cairo. He adds: "Two days later, I was  taken to the State Security Intelligence building on Jabir  Ibn-Hayyan Street. There, I was blindfolded. An officer came  into the room who asked me a lot of such questions as: What  group do you belong to? What books do you read? What mosques  do you go to? When he did not like my answers he gave me a good  beating, shouting insults I had never heard before. He also  said that detention would do me good."    Jalal then says that he was taken to an overcrowded cell,  where on the night of 26 April [contradiction with the dates  mentioned above is as published] he met lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith  Madani. He says that Madani "stayed with us in the cell for one  hour. We asked him why he was arrested and he said: I do not  know. He was self-composed. An hour later he was taken away.  We did not see him any more. Later I heard news of his death  on radio London [the BBC]."    Describing torture in the "terror cell," Jalal says: "Every  time the cell's door opened, we would die of fear, particularly  at 1200 and 2300, the times of the `torture shifts' when some of  us would be led away after being blindfolded to a room on top of  the cell. The detainee would be suspended at the door and a  bout of terrible torture would begin, including electric shock  and whipping. When the victim fell silent we would know that he  had fainted. He would return in a terrible state, not even able  to drink water.    "I helped one of the detainees drink water because his hand  `was too stiff' from frequent `hanging' at the door. The bodies  of the victims were full of bruises and cuts. I was released on  Friday, 29 April, but before that one of the officers told me  that if I was ever seen again in the mosque to which I go, I  would be thrown into jail for life."   <H5>    ISLAMIC WRITER BANNED FROM AL-AHRAM </H5>   As part of his lengthy and versatile page-5 commentary,  'Adil  Husayn denounces the banning of Islamic writer Fahmi Huwaydi  from the semi-official newspaper AL-AHRAM. He writes:    "Who decided to ban the distinguished writer Fahmi Huwaydi  from writing in AL-AHRAM? Fahmi Huwaydi is an internationally  acclaimed writer and to prevent him from writing is to deal a  savage blow to the country's modest scope of free expression.    "The ban was preceded and accompanied by a campaign in pro-  government newspapers attacking everything Huwaydi writes. The  campaign targeted not only Huwaydi but anyone writing about  Islam without exception. The campaign did not spare al-Azhar  ulema and the worst insults were leveled at the Awqaf minister  himself."    Having thoroughly denounced what he sees as a  government-blessed press campaign against Islamists, Husayn sees  the campaign from an international perspective: "Some may  imagine that questioning and attacking Islam is a form of free  expression. But what we are faced with today is much more  serious than a view expressed in a number of articles or books.  We are facing a premeditated and unabashed onslaught by the  forces of international arrogance, including Zionism, against  the Muslim people. What is being published in Egypt is a mere  translation of what is being written abroad. Hundreds of  millions of dollars are being spent to finance such writings.  We are not facing just a number of deviant individuals but a  diabolical foreign scheme that some of our writers, knowingly or  unknowingly, are colluding with."  <H5>  SUDANESE MINISTER INTERVIEWED </H5>   A 2,500-word report on an interview with 'Ali 'Uthman Taha,  Sudanese Minister of Social Planning, by Qutb al-'Arabi in  Khartoum appears on page 8. The date of the interview is not  given.    Early in his report, al-'Arabi informs us that the Social  Planning Ministry is "a ministry created to carry out the task  of social changes based on an Islamic foundation."    The Sudanese minister is cited as saying that the "stability  of the domestic regime is no longer in question," that  "opposition at home and abroad is weakening," and that "military  resistance" is waning.    The minister argues that the Islamic regime is gaining  popularity and elaborates on several steps that the government  is pondering to fortify the Islamic character of the state. "As  for popular response to the Islamic propositions of the  Salvation Government, Minister Taha said: The popular movement  response to Islamic slogans outstripped the actual political  reach. The political regime is still taking gradual steps but  various sectors of society, including the general public, social  organizations, tribes, intellectuals, and popular figures, are  all joining the Islamic trend with a zest hard to accommodate  within the framework of the national conference or popular  committees. The response is massive, the prospect promising,  and the urge strong."    As examples of government efforts to encourage piety, the  minister mentions that the cabinet is examining proposals to  start the working day with the dawn prayer and to train  professionals, such as doctors and engineers, to spread the word  of Islam within their professions.   <H5>    A MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD VERSION OF PLURALISM </H5>   A 2,000-word essay entitled "Muslim Brotherhood: A Brief  Word on Consultation [shura] in Islam" and signed "the Muslim  Brothers" appears on page 13. In a language that is part  theology and part modern political jargon, the essay provides  the group's view of government. It fails to point out whether  this view is a recapitulation or a revision of the group's  position and does not clarify whether it is part of any  political initiative.    The essay opens with a Koranic verse often cited to indicate  the democratic nature of Islam: "Those who hearken to their  Lord, and establish regular prayer; who conduct their affairs by  mutual consultation; who spend out of what we bestow on them for  sustenance." This verse, the essay tells us, means that "the  people are the source of powers."    The essay then briefs us on the lives of the early Caliphs,  who, it argues, came to power through "selection by the general  Muslim public." Since then, the Muslim people have had many  rulers, some good and many bad, but "never has the Islamic  shari'ah been abandoned, neither as a faith, nor a reference nor  a constitution."    Islamic rule, good or bad, only ended with the crusades:  "Never has a ruler or an Islamic people adopted a reference  other than shari'ah until the Islamic people were visited by the  imperialism of the crusaders. The crusaders invaded them, ruled  them, and imposed their laws and principles on them. A  procession of agents, following on the footsteps of the  crusaders, then came to power."    From this, the essay concludes that Muslim rulers should be  selected by the people from among the capable and devout: "The  people have the right to select, with their good judgment, those  whose piety, probity, knowledge, and efficiency are commensurate  to the tasks of office."    Also, the state needs to have a constitution based on the  Koran. "We believe--although the Koran and the teachings of the  prophet are the supreme constitution of Muslims and that whoever  or whatever challenges them is wrong--that the nation should  have a written constitution. The nation should formulate and  agree upon that constitution, which should be inspired by the  texts of the lofty shari'ah."    The essay proposes that a parliament is needed to implement  the constitution. The constitution, it says, should "contain  enough principles and guarantees to protect public and private  freedoms of all people--Muslims and non-Muslims alike--and make  the government a consultation affair [shura] based on the power  of the people. The constitution should define the rulers'  responsibility before the people. It should state a way of  questioning and correcting the rulers peaceably and successfully  if they go wrong and change them if needs be. This requires the  presence of a representative council with effective legislative  and control powers, a council embodying the true will of the  people as expressed through fair and free elections. The  resolutions of such a council should be binding."    Having expounded its view on the constitution and the  parliament, the Brotherhood's essay proposes limited-term  presidency: "We are also of the opinion that--considering that  the president of the state is just an elected official--the  presidency must be for a limited term and must not be renewed  except for a limited period to avoid despotism."    After giving a mix of theological and common-sense  arguments,  the essay recommends a pluralism that resides within the  confines of shari'ah: "We, therefore, believe in the plurality  of parties in Islamic society and that the authority need not  place restrictions on the formation and activity of political  groups or parties. Every group should be left free to advocate  its views and expose its method... [ellipsis as published] So  long as Islamic shari'ah is the ultimate constitution and the  law is applied by an independent and protected judiciary, away  from the influence of any authority or side, and so long as the  judiciary is intellectually, scientifically, and theologically  capable, this should be sufficient to guarantee the probity of  society and its commitment to the right path."    The essay concludes: "We also see that the acceptance of the  multi-party system in the Islamic society, in the way that we  just stated, involves the acceptance of the fact that power may  change hands among political groups and parties through periodic  elections. May God be blessed first and foremost. God's prayers  be upon Prophet Muhammad and his scions and disciples."</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Observer: Exhumed With UK undertakers mourning their own deep recession, I hear that 40-year-old Howard Hodgson, who in his heyday was Britain's highest-paid funeral director, is planning a resurrection. Only three months after retiring from the graveyard business with a Pounds 6m fortune and big plans to write historical biographies, Hodgson seems keen to return to the stock market. Only this time he intends to concentrate on the pre-dead market. Hodgson, who began life as an insurance salesman before rescuing the family's under-taking business, plans to target the over-55s with financial services to be sold by a small army of retired bank managers and accountants. 'For the first time ever the third age, over 55, has got money and does want services,' says Hodgson in a pause from filming 'How Euro are You?' a BBC-TV series warning businesses to prepare for 1992. Meanwhile, he insists his writing career is not stillborn. Currently working on 'How to become Dead Rich: a funeral director tells all' - Hunter Davies suggested the title - Hodgson has not given up hope of writing the definitive biography of Paul McCartney.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULING PUT OFF IN DISPUTE BETWEEN CITY,  POLICE  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge has postponed a ruling in a labor dispute between the  Long Beach police union and city management, while indicating that she will  side with the city.  </P> <P> The 610-member Long Beach Police Officers Assn. is trying to stop the city from  imposing a new contract without the union's consent. But at a Los Angeles court  hearing Thursday, Judge Dzintra Janavs disagreed with the union's arguments,  saying federal case law supported the city's actions.  </P> <P> She decided however, that the city had not given the union adequate notice that  it was going to declare an impasse in the 9-month-old bargaining talks and  adopt its final contract offer. Dzintra told the city to give the union its  final contract position to allow the membership to vote on it before the next  court hearing. In the meantime, the city has agreed not to implement the  provisions of the new contract.  </P></p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Prison officers' dispute curbed MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, yesterday won a High Court injunction preventing the Prison Officers' Association from stepping up its industrial action next week. The association had threatened to stop accepting most admissions to prisons for three days starting on Monday - a move the Prison Service management had warned would represent a serious threat to law and order. A High Court judge, Mr Justice May, yesterday accepted the government's arguments that, because prison officers hold the office of constables, they are not protected under employment law if they take industrial action that breaches their contracts. However, the judge agreed with lawyers for the association that the logical consequences of his ruling meant the association could no longer effectively act as a trade union. He added that it was 'remarkable' that it had been treated as a union for so long without the issue of its protection under employment law being challenged. Mr John Bartell, the association's chairman, said the union was certain to appeal against the injunction and would continue the legal fight as long as necessary. He said: 'The home secretary now has a major problem on his hands. This ruling is only part of a long legal process. 'In the long run, the courts will vindicate the fact that we are a trade union. I do not believe the public will allow this shabby recourse to the courts to create another GCHQ.' The association's national executive was last night meeting to discuss its next move. Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service, welcomed the injunction. He denied it had been sought as a back-door means of breaking the association, saying the management wished to have constructive relations with prison staff. The injunction had been sought 'with the greatest of reluctance' and only because of the seriousness of the action threatened. Had the action gone ahead, an extra 1,700 prisoners would have had to be accommodated in police cells by next Wednesday. A ballot of the association's membership last month approved action short of an all-out strike to protest against the government's market-testing proposals. It has already begun limited action in the form of a work-to-rule.</p>

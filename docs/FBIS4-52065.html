			<p>BFN     [Text] The building of the Nungna suspension  bridge--another proud creation of the era of the Workers'  Party--which is underway in conformity with our party's grand  plan--is being pushed ahead vigorously.    To provide our people with a more wonderful and cultural  living condition, the supreme commander General Kim Chong-il has  himself initiated the building of the Nungna suspension bridge.  He has shown a great trust by entrusting this honorable task to  the soldiers of the Korean People's Army unit to which Comrade  (Kang Chin-sop) belongs.    All the soldiers, boundlessly encouraged by supreme  commander  General Kim Chong-il's great trust and warm affection, have been  registering new upsurges day in and day out in the building of  the bridge .    The soldiers have already finished within a short period of  time the large-scale construction, including setting up the  bridge's piers and (?erecting beams). They have set a goal to  build several crane units on their own by highly displaying the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude to resolve  everything with one's own strength even if the higher echelons  do not supply the necessities, although it would be better if  the higher echelons did supply them. They have achieved a  breakthrough in the construction by finally building the cranes,  while actively seeking out inner reserves, putting together  strength and wisdom, and successfully solving pending technical  problems.    At the present moment, the soldiers are markedly increasing  the speed of the construction with a high conviction of victory.</p>

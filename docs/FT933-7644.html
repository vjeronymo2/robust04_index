			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Management: Driving out the old regime - John Griffiths describes how Toyota's working practices transformed one of its UK car components suppliers Toyota, Japan's largest car maker, began production in Britain only in January. But this pioneer of lean production systems, which is widely recognised as setting a world standard in efficient manufacture, is already having a dramatic impact on the management practices of more than 150 UK and continental component makers. Since the beginning of this year Toyota's first car for Europe, the Carina E, has been emerging at an ever faster rate from the assembly line at the company's Pounds 800m-plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire. As with Nissan's Sunderland factory and Honda's at Swindon, the line is being supplied not by the once-feared influx of Japanese component companies  -which has almost totally failed to materialise - but by mainly indigenous British and continental companies. They are widely varied in their size and activities; from British Steel's Llanwern plant in south Wales, supplying coated steel strip, to small concerns providing the 10,000-plus individual parts which make up a modern car. Last month a Department of Employment-commissioned study suggested the work practices and culture needed to meet Japanese cost and quality targets are resented by those suppliers' work forces. But there is no visible sign of that at Advanced Engineering Systems (AES), at Tipton, west Midlands. AES, a supplier of machined castings and other parts to Toyota, Honda and Rover, provides one of the most vivid examples of the cultural adjustments a British supplier, with its roots stretching deep into the old, adversarial traditions of the UK industry, has had to make en route to its goal of becoming a world-class supplier. A year ago AES was part of Beans Industries, a former British Leyland subsidiary which, among other things, was churning out reconditioned engines for the Unipart group. Unipart bought 80 per cent of AES from Beans, with an option to acquire the remainder shortly, purely because the company had contracts to supply seven components to Toyota. Unipart Industries - the group's components manufacturing arm - had already learned much about quality from Honda. In a benchmarking study of 17 Japanese and UK components firms carried out last year by Dan Jones - co-author of The Machine That Changed the World - and Andersen Consulting, it was the only UK company to match the best Japanese companies on quality. But the study showed it was unable to ally quality with Japanese productivity. What better way to try to close the gap than to supply to one of the most efficient of all Japan's vehicle makers? Despite his previous experience of working with Honda even Frank Burns, AES' managing director, was shaken by Toyota's reaction when asked for its approval of the Unipart move. 'We said we wanted to acquire the business and why - and did they have any objections? They said 'we don't mind but please hire these 20 people' and gave us a list of individual names. We did, of course and that gave us an early insight into the incredible detail with which Toyota tackles everything it does.' Burns and David Nicholas, managing director of the parent Unipart Industries, had no problem persuading Beans employees to co-operate, and were able to offer the inducements of improved staff status and other elements of the Unipart package. 'They all wanted to join the 'new world', despite there being no recognition for unions,' recalls Burns. (Unipart derecognised all unions two years ago, although there is no ban on membership.) AES remains a small company, employing 40 now and an expected 50 by the end of this year. It is divided into two main areas, one working for Honda, the other for Toyota. The Honda area, which has been running for a year, is well advanced, refining the team working systems brought from Premier Exhausts, another Unipart subsidiary, as the combined experiences of working for Honda and Toyota are absorbed. Training is top priority - to achieve quality and to address the productivity issues highlighted by the benchmarking study. Fifty per cent of team members can perform every operation on the 13-machine Honda sector; 60 per cent can perform 80 per cent of the tasks and the proportions are climbing weekly. That the training bill is currently one half of wage costs also illustrates one of the key operating influences of Toyota still alien to a vast swathe of UK industry. AES invested in all the necessary systems and capacity for the Toyota contract months before production began. Eighty per cent of the contract's cost base was built into the opening phase of manufacture - a proportion likely to be the norm for all future business. 'It means', says Burns, 'that we have the right machines, quality standards, manning levels, training etc so that costs fall rapidly as production gets under way. The classic western approach is minimal initial investment, rectifying mistakes and putting in more investment as production builds.' Three months ago, Burns went to Japan to take part in Toyota's latest production system course. He found himself looking anew at areas where he had thought he already had a lot of the answers. He is teaching the course to AES' employees and later the whole group. The insights about waste, he freely admits, left him initially incredulous - notably the proposition that up to 85 per cent of employees could not be working at any one time. 'They said that around the factory you could normally find 5 per cent of people visibly not working. But then a further 25 per cent could be waiting, even if briefly, for deliveries or for a machine to finish its cycle. Then you could have a further 30 per cent building inventory. Toyota regards that as not really working because there is no immediate contribution to the manufacturing operation. Last, they figure that up to 25 per cent can be working to method and requirement - but the method itself is not efficient, involving wasteful movements for example. 'I got back; we checked, and found those numbers weren't far off. The problem is that UK managers tend to focus on the 5 per cent visibly not working and possibly those waiting - and are totally unaware about the rest.' The benefits arising from Toyota's unrelenting attention to detail has led AES to adopt U-shaped production cells, in which one operator can move easily from one machine to another, controlling a sequence of processes, rather than operating just one machine. Initially, each machine required an operator to press two centrally mounted buttons and watch the process begin. A visiting Japanese engineer suggested replacing the buttons with Toyota's flap-type switch mounted at one end of the machine that the operator could hit with the flat of his hand at the start of his tour of the machines. Burns acknowledges it sounds trivial. 'But they are an integral part of Toyota Production System (TPS). And in saving one second they equate to 64 man weeks on the seven lines. We reckon we can save 2-2.5 per cent of the labour bill a year - that's the entire training bill for some companies'. The switches illustrate the different philosophy required for TPS. 'The natural, British management response when the suggestion came about moving buttons was 'Pounds 25,000 - just for moving buttons]' And on that ground, in the past, it would never have been done.' The Japanese visitor produced 185 kaizen (continuous improvement) suggestions. And AES' teams have come up with half as more again. The application of TPS principles is already showing in productivity. On the Honda flywheels line, four men were producing 750 flywheels a week on two shifts. Introduction of the U-cells and related improvements, plus a third man lifted output to 1,000 a week. The third man has now been redeployed but output remains at 1,000 a week. Premier has also introduced the Toyota U-cell system, with reported productivity gains of 30-40 per cent. Perhaps warning other European components groups about the cost and quality benefits deriving from such close links with the Japanese, one leading European vehicle producer is switching to Premier as its exhaust systems supplier.</p>

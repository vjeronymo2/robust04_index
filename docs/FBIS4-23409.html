			<p>BFN     [Text] For some time now a lot of attention has been paid  to the presence of so-called South African mercenaries in  Angola. The soldiers are assisting in the training of MPLA  [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] soldiers. An  international news team succeeded in visiting one of the  controversial training camps, and Nan Roux has the details:    [Begin recording] [Roux] These soldiers are former members  of  the South African Special Forces, a special unit within the  South African Defense Force. They have already been in Angola  for a year now and are involved in the training of their former  enemy, the Angolan Government, the MPLA. Many see them as  mercenaries but they do not agree with this. They insist that  they are not fighting the war for the Angolan Government, but  that they are merely helping the MPLA soldiers to fight their  own war more effectively.    [Executive Outcomes official Karl Deats, in English]  ...already, that our function over here comprises a couple of  things, first of all, in an advisory ... in an advisory  capacity. Secondly, in a socioeconomic assistance role, and  then the main function that we had over here is to conduct  training.    [Roux] The South Africans have three training camps in  Angola: in the country's diamond province, Lunda Sul, as well as  south of the capital Luanda. The camps are used for the  training of new troops. The soldiers are instructed in basic  techniques, such as weapons maintenance, radio signals, and  fighting techniques. The South Africans originally entered  Angola under the name of a South African company, Executive  Outcomes. The company was approached by oil companies to  protect their installations in Angola. No one knows how long  the South Africans will remain in Angola, but according to  Executive Outcomes this will depend on the Angolan Government  and their success in the battle against UNITA [National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola].

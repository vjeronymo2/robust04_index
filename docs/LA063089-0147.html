			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS MAKE FOUR ERRORS, HELP PADRES SWEEP SERIES, 5-3  </P> <P> Those Dodger observers who have been whispering, "What next?" were granted an  answer Thursday night.  </P> <P> Next: The defense.  </P> <P> A team that had committed fewer errors than all but two other National League  teams committed four, including two in one game-costing inning, and lost, 5-3,  to the San Diego Padres before 36,128 fans at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Not only did the Padres sweep this three-game series, they ultimately made the  Dodgers look like an old broom in doing it. The Dodgers, after making only 59  errors in their first 76 games -- 14 fewer errors than the Padres had made --  completely fell apart during a three-run Padre fourth inning that eventually  broke Fernando Valenzuela's personal four-game win streak.  </P> <P> Jeff Hamilton, who committed one of the errors when he dropped a throw at third  base, later recalled the play.  </P> <P> "There was my play, there were other plays. . . . It's all compounding, and we  can't figure it out," he said. "Maybe we're trying too hard to figure it out.  Maybe we're racking our brains too much."  </P> <P> With the score 1-1, the fourth inning began rather routinely, Tony Gwynn  getting a single to left off Valenzuela. Jack Clark then walked, something he  had done 66 times this year, more than anyone in the league.  </P> <P> But Chris James laid down a sacrifice bunt that appeared merely to sacrifice  the Padres' chances, as Valenzuela grabbed the ball and threw to third baseman  Hamilton to force Gwynn.  </P> <P> Except Hamilton dropped the throw. No sun, no funny spin, no real excuses.  </P> <P> "I just dropped it," Hamilton said. "It hit the heel of my glove and bounced  out."  </P> <P> With the bases loaded, up stepped Garry Templeton, who hit a simple grounder to  Hamilton, who made the simple throw to catcher Mike Scioscia to force Gwynn at  the plate. With one out, everything seemed routine again.  </P> <P> For about two minutes. Six pitches later, on a full count, Valenzuela walked  Benito Santiago, who does not lead anybody in walks this year. In fact, it was  only the eighth walk he has drawn in 233 at-bats.  </P> <P> "That was my fault, my walk, you can't have that," said Valenzuela, who fell to  4-6 even though his earned-run average dropped from 4.15 to 3.92. In seven  innings, he gave up only one earned run on eight hits.  </P> <P> "Yes, it was only one earned run, but I put the men on base that caused the  run," Valenzuela said. "Tonight is not the best I can do, or the best we can  do."  </P> <P> But wait, it got worse. Shortly after Clark trotted home with the Padres' first  run of the inning on the walk, Shawn Abner followed with a double-play ground  ball to shortstop Alfredo Griffin.  </P> <P> Griffin made the quick toss to second baseman Mariano Duncan, who made a nice  pivot, a nice release -- but the ball went into the dirt, scooting underneath  first baseman Eddie Murray's glove.  </P> <P> "A bad throw, I blame it on nothing," said Duncan, who was starting in place of  the injured Willie Randolph, although Randolph later pinch-hit in the seventh  inning despite a sore hamstring.  </P> <P> James had already scored on Abner's grounder, and Templeton took advantage of  the Duncan's error to score another run. After Padre starter and winner Dennis  Rasmussen added a single to move Abner to third, Valenzuela escaped the mess  when Bip Roberts flied out.  </P> <P> But the damage had been done. This fourth straight loss equals the Dodgers'  season high, a streak that they had achieved three times. With the National  League West-leading San Francisco Giants winning, the Dodgers fell 9 1/2 games  out of first place. Now, the only thing between last year's World Series  champions and the basement are the Atlanta Braves, for whom the Dodgers are  certainly thankful.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, gave the first official indication that the  Dodgers might be close to finding a center fielder when he praised Jose  Gonzalez. Going into the game, Gonzalez was on an eight-game hitting streak,  with 11 hits in his last 23 at-bats (.478), all of which had improved his  part-time average to .352. Then against San Diego Thursday night, he singled in  the fourth inning and singled again in the sixth inning to drive in a run. He  also has made several excellent fielding plays in the past few days as a  starting right fielder and center fielder. "One thing that has happened to  hearten me is that the opportunity has been there for Jose, and he has come  through," Claire said. "He has become a good example of the overall philosophy  of the organization, to develop our own talent. He hasn't been spotlighted that  much, but he is showing an ability to step in there and play every day, an  ability to play center field at the major league level. The only thing he has  not shown us is power (no homers, only two extra base hits in his first 25  games), but we know he has that. And he has shown us so much more. We have been  very impressed."  </P> <P> If Gonzalez still proves not to be the answer, a couple of other prospects have  surfaced, according to league scouts. They say the Dodgers are looking at,  among others, Milwaukee's Gary Sheffield and Glenn Braggs, and the Pittsburgh  Pirates' Barry Bonds. Sheffield is the unhappy Brewer rookie shortstop who can  also play outfield. He is hitting .265 with four homers and 27 RBIS and has  good speed. Braggs, the Brewer left fielder, is hitting .269 with 11 homers and  40 RBIs. Bonds, meanwhile, visited Dodger Stadium during his day off Thursday  after the Pirates arrived in town to play the Dodgers in a weekend series  beginning today. "Talk to me about that tomorrow, this is my vacation day,"  Bonds said about any interest he might have in the Dodgers. He is hitting .244  with 10 homers and 28 RBIs. Pitchers Tim Leary or Tim Belcher probably would be  involved in any trade the Dodgers make.  </P> <P> Claire said that he was satisfied with Belcher's attitude after the pitcher's  early Wednesday morning shouting match in the Dodger dugout with umpire Ed  Montague.  </P></p>

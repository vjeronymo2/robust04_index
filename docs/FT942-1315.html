			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF in talks with Thorn EMI Thomson-CSF, the French electronics company, is planning to buy the missile electronics and optronics business of Thorn EMI, the diversified UK industrial group. The deal, which would give Thomson-CSF the European lead in missile electronics that it already holds in optronics, is subject to final contract negotiation and approval by the French and UK governments. The Thorn EMI business has a turnover of Pounds 90m, with slightly more than two-thirds coming from missiles. Mr Francois Carayol, strategic director for Thomson-CSF, said the deal would lead to closer co-operation with British Aerospace Dynamics, with whom Thorn EMI works on the Rapier and Asraam missiles. It would also increase Thomson-CSF's workshare on the Trigat anti-tank missile. Mr Carayol claimed this would not cause conflict with Matra, the missile making division of the French Lagardere group, which is separately negotiating with BAe to form a joint missile company. Thomson-CSF already has a Anglo-French joint venture with Pilkington Optronics. It said the new deal would give it a role in the European Fighter Aircraft.</p>

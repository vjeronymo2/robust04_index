			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Decline at Xerox is steeper than expected XEROX, which issued a profits warning in May, yesterday unveiled a sharper-than-expected decline in second-quarter earnings from its core document processing business. For the three months to June 30, Xerox net income fell to Dollars 112m, or 96 cents a primary share, from Dollars 124m, or Dollars 1.12, a year earlier. Income from the core document processing business fell to Dollars 111m, or 95 cents, from Dollars 124m, or Dollars 1.12, last year. Revenues slipped to Dollars 3.54bn from Dollars 3.55bn the previous year. Xerox warned investors in May to expect an earnings downturn. Its shares then dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 . The stock was Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 73 5/8 at the close yesterday. Most analysts had expected earnings of about Dollars 1.03 a share. Xerox blamed some of its problems on the unexpectedly lengthy process of reorganising its sales force and the ensuing disruption. It said earnings were hurt by weak European economies and an unconvincing recovery in the US. Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said: 'The economic environment in both the US and Europe is causing customers to scale back spending on office equipment'. Document processing gross margins fell in the quarter, reflecting a shift towards low-end products with lower margins, pricing pressure and unfavourable currency translations. Mr Allaire said Xerox would strive for earnings growth for the full year. But he noted the European economic environment would probably remain soft in the second half. First-half net income was Dollars 301m, or Dollars 2.73 a share. A year earlier, the company took charges of Dollars 764m for accounting changes which contributed to a loss of Dollars 405m, or Dollars 4.56. Income from document processing edged 4 per cent higher in the period to Dollars 236m from Dollars 227m. Revenues were Dollars 6.84bn, against Dollars 6.86bn.</p>

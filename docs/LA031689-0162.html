			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> GUN DEALER TO FACE TRIAL  </P> <P> A Los Angeles gun dealer accused of the illegal sale of semiautomatic assault  rifles will face trial in Pasadena Municipal Court May 1 after pleading  innocent to the charges this week.  </P> <P> The dealer, Ology Gibson, is accused of failing to obtain a Pasadena business  license and a permit for an outdoor sale before selling assault rifles in the  parking lot of a Pasadena gun store last month.  </P> <P> He also is charged with three misdemeanor violations of the state Dangerous  Weapons Control Act, including failure to observe a 15-day waiting period for  concealed weapons. The city prosecutor's office contends that assault rifles  are small enough to be concealed and therefore should require the same kind of  waiting period imposed on handguns.  </P></p>

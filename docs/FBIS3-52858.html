			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Betzelem, the Israeli human rights  organization, has called on the Palestinian political  organizations to put an immediate stop to the torture and  killing of residents suspected of cooperating with Israeli  authorities. At the same time, at a news conference in  Jerusalem this morning, the organization criticized Israel's  deliberate recruitment of collaborators. Details from reporter  Mark Weiss:    At almost every Betzelem news conference over the years, the  organization has been accused of avoiding the issue of  collaborator killings while concentrating exclusively on human  rights abuses committed by the Israeli authorities. Yuval  Ginbar from Betzelem denies the accusation. [passage omitted]    Between 750 and 950 Palestinians suspected of collaboration  have been killed since the start of the intifadah, many after  suffering severe torture. Both Israeli and Palestinian sources  estimate that more that half of the Palestinians killed as  collaborators did not in fact work for the authorities.  According to a sample investigation conducted by Betzelem, many  of those called collaborators had committed so-called social or  criminal offenses, such as drug-trafficking or homosexuality.  Many suspected collaborators were killed without any prior  interrogation or judicial proceeding.    Betzelem considers the Palestinian political organizations,  whose activists torture and kill, as responsible for these gross  violations of human rights, along with the perpetrators  themselves. The organization calls on the Palestinian political  organizations to put an immediate stop to the torture and  killing of suspected collaborators, to sever all financial and  organizational ties to groups that commit such acts, and to  place suspected perpetrators on trial.    Betzelem also criticizes the Israeli Government for  flaunting  international law, for what it terms the exploitation and  extortion tactics employed to recruit collaborators. The  recruitment of agents from the occupied territories by these  methods is prohibited under the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Betzelem calls on the Israeli Government to end the recruitment  of collaborators, to stop using collaborators in illegal actions  such as violent interrogations, and to enforce the law equally  against collaborators who use violence or commit other criminal  acts.</p>

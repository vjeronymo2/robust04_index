			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 May (MENA)--Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, Arab  League envoy to Yemen and Arab League assistant secretary  general for military affairs, and members of his delegation  returned to Cairo this afternoon following a visit of several  days to Yemen.    During the visit, the Arab League delegation met with Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and a number of Yemeni leaders in  a bid to stop the bloodshed in Yemen.    In his arrival statement at Cairo airport, Bayraqdar said  that he had conveyed to the Yemeni president the Arab League's  appeal to end the fighting and to begin a dialogue. He said  that the Arab League delegation also met with Deputy Prime  Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Alfi and members of the Presidential  Council and reiterated the Arab League's concern for the  consequences if the fighting continues. The delegation urged the  two sides to halt fighting.    Bayraqdar pointed out that the officials in Sanaa had  explained to him the causes that led to the outbreak of  fighting, the efforts made by President Salih before the war,  and the current circumstances. He said that he conveyed a  message from the Arab League secretary general to the Yemeni  president, urging him to end the fighting and to pave the way  for dialogue.    The Arab League envoy noted the results of his talks with  the  Yemeni president showed that Salih cannot accept a cease-fire  for the time being, particularly after the clashes and fighting  between the two armed forces. Bayraqdar said that the Yemeni  president told him halting the fighting is contingent upon  several conditions, including the recognition of the  constitutional legitimacy, the safeguarding of the Yemeni  peoples' unity and land, the safeguarding of the unity of the  army, and the merger of the army. The Yemeni president,  according to the Arab League envoy, stressed that a cessation of  fighting is currently ruled out unless those responsible for it  are arrested, including 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the prime minister,  and eight leading members of the Yemeni Socialist Party.    In his statement, Bayraqdar said that the Yemeni president  maintained that he will not accept any Arab initiative, not even  by the Arab League, until the perpetrators, whether  secessionists or others, are identified. Therefore, the Arab  governments must deal with the constitutional Yemeni Government.    The Arab League assistant secretary general said that during  the lengthy talks, the Yemeni president stressed that either the  perpetrators surrender and stand trial so that those responsible  for the outbreak of the events are identified, or they leave  Aden for any Arab or foreign country as they wish.    The Yemeni president again expressed his thanks to the Arab  League secretary general and the League Council for their good  offices.</p>

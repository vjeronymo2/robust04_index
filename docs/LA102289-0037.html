			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMODELING: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> TREE TRIMMING  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS, when confronted by a tree that needs trimming, usually hire  whomever gives them the least expensive estimate. They often regret the  decision. "It isn't easy to find a reliable tree-maintenance service," says  Alden Kelley, an arborist consultant in Fullerton. "There are no official  licensing standards for the profession." But, he says, consumers can protect  themselves by following some guidelines.  </P> <P> Tree trimming professionals recommend that homeowners get at least three  estimates. One should be from a large company with a reputation to protect, and  one should be a small tradesman or someone who advertises in the local  newspaper. In all cases, check references, going to recent jobs to check the  quality of the work. A small number of tree trimmers are certified by the  International Society of Arboriculture and have to meet high standards to get  the ISA designation. Finding one of them might be worth the trouble.  </P> <P> A word on insurance: Most large companies carry protection, but many small  firms and individuals do not. Insist on proof that the tree trimmer has  workman's compensation and liability. "Get the proof directly from the  company's insurance carrier," says Robert Kelley (no relation to Alden) of  Kelley Tree Specialists in Los Angeles. "Ask for a copy of the insurance binder  -- many people dummy up papers to look legitimate." If a homeowner's insurance  fully protects them -- against liability, property damage from hired workers  and injury to those workers -- the homeowner can hire a skilled trimmer who  does not carry insurance.  </P> <P> The most important thing is trimming skill. "Like a well-styled haircut, a  properly trimmed tree is not conspicuous," says Alden Kelley. "It should have  much the same shape as before." Don't take the trimmer's word alone that he is  good; watch him work, if possible. Certain trees are trimmed with a chain saw,  but check for bad cuts, rips in the bark and remaining stubs. Other trees need  fine, or feather, pruning and will be trimmed by handsaw and pruner only; look  for stubs and tearing of the bark.  </P> <P> Fine pruning requires a light touch -- most trimmers don't have it. A trimmer  who can fine prune is worth any extra cost. "It's an all-or-nothing type of  thing," says Alden Kelley. "Invest profitably, or pay 2 to 10 times the actual  cost in damage. You might save $200 but lower the assessable value of your tree  by $2,000."  </P> <P> An average minimum figure is about $35 an hour, but most jobs are priced by  what the market will bear ("You need at least three estimates to get a  competitive price," Robert Kelley says.) Figure on paying at least $100, with  no limit on the other end of the scale. People who routinely pay $400 for work  on their car flinch when asked to pay the same for tree work -- even if that  tree adds $5,000 to the value of their property. A well-cared-for tree is an  investment that keeps growing.  </P> <P>  For basic information, contact the City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Street  Maintenance, Street Tree Division. It also provides information on choosing  types of trees and where to plant but does not give referrals for tree trimmers  or companies.  </P> <P>  Write for general information to International Society of Arboriculture,  Western Chapter, 232 Archer Way, Nipomo, Calif. 93444.  </P> <P>  For referrals for International Society of Arboriculture certified arborists,  write International Society of Arboriculture, Certification Program, Denise  Froehlich, P.O. Box 424, St. Helena, Calif. 94574.  </P></p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Kitty Little purchase as profits double SHARES IN Kitty Little Group rose 10p to 31p yesterday as the USM-quoted designer and manufacturer of consumer goods reported pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 26,000 to Pounds 54,000 for the first half of 1993. It also announced the acquisition of Samco, the market leader in branded sunglasses, for up to Pounds 2.85m, and a proposed share issue to raise about Pounds 2m to fund the acquisition and provide increased working capital. Turnover for the period fell slightly to Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 2.69m). Earnings per share worked through at 0.53p (0.06p) and the group is paying an interim dividend of 0.5p (nil), with a forecast final of not less than 1p. Mr Graham Webster, chairman, said the acquisition should double group turnover, which, together with planned overhead savings, should have a profound impact on the group's future performance.</p>

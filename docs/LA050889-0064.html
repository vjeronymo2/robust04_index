			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBYA REPORTEDLY SOUGHT TO KILL U.S. ENVOY TO ITALY  </P> <P> Washington's outgoing envoy to Italy was quoted Sunday as saying Libyan gunmen  came to Rome to kill him in 1981.  </P> <P> Maxwell M. Rabb, who is ending eight years as U.S. ambassador, told the  magazine Epoca in an interview to be published today that he was awakened in  his hotel during a trip to Milan on Oct. 13, 1981, and told to fly home to the  United States.  </P> <P> "I was to have been assassinated the next day," Rabb said in the interview.  "Five Libyans had been captured by police in a Rome hotel, and one of them was  to have been my killer.  </P> <P> "I can't go into details for security reasons, but they had practically put a  price on my head and another on the head of the U.S. consul in Palermo," Rabb  was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> The Libyan Embassy was not available for comment, but Libya, accused by  Washington of supporting world terrorism, dismissed a similar accusation in  1986 as U.S. propaganda.  </P></p>

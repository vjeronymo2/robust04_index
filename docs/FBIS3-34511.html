The agreement, signed by Finance Minister Sami Qammuh and  Japanese Ambassador Yuji Ikeda, followed a decision in June by  the Paris Club of major government creditors to ease Jordan's  foreign debts.    Under the accord, Japan will reschedule installments on  arrears from July 1993 until February 1994, the Jordan News  Agency, Petra, said. The sum will be added to a previously  rescheduled amount of $87.3 million dollars, it added.    The deal provides for a grace period of nine years for  government debts and seven years for government-guaranteed  commercial loans.</p>

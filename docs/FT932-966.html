			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bloom returns with Pounds 3.5m Union buy MR DESMOND Bloom, the property entrepreneur, yesterday announced that Vizcaya Holdings, a USM-quoted shell company that he joined last December, had bought Union Group, a private property group for Pounds 3.47m. The acquisition is accompanied by a Pounds 2.2m vendor placing to help finance the deal and a Pounds 1.8m rights issue for working capital. He said the deal represented 'the first step in the creation of a property investment company that will be seeking to make its mark over the coming years'. Vizcaya, a former zinc mining company, will be renamed Premier Land and will move up from the USM to the Official List. Its shares, which were suspended at 5 3/4 p on April 20 because of the impending acquisition, are expected to resume trading on July 20. Union Group has a Pounds 40.7m property portfolio. Vizcaya will pay Pounds 2.2m in cash for Union Group by the placing of 44.5m vendor placing shares. The balance of Pounds 1.25m will be paid by the issue to the vendors of 25m shares. Mr Bloom is to be granted an option to subscribe for 5m shares, or 3 per cent of the company, at 6p per share. In addition to the vendor placing shares, the company is raising Pounds 1.8m by a 2-for-5 rights issue of 22.2m shares at 5p per share and a placing of 14.3m shares at the same price. The issue is underwritten by Guinness Mahon. Mr Bloom, a former guitarist and boxer, was one of the more colourful figures in the property industry in the 1980s. Dwyer, a one-time textile company, briefly became the best performing share on the stock market but its value collapsed as the property market declined. He was replaced as chief executive of Dwyer last November when the directors decided his Pounds 250,000 salary could not be justified.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fisons finds new chief executive - Priorities to continue rationalisation and fill gap in product pipeline Fisons' long search for a chief executive ended yesterday. Six months after ousting Mr Cedric Scroggs, the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group appointed Mr Stuart Wallis, an executive director at Bowater. Shares of Bowater, the packaging group, fell 13p to 430p, while Fisons' shares were static at 138p. Mr Wallis, who had been responsible for the European packaging and international health and beauty packaging businesses, had been seen as a potential successor to Mr David Lyon as Bowater's chief executive. The appointment follows a series of crises at the former fertilisers group. These include the resignation of one chief executive, the sacking of another chief executive and premature departure of a finance director, three profits warnings, and a collapse in market capitalisation from Pounds 2.23bn to Pounds 953m. Mr Wallis, a 48 year old chartered accountant, is scheduled to start at Fisons on September 1. Prior to his 6 1/2 years at Bowater, he was an executive director for distribution at Octopus Publishing. Analysts expressed disappointment that Mr Wallis did not have greater expertise in the pharmaceuticals industry. However, Mr Patrick Egan, Fisons chairman, said none of the five short-listed candidates had such experience. Mr Wallis said he had worked in a number of different sectors and was used to steep learning curves. He had already had dealings with the pharmaceuticals industry when at Bowater, he added. The main priorities were to continue rationalising as quickly and effectively as possible, and to fill the potential short to medium-term gap in the product pipeline, he said. Mr Egan warned the first half results, due in September, would be 'restrained' by acts of God. The hay-fever season in Japan had been 'abysmal', North American laboratory supplies had been interrupted by weather, and an instrument factory in California had been struck by an earthquake. The instruments business would record a small loss during the first six months and the pharmaceuticals operations' trading results would be down because they would be compared with a period last year which had been flattered by unacceptable acquisition accounting and stock loading.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Aquino's choice may hit IMF agreements PRESIDENT Corazon Aquino's support for the candidacy of Mr Fidel Ramos, a ruling party outsider and former defence secretary, in Philippine presidential elections in May could affect economic agreements with the IMF. The announcement was not a complete surprise but it did disappoint the leadership of the ruling party, Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), which had favoured the house speaker, Mr Ramon Mitra. Mrs Aquino's choice could make the LDP-dominated Senate less enthusiastic about approving new tax measures that must precede an important International Monetary Fund agreement. The LDP, which is seen as loyal to Mr Mitra, evolved from the broad coalition which helped bring Mrs Aquino to power in 1986. Mrs Aquino's decision not to choose Mr Mitra demonstrates the fragility of the coalition. Mr Mitra defeated Mr Ramos in a party straw vote last November, but the latter accused the Mitra group of cheating. Some politicians have said Mrs Aquino's move could derail some of her administration's economic programmes. Among these are the government's commitments to the IMF in exchange for financial support for Manila's programmes.</p>

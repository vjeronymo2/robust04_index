			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister Plenipotentiary Shahir Sayf by </F> 'Imad 'Abd-al-Tawwab; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-Tawwab] What are you telling the Yemeni  leaders in these circumstances?    [Sayf] Like any other Yemeni citizen, we are calling on the  Yemeni leaders to resort to reason and to stop the military  operations that are harming innocent civilians. Children,  women, and men are daily falling victim to these operations.  Villages and numerous civilian installations are being  destroyed. We call on them to stop this, resort to reason, sit  at the negotiating table, talk as brothers about the  differences, and try to reach solutions that satisfy all the  parties, spare Yemen more fighting, try to salvage what could be  salvaged, and avoid letting Yemen enter a dark tunnel with the  outcome known only to God almighty.    ['Abd-al-Tawwab] Are you calling for a dialogue among family  members?    [Sayf] The one family that could find credible solutions  based on the Pledge and Accord Document.    ['Abd-al-Tawwab] What do you say about Egypt's efforts? Some  people are now criticizing Egypt and saying that it has not  intervened.    [Sayf] On the contrary, Egypt has always been the first to  intervene to find solutions to many crises faced by the Arab  countries. Egypt has always been first. It was first in the  Yemeni crisis through President Husni Mubarak's envoy who  shuttled between Sanaa and Aden in an attempt to reach a  peaceful solution for the crisis in Yemen. Even after the  fighting erupted, Egypt took the leading role when it called on  the Arab League to hold an extraordinary session to try to stop  the fighting and to call on the warring parties to resort to  dialogue to resolve their differences.    ['Abd-al-Tawwab] As a Yemeni citizen living in Cairo, I am  asking you about Egypt's efforts. There have been contacts  between President Mubarak and Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid even after the  fighting erupted. Do you think Egypt's stance is the correct one?    [Sayf] Egypt's stance has been very sound. Contacts have  taken place between Mubarak and President Salih and Vice  President al-Bid, even during the fighting. Egypt's role is  needed in these times. I believe that Egypt is the leading Arab  country. The Arab nation suffers many setbacks whenever Egypt  and its role are absent.    ['Abd-al-Tawwab] In whose hands is the solution?    [Sayf] The solution is in the hands of the Yemenis but with  the help of their Arab brothers.    ['Abd-al-Wattab] Several days ago, Egypt was the scene of  the  signing of the Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement and there was  great joy for the Palestinians, some of whom are in Yemen. Do  you think this is the right time for this Yemeni crisis, when  the brother is killing his brother and tanks and planes are on  the attack?    [Sayf] You feel real pain when you see reconciliations  taking  place everywhere, meetings, and the signing of agreements here  and there, while the world is daily watching the bloody fighting  in Yemen, which is claiming the lives of many innocent people  who have no interest in the fighting. I hope the Arab efforts  will be effective and that more contacts will be held with the  Yemeni leaders to put them back on the right course.    ['Abd-al-Tawwab] I thank you for this interview and ask:  What is your message through the Cairo radio network to the  brothers in Yemeni?    [Sayf] I can say only this: Pray to God to guide our Yemeni  leaders, inspire them to achieve an end to this bloody fighting,  and make them resort to reason and hold dialogue because we can  reach very good results through dialogue. We might not achieve  any results through fighting. The damage could be more grave if  the fighting continues in this way and claims more victims.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bundaberg Sugar raises offer for crushing mills Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian sugar producer owned by Tate &amp; Lyle of the UK, yesterday raised its ADollars 87m (USDollars 62m) bid for two crushing mills in northern Queensland. Bundaberg, acquired by Tate &amp; Lyle for ADollars 325m three years ago, said it was increasing its offer for the 30,000 shares in the Tully Sugar mill from ADollars 1,600 a share to ADollars 2,160 a share. Its offer for the 3.9m shares in South Johnstone goes up from ADollars 9.40 to ADollars 12.25, increasing the total value of the bids by around ADollars 26m, to approximately ADollars 113m. Mr Geoff Mitchell, managing director of Bundaberg, said that the increased offer was an effort to address issues raised by shareholders, including 'current profitability, retained earnings, grower control and prospects'. Bundaberg, which announced its original offers in October, said that 'the proposal to invest in the north Queensland sugar industry now represents a total commitment of some ADollars 125m'. The mills said that the offers would be referred to their financial advisers.</p>

She was speaking to a news conference held  after she addressed the United Nations Commission on Human  Rights in Geneva. Benazir Bhutto said she addressed the  Commission in order to mobilize international public opinion and  force India to take solid steps to allow human rights  organizations into occupied Kashmir, release detained Kashmiri  leaders, permit television crews and journalists to visit  Kashmir, and reduce the number of troops there. She said the  world should not ignore human rights violations in occupied  Kashmir. Keeping this in view, it is imperative to implement  the UN resolutions. This problem is pertinent not only for  today, but also for the future.    When the prime minister was asked whether Pakistan will  consider demands for a sovereign Kashmir, she said that no such  demand has yet been made. This so-called demand will resurrect  the entire issue of the 1947 partition of the subcontinent into  an independent Pakistan and India. She said that while  reviewing this demand, the demands for freedom by Sikhs, Tamils,  and other groups in India should also be kept in mind.    The prime minister said that Pakistan has presented  proposals  to India at the international level time and again on the issue  of nuclear nonproliferation, but India has rejected all of them.    Regarding her visit to Bosnia today, Benazir Bhutto said she  and her Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller are visiting Bosnia to  express their solidarity with Bosnian Muslims. She said their  efforts are intended to ensure the implementation of the London  Accord on Bosnia. She said that decisions to lift the arms  embargo and implement a cease-fire should be made within the  purview of the London Accord.    Earlier, addressing the Human Rights Commission in Geneva,  Benazir Bhutto urged the international community to take steps  to stop the carnage in occupied Kashmir and exert pressure on  India to withdraw its troops from the occupied valley. She  said: It is time for the international community to force India  to release the Kashmiri leaders; lift all of its draconian  emergency laws; stop its Army from committing atrocities in  Kashmir; and allow international human rights organizations and  representatives of humanitarian institutions and the mass media  to visit occupied Kashmir, ascertain the facts, and provide help  to the suffering Kashmiris.</p>

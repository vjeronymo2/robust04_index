			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / IMF agrees increase for Cambodia The International Monetary Fund has agreed to an increase in Cambodia's share to 65m special drawing rights (Pounds 60.5m). This that could let Cambodia borrow the equivalent of as much as Dollars 370m from various IMF loan facilities. Cambodia's IMF quota had been stuck at SDR25m since 1970 because its isolation from the international financial community had left it out of several quota increases. With IMF membership reinstated six months ago, Cambodia has already borrowed about Dollars 9m from the IMF's systemic transformation facility, which is a loan account designed to help former communist countries.</p>

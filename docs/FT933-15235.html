			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bank confirms Daimler share tie-up DEUTSCHE Bank reiterated yesterday that it had no plans to reduce its 28 per cent stake in Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial holding. This followed comments from Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz chief executive, that he expected Deutsche to cut the stake 'in the medium-term'. He told journalists in Nuremberg that after such a move, Deutsche would remain a large and valued shareholder. Mr Reuter's comments revived speculation that Deutsche was considering cutting the stake which it has owned in Daimler since the late 1920s, the biggest holding in the bank's portfolio of share-stakes in large German companies. Earlier this year, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a board director of the bank, told a meeting of investors in Dusseldorf that the two companies agreed that the stake should be cut 'before too long'. Daimler and Deutsche have denied there were any plans for a reduction in the stake. However, the fact that the issue is being talked about in public shows the extent to which Germany's industrial and financial establishment is prepared to consider radical steps amid economic downturn. Analysts suggest that one way for the Deutsche Bank to reduce its stake would be for it not to take up its entitlement to shares in a future Daimler rights issue.</p>

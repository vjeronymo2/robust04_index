			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> DEADLOCKED JURY RESUMES ITS WORK  </P> <P> Jurors in the murder trial of Danny Davis Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park, who  Thursday had declared themselves "hopelessly deadlocked," resumed deliberations  this morning after the trial judge reinstructed them on the legal meaning of  "implied malice aforethought."  </P> <P> The definition is critical to the prosecution's effort to convict Ornelas of  second-degree murder in the Sept. 1 death of Debbie Killelea, who was struck by  a speeding car and killed in an alley behind her Balboa Peninsula home while a  passenger videotaped the incident.  </P> <P> Ornelas is accused of having had "implied malice aforethought" by speeding up  the alley and failing to brake when he saw Killelea and her two sons walking  there.  </P> <P> The prosecutor, Dep. Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals, argued that Ornelas, though  drunk at the time by legal definition, knew what he was doing.  </P> <P> The jurors Thursday declared themselves deadlocked, but Orange County Superior  Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas ordered them to continue deliberations.  </P></p>

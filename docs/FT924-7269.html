			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (8): Some of the glitz has faded - New York NEW YORKERS still like to think of their city as the brashest place in America, but when Los Angeles went up in flames earlier this year, New York started to seem like a kinder, gentler city. Recession has wrought subtle changes in Manhattan. Some of the glitz and glitter has gone, done in by the loss of thousands of highly-paid jobs. But the city's spirit remains remarkably resilient. Some things have not changed. The business climate may be difficult, but the pace of life is as frenetic as ever. As a result, there are still too many people trying to cram too much into a day and visitors should be prepared to have meetings unceremoniously delayed or cancelled. With the number of homeless in New York now swollen to about 80,000, begging has become something of an art form. Requests for donations to the United Negro Pizza Fund (a play on the United Negro College Fund) are par for the course, as are recitals of bad poetry. Perhaps the most original, and annoying, is a musician who uses his saxophone as an instrument of torture, squawking loudly on crowded subway cars until the captive passengers pay him to stop. The recession has not relieved the city's perennial traffic jams. Traversing Manhattan at mid-day or rush-hour is still a nightmare. The most reliable form of transportation is walking, if the distance is manageable. For greater distances, the subway belies its reputation by being reasonably fast and safe. Otherwise, cabs are comfortable and remarkably cheap when compared with London. Unlike London, however, cab drivers do not need to know their way around the city before getting behind the wheel. Nor do they need to speak English. For the business traveller on a pre-recession expense account, the Carlyle is the creme de la creme of luxury hotels in a city bursting with fine lodgings. Other top dollar options include the Lowell, the Pierre and the Waldorf-Astoria. Room rates at the Royalton and Paramount, both refurbished by French designer Philippe Starke, are surprisingly reasonable given the abiding trendiness of the hotels. Although the bedrooms tend to be small, the public rooms provide hours of entertainment and views of some of the most beautiful people the city has to offer. For those travelling on a more moderate budget, the Algonquin, on West 43rd Street, is one of the city's more charming large hotels, although the service is less reliable than at some of the chains. The Esplanade, on West End Avenue and 74th Street, has reasonable rooms at reasonable rates. For longer stays, the Surrey House on 76th Street and Madison Avenue, or the more economical Embassy Suites Hotel on 47th and Broadway, provide reasonably priced bedroom-and-lounge suites. At the lower end of the market, the Days Inn on 57th Street and Ninth Avenue is the most cheerful option. Eating out remains an abiding pleasure in New York, with enough variety to accommodate every palate and wallet. Recession has made it possible to get a last-minute table at Lutece, although advance reservations are still recommended. Other top-end favourites include Bouley, Auerole and Arcadia. With tens of thousands of restaurants in the city, it is worth asking friends or colleagues for recommendations. Or pick up a copy of the amusingly idiosyncratic Zagats restaurant guide, which conveniently lists restaurants by price, location and type of food. It is also worth checking the Dollars 19.92 lunch specials, which were introduced during the Democratic Convention and are still to be found at many of the city's better restaurants. After hours, New York still offers a plethora of theatre, film, music and art. But it is the oddities that give the city its quirky character. Visitors in the summer should look out for the weekly screenings of silent movie classics, complete with live organ accompaniment, at the Cathedral of St John the Divine, near Columbia University on the Upper West Side. Other New York institutions include the Knitting Factory, home of jazz tuba players and unconventional poets, which the New Yorker describes as 'the club most likely to feature an electric-rake player . . . it's like a frat house for the avant-garde.' New York is still a Mecca for jazz fans. Unfortunately, many of the best acts go to the Blue Note, perhaps the most over-crowded, over-priced, soulless club in the city. Apart from the quality of the music, the Blue Note's main appeal is its small size. Music-lovers with a limited budget should sit at the bar. Other options include Sweet Basil and Village Vanguard. The jury is still out on the editorial content of the new New Yorker, but the listings section remains fairly reliable. New York magazine has a more extensive selection.</p>

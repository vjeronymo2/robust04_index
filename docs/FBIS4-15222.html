			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Armen Khanbabyan "Russia Does Not Let </F> Humanitarian Grain Through to Armenia. Washington Unhappy Over  Plans To Restore Armenian Atomic Electric Power Station"]    [Excerpts] Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan  received U.S. Ambassador to Yerevan Harry Gilmore the other day.  A laconic official communique to this effect said that the  sides discussed a number of problems of an economic nature,  including questions related to deliveries to the republic of  American humanitarian aid in the shape of seed grain, and the  resumed startup of the Armenian nuclear electric power station  [AES].    These problems are of paramount importance for the  republic's  life while their solution is running into considerable  difficulties. Back on 21 March, THE NEW YORK TIMES accused  Russia of the fact that Moscow was to blame for the delay in  bringing to Armenia nearly 2,000 tonnes of seed grain, the funds  to buy which had been provided to Yerevan by the United States.  Under an American-Russian agreement signed two years ago,  humanitarian freight transit is not subject to customs duties;  this time, however, Russian customs demanded the payment of 30  percent of the freight's cost, or $750,000 in customs duties.    Moscow seems to be ready to move the grain from Saratov  where  it is stuck, but the customs structures remain stubborn -- while  neither the United States nor Armenia intend to bow to their  demand because this would create the dangerous precedent of  turning a humanitarian action into a routine trade deal.  Incidentally, the grain was bought by Armenia with American  money in Russia which in itself has made the Russian side a  considerable profit, and its stubborn desire to get additional  dividends appears as not very seemly, to put it mildly. Some  local analysts suppose in this connection that Russia is thus  trying to put political pressure on Yerevan and Washington.  Whether this is the case is hard to say but Congressman Richard  Lehman, a Democrat, has already put a bill before the House of  Representatives under which the United States is to cut all aid  to countries obstructing the delivery of American humanitarian  aid to its destination. [passage omitted]    While Washington is trying to give Yerevan the necessary  help  in grain supplies, the American side's attitude to the Armenian  Government's intention to revive the AES is directly the  opposite. Ambassador Gilmore told Prime Minister Bagratyan that  in the United States there are many opponents of restarting the  station. According to the ambassador, their stance is explained  both by not knowing the real energy supply situation in the  republic, and the fears that the Armenian side may not be able  to ensure the reliable physical protection for the facility.  This apparently means that the men in Washington do not intend  to help finance the restoration work. In the meantime,  according to specialists' estimates, the latter would cost $70  million, signifying that the project cannot do without foreign  aid anyway. Under the recently signed Armenian-Russian treaty,  Moscow will help Yerevan restore the AES, but this assistance  will be mainly of a technical nature. It is up to the  republic's government to solve the main questions of financing.  It is with this objective that Sepuh Tashdzhyan, the state  minister in charge of the power engineering sphere, has gone on  a foreign tour to visit England and Italy. There is a hope that  people in Europe will treat Armenia's request with  understanding. Tashdzhyan will also visit the United States  where he, as an American citizen and specialist in the field of  oil and gas production, has many connections in corresponding  circles. Whereas the Americans would hardly give money for the  restoration of the AES, in the United States it would in all  likelihood still be possible to get funds for the program of  prospecting for oil and gas fields in Armenia. Indeed, if  commercial deposits of oil and gas are discovered, this would  spur the movement against restarting the AES in the republic and  alter the authorities' intentions in this question.</p>

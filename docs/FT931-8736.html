			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / US tries to rekindle Mideast peace hopes: Events are pressing heavily on all sides and initial optimism is being eroded LITTLE IS likely to induce a deeper sense of deja vu in the Middle East than the arrival in the region of a new American secretary of state on yet another fact-finding mission. There is equally little to suggest that Mr Warren Christopher is going to learn much during the next few days about the peace process that he has not already gleaned from his experienced state department advisers and from his conversations in the past two weeks with the leading players. This may be the inevitable price to be paid for a change of US administration. But it could be a costly exercise at a moment when events and time are pressing ever more heavily on those in the Middle East most committed to negotiations. Nearly 16 months and eight rounds of talks have passed since the opening ceremony in Madrid. But with each succeeding week the initial optimism of Madrid is being eroded and the risk is increasing of events making it impossible for one or more of the participants to continue negotiations. US officials rightly point out that the fundamental reasons which brought the representatives of Israel, the Palestinians, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon to the talks are still valid. To a greater or lesser extent all of them accept the need for a negotiated settlement to the conflict that has blighted the world for more than four decades. However, since the autumn of 1991 nothing has been done to build popular support for that stance. No delegation wishes to abort the process but the Palestinians in particular are finding it ever more difficult to continue. The immediate crisis stems from Israel's decision on December 17 to expel 415 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza solely on suspicion of being active in Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two radical organisations opposed to the peace process. Under intense US pressure and under the unprecedented threat of United Nations sanctions, Israel last week agreed to re-admit 100 and halve by one year the expulsion period for the remainder. Mr Christopher and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, hoped that last Friday's UN statement welcoming the concession as a step in the right direction would allow peace talks to resume. Their hopes were premature. Mr Rabin's extreme reaction to the worsening violence in the occupied territories was designed in large part to placate Israeli public opinion. The response by the Palestine Liberation Organisation and its negotiators is no less dependent on the mood in the West Bank and Gaza. There, the harshness of the deportations, the increase in the killing of young people by Israeli troops and the arbitrary destruction of homes is working to increase the support for Hamas. And it is cutting the ground from under the feet of the Palestinian negotiators who live in the occupied territories. These events have to be seen against the hopes raised by Labour's victory in the Israeli elections last summer, won on a platform of reaching a swift agreement with the Palestinians, and on an American policy which, under the guidance of Mr James Baker, then secretary of state, had appeared to Arabs more even-handed than for many years. The haste with which Mr Christopher welcomed Mr Rabin's offer to take back 100 of the deportees as a virtual end to the issue suggested to some that the US was tilting back more emphatically in Israel's favour. If Mr Christopher wishes to reverse this impression, persuade the Palestinians to resume negotiations and bring the parties back to the substance of the peace process, he will, like so many of his predecessors, eventually come to the core of the issue which is the US-Israeli relationship. Although Russia is the co-sponsor of the peace process, responsibility for it is essentially American. The US continues to give more than Dollars 3bn annually in military and civil aid to Israel and is additionally providing loan guarantees for a further Dollars 2bn a year. Both governments officially refuse to acknowledge that these huge sums offer scope for diplomatic leverage. But a middle-class America which is being asked to pay higher taxes could well come to a different conclusion if Israel is deemed to be unhelpful in building on what President Clinton described on Tuesday as an 'historic moment' in the Middle East. Mr Christopher says he wants to listen rather than to talk during his week in the region. If he then concludes that what is most required is a clear and emphatic American response, his trip will not have been wasted. The lesson learned by President Jimmy Carter, the last Democrat to inhabit the White House, remains valid. Israelis and Arabs cannot make peace on their own.</p>

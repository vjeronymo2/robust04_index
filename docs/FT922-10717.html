			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts slip as investors take positions for auction UK government bond prices moved slightly lower yesterday as investors took positions ahead of today's Pounds 2.5bn gilts auction, the first test of demand for government paper since the Conservative election victory. Yesterday, the 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed at 99 25/32 , down 1/16 of a point on the day, for a yield of 9.02 per cent. The June gilt futures contract on Liffe closed at 98.22, from an opening level of 98.26 and 98.28 on Monday. Volume was 34,000 contracts. Today's auction of 8 3/4 per cent bonds maturing 2017 is expected to attract demand primarily from UK institutional investors. However, the bonds are tax exempt for overseas residents, a feature designed to attract overseas investment institutions which normally shun long-dated issues. Analysts said yesterday that total bids for stock would have to cover bonds available y at least twice for the auction to be judged a success. GERMAN government bond prices were weaker yesterday following Monday's strong technical rally, with no new factors to push the market forward. The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing 2002 closed at 100.08, little changed from 100.12 at the opening, for a yield of 7.98 per cent. The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, closed at 87.35 from an opening level of 87.39 and 87.44 on Monday. During the morning session, the contract hit a low of 87.16 before recovering ground through the afternoon. With no new regional inflation data released yesterday, the market focused on the second day of industrial action. US Treasury prices rose at the long end of the maturity range yesterday morning after traders and investors took heart from an unexpectedly sharp fall in March new home sales. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  19/32 at 99 5/16 , yielding 8.052 per cent. The two-year note was up  3/32 at 99 31/32 , yielding 5.375 per cent. Prices fell in early trading, a knee-jerk reaction to news of a 2 per cent increase in first-quarter gross domestic product. The improvement in GDP was in line with market forecasts, and confirmed that the US economy had pulled out of recession. The GDP data also showed that personal consumption rose 5.3 per cent in the first three months of the year, a bigger-than-expected rise and the main reason for the early fall in Treasury prices. The market recovered at the long end, however, when the Commerce Department reported that new home sales fell by 14.8 per cent in March, a fall that was much bigger than analysts had expected. The news buoyed investors, because it suggested that the recovery in the housing market may have stalled last month, and overshadowed the Conference Board's announcement of a rise in its consumer confidence index from 56.5 per cent last month to 64.8 per cent in April. JAPANESE government bond prices slipped overnight in Tokyo in thin trading, ahead of a public holiday today. The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a yield of 5.685 per cent, from 5.665 on Monday and 5.5.625 per cent on Friday.</p>

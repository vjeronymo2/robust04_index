			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Dockers hold out on labour law FRENCH dockers at two of the country's 29 ports, Marseille and St Malo, have still to reach agreement with employers on implementing a new labour law, the Marine Affairs ministry said yesterday, Reuter report from Paris. Dockers from St Malo were due to meet officials later yesterday to discuss stalling points on implementing the new law which makes dockers salaried workers, a ministry official said. But dockers at Marseille, France's largest port and at the front line of a long and bitter campaign of strikes by the country's 8,211 dockers, were not due to hold a similar meeting. Talks between the CGT union representatives and employers in Marseille broke down on Saturday in disagreement over the percentage of workers to be kept on as casual workers. Ports failing to agree a deal by last Wednesday were theoretically not eligible for a Ffr2bn (Dollars 400m) package from government and employers.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Technology: Mixing up a time saver - Worth Watching Builders and do-it-yourself enthusiasts could save both time and money with a collapsible cement mixer, designed by a former engineer from Watford. David Gawron's patented Gizmix replaces the traditional mixer's steel drum with a synthetic rubber bag inside a web of telescopic tubular rods. Packaged with the motor the mixer can be stored in a box in the corner of a workshop or garage. Because it is light enough to carry, it can also be taken to the upper stories of a high-rise building without the need for a winch. Once in production, the Gizmix should cost less than Pounds 100 to buy. Gawron: UK, 0923 776 747.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japan's Finance Ministry  announced Wednesday [9 February] the easing of regulations,  effective in March and April, in a bid to spur international  financial dealings. The ministry is to allow more freedom under  the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law on deposits,  securities transactions, direct investment, lending and  borrowing, and import-export accounts.    For overseas nonyen deposits by residents, the amount which  is free of ministry permission will be raised to up to 100  million yen from the current 30 million yen March 1.    Referring to last year's statistics, a ministry official  said  overseas foreign currency deposits with between 30 to 100  million yen accounted for about half of the 130 deposits  approved overall.    The same measure will be taken for investment by residents  on  overseas securities and by nonresidents on domestic securities.    The nonpermission amount for nonbank lending and borrowing  between residents and nonresidents will be raised to up to 100  million yen from the current 10 million yen.    On the current 10 million yen limit per case for trading  houses and other firms using an accounting method of offsetting  export and import payments between head offices and overseas  branches, the ministry will allow an increase of up to 100  million yen from April 1.    The period for leaving the payments on the accounting record  for settlements through the offsetting method will be extended  to six months from the current three months.    The ministry will also abolish and ease March 1 various  reporting obligations linked to the above regulation revisions.  The move is intended to "improve convenience and further  facilitate overseas dealings amid international financial  transactions becoming increasingly active," ministry officials  said.    They said the measures are in line with an agreement late  last year under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT)-sponsored Uruguay Round of multilateral talks and also  with an administrative reform outline decided by the government  Tuesday.</p>

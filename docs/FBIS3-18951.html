When he left the Elysee Palace, Pascal Lissouba  said that he had echoed Africa's cry of despair after the  devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc.  Africa deserves better than this, he said. He added that Paris  has to tackle problems differently, including the debt issue.  The visit of the Congolese president seems to reflect a  rapprochement between Paris and Brazzaville. Monique Mas  reports:    [Mas] Indeed, relations between France and Congo seem to  have  improved after a period of severe tension. There were problems,  one has tried to deflate them in order to go on, Pascal Lissouba  said. He met his French counterpart earlier today.    A series of official meetings is on the agenda of his  private  visit. President Lissouba will also meet the French minister  for foreign affairs, the minister of cooperation, and the  interior minister. There will be more talk about developments  in the Congolese political situation after international  arbitration on the electoral dispute and after violence has  subsided. In that respect, Paris believes that there has been  some progress, but that more is needed; for instance, details on  the concrete form the national reconciliation at a political  level announced in Brazzaville might take. As for economic  matters, Paris has referred Congo to the IMF. It has been badly  hit by the devaluation of the CFA franc. There will also be  some talk about the timeliness of the return of French  cooperation workers. The oil issue has no longer been a bone of  contention since President Lissouba backed down in favor of  French interests. As for the rest, Paris remains cautious.</p>

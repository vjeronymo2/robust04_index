When asked if there were any U.S. POWs left behind in Laos  and if Laos is doing enough on the POW/MIA issue, he said that  this issue had received extensive review in both the legislative  and executive branches. Following its year-long investigation  into the POW/MIA issue, the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA  affairs noted in its final report: "American officials did not  have certain knowledge that any specific prisoner or prisoners  were being left behind." The counselor added that cooperation on  the POW/MIA issue is a priority in the U.S. relations with Laos.  The U.S. will continue to press for additional cooperation and  progress on this issue.    505 Americans remain unaccounted for in Laos. Last year, the  U.S. and Laos conducted six joint field activities. However,  more than 80 percent of the persons unaccounted for in Laos were  actually lost in areas under the control of the North  Vietnamese. This demonstrates the importance of the first-ever  trilateral operation with Vietnam, which was completed on  December 20, said the release.    The release also added that the first field activity for  1994  was scheduled to begin later this month.</p>

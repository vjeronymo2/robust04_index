			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Merger plan lifts London futures market activity THE green light given to the merger of the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London Traded Options Market last week has increased activity in individual UK stock options on LTOM. Average daily volume in LTOM's 67 stock options in the last quarter of 1991 was just 17,000 contracts a day, (although the FT-SE 100 index option has remained quite active). Last Monday, volume was just 13,000. On Wednesday, when Liffe announced it had found enough market-makers in the product for the merger with LTOM to proceed, volume rose to 39,000. On Thursday, 35,000 contracts were traded, and on Friday close to 30,000. Open interest, which reflects the positions held in the market, rose from 511,000 when the market opened on Wednesday to 547,000 at Friday's close. However, volume slipped back somewhat yesterday to 20,000 contracts. Mr Bruce Froud, head of derivatives at Kleinwort Benson, reported 'positive feedback from our institutional clients, now that the uncertainty is out of the way.' Some institutions had been reluctant to take positions in the market, while its future was not secure, creating some pent-up demand. The increase in volume reflected greater commitment by market-making firms, which have themselves been nervous about taking positions, dealers said. 'There does appear to be a gathering confidence now that the merger issue has been resolved,' said Mr Tony de Guingand, chief executive of LTOM. While the stock market was reasonably active last week, dealers said the rise in volume was not market-driven. Only one stock option - Asda  - was traded in very high volume, because the company's results were published last week. Otherwise, the increase in trading was across the board.</p>

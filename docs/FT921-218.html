			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Moscow set to sign deal with enclaves SEVENTEEN of Russia's 20 semi-independent enclaves are expected today to sign a federal treaty designed to preserve at least the semblance of Russia's territorial integrity. But the treaty is being boycotted by Chechnya, Bashkiria, and by Tatarstan, the largest of the former autonomous republics, which voted 10 days ago to deal with the Russian Federation on an 'equal basis' but says it will stop short of outright secession. The treaty itself may also be less binding than it appears. Mr Ramazan Abdulatipov, chairman of the Council of Nationalities, one of the two chambers of the Russian parliament, said yesterday some republics, such as Kalmykia, would sign with reservations. These would allow republics to reach deals with Moscow - for instance giving them control over their mineral wealth or the right to collect taxes. But whatever its faults, the treaty should provide President Boris Yeltsin with a badly-needed political success to shore up his position ahead of next week's Congress of People's Deputies, during which his economic policies will come under fierce attack. A negotiated settlement with Tatarstan, allaying fears he is allowing Russia to break up, should also help buoy his political fortunes. Finally, agreement with the 17 enclaves could make it easier for the Russian Federation to adopt a long-delayed constitution, although there are reports that Mr Yeltsin has ditched the official draft of the document. Tatarstan's vice-president, Mr Vasily Likhachev, yesterday met Mr Gennady Burbulis, the first deputy prime minister, for talks on a bilateral treaty. A similar deal is being sought by Bashkiria, which attended preparatory talks but has differences over property, mineral resources, budgetary policy and taxation. Chechnya representatives stayed away. A fourth possible rebel, Yakutia, said it would sign the treaty if amendments were made on economic issues.</p>

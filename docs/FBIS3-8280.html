The revenues from the privatization of  large-size companies in 1993 amounted to approximately Kc24.405  billion. Since the Fund came into existence, this has amounted  to approximately Kc50.937 billion. Overall receipts from the  privatization of small-size companies amounted to Kc36.085  billion.    Regarding privatization of large-size companies, foreign  investors have invested more than Kc22 billion up to the  present, which is almost 44 percent of the capital that has been  invested overall. On 31 December 1993, more than Kc43 billion  remained on the National Property Fund account after the  deduction of all expenditures connected primarily with writing  off the debts of the privatized companies. Out of this amount,  Kc20 billion has been deposited with the Czech State Savings  Bank. The interest from this long-term deposit will be used for  the privatization of the health service.    There have also been problems with the repayment of money of  the already privatized assets. At present, the Fund has taken  to court a total of 93 subjects who have failed to repay money  owed, which amounts to Kc2 billion. The court has so far  resolved only five cases.</p>

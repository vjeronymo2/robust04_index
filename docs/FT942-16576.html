			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Leading Article: Mr Major's anniversary It is two years since Mr John Major surprised everyone by winning the general election. The prime minister fought the 1992 campaign as the underdog. Polls suggested that there might be a hung parliament. The Conservative campaign was bungled. During its final stages Mr Major was derided for his recourse to a soapbox at meetings. In the event, he led the Tories to an unprecedented fourth victory in a row - and the largest popular vote in history. The descent since that day of triumph has been precipitate. According to the latest Gallup poll, no prime minister and no government have fallen so far and so quickly out of favour since Gallup began taking soundings of British opinion in the late 1930s. The prime minister's personal rating is the lowest for any holder of his office since polling began. He is now back on the hustings, partly to demonstrate that he is still a vote-winner. In spite of widespread speculation about possible successors, it is not clear that he should or will be replaced. The balance sheet of his performance is mixed. When he became chancellor in 1989 and prime minister the following year, Mr Major regarded the conquest of inflation as his central economic task. He maintained this position at great political cost, both before and after his election victory. The prolonged squeeze has had the desired effect. Retail prices, which rose by 9.5 per cent in 1990, are now increasing at a quarter of that rate. The recession, which can be said to have begun to bite with Mr Major's chancellorship ('if it isn't hurting, it isn't working'), bottomed out two years ago. The recovery is well under way, some would say steadily, others too slowly. The index of industrial production, which fell to 94.5 in January 1992, rose to 100.7 in February, its highest level since a peak of 102.1 in 1990. Although there are still a million more out of work than when Mr Major became chancellor, unemployment is falling. The prime minister's anticipation of a period of sustained non-inflationary growth may be optimistic, but it is not irrational. Noble cause There are other achievements to his credit. In December he took a significant political risk in a noble cause. Together with the prime minister of Ireland he signed a joint declaration offering Sinn Fein a place at the negotiating table in return for a permanent renunciation of violence. More to the point, Irish republicans were offered a united Ireland if they could persuade a majority of the people of Ulster and, separately, the Irish republic to vote for it. The declaration has not brought peace, but it has set the only defensible terms upon which a settlement might be based and, most importantly, it has done so in tandem with the Irish government. Even when it comes to Europe it would be wrong to portray the prime minister's policies as a total disaster. Before the election, Mr Major completed a difficult negotiation of the Maastricht treaty. Afterwards, he pushed it through Parliament, braving a no-confidence vote in the final moment. His tactical errors in staging set-piece dramas over relations with the European Union involved misjudgment, but at root they were the consequence of the deep and long-running division among Conservatives, compounded by the government's slim overall majority (17 and falling) in the Commons. The day may come when a different Conservative leader proposes British withdrawal from the EU. That, too, would split the party from top to bottom. Humiliating failure The negatives on this balance sheet are well-known. Deep cuts in interest rates, which should spur the recovery, were made possible by Mr Major's most humiliating failure, the ejection of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism. Control over public spending, particularly in the pre-election years 1990 and 1991, was lax. Combined with the recession, this profligacy has produced the horrendous budget deficit that must now be paid for in increased taxation. The bills started to come in this week. It is against this background that the familiar chapter of recent Tory embarrassments must be read. In happier times, back to basics might have been followed by sex scandals without rocking the government. Populist law and order proposals might have been amended in the House of Lords without arousing much comment. The Citizen's Charter might have sunk without trace, without catcalls as it did so. The cause of Mr Major's present political weakness is none of these mishaps. His misfortune is that recovery has been faltering, and late. The Labour party has little to crow about. Its present popularity in the polls is only a reflection of the electorate's disenchantment with the Conservatives. Mr John Smith, whose second anniversary as leader is a couple of months away, leads a party with fewer acknowledged policies than it had when Mr Neil Kinnock lost the election in April 1992. Mr Major will always lack charisma and his last two years have been unfortunate, occasionally inept. The leader of the opposition's have been worse: a nullity.</p>

Bosnia-Herzegovina took advantage of the occasion to demand the  immediate withdrawal of all heavy weapons positioned around  Sarajevo to a point outside the town's range. If the Serbs do  not do this within 48 hours, Minister Ljubijankic demanded air  strikes. The credibility of NATO as a serious institution and  [word indistinct] talks is at stake.    Our foreign minister repeated the demand to lift the arms  embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ljubijankic and Balanzino  discussed the military presence of the Croatian Army in our  country. Our side referred to a secret agreement between Franjo  Tudjman and Slobodan Milosevic on the division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina between Croatia and Serbia.    Bosnia-Herzegovina expressed the desire to join the  Partnership for Peace, an NATO initiative designed to unite with  the former Socialist countries. Mr. Balanzino informed Minister  Ljubijankic that NATO is keeping our country in mind but that  the acceptance procedure is long, and the number of interested  countries is great.    Mr. Balanzino informed the Bosnia-Herzegovina foreign  minister that NATO has planned all the details for action in  Bosnia-Herzegovina; only a political decision is needed. It is  high time we preserve the meager credibility of the  international community and NATO with resolute action. We  seriously believe this, he emphasized.</p>

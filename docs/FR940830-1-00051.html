			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Option 4_30 grams/day. This represents the 80th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentile sport fish consumption by Michigan sport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishermen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 5_40.8 grams/day. This represents the 80th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentile of total fish consumption by Michigan sport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishermen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 6_43.1 grams/day. This represents the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sport fish consumption level for the highest consuming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sport fish sub-group (lower income minorities).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 7_57.9 grams/day. This represents the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total fish consumption level for the highest consuming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sport fish sub-group (low income minorities). The West  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study also documents individual consumption rates in excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The policy options presented in the survey do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily reflect the opinions of the State of Michigan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but EPA believes that they are included in the range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible fish consumption rates that could be used as part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the final Guidance methodology for deriving human health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on the, ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study'' including: (1) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriateness of the study methods used in study; (2) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seven policy options in Chapter 6 of the report on possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish consumption rates for Michigan; (3) the applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the results in the study to other parts of the Great  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lakes Basin; and (4) the appropriateness of using a fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption rate for the final Guidance higher than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed 15 grams/day, based on the range of values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in the West et al., study or other relevant and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate data, and alternative approaches to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different levels of fish consumption in a waterbody.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=4 --> C. Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Factors, July 1994 (Technical Support Document, July 1994)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As explained in the preamble for the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidance, aquatic organisms accumulate chemicals in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tissues from exposure to chemicals from all sources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including food and water. Further, as organisms at lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trophic levels are consumed by organisms at higher trophic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels, tissue concentrations of some chemicals increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of biomagnification, chemical levels in top  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predators may be orders of magnitude higher than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of the chemical in the ambient water. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the development of National water quality criteria, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used the term ``bioconcentration factors (BCF)'' to reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the propensity of an organism to accumulate a chemical in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its tissues. When field-measured bioaccumulation factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (BAFs) were not available, BCFs were used as estimates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAFs. In the proposed Guidance, EPA requested comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two uses of BAFs, which account for exposure from all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, EPA calculated BAFs for individual chemicals at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different trophic levels. The BAFs at the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trophic level consumed by humans and wildlife species were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then used to derive human health and wildlife criteria. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, if all other factors were equal, a chemical with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher bioaccumulation factor would have a lower (more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent) criterion. Second, EPA used the human health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAFs to identify a list of ``bioaccumulative chemicals of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern'' which warrant increased attention in the Great  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lakes Basin. See Section II.G. (at 58 FR 20843) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble to the proposed Guidance (58 FR 20802).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is today soliciting comment on additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical information about BAFs and alternative options to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaching four issues described in the proposed Guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also soliciting comment on the newly calculated BAFs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the chemicals in Tables 3 and 4 of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidance for human health and wildlife species based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and options discussed in this Notice. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAFs, if promulgated, would change the criteria for human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and wildlife in Tables 3 and 4 of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Guidance included a hierarchy of three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods for deriving BAFs for organic chemicals: a field-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured BAF; a BAF predicted by multiplying a BCF measured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the laboratory by a food chain multiplier (FCM); and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAF predicted from a BCF calculated from the chemical's n-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> octanol/water partition coefficient (K <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> ow <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and multiplied by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a FCM. For inorganic chemicals, EPA proposed to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either a field-measured BAF or BCF. The four issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in this Notice all pertain to the derivation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAFs for organic chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is considering whether it should revise its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed methodology for the calculation of BAFs in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Great Lakes System to incorporate the information discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Technical Support Document, 1994, and summarized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below. The material discussed in sections C.1, C.2, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.3 would replace portions of the proposed Guidance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material discussed in section C.4 would provide a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method for deriving a BAF for organic chemicals and this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method would be added to the hierarchy of methods for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organics described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the proposed Guidance, EPA proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require States and Tribes to adopt requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation of BAFs that are consistent with EPA's final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology. Although the State or Tribal regulation need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not duplicate this methodology, the State's or Tribe's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method must produce a BAF at least as stringent as the BAFs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived by using EPA's methodology. If EPA incorporates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the topics discussed in the Technical Support Document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, and this Notice into its methodology, States and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tribes will be required to reflect them in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodologies and derivation of BAFs. EPA also notes that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if EPA incorporates the material discussed in sections C.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to C.4 into its methodology for deriving a BAF, EPA would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use this material in promulgating BAFs for any State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tribe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

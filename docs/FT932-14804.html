			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Fortis dampens sale speculation FORTIS, the Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group, yesterday tried to dampen speculation about a likely reshuffle of its banking assets in Belgium. The group, which announced a 4.4 per cent increase in net profits last year, to Ecu419m (Dollars 513m) from Ecu402m, wants to sell part of its 14.7 per cent holding in Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank. But Mr Maurice Lippens, joint chairman, said yesterday that Fortis would take its time and did not want to 'destabilise' Generale de Banque. 'We believe the price (of the bank shares) today is a good price, but it still could be a little higher,' he said. Fortis - which groups together the activities of AG of Belgium and Amev of the Netherlands - decided to reduce its stake in the bank after failing to agree terms on which it could sell its insurance products through Generale de Banque's branch network. Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company and a prominent shareholder in both AG and Generale de Banque, has expressed an interest in buying the shares. Fortis is now considering whether to bid for a stake in CGER-ASLK, a Belgian state-owned savings bank, which is part of the government's privatisation programme. Mr Lippens said Fortis was not selling the Generale de Banque stake to raise funds for a stake in CGER-ASLK, which he described as 'an outstanding example of 'bancassurance' in Belgium'.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TWO MORE TAXICAB DRIVERS ASSAULTED, ROBBED  </P> <P> Two cab drivers were beaten and robbed, bringing to three the number of  assaults on cabbies this week, police said Thursday.  </P> <P> Two National City women were arrested in connection with the robbery and  stabbing of a Diamond Cab driver about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, said Bill Robinson  a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department.  </P> <P> The suspects, Odessa Cordova, 45, and Louise Harvey, 31, hailed a cab in  National City and directed the driver to go to an address in East San Diego,  Robinson said.  </P> <P> They allegedly ordered the driver, Jose Elguezabal, 38, to stop at the 4100  block of Redwood Street, Robinson said.  </P> <P> "One of the women put a knife to the driver's throat while the other took money  from his pants," Robinson said. "One of the suspects tried to slice the victim  across the throat."  </P> <P> Elguezabal blocked the stabbing attempt, and suffered only a laceration on his  hand, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Police arrested the suspects a short distance from the crime, Robinson said.  </P> <P> In the other robbery, two men beat a Yellow Cab driver and escaped with about  $30 shortly after 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, said Lt. Jerry Moody.  </P> <P> The men hailed the cab driver, Mark Gilligan, 41, at 16th and F streets, Moody  said.  </P> <P> Gilligan drove the men to the 400 block of Cedar Street, where they grabbed him  and punched him before escaping with his money, Moody said.  </P> <P> Police are still looking for suspects in that case, Moody said.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, a cab driver was beaten and robbed of $140 after picking up  a fare at a La Jolla hotel.  </P> <P> Police officials and mayoral aides have been trying to devise ways to reduce  the number of attacks that have plagued cab drivers this summer. Officials set  up a meeting with representatives of the city's cab companies last month after  two drivers were shot, one fatally, during robbery attempts on consecutive  days.  </P></p>

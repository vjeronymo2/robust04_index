			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / International Company News: Trizec suspends payout TRIZEC, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer, has suspended common-share dividends pending the outcome of a plan to restructure its CDollars 5.3bn (USDollars 4.17bn) debt. The Calgary-based company, controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, aims to present its debt-restructuring and recapitalisation proposals by the end of July. About CDollars 1.7bn of principal payments, mostly on mortgage loans, are due before the end of 1995. The proposals include delayed preferred share redemptions and extended debt maturities. The semi-annual dividend has gradually been cut over the past 18 months, from 18 to 5 cents a share. In a further effort to boost liquidity, Trizec has sold a number of assets, including the bulk of its 23 per cent stake in Rouse Co, a leading US shopping mall developer. It is also seeking a buyer for up to 50 per cent of its retirement home subsidiary. Trizec posted net earnings of CDollars 5m, equal to a loss of 3.4 cents a share, in the six months to April 30, down from CDollars 12m, or a loss of 1.4 cents a share, a year earlier. The accounts of Bramalea, the Toronto-based developer, are no longer consolidated, Trizec's stake having been cut from 72 to 20 per cent.</p>

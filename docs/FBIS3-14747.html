			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The Georgian delegation [to  Abkhaz-Georgian talks] returned to Tbilisi from Geneva  yesterday. Today our correspondent met the leader of the  delegation, Jaba Ioseliani. We now present an excerpt from an  interview which will be shown fully after this information  program.    [Begin recording] [Ioseliani] We knew from the outset that  they would not agree to talks. Well, they would agree to talks,  but they would not sign anything. We knew this very well. We  were meeting them anyway, so that the world would know who we  are dealing with, what their demands are and what they want.    This is because people abroad do not understand what is  happening. We are five million, while they are 70 [thousand].  How can they have done anything at all? We must be the culprits.    This is because they are using everything, while we are not  using anything. If they were in our position, they would  trumpet their cause abroad, they would shout, cry and all that.  We are not doing this.    We knew the (?situation) very well and acted little by  little. Still, they find it hard to understand the situation.  There have been three meetings, right? British, Americans --  our friends were there. They were sympathetic, but they also  thought that we must be saying something wrongly. They thought:  not everything is as they [Georgians] say. When there are two  parties, both must be guilty of something. That is how it is in  general.    But after they saw it this time, they went almost mad. Look  what kind of people they [Abkhazians] are, they said, [words  indistinct]. I did not say a word; I sat quiet.    Are you really giving them autonomy, they asked us.    Of course, we are, I said.    But what else do they [Abkhazians] want, they asked.    Ask them what they want, I said. [end recording]</p>

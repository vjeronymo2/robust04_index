			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Five people of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), who had escaped  from logging camps in Siberia, Russia, arrived here Wednesday  [18 May] via a third country, the Foreign Ministry here said.    This is the first time for Seoul to allow the DPRK's loggers  to resettle in South Korea through a lawful procedure, Foreign  Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said.    "As they wanted to seek refuge in South Korea, the  government  decided to allow their resettlement here from a humanitarian  point of view," Chang claimed.    He refused to disclose detailed information about how the  loggers could flee and reach Seoul, saying he had to put into  consideration the position of countries concerned and the  personal safety of related people.    The South Korean Government decided on April 15 that it will  accept all DPRK's escapees who wish to settle in South Korea.    However, the DPRK has accused South Korea of stepping up  efforts to "kidnap" its loggers working in Siberia.    If the South Koreans "persist in their operation to kidnap  our dignified workers by misrepresenting facts, in defiance of  our reasonable warning, they will drink a bitter cup," said a  statement released by the DPRK's Foreign Ministry earlier.    The DPRK has thousands of workers in logging camps in  Siberia, getting paid by Russia in wood in return for providing  the labor.    An estimated 500 loggers are said to have escaped from the  camps, some of whom are hiding in various parts of Russia and  seeking refuge in South Korea, according to reports.    The logging contract between Russia and the DPRK was to  expire at the end of last year but the two sides are still  negotiating its extension as Moscow demanded human rights  condition improvement inside the camps.    The loggers who came to South Korea will get vocational  training at a vocational education organization for a period,  while receiving some amount of money for their resettlement,  according to official sources.</p>

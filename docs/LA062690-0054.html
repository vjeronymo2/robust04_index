			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Cosby Gets Help From 'The Simpsons': NBC won't accept commercials featuring  characters from "The Simpsons" because it doesn't want to cross-promote a  program on a competing network. But that doesn't mean that NBC stars can't put  their commercials on during "The Simpsons." In fact, Bill Cosby, who will go  head-to-spikey head with Bart Simpson when the animated series moves to  Thursday night in the fall, was seen Sunday during "The Simpsons" plugging his  upcoming "Ghost Dad" flick.

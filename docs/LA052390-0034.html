			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 3-A BASEBALL  </P> <P> In other 3-A games:  </P> <P> Rancho Buena Vista 5, Sweetwater 4 -- Rancho Buena Vista scored the eventual  winning run on a balk -- a call that Sweetwater (20-9) protested. Sweetwater's  Larry Meza, a right-hander, had just taken the mound -- after Rancho Buena  Vista scored two runs -- when he stepped backwards off the mound with his left  foot. The umpire called a balk, and the Longhorns (16-11-1) went ahead, 5-4.  Steve Valencia was two for four, and George Hadden (7-4) was the winner for  Rancho Buena Vista, which will play host to Mira Mesa if the protest -- to be  decided today -- is denied.  </P> <P> Poway 3, Southwest 2 -- After fouling off a 3-1 squeeze attempt, Phil Portiera  doubled in the winning run in the bottom of the seventh for top-seeded Poway  (20-6-1). Catcher Matt Schwenke hit a two-run home run in the fifth, and Danny  Miller (12-1) won in relief for Poway, which will play host to Monte Vista in  Thursday's quarterfinals. Southwest finished 13-14.  </P> <P> Monte Vista 1, Hilltop 0 -- Hilltop's Jose Silva had 13 strikeouts and allowed  just two hits, but one was a home run in the top of the sixth by Ernie Reyes.  Silva's counterpart, Robbie Stone, allowed just three hits and struck out seven  to improve to 9-4. Monte Vista improved to 18-11-1.

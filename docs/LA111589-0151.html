			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SAFEGUARDS URGED IN PENSION FUND ASSETS;  </P> <P> RETIREMENT: THE CHAIRMAN OF A HOUSE PANEL CALLS FOR PROTECTIONS AS HEARINGS  OPEN ON POTENTIAL FRAUD AND MISMANAGEMENT OF SAVINGS.  </P> <P> The chairman of a House panel today called for stronger measures to protect  private pension fund assets so workers do not lose their retirement savings to  fraud and mismanagement.  </P> <P> "We must develop greater safeguards to adequately protect the nation's private  pension fund assets," Rep. William J. Hughes (D-N.J.) said as he opened a  hearing by the House subcommittee on retirement income and employment.  </P> <P> "Our workers and retirees have a right to expect that the pensions they have  worked so hard to earn and which they are counting on to meet basic living  expenses during their retirement years are not eroded away by waste, fraud and  corruption," he said.  </P> <P> The hearing stemmed from reports issued by the Labor Department's inspector  general office that pointed to the vulnerability of $2 trillion in assets of  pension plans covering 76 million Americans.  </P> <P> The latest inspector general's report, obtained by the Associated Press, says  billions of dollars in private pension money is not being fully audited because  the money was invested in such institutions as savings and loans.  </P> <P> Some Labor Department officials dispute the extent of the problems, saying the  department's acting inspector general, Raymond Maria, has exaggerated the  potential for fraud. Maria has likened the potential to the recent savings and  loan crisis, which some estimates say will require a $100-billion taxpayer  bailout.  </P> <P> David George Ball, assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare benefits,  told the hearing: "The pension system, by any objective measure, has never been  healthier."  </P> <P> Maria, in his testimony, said, "Our goal is not to unnecessarily frighten  people but to stimulate concern where such concern is needed and to avoid  potential future crisis."  </P> <P> He said inadequate regulations and reliance on civil rather than criminal  remedies have "created a window of opportunity for those who would embezzle and  steal from plan participants."  </P></p>

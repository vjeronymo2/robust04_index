			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> RECYCLING CHARGE EXEMPTION GRANTED  </P> <P> As of Friday, low-income residents participating in the city's recycling  program will not have to pay the recycling charge of $2.58 per month.  </P> <P> In a memo to the City Council, Mayor Don E. Smith and Mayor Pro Tem Gene Beyer  recommended the change in response to several seniors asked for the exemption.  </P> <P> Officials said about a third of the city's residents are involved in the  three-month-old recycling program. Next month, the city will distribute the  colored bins for recycling to residents in the rest of the city.  </P> <P> Of the total monthly charge, the contractor receives $2.10 for bins, trucks and  personnel. The city uses the remaining 48 cents for administering the program  and for various public education programs, such as a children's coloring book  and poster contests.  </P></p>

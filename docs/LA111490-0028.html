			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OUTCRY PROMPTS LYNWOOD TO SCALE BACK  UTILITY TAX  </P> <P> The Lynwood City Council has decided to scale back a new utility tax after  being deluged with complaints from angry residents.  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 1 Monday to enact a 3% tax on gas, telephone and  electric bills, effective Jan. 1.  </P> <P> The council initially had approved a 10% tax, but opted for the lower rate  after angry residents packed the council chambers last week to protest the tax.  The 3% tax is expected to increase residents' total utility bills an average of  $35 a year.  </P> <P> The new tax is expected to generate more than $1 million next year to help pay  for such services as street and sewer repairs, officials said.  </P> <P> The council approved the 10% tax on Oct. 30 to avoid restrictions of  Proposition 136, which would have required cities to obtain voter approval  before raising taxes. The proposition, however, was defeated last week.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 22 SAPA -- It was important members  of the security forces should be able to carry out their duties  without fear of being prosecuted for political crimes after the  elections, African National Congress President Nelson Mandela  said on Friday [22 April]. Mr Mandela was speaking after a  meeting with President F W de Klerk at the Union Buildings,  Pretoria, to discuss indemnity for those who committed political  crimes and the franchise for prisoners. The ANC wanted the  security services to be committed to their duties without fear  of facing prosecutions for political crimes after the elections,  he added.    Mr Mandela said he and Mr de Klerk also exchanged views on  prisoners being allowed to vote. Mr de Klerk said on Thursday  he would probably decide on the issue on Friday. Mr Mandela  said: "We are more or less looking at the problem from the same  angle."</p>

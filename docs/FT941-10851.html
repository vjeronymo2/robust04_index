			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Jordan's relief Jordan has won slight relief on its external debts to Japan following agreement between the two sides which will add Dollars 14.1m (Pounds 9.4m) of principal and interest to Dollars 87.3m in debts to Japan which have already been rescheduled, writes James Whittington in Amman. This will not affect most of Jordan's Dollars 1.3bn mainly official debt to Japan, for which repayment will be discussed in the next round talks with the Paris Club of official creditors in late March. The terms are the same as for the rescheduled Dollars 87.3m of interest and principal agreed in June 1992. There is a grace period of nine years for official loans and seven years for commercial loans backed by the Japanese government. Jordan's total external debt is around Dollars 6.8bn, or 140 per cent of gross domestic product, after Dollars 673m of repayments on principal and interest in 1993.</p>

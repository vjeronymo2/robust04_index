			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Two left-wing opposition  parties said Monday [2 May] the new cabinet of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata is trying to spoil the war-renouncing Constitution.    The Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ] (SDP) and the  Japanese Communist Party (JCP) issued separate statements on the  eve of the 47th anniversary of the Constitution.    The SDP, which quit the coalition last week to turn [as  received] the No. 2 opposition party, said it wants to protest  against what it called the "dangerous intentions" of the  administration.    "We are worried that some members of the Hata administration  are supporting collective defense, forbidden under the  Constitution, and supposing `emergencies' on the Korean  peninsula, and that they have spoken with the intention of  changing the Constitution in order to deal with the situation,"  the SDP said.    The JCP said, "the new administration is trying to impose an  extraordinary system and an emergency system on the people, on  the pretext of `sanctions' against North Korea."    "We take it seriously that some ministers have urged the  government to change its current interpretation that resorting  to collective defense is a violation of the Constitution," the  JCP said.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai have expressed support for legislation to deal  with emergencies including possible international sanctions  against North Korea related to Pyongyang's suspected nuclear  weapons development.</p>

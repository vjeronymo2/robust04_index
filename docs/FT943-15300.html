			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: What's in a game? I was passing through the green room the other evening when Miss Lee, my executive assistant, caught sight of me and smiled to herself. She was wearing the sort of Japanese designer gear (Yakomoto? Kamikaze?) that shows a great deal of flesh - the hips, for example, and the area below the collar-bone, and the sides and lower back - yet costs a preposterous sum, at least if you are paying in dollars. Miss Lee said: 'There was a flurry of action today, Michael. The score is mounting hugely. We have 473 in the red folder and 322 in the blue.' I knew what she was talking about. Two weeks ago, burdened by compressing what I had to say into the molecular dimensions of this column, I appeared to indicate that I thought that a light-year was a unit of time, rather than a unit of distance. This slip triggered an avalanche of compassion, mainly from readers in the furthest-flung places - Switzerland, especially. They were convinced, to a man, that I did not really believe that a light-year was a unit of time, and that the error must have crept in because of a warp in the fragment of space-time which I and my brain were transversing at that particular moment. Faxes and letters poured in. Typical was the fax from Kevan Pegley of Haslemere, Surrey. 'How,' he asked, 'could a man of your . . .' - I'll delete his next four words, which were deeply and movingly flattering - '. . . have fallen prey to such a common blunder? A light-year is a unit not of time but of distance: it is the distance travelled by light, at the speed of very approximately 186,000 miles per second, in one year. It is, therefore, very approximately 5.9 x 1012 miles.' Miss Lee has spent the last fortnight collating these faxes and letters with the zeal you would expect of a Thatcherite Yorkshirewoman whose self-esteem has been buttressed by large purchases of Japanese designer gear. 'Yes,' said Miss Lee, as I passed through the green room. 'We now have 473 light-year faxes in the red folder and 322 light-year letters in the blue folder. It is wonderfully exciting - far better than the World Cup. 'Michael, why does the World Cup last so long? What are they doing? If it hadn't been for the World Cup you would not have been lured into musing about the possibility of there being, somewhere in the galaxy, a Milky Way World Cup for soccer-playing planets, which is how you stumbled into your light-year error in the first place. Soccer is hideous. It's just groups of hairy men rolling on the ground and being given red and blue cards.' I said: 'Red and yellow cards.' Miss Lee said: 'Be that as it may. What the world needs most is a completely new game. The old ones are boring. I believe I read last year - probably Vanity Fair - that the man who founded Nike - can't remember his name - I expect he had a beard - had been told by someone in Hollywood that sports were now a bigger business world-wide than the entertainment business, and that this man - the one who founded Nike - had set himself the target of inventing a new game.' 'Why?' 'Well, it would appear, Michael, that this man at Nike shares my opinion - namely, that all sports at present, particularly those with balls - soccer, tennis, badminton - are fundamentally silly. We need a new game. A game that women can watch, which means games that do not involve groups of greasy men throwing or striking a ball and rolling about on the ground.' I said: 'Badminton is played with a shuttlecock.' I left Miss Lee's presence and returned to the dining room, where I have been watching the World Cup on the smaller of our screens. But I could not concentrate. Miss Lee, I thought, was right. We need a new game. Recently I have played some tennis with Norman Lamont, the former UK chancellor. Norman is a naturally-gifted ball player. But the thought crossed my mind as the ball sped to and fro that tennis, after all, is astonishingly silly. Soccer is silly. Rugby is ugly and silly. We need a new game. I shall spend most of next week thinking about this game. In the meantime, faxes and letters continue to swell Miss Lee's bulging folders. Who would have thought that a tiny light-year error could have produced a crusade to find a new game so as to drain the mire of silliness in which the world is bogged.</p>

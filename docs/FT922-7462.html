			<p>920519 FT  19 MAY 92 / Pressure over BR route access The government faced demands from both sides of the Commons last night to ensure that the introduction of rail services by private-sector operators is not limited to British Rail's most profitable routes. Mr John Prescott, Labour's shadow transport secretary, led the calls for restrictions to prevent 'cherry-picking' by Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group and other interests keen to secure access to BR's tracks. Railway enthusiast Mr Robert Adley (C Christchurch), who has warned that the privatisation of BR might become a 'potential poll tax on wheels', also insisted that private-sector operators should not be allowed just to 'pick the bit they like'. He suggested a 'coupling procedure' - with those seeking to operate the most profitable routes being required to take responsibility for a less attractive service as well - as one means of protecting BR's position. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, who moved the second reading of the British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Bill, confirmed that the principle measure dealing with BR would be introduced in the autumn It would be preceded by a white paper outlining proposals for the franchising of passenger services, the sale of BR's freight and parcels buisnesses, and preparing the way for the sale of stations. He described the bill - which Mr Adley promised not to oppose while reserving his position on the measure to be introduced in the autumn - as the first legislative step to bringing the 'the benefits of the private sector and privatisation to the coal and rail industries'. Mr MacGregor was unable to answer fears expressed by Mr Tam Dalyell (Lab Linlithgow) that negotiations were already in hand for the sale of Edinburgh's Waverley station. That, Mr Dalyell told the House, occupied a most valuable central site and had benefited from the investment of 'huge amounts of money'. The minister said decisions on the future structure of the coal industry and the timing of its privatisation had yet to be made. Mr Prescott argued that the bill reflected the government's 'ideological obsession' with privatisation, and emphasised that France, Germany and other countries with efficient railway services believed that they could best be operated as a state enterprise. He condemned the excessive restrictions imposed by the Treasury which prevented British Rail having the same access to private capital as its foreign counterparts.</p>

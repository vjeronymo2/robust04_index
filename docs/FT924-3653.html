			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / UN gloomy on ex-Soviet states' economic hopes THE sharp downturn in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has deepened this year and for most of the region will continue into 1993, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. In its Economic Bulletin for Europe published today, the ECE says output in 1992 has fallen even in those countries expecting a recovery, and 'most people have had to endure further cuts in their standards of living'. Popular enthusiasm for a new order has given way 'to widespread feelings of disappointment and anxiety about the future', the ECE says. Initial over-optimism about the speed at which the transition from centralised planning to a market economy could be achieved has fuelled discontent and provided 'fertile ground for the revival of ancient hatreds'. The ECE says that, despite the generally sombre situation, 'there are signs of improvement' in Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics. In Albania, Bulgaria and Romania, national output is expected to fall further in 1993, but more slowly than this year. However, in the former Soviet republics economic decline has accelerated in 1992 and short-term prospects 'leave little room for optimism'. The ECE expects national output in eastern Europe to fall on average by about 10 per cent this year, a drop of almost a third since 1988. By the first half of 1992 industrial production had fallen by more than 40 per cent since 1988. In the Commonwealth of Independent States economic activity fell by nearly a fifth in the first half of this year, to about 30 per cent below 1989 levels. In Russia alone, the ECE expects net national product (output excluding services) to drop by a quarter in 1992, a fall of 36 per cent since 1989. In the three Baltic states the situation this year has been worse still. In Latvia, GDP in the first half of the year was nearly a third down on 12 months earlier, 'the largest decline in any transition economy not racked by civil war or armed conflict'. Unemployment in eastern Europe has risen rapidly and will soon accelerate sharply in the former Soviet Union, the ECE predicts. 'The prospect of mass unemployment in countries where the social safety net is only rudimentary must inevitably increase the danger that social and political support for economic reform will quickly evaporate.' The ECE has consistently argued for a co-ordinated approach to western assistance for eastern Europe along the lines of the post-war Marshall Plan for western Europe. In the latest bulletin it says there needs to be a 'safety net' for the transition process. Instead, it says, those in most urgent need of assistance appear to have the greatest difficulty in obtaining it. In addition, most of the so-called 'aid' to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union is in fact debt-creating, while the total amount of credits and other assistance to the region in 1991 and 1992 adds up to less than half the Dollars 184bn (Pounds 121bn) in transfers from west to east Germany alone.</p>

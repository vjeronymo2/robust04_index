			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Quality Software seeks quote QUALITY SOFTWARE Prod-ucts, a small computer software company based in Gateshead, plans to seek a stock exchange listing later this month. It wants to raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m to fund expansion. Formed in 1981, the company is a leading UK accounting software supplier. Mr Alan Mordain, chairman, said the listing would enable Quality Software to develop a new product line - Universal Olas - and engage in joint products 'with a large number of companies which have expressed interest.' Pre-tax profits for 1992 were expected to be Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.5m in 1991), before Pounds 600,000 of exceptional costs, on turnover of Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 11.1m). The company is expected to be valued at about Pounds 25m. It currently has some 130 customers, mostly large.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Storehouse falls Discouraging remarks from Storehouse over current trading saw stores analysts trimming back their profits forecasts as the shares dropped back in busy turnover of nearly 4m. The market had been expecting sales growth at BHS and Mothercare to be 5 and 6 per cent respectively. However, the company put the figures at 4 and 5 per cent which, together with warnings of a Pounds 6m provision, was enough to prompt a raft of revisions. Storehouse finished 7 cheaper at 222p. Storehouse's decline was seen as symptomatic of a day the stores sector absorbed the mildly disappointing retail sales figures for August. Several stocks weakened as a result as analysis of the figures showed footwear suffering a reverse and clothing also experiencing a year-on-year decline. Marks and Spencer fell 8 1/2 to 381p, Next rallied to close a net 2 off at 206 1/2 p on 3.4m traded, and Sears slipped 2 1/2 to 112 1/2 p. One of the sector's few bright spots was Kingfisher, up 2 at 647p, which basked in positive comments from Tuesday's results, and benefited also from some early switching out of Storehouse.</p>

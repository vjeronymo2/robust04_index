			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Arts: A 'Figaro' tingling with life One would have thought that enough versions of the Mozart operas had been recorded in the composer's bicentenary year, but apparently not. Charles Mackerras is recording another cycle in Scotland and the Edinburgh Festival has once more jumped in to profit from the sessions. This year was the turn of Le nozze di Figaro in a concert performance at the Usher Hall on Monday. It is a long time since Mackerras presided as a guardian of Mozart style in London and just how zestful he is in this repertoire may be getting forgotten. His Figaro tingled with life in every bar. With luck the Scottish Chamber Orchestra has absorbed Mackerras's rhythmical and bracing way of playing Mozart as a permanent feature. If nothing else, they are unlikely to forget how fast it goes. After Runnicles's Mahler on the opening night, the festival has certainly made an up-tempo start. Being Mackerras, he is not content to conduct the same version of the opera as everybody else. The research into ornamentation that he pioneered in the 1960s was further explored here, emphasising that the rhythm of the Italian language should be paramount in how the music is sung. Furthermore, he gave us some different arias from those we expect. Not all his experiments worked. Carol Vaness's Countess, for one, would have made a better impression in 'Dove sono' if she had been left to sing what we usually hear, rather than the highly-decorated showpiece unearthed by Mackerras. The alternative arias for Susanna - 'Un moto di gioia' and 'Al desio' - are also less original than the usual pair, but at least Nuccia Focile made a winning job of them. It was the Italians in the cast who shone, because they fitted Mackerras's conception of Figaro as a quick-fire comedy. Focile's Susanna, second cousin to her Despina, was pert and quick-witted. Alessandro Corbelli, previously known as a buffo baritone, is not a natural for the Count, but he made a forceful figure, on the pompous side. Alfonso Antoniozzi was characterful as both Bartolo and Antonio. Carol Vaness has scored successes in the past with Mozart's active soprano roles, but the passive nature of the Countess suited her less well. Simply having to sing beautifully is not what she is best at. Despite biting into the text, Alastair Miles is on the phlegmatic side for Figaro. Susanne Mentzer's Cherubino lacked adolescent fire in his belly. For 'Voi che sapete' she had been given intricate 18th-century embellishments written by one Domenico Corri, a happy find. Corri lived in Edinburgh, so Mackerras had made a handy Scottish connection.</p>

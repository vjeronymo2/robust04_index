			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE PROJECT WILL PUT KIDS ON CENTER STAGE;  </P> <P> PERFORMING ARTS: 'CITY MOVES' WILL GIVE 250 SCHOOLCHILDREN A CHANCE TO STUDY  MODERN DANCE, CULMINATING IN PUBLIC PERFORMANCES AT THE SAN DIEGO CONVENTION  CENTER.  </P> <P> The San Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts, San Diego's leading modern  dance presenter, will move into the vanguard of dance education next week when  it launches "City Moves," an ambitious dance education and performance project  for San Diego schoolchildren. The program was outlined at a press conference  Monday.  </P> <P> "City Moves" will involve 250 children ages 8 through 18, as well as 50 local  dancers, in its inaugural year. It will include a nine months of auditions at  schools and community centers, master classes, rehearsals and public  performances.  </P> <P> "I think what we're doing is unique in the country," foundation director Fred  Colby said. "This is the first (educational program) organized and run by a  presenter."  </P> <P> The school year will culminate with five performances of "The Terrible Tale of  Ringmaster Twigg," a new dance-theater piece commissioned for the project. The  work will be choreographed by project director William Conrow, who wrote the  show, and other area dance makers, including Three's Company artistic director  Jean Isaacs; Patricia Sandback, director of SDSU's dance program, and Stage  Seven artistic director Katherine Irey.  </P> <P> Performances are scheduled for Memorial Day weekend at the San Diego Convention  Center.  </P> <P> About 2,000 students from the San Diego Unified School District's "Young at Art  Program" will help create the sets, costumes and music. Five visual artists  from the "Young at Arts Program" were commissioned to work with the students on  that portion of the project.  </P> <P> San Diegans Bob Willey and Christopher Penney will compose the original music,  and Philip Matzigkeit of the "Young at Art" program is charged with designing  the decor.  </P> <P> " 'City Moves' will be one of the largest theatrical events ever presented in  San Diego," Colby said. The project is meant "to significantly raise San  Diego's appreciation and support of dance and dance education."  </P> <P> "During the first three weeks," beginning in early October, "we'll be putting  on presentations to show the kids what it's all about," said Albert Rodewald, a  foundation spokesman. "That ought to get 7,000 or 8,000 kids exposed."  </P> <P> Half the young dancers for "City Moves" will be selected by audition from among  the 20 schools participating this year. The remaining students, as well as the  adult dancers, will be chosen through auditions at eight participating  community centers throughout San Diego.  </P> <P> A quarter of the cast will be culled from high schools and another quarter will  come from junior and middle schools; the remaining half will come from  elementary schools. There will be no tuition charges for any of the  participants.  </P> <P> The foundation, known for presenting well-known dance companies from out of  town, plans to use this program as a means of nurturing San Diego's own dance  community.  </P> <P> "There's always been that concern that we're importing dance, and not part of  the local dance community," Colby said. "But we've always seen the value of  bringing in the greats like the Joffrey, ABT, Martha Graham. Now you can see  the results in the growth of the dance community.  </P> <P> "We came to the conclusion that we had an obligation to the community," he  said. "It was important for us to give something back, and there's been no real  programs to educate children in dance in the San Diego schools. I personally  have strong political and social concerns, and I believe (this project) is a  valuable tool for solving some of our social problems. This will bring people  together -- black, white, brown, whatever. There's only two ways to do this:  sports and the arts."  </P> <P> Funding for the project will come from a variety of private and public sources,  including Pacific Telesis Foundation, which provided the seed grant of $25,000,  and the San Diego Unified Port District, which is kicking in $46,000 to  underwrite the commissioned work that caps off the first year of the project.  </P> <P> However, Colby said, "we still need to raise an additional $60,000 in  contributions before all aspects of the project can be realized. We have three  other grant applications out now, and we're very confident we'll achieve that  goal, because the response so far has been ecstatic.  </P> <P> "We want the community to come to those performances," he said. "That's why  we're keeping the ticket costs down to $5. We're also trying to get more  corporate support" for free tickets, he said.  </P></p>

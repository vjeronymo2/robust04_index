			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Major fires broadside at social policy - UK premier warns rising labour costs are undermining EC competitiveness BRITAIN'S prime minister, Mr John Major, yesterday sought to move on to the offensive in his long-running battle with the country's Community partners over social policy by spelling out the link between Europe's escalating labour costs and its declining competitiveness. In a presentation to the Copenhagen summit which was designed to capitalise on what he sees as a new mood of 'realism' in the Community, Mr Major also took a further sideswipe at Germany for preventing a European-wide reduction in interest rates. Emphasising the advantages that Britain now enjoyed from a combination of low inflation and low borrowing costs, Mr Major said that high real interest rates elsewhere were 'penalising growth, stopping investment and damaging business and consumer confidence'. He also warned against any relaxation of Maastricht treaty guidelines on fiscal deficits, even though he regarded as 'fanciful' the timetable set for European monetary union. However, the prime minister reserved the thrust of his speech for a frontal attack on the damaging impact of high employment costs on competitiveness and on job-creation. Contrasting Europe's failure to create jobs during the 1980s with the success achieved in the US, he told other leaders: 'The choice before us is a stark one. We surely do not want the 17m unemployed in Europe to become 20m or more people without jobs. We must compete or we shall contract.' He called for new procedures under which any proposed EC legislation affecting industry or employment would be accompanied by a full analysis of its impact on competitiveness. In parallel, the European Commission should carry out a thorough audit of existing directives to gauge their impact on business costs and jobs. In what his aides described as an attempt to dislodge the notion that Europe could prosper 'through trade with itself', Mr Major offered a litany of figures to underline the EC's weakening competitiveness and rising structural unemployment. The Community share of the industrialised world's exports had fallen by 10 per cent during the 1980s. EC unit wage costs had risen by 4 per cent a year over the same period. In the US, the rise had been 1 per cent a year. In Japan there had been no increase. As a result, average labour costs in manufacturing in the EC were now 20 per cent higher that in Japan or the US. Offering his prescription, Mr Major called for greater labour market flexibility and mobility, an end to wage indexation and the promotion of flexible work patterns and employment contracts. That provided the basis for a sharp attack on efforts to harmonise social policy across the Community. With the non-wage costs of European employers nearly twice the level of their competitors in the US, the priority should be to reduce the regulatory and social burdens on industry. Seizing on four directives either passed or under consideration - covering working time, acquired employment rights, young people and part-time workers  -Mr Major warned: 'There is a real danger that harmonisation at Community level is locking us in to costly labour market rigidities and driving away business to our competitors.' Backing in principle Mr Jacques Delors' plan to produce a report for the Brussels summit next December, he said that the main focus should be on improvements to the functioning of labour markets and lightening the burdens on industry.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Cao Min: "Jobs Probe to Boost the Rights </F> of Workers"]    [Text] The Labour Ministry is to launch a massive  employment inspection to ensure workers' conditions meet State  standards, it was revealed yesterday.    The inspection will cover all urban and township enterprises  whether they are Chinese or foreign-funded, a ministry spokesman  said.    And it will run from April 1 until June 30.    Among the things labour departments will be checking is  whether enterprises have violated the law by using child labour  or making women work in unsuitable jobs, the official said.    The inspectors will also check contracts, wages, working  hours, insurance and welfare treatment, the official added.    The imperfect legal system and a lack of government  supervision have caused a sharp rise in the number of labour  disputes in China since the beginning of last year, said a  recent Labour Ministry circular.    The Beijing-based China Electronic News said there were more  than 10,000 disputes last year, and the Labour Bureau in  Shenzhen Special Economic Zone alone reported 2,353 in the first  half of the year.    Some enterprises, particularly those outside State  ownership,  have violated labour laws and regulations, infringing workers'  legitimate rights and interests.    The Shenzhen Special Zone Daily said a local joint venture  hotel owed 238,000 yuan ($27,300) in back salarises to its  employees in January.    Some employers paid little heed to their workers' health and  made them work prolonged hours.    These firms also often ignored workers' safety.    Some trade union officials on the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have tabled proposals urging  better protection for workers, particularly in foreign-funded  firms, at the current Second Session of the CPPCC Eighth  National Committee.    The government is very concerned about the problems and has  instructed labour departments to look into them thoroughly, said  the official.    Any illegal practices will be dealt with and those found  guilty will be warned, fined or may lose their business licence.    The Labour Ministry hoped industry, commerce and public  security administrations plus trade unions and women's and youth  organizations would work with labour departments during the  inspection.    It has also urged the country's mass media to publicize  labour laws and regulations and provide consulting services on  policies and laws.</p>

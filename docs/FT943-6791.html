			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palm oil prices at highest since 1984 Export prices for Malaysian palm oil have hit the highest levels for more than 10 years and traders are forecasting further gains as world demand increases. This week the export price for immediate delivery of Malaysia's crude palm oil reached MDollars 1,402 (Pounds 354) a tonne - the first time since 1984 that prices had breached the MDollars 1,400 mark. 'Rising demand, particularly from China and Pakistan, plus lower Malaysian production this year is likely to push prices up still higher,' said a Singapore-based commodities trader. Malaysia is the world's biggest producer of palm oil, accounting for about 55 per cent of total global output. Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the country's minister of primary industries, said that Malaysia's palm oil output this year was likely to be lower than the 7.4m tonnes produced in 1993 because the local crop was 'over-stressed' after two years of good yields. Its palm oil stocks have been steadily declining in recent months: according to latest statistics from the palm oil registration and licensing authority, stocks at the end of July were 451,500 tonnes, a 4 per cent drop on the previous month's figure. Meanwhile Malaysia's palm oil producers have stepped up pressure on the government to take action to alleviate severe labour shortages in the plantation sector. Plantation owners say that more should be done to ensure that foreign workers stay on the plantations and not move after a few months to factory jobs in urban areas. Many palm oil and rubber estates in Malaysia are more than 60 per cent staffed by immigrant workers.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains cut back before the close of trading - Market Report The UK stock market extended its recovery yesterday, although shares closed well below the best of the day as Wall Street failed to carry through its overnight strength into the new trading session. Market strategists sounded somewhat cautious of applauding the equity rally, pointing out that the first day of the new financial year in the UK brought a sharp increase in trading volume which appeared to be grounded in tax-related deals. A further shaving of interest rates at the money market repo auction in Germany, together with a firm performance from sterling, encouraged interest rate optimism. Gains in UK government bonds also buttressed confidence in the stock market and little attention was paid to the rise in annualised MO money supply last month. But the final reading on the FT-SE 100 Index of 3,131.5 for a gain of 15.3 was well below the day's peak and did not even match the first reading on the index, which opened some 26 points up in response to the Dow's overnight rise of 83 points. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which includes a range of second line stocks, put on 15.1 at 3,778.1. The early strength also reflected a substantial buy programme which appeared to be related to year-end tax trades and originated from a large US investment bank. Lines of stock, across both the Footsie and FT-SE Mid 250 ranges, were sold on Tuesday night by investors seeking to establish a tax loss for 1993-1994. At the opening of the market yesterday, many of these stocks were rebought in deals which lifted the Seaq trading total sharply. Boosted by these tax-related deals, Seaq business for the day jumped by nearly one-quarter to 944.2m shares. But traders said business died away in the middle of the session, although reviving towards the close when both US Federal bonds and Wall Street turned easier. The Dow Industrial Average was 14 points down when London went home for the day, leaving UK traders to watch New York markets closely for a lead to this morning's London opening. London was somewhat slower than some continental European markets to respond to the improvement overnight in sentiment on Wall Street. Analysts of the UK market pointed to lingering uncertainties over the outlook for domestic base rates. Hopes for an early cut in rates to counterbalance the tax rises to be implemented this month appear threatened by the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve will tighten credit policy again soon, as well as by political uncertainties in the UK. However, market confidence steadied yesterday. Hoare Govett, the UK securities house, dismissed last week's rumours that a repeat of the 1987 crash was in the offing, noting that the 'pendulum of market sentiment' has swung from one extreme to the other since the beginning of the year. In particular, Hoare urges that the yield ratio of bonds to equities has remained relatively stable at around 2.1, compared with more than 3.3 at the time of the 1987 crash. 'The two episodes have been entirely different,' said Hoare. US dollar strength helped the multi-nationals, with the pharmaceutical sector in good form. Across the wider range, the stress was again on manufacturing sectors, and consumer stocks continued to lag behind as the market focused on sectors more directly linked to UK economic recovery.</p>

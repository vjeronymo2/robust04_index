			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Grainger pays Pounds 61m for Frincon - Deal will treble Newcastle group's commercial property portfolio Grainger Trust, the Newcastle-based property company, will more than treble the size of its commercial property interests with the acquisition of privately owned investor and developer Frincon for Pounds 60.8m. Grainger is paying for the acquisition through the issue of 4m shares and Pounds 50.7m loan notes to the family of Mr Robin Tomkins, who founded Frincon in the late 1970s. The deal will give the Tomkins family 16 per cent of the enlarged company. Mr Tomkins will join Grainger's board as a non-executive director. Frincon's assets comprise office, retail and industrial property, around half of which is in the Colchester area. However, under the terms of the deal Grainger has an option to sell part of the portfolio back to the vendors in September next year. The properties covered by the option are either substantially unlet or let on leases that will shortly expire. Mr Stephen Dickinson, managing director of Grainger, said the arrangement gave the company a year to find new tenants and renegotiate leases before deciding whether to sell in the open market or sell the properties back to the Tomkins family. 'They may well get a lot of these properties back,' he said. If this option is exercised, Grainger would be left with a portfolio of 32 freehold and five leasehold properties valued at Pounds 81.3m. Mr Dickinson said these properties were mostly fully let at rents close to current market levels. A maximum of Pounds 29.9m of loan notes issued to the Tomkins family could be redeemed. After allowing for Pounds 11.6m cash acquired with Frincon, Grainger's net outlay for this portfolio would be only Pounds 19.3m. Until now, it has specialised in buying residential property let under regulated tenancies. Such properties are usually bought at a discount to reflect the sitting rights of the tenants and sold when they become vacant. Grainger is the second largest quoted residential landlord after Bradford Property Trust. Before yesterday's deal around two thirds of its assets were residential. This proportion will now fall to about half. Grainger expects to have made a pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds 5.6m in the year to September 30, compared with Pounds 1.7m last time. The latest figures will include a Pounds 1.9m write-back on the value of current assets. The company also expects to pay a final dividend of 4.55p, making a total for the year of 5.9p (5.25p).</p>

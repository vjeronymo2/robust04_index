			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Quaker buys 'new age' drinks Quaker Oats, the US food and beverage group, has agreed to pay Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.07bn) in cash to acquire Snapple Beverage, a company that has changed the shape of the US soft drinks market with its 'new age' iced teas and fruit-flavoured drinks. Quaker also said it would seek buyers for its European petfood business, which makes Felix catfood and Fido dogfood, and its Mexican confectionery arm which produces La Azteca chocolate. Snapple, based in Valley Stream, Long Island, has grown rapidly in the US by selling bottled drinks that appeal to an increasingly health-conscious public. Annual sales shot up to Dollars 516m last year from Dollars 44m in 1990. Recently, however, Snapple's profits and share price have been hit by the cost of geographical expansion and by competition from companies such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, which have jumped on to the alternative beverage bandwagon. Snapple said net profits had sunk from Dollars 26.9m to Dollars 7.1m in the quarter to September. Chicago-based Quaker Oats, for many months the subject of bid speculation, has been under pressure to realign its businesses because of lacklustre financial performance. Last week it reported a fall in net income from Dollars 91.4m to Dollars 57.3m in the quarter to September, blaming weakness in European petfood sales and increased marketing costs, especially for its Gatorade sports drinks in North America. Mr William Smithburg, Quaker chairman and chief executive, said the combination of Gatorade and Snapple would create North America's largest 'good-for-you' beverage company, with market leadership in teas, juice drinks and sports drinks. He said the petfood and chocolate disposals would concentrate Quaker on faster-growing, higher-margin businesses. The European petfoods business has annual revenues of about Dollars 800m and Mexican chocolate has annual revenues of about Dollars 100m. Mr Les Pugh, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street investment bank, said the two would probably fetch about Dollars 700m. He cited Nestle, the biggest European food company, as a possible buyer.</p>

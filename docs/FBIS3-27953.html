			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Masahide Kawashima: "Will a Favorable Wind Arise </F> for `Decentralization'?"]    [Text] This happened when a pianist who is staying in  Saltzburg, and who returned to Japan for a time in  mid-September, dined with me. By a whimsical turn of fortune, a  university president with whom she is acquainted in Austria is  going to collect and publish "one-page messages" from persons in  various fields in countries around the world, and she asked me  to cooperate with him; it was a situation in which I had to  write one. I sent him something with a stiff, formal title. "The  Relationship Between the Central Government and the Provinces in  Japan."    At present, we are right in the midst of a "political reform  Diet session." There is no doubt that the biggest news that  should be dispatched from Japan is the four political reform  bills which are fixed mainly on historic changes in the  electoral system. But it makes me expect that the complications  will be extraordinary. Moreover, I suspected that things were a  bit too fishy, even if we take it as fairly certain that it  would be settled during the Diet session. So I selected for my  subject the secondary "eye" of the typhoon.    To the Hosokawa government, decentralization is not so much  an extension of political reform as it is something that  complements, expands, and completes political reform. Is it,  perhaps, rather a task with the properties of a leading point  which forms a concentric circle?  <H5>  Expectations "Because It Is Hosokawa" </H5>   Certainly one can say that decentralization is the Hosokawa  government's highest task. Moreover, there are also great  expectations because of it being the Hosokawa government.    First, the lineup. Four persons who have been governors or  mayors have assembled. Prime Minister Hosokawa spent 10 years as  the "clan lord" of Kumamoto Prefecture. He is known for the  "Artopolis policy," which tries to awaken consciousness of urban  design, the "hands on" plan, which took the lead in computer  education for elementary and middle school pupils, and for many  ambitious experiments and bold initiatives in the "Japan first"  campaign, activation of the prefecture, and regional development.    Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, has experience  as an official in Saitama Prefecture, and he not only advanced  rapidly to mayor of Yokaichi and governor of Shiga Prefecture,  he distinguished himself by such environmental policies as the  Biwa treaty and policies on municipalities and communities.  Minister of Construction Kozo Igarashi was mayor of Hokkaido's  Asahikawa, a "shopping paradise"; and Eijiro Hata, minister of  agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, was the "idea mayor" of  Oita Prefecture's Hita. That is the lineup.    It is not just the lineup. In his keynote address for the  special Diet session, Prime Minister Hosokawa made his position  clear, saying, "We must by all means succeed in the tasks of  relaxing regulations, promoting decentralization, and correcting  the harmful effect of administration which is compartmentalized  by competition over turf... and also continue to develop  regional administration that is filled with a vitality in which  the region's special characteristics and autonomy are reflected."    It cannot be doubted that every government agency will be  gauging the wind direction toward decentralization as it  considers development of new policies. Take, for example, the  Ministry of Construction. Since the formation of the new  government, it has set forth changes of posture in rapid  succession: a great reduction in such duties entrusted to  agencies as decisions on city plans, reconsideration of national  leadership in wide-area public works, creation of "regional  improvement action programs" centered on autonomous bodies, and  so on. I would like to take this to mean that the ministry  became aware of the political reform goal of eliminating the  hotbed of politician-bureaucrat-businessman collusion, and  changing the centralized administration of construction.  <H5>  The Wind Direction Was Changing </H5>   But the favorable wind toward decentralization was growing  much stronger up to the general election. Along with political  reform, decentralization was gradually being narrowed to an  issue both at the center and in the provinces.    The moves this year to which one should pay attention are  the  "wide-region alliance" and "nuclear city" reports of the 23d  Local Government System Research Council, the proposal of the  Political Reform Promotion Council (Private Ad Hoc Council on  Political Reform) for a "decentralization revolution," and the  "decentralization resolutions" in both houses prior to  dissolution of the lower house. It was an upsurge, with the  report of the Third Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform, and  the proposals of the Japan Junior Chamber, Inc. and the National  Congress for Political Reform, and the trend in the research and  discussion of the National Governors' Association, and advocacy  by all political parties of a system of basic law for  decentralization.    Nostalgia also appeared for the past argument for merging of  prefectures to form "regional" administrative bodies, there were  also animated calls for a new federal system, and such fruitful  steps as the Hyogo Prefecture Symposium hosted by the National  Governors' Association and the National Discussion Conference  hosted by the Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform were also seen.    A number of things can be considered as the background to  this. First, the changes in the world political and economic  situation because of the collapse of the cold war structure. The  fact that the central government should turn its eyes outward,  and transfer both authority and responsibility for internal  affairs to autonomous bodies. Diverse multipolar policies on  national land can be cited as the second, and for the third,  which is the reverse side of the coin, transfer of authority to  local areas was sought because there was a genuine grappling  with such activities as improving district towns. And for the  fourth, there were demands for structural reform linked to  political reform; and so on and so forth.    It is probable that the circumstances of decentralization  have begun to differ from when things were, in a real sense,  driven by an adverse wind in the direction of "neo new  centralization" by the policy line of "the general settlement of  accounts for postwar politics" under the Nakasone government.  <H3>  Toward Basic Laws on Decentralization and Laws To Promote  Decentralization </H3>   Among the times when the argument for decentralization has  surged since the end of World War II, the major special  characteristics this time are such things as the striking  enthusiasm of chiefs of prefectures and municipalities who are  grappling with decentralization, such core parties as the Japan  New Party also have officially espoused it and begun action, and  municipalities are concentrating on making it a reality, within  the scope of what they can do, and have, therefore, elevated it  to a priority task in such municipal administration as  ordinances and charters. There were also proposals for a  national campaign.    The point which, more than any other, sets it off decisively  from past arguments for decentralization is that calls to  reverse the proper nature of the relationship between the  central government and the provinces, and to change to a  blueprint in which the provinces come first in both social  consciousness and the legal system, occurred without being  anticipated.    Up till now, virtually all assertions in favor of  decentralization have employed the method of probing minutely  into such things as work entrusted to state agencies, local  agencies of the national government, licensing authority and  subsidies, and seeking a share for the provinces by reorganizing  the functions and business of central government agencies. It  was based on the existing centralized administration, under  which everything is done in instalments. This reverses that.  Prefectures and municipalities would shoulder authority and  responsibility for everything concerning domestic affairs, and  the agencies of the central government would bear a portion  limited to diplomacy, national defense, planning, and  preservation covering the entire country, such as currency, and  adjustment among local governments.    It is a view that penetrates to the heart of  decentralization  in the general discussion, rather than in later details. The  National Governors' Conference and the Ad Hoc Council on  Political Reform proposed it. In the representative  interpellation at the beginning of the last regular Diet  session, Sadao Yamahana, who at the time was chairman of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan, sought establishment of a  system of basic law for decentralization. At a meeting of the  prefectural assembly, Governor (Toshitami) Mihara of Hyogo  Prefecture proposed "laws limiting centralization." There are  various ways of referring to it, such as a basic law on  decentralization, or laws to promote it, or a basic law on local  autonomous bodies, but the direction of the argument for  decentralization is being established.  <H5>  The Wall Is Still High, But... </H5>   However, the wall impeding the favorable wind toward  decentralization is still high. The resistance of central  government agencies is a force that renders essentially hollow  the "main purpose of local autonomy," which the new postwar  Constitution held up as a principle. It is not easy to raze a  wall that is strengthened by such things as administration  compartmentalized by turf boundaries, work entrusted to  agencies, licensing authority, and policy on subsidies. Nor can  one see that the advent of the new Hosokawa government, which  makes decentralization its highest task, changed the situation.    The symbol of that is the final report of the Provisional  Council for Promotion of Administrative Reform (Third  Administrative Reform Council, chaired by Eiji Suzuki). Prime  Minister Hosokawa is serving as chairman of this council's  sectional meeting on affluent life, and even when addressing a  regular meeting after having assumed the post of prime minister,  he said "I feel that I have returned to a room that is dear to  me," but in the report is nothing that challenges the wall. The  resistance of government agencies to compilation of the report  was dreadful, so it ended with the opinion of some members  wanting to make clear a posture toward decentralization that  differed from that of the time of LDP governments, being  repulsed.    Ironically, after the Hosokawa government was born, the  worst  situation that puts a damper on the approach to decentralization  is spreading. The corruption of heads of local governments.  After the arrest of Mayor Toru Ishii of Sendai and Governor  Fujio Takeuchi of Ibaraki, the entire system of general  contractors and the heads of other local governments bodies  continue to be shaken.    When the agitation toward decentralization increases, voices  from central government agencies arguing against it are heard  without fail. Will it be safe to transfer authority to the  provinces; will they be able to handle it; will money not be  used in a wasteful manner? It is a so-called "catch-all"  argument.    The corruption of a string of headmen and general  contractors  evoked uneasiness in the population, to say nothing of agencies  of the central government. Even if one tries to answer the  uneasiness by saying such things as "the corruption of money and  power is the same even for the central government, nay, the  scale of Lockheed, Recruit, and so on is far greater," and "if  authority shifts to the provinces, the locus of responsibility  will be clear, and it is easier to do a thorough job when the  eyes which are monitoring are near to the public," it sounds  feeble. It is probably certain that the momentum toward  decentralization was diminished. I cannot help being  disappointed.  <H5>  Rebound by Four Political Reform Laws </H5>   Even if it were not so, there is confusion in the provinces,  not so much because of the advent of the Hosokawa government as  because of the crumbling of the LDP's long rule. At the National  Governor's Conference that was hosted by the government on 14  September, the prime minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary  Takemura received words of the greatest welcome, such as  "persons who understand the heart of the provinces..." (Governor  Morihiko Hiramatsu of Oita Prefecture). On the other hand, the  picture of an uncertain attitude by the provinces is  conspicuously making the rounds, at the center, of Diet members  from the prefectures, and in Diet policy in the local areas and  in dealing with the coalition governing parties and the  opposition LDP. One can say that it is unavoidable, but to the  Hosokawa government this, too, is a wall which it must break  through.    The current Diet session is a political reform session, so  passage of the four bills becomes the goal with the highest  priority. The outlook has come to be that even the  opposition-party LDP will have to cooperate in their passage. It  will probably work out to be a form in which there will be  decentralization in the future. Transparency and a sense of  fairness. With the four reform bills as an impetus, the Hosokawa  government will grapple with decentralization as an extension of  them. What will it do about the system of laws on administrative  procedure which was inherited from the previous regular Diet  session; what will it think of the next-generation  administrative reform of the Third Ad Hoc Council on  Administrative Reform, which has finished its mission; will it  devise a Fifth National Comprehensive Development Plan in  response to a complete inspection of the Fourth National  Comprehensive Development Plan, which began in the time of the  previous government; furthermore, what about a thorough  relaxation of regulations; what about systematization of opening  information to the public, and what about a system of basic laws  for decentralization---?    In my "one page message" to Australia [as published], I  wrote  that the situation of making a reality of the decentralization  and local autonomy which retrogressed in terms of the principles  of the new constitution would probably be difficult for  Europeans to understand. It can be called a different world from  that of people who possess a history in which autonomy of cities  led to nation states. And next, when I am asked for a followup  report on the "message," I want to dispose of it with one line.  "True political reform became a reality in Japan."

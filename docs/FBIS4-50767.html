			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- The so-called evidence  produced by a Harry Wu on Wednesday [18 May] to prove that China  has continued to export prison-labor products to the United  States is entirely false, a government official said here today.    A leading official of the Chinese judicial department said  that according to yesterday's WASHINGTON POST and WASHINGTON  TIMES, Harry Wu said at a news conference on may 15 that the  Shandong United Steel Tube Company in East China's Shandong  Province had shipped 180,000 pounds of steel tubes to two  Florida-based subsidiaries of the Waxmon Company of the United  States.    Wu claimed that the Chinese company is a "prison-labor  factory."    The official said that the fact is that the company, based  in  the coastal city of Qingdao, is a subsidiary of the Shandong  Provincial Branch of the China Foreign Trade Transportation  Corporation.    The factory is by no means a "prison-labor factory" and has  never exported steel tubes to the United States, he added.    Harry Wu also claimed at the news conference that the  Houston- based Cosmos Trading Company of the U.S. had imported  hardware and tools from the Shenda Tools Factory based in  Hangzhou, the capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.    He argued that the factory had "2,000 prisoners."    The official said that the factory, built in 1991 is by no  means a prison-labor factory, but a factory attached to the  Zhejiang Provincial Department of the Machine-Building Industry.    The factory manufactures all kinds of manual tools and  employs 400 people, none of whom is a prisoner, he added.    Harry Wu also claimed that he had taken pictures and videos  of prisoner-made toys, hardware and Christmas tree decoration  lights.    According to the official, everyone knows that such goods  are  available all over China. "So how can Wu's pictures and videos  prove that these goods are prison-labor products?" he asked.    Harry Wu boasted that he had collected "evidence" in 26  prison- labor factories in China.    The official said that in fact, he had not entered any  prison  in China, but had just taken pictures and videos at a distance  outside prisons.    Then Wu montaged these videos with what he had taken in  streets to spread sensational rumors, in an attempt to deceive  the general public, he noted.    The official said that the Chinese Government was  conscientious in implementing a memorandum of understanding  between the Chinese and American Governments on banning the  import and export of prison- labor products.    Not long ago, officials of the U.S. Embassy in China visited  three reform-through-labor units in Guangdong Province, he said,  adding that they were now visiting another two such units in  Zhejiang Province.    "Sino-American cooperation in this regard is now proceeding  smoothly," he said.    "At this time, Harry Wu and others are repeatedly spreading  rumors everywhere, with their ulterior motives all too clear,"  he said.</p>

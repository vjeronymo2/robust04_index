			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Authorities Admit to Salvation </F> Front That Canceling Election Results Was a Mistake"]    [Text] Paris -- Sources close to the Islamic Salvation  Front [FIS] have revealed further details about the contacts  made between the detained FIS shaykhs and Algerian authorities.  The sources said the contacts "were marathon rounds of  dialogue, some of which continued until the early hours of the  morning. They were led for the state by Major General Tayyib  Daradji, inspector general of the ground forces, and a  Constitutional Council member named Kebir. President Zeroual  attended two rounds in his capacity as defense minister before  his assumption of the presidency. He stressed to FIS shaykhs  that he was talking with them in the Army's name." The sources  said that the meetings began on the evening of 30 December 1993,  and that the last meeting was held on 18 February.    The sources quoted FIS shaykhs as saying that those  representing the authorities in the talks "admitted the mistake"  of canceling the elections, and tried to persuade FIS shaykhs to  participate in the national dialogue conference or recommend  someone to represent them. They also asked the shaykhs to issue  a statement condemning terrorism. But the shaykhs rejected  these demands and offered to issue a joint statement with the  regime, specifying the points on which the two sides agree, most  importantly the authorities' admission of their mistake in  canceling the elections.    The shaykhs also insisted on the "legitimacy" of the jihad,  saying it is "the right of the Algerian people, whose rights  have been usurped." They demanded that the "person responsible"  for the present situation be identified in a joint statement.  But the authorities rejected all these demands, only responding  to part of the shaykhs' conditions, namely releasing two of  them, Shaykhs Ali Djeddi and Abdelkader Khamkham, and allowing  them to work freely to get in touch with the detained shaykhs to  tell them of the situation, hence enabling them to make their  decisions and negotiate once again with the authorities.    It seems that all parties are awaiting the outcome of the 8  May march, which will demand dialogue. The march has been  called by the major Algerian parties. The FIS is expected to  participate in it powerfully. FIS leaders will watch the march  to see how the regime will deal with FIS supporters. The march  will also give the FIS the opportunity to test its ability to  mobilize the scene once again.    Algerian sources say that the negotiations between the  regime  and the FIS will resume after 8 May. The most important topic  is expected to be "the resumption of the canceled elections."    Sources close to the FIS say that the "Front cannot agree to  new elections. Because there is no trust at all in the present  authority, and new elections would grant the illegitimate  authorities that have assumed power in Algeria since the 2  January 1992 coup the legitimacy they are looking for, thus  enabling them to rig the elections completely and to claim that  the FIS has lost the popularity it enjoyed in the past, and then  resort to violence and terrorism against the Front under an  alleged legitimacy."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Quintal] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 21 SAPA -- Minister of  Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer said on Thursday [21  April] there was no possibility of amending the constitution and  that the right-wing had not approached the government in this  regard. He was commenting in an interview with SABC [South  African Broadcasting Corporation] radio on the possibility of  the Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner  National Front] participating in the election if certain  conditions were met.    Mr Meyer said the idea of 800,000 votes indicating support  for a volkstaat [homeland] was not viable because it would not  be an indication of the locality of a volkstaat.    Referring to the right-wing's demand for independence, he  said the government was not prepared to fragment South Africa.  Self-determination could be aspired to within the framework of  the existing constitution.    Mr Meyer said the right-wing already had what it wanted,  which was why Gen Constand Viljoen was taking part in the  election.    He suggested Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg link up with Gen Viljoen.</p>

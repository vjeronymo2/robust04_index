			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Minimum wage MR NEIL KINNOCK said yesterday that Labour's national minimum wage will stay fixed at Pounds 3.40 an hour, in spite of the rise in median earnings due next month. Under Labour's original proposals the minimum was to be fixed at half the median earnings rate, expected to be about Pounds 7.20 an hour in April.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Figures from Bank confirm housing market recovery fears Fears about the slowing pace and fragility of the recovery in the housing market were confirmed yesterday after the release of figures which showed new net mortgage lending in May broadly similar to the level in April and May last year. While the statistics published by the Bank of England showed a slight rise in the number and amount of loans approved - which is seen as an important forward-looking indicator - the reaction from the Council of Mortgage Lenders was gloomy. The council, which represents banks, building societies and other lenders, said that the data did not amount to proof of sustained recovery. On a seasonally adjusted basis new net lending in May totalled Pounds 1.5bn, compared with Pounds 1.7bn in April and Pounds 1.4bn in May last year. Within that total, the fall in new net lending by societies was particularly notable, falling from Pounds 1.1bn in April to Pounds 934m in May, while lending by banks rose from Pounds 443m to Pounds 710m. Apart from April the monthly figure for new net lending by banks was the lowest since October last year. The monthly figure for societies was the lowest since last November. The figures also disclosed a withdrawal by centralised lenders, after two months of re-entering the mortgage market. There were more encouraging signs in the figures for loans approvedhowever, with about 86,000 approvals given in May totalling Pounds 4.7bn. The May figures are just higher than those in April - 82,000 loans approved for a total of Pounds 4.6bn - and those in May last year. Some lenders have sometimes seized on even relatively small increases to point to improving prospects for a recovery in the mortgage market, but yesterday Mr Adrian Coles, CML director-general, struck a more downbeat note. He said that mortgage lending statistics had moved within a narrow band for some months. 'There is little evidence for anything other than a painfully slow recovery from the recession. It is not clear that even the modest growth seen over the last year will continue,' he said. Concern about the weakness of the housing market recovery was underlined by Halifax building society in its monthly house price index. It reported a month-on-month rise of 0.3 per cent in house prices in June - the first increase after two monthly falls - leading it to calculate an annual rate of house price inflation of 1.5 per cent. Halifax said that the lower-than-expected levels of mortgage lending and house purchases in recent months seemed to be a result not only of the April tax rises and higher fixed-rate mortgages, but a reflection of generally weak consumer confidence and widespread lack of recognition that the economy was recovering.</p>

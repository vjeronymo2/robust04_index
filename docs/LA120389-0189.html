			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROJECT PLANS FOR CITY'S COAST  </P> <P> Your editorial "Officials Forget Their Duty on Beach Access" (Nov. 16) was  truly misleading and showed a total lack of understanding about Huntington  Beach's proposed Pier Plaza and Pierside Village projects, which you purport  will limit public access.  </P> <P> The truth of the matter is that the proposed improvements along our beachfront  will significantly increase beach accessways and beach parking. It will also  create a pier plaza and park area of four acres for access and enjoyment of all  cities free of charge, an amenity that does not now exist.  </P> <P> You also failed to mention that the parking fee at the city beach is the same  as at the adjacent Huntington and Bolsa Chica state beaches with the exception  of our $1 surcharge, which is being set aside to rebuild our 85-year-old  Municipal Pier. Since 85% of the people using our pier are non-residents, it  seems only fair that they pay a small share of building a new pier.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach is very proud of the nine miles of unobstructed views of our  beach and sunsets along Pacific Coast Highway. Huntington Beach City Councils,  past and present, should be lauded for protecting this resource, which no other  urban city in California has had the pride to do. Is Newport Beach a coastal  city? Is Dana Point or even Laguna Beach? You would hardly ever know it by  driving through those cities along Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> It may disappoint you to know that the State Lands Commission is not opposed to  our currently proposed projects but only wants assurance that no additional  projects are planned that may block views or access. There are none, never have  been, and hopefully never will be if future City Councils maintain the same  wisdom as the past and present have.  </P> <P> On Dec. 4, the preliminary plans for the Pierside Village and Pier Plaza  projects will be presented to the public at the City Council meeting. That will  be the chance for your editorial writer to do something he needs, which is to  research before he writes.  </P> <P> PAUL E. COOK  </P> <P> City Administrator  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

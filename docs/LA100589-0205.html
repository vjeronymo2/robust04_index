			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE GORILLA AND THE GURU: 2 SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON BUSINESS LEADERSHIP  </P> <P> Leadership -- and how to create leaders -- has become a hot topic among  companies that are discovering that there is more to success than balancing the  books.  </P> <P> Leaders are in demand because employees now are "human capital." They don't  work at their jobs, they are "empowered" to do them. And their boss is no  longer a manager but a leader.  </P> <P> Since the leadership craze hit, consultants and chief executive officers have  turned into instant experts. Business magazines have regular columns on  leadership, training seminars use leadership as a theme and an assortment of  how-to and inspirational books on leadership is hitting the best-seller lists.  </P> <P> Two tomes not to be overlooked in the leadership derby mirror the dramatic  differences in management styles that companies have adopted to weather the  competitive turbulence of the 1980s. One is the frontal approach to leadership:  Take charge, be aggressive, ferret out your enemies. The other is kinder and  gentler: Treat people well and look for the good in them, and they will respond  in productive and creative ways.  </P> <P> Attila the Hun, meet Max DePree.  </P> <P> "Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun," written by Wess Roberts, a  human-resources professional at Fireman's Fund Insurance, is a 110-page  leadership manual based on the life and "work" of Attila, King of Huns, a  5th-Century brutalizer and bully of men and nations who relished being known as  the Scourge of God.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sees Attila as Mystical  </P> <P> Roberts, who picked Attila as his metaphorical leader because of the warrior's  "mystical" qualities, softens Attila's rough edges, painting him as a  deliberate (if driven) compassionate leader who may have been crude but was  also wise -- particularly in how he handled subordinates (the Huns).  </P> <P> "Some of his methods may seem brutal in our day . . . but, hey, that's how  things were done," Roberts said.  </P> <P> Consider these "Attila-isms":  </P> <P> * Do not let your chosen enemy have the advantage in any situation.  </P> <P> * Do not insult unless you mean it.  </P> <P> * For Huns, conflict is a natural state.  </P> <P> * Huns make enemies only on purpose.  </P> <P> * If it were easy to be a chieftain, everyone would be one.  </P> <P> The book got off to a slow start; 16 publishers turned it down before Warner  Books took it on. Its outlook turned more bullish after it fell into the hands  of H. Ross Perot, a modern-day corporate Attila, who touts it as a great book  with timeless principles. The book hit the New York Times best-seller list and  is being translated into 13 languages. It is also being made into a film for  business and is available on cassette.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Opposite Approach  </P> <P> If the curious appeal of "Attila" lies in its simplistic pronouncements and  outrageous presentation, quite the opposite is true of "Leadership Is an Art."  </P> <P> Written by Max DePree, 64, chairman of Herman Miller Inc. -- a designer and  maker of office furniture -- the book is small and soulful enough to be carried  around like a prayer book -- and, in some respects, it is.  </P> <P> "There is a strong spiritual content to leadership," DePree said. "People make  a decision to follow, but we don't quite know why they do."  </P> <P> DePree has decided that leadership is akin to being in a state of grace: It is  a sort of gift given to someone who then has the obligation to serve. His  meditations -- drawn from Luke, the Corinthians, Plato, Gandhi and his own  experience -- are perhaps more daring in spirit than all of Attila's bluster.  </P> <P> Consider these musings:  </P> <P> * The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say  thank you.  </P> <P> * By ourselves, we have serious limits. Together we can be something wonderful.  </P> <P> * Intimacy is one way of describing the relationship we all desire with work.  </P> <P> * An elegant company frees its members to be their best.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two-Edged Question  </P> <P> DePree also shares novel approaches to performance reviews, in which he  proposes that some of the "right" questions to be asked are: "What have you  abandoned?" and the two-edged consideration of "Does Herman Miller need you?"  and "Do you need Herman Miller?"  </P> <P> DePree also thinks that leaders should have the capacity to weep over the good  and bad, the happy and sad in life -- and at work. Things that bring tears to  his eyes include superficiality, a lack of dignity, arrogance, tenderness, good  news and having to work in a job where you are not free to do your best.  </P> <P> This probably is not the approach Attila would take, but it is all in a day's  work when you are trying to be a leader at Herman Miller -- rather than chief  of the Huns.  </P></p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Seats for change on the Exchange - The SE's latest solution to little-traded shares IS THIS the stock market of the future for all but the biggest companies? The London Stock Exchange took another stab yesterday at solving the problems of its lesser-traded stocks, and in the process came up with a system which could serve as a model for a large part of the domestic stock market in the years ahead. Illiquid stocks represent a problem which has repeatedly returned to haunt the exchange in recent years. It happened again yesterday, as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said it was to stop making markets in some 150 equities (and a further 50 convertible securities). At least some of these will join the 159 companies which do not have two market makers and so are no longer traded under normal stock market rules. Ever since the 1987 stock market crash, and particularly since the UK went into recession, trading in the shares of smaller companies has declined. As a result, market makers, whose buy and sell prices are meant to form the backbone of a competitive UK stock market, have pulled back to cut costs. P&amp;D yesterday made eight of its 43 market makers redundant, along with a handful of sales and research staff and two traders on Liffe. The Stock Exchange's response to this erosion of the market-making system has until now proved inadequate. First, it relaxed the obligations on market makers in return for an agreement that at least two houses would quote a price in all companies. That failed as market makers pulled out anyway. Next, the exchange proposed a sole-trader arrangement under which a single market maker would have a monopoly in the trading of each company's shares. It backed off in the face of opposition, and launched instead its bulletin board - a simple electronic notice board on which investors could display the shares they wanted to buy or sell. Yesterday saw the latest refinement: the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service, due to begin on November 16. Seats, as it will be known, combines the bulletin board with the earlier sole trader idea, producing something very similar to the specialist system that operates on the New York Stock Exchange. The announcement received a generally favourable response from investors. Until the new rules, market makers on Seats will have an obligation to make continuous two-way prices, fulfiling the role of the specialist in New York. At the same time, investors will be able to post orders to buy or sell shares for public display. When market makers trade, they will have an obligation to fulfil orders on the bulletin board which are at the same price or better than the price it was proposing. In addition, the trade in many companies' shares that currently takes place in brokers' offices - estimated at about 75 per cent of the turnover in many small companies' shares - will have to be shown to the market maker first. That will allow the market maker, and investors who have posted orders on the bulletin board, first bite at the business. This exposure of orders is what market makers have been calling for for some time. 'It's enough to give us an incentive,' said Mr David McNamara of Winterflood Securities, a specialist smaller-company market maker. Brokers who are now forced to bring more of their business to the central market place will pay the cost. 'It's very difficult for a broker to hand on anything,' says Mr Simon Sharpe of Albert E Sharpe, the Birmingham-based firm which acts as broker to many small companies. 'Brokers are scratching around for business at the best of times. (But) We would certainly try to help market makers in every way.' Market makers will also be helped by new publication rules. All trades by or between brokers will have to be published immediately. Trades which leave market makers exposed in a particular share, on the hand, will not be published, except for disclosure of the price after five days. If Seats is a success, how far might it eventually extend? While London clings jealously to its market-making system for the biggest, most heavily traded stocks, there has long been a belief in the Stock Exchange tower that other market structures are better for the large rump of less actively traded companies that make up the UK stock market. Market makers have resisted any encroachment of order-driven systems on to their territory, but withdrawals like that of UBS suggest that they are increasingly pulling back to concentrate on large companies. 'It's quite possible that this (Seats) will end up applying to everything but the biggest 250-400 companies,' one market maker said. If so, then the nature of the UK stock market will have changed substantially since the Big Bang reforms of 1986.</p>

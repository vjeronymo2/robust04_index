Part 658 is amended by adding &sect;658.23 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;658.23  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> LCV freeze; cargo-carrying unit freeze.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and except for tow trucks with vehicles in tow, a State may allow the operation of LCV's on the Interstate System only as listed in appendix C to this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a State may not allow the operation on the NN of any CMV combination with two or more cargo-carrying units (not including the truck tractor) whose cargo-carrying units exceed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The maximum combination trailer, semitrailer, or other type of length limitation authorized by State law or regulation of that State on or before June 1, 1991; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The length of the cargo-carrying units of those CMV combinations, by specific configuration, in actual, lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) in that State on or before June 1, 1991, as listed in appendix C to this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the following CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units may operate on the NN.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer and truck tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer combinations with a maximum length of the individual cargo units of 28.5 feet or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Vehicles described in &sect;658.13(e) and (g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Truck tractor-trailer and truck tractor-semitrailer combinations with an overall length of 65 feet or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Maxi-cubes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Tow trucks with vehicles in tow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For specific safety purposes and road construction, a State may make minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency nature to route designations and vehicle operating restrictions applicable to combinations subject to sections 1023 and 4006 of Pub. L. 102&hyph;240 and in effect on June 1, 1991 (July 6, 1991, for Alaska). Adjustments which last 30 days or less may be made without notifying the FHWA. Minor adjustments which exceed 30 days require approval of the FHWA. When such adjustments are needed, a State must submit to the Division Office of Motor Carriers, by the end of the 30th day, a written description of the emergency, the date on which it began, and the date on which it is expected to conclude. If the adjustment involves route designations, the State shall describe the new route on which vehicles otherwise subject to the freeze imposed by sections 1023 and 4006 of Pub. L. 102&hyph;240 are allowed to operate. To the extent possible, the geometric and pavement design characteristics of the alternate route should be equivalent to those of the highway section which is temporarily unavailable. Approval or disapproval by Office of Motor Carriers officials of adjustments involving route designations shall be coordinated with the Division Administrator. If the adjustment involves vehicle operating restrictions, the State shall list the restrictions that have been removed or modified. Approval or disapproval of the adjustment by the Division Office of Motor Carriers shall take place only after consultation with the Regional Office of Motor Carriers. If the adjustment is approved, a copy of the approved submission shall be forwarded through the Regional Office of Motor Carriers, to the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers at Headquarters, who will publish the notice of adjustment, with an expiration date, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Requests for extensions of time beyond the originally established conclusion date shall be subject to the same approval and publication process as the original request. If upon consultation with the Regional Office of Motor Carriers, a decision is reached that minor adjustments made by a State are not legitimately attributable to road or bridge construction or safety, the Division Office of Motor Carriers will so inform the State, and the original conditions of the freeze must be reimposed immediately. Failure to do so may subject the State to a penalty pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 141.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez Diaz by </F> unidentified Caracol announcer in Santa Fe de Bogota on 12  March--live]    [Text] Announcer: What is the government's  position on the surrender of Valle del Cauca drug traffickers,  which began today with the surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola  Grajales?    Gonzalez: I think this is an important event in  the fight against drug trafficking and a positive event in the  struggle against crime. It conveys the idea that criminals are  better off surrendering to justice rather than succumbing to the  state's firm actions. To the extent that this process advances  within the framework of effective cooperation so justice can be  done, we believe it will help strengthen the country's judicial  organization.    Announcer: Is the government certain that drug  traffickers who surrender will confess their crimes and  cooperate with justice?    Gonzalez: According to reports from the  Prosecutor General's Office, we understand there is a  willingness on the part of drug traffickers to cooperate with  authorities and confess their crimes. Obviously, this will have  to be evaluated and judged by the Prosecutor General's Office  and judicial authorities. However, we do have reports on the  drug traffickers' willingness to cooperate. They surrendered to  authorities unconditionally. Let's wait for an evaluation from  the Prosecutor General's Office and for the process to conclude.    Announcer: Is the Palmira Prison a maximum  security prison? Does it guarantee that these people will be  safe there?    Gonzalez: Once we received the information from  the Prosecutor General's Office on the surrender of these  individuals, we set aside a place within Palmira Prison and took  special security measures. They will be submitted to an ordinary  disciplinary regime, as well as to special security measures.    Once the projects for a security section within Palmira  Prison are complete, they will be transferred to those  installations.    Announcer: Does the government know anything about  other people surrendering?    Gonzalez: No. There are no reports of other drug  traffickers surrendering to justice. As the public knows, this  surrender is part of a process of conversations and requests  that has been under way for several months now under the  direction of the Prosecutor General's Office.    Announcer: We thank Justice Minister Andres  Gonzalez Diaz. He just gave the government's official position  on the surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales.</p>

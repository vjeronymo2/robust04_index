			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry on 1  February gave the following answer to the question raised by a  reporter from the Korean Central Broadcasting Committee in  connection with the recent passage of a bill by the U.S. Senate  on the initiation of Radio Free Asia. The passage of the bill  on 25 January by the U.S. Senate on the initiation of Radio Free  Asia is a criminal act of interfering in the internal affairs of  and of hostility against our country and other Asian countries.    The true intention of the United States in initiating Radio  Free Asia is to infuse the so-called U.S.-style democratic  values and the toxin of bourgeois ideology into our country and  other Asian countries in order to crush [apsal] socialism in  this region and demolish the independent governments there from  within. The United States was able to use this machination and  propaganda effectively to demolish from within the former  socialist countries in another region in the past and to have  them return to capitalism, but it is far from workable with our  country.    We have the chuche idea, the great guiding ideology of the  era of independence, the spirit of independence, and our-style  way of life; and our people regard the chuche socialism, in  which the leader, the party, and the masses are wholeheartedly  united, as their life and lifeline.    The United States should immediately stop the game of  initiating Radio Free Asia, a propaganda and machination  organization with a hostile aim against our country and other  Asian countries.    If the United States initiates Radio Free Asia despite the  consistent opposition and rejection of the people of Asian  countries, it will gain nothing from it. The Asian people,  including our people, will resolutely confront [tanhohi masso  nagalkkosida] the U.S.-conducted cold war against Asia by  steadfastly implementing an independent policy to reject Yankee  culture and to protect Asian tradition, culture, and  consciousness.</p>

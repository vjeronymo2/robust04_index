			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRED B. HUESMAN, FORMER OWNER OF DESMOND'S, DIES  </P> <P> Fred B. Huesman, former owner of the now defunct Desmond's clothing store chain  which was founded near Los Angeles' historic Olvera Street in 1862, has died.  He was 79.  </P> <P> Huesman died Wednesday during open heart surgery at St. Vincent's Medical  Center.  </P> <P> A native of Glendale, Huesman joined Desmond's five years after his uncle,  Ralph R. Huesman, purchased it from Desmond family heirs in 1921. He succeeded  his uncle as president in 1944 and continued in that position until 1973, when  he took the title of chairman.  </P> <P> Huesman retired in 1978, and the chain, which had become a part of the New  York-based Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., went out of business in 1981.  </P> <P> At its peak, the chain had 19 stores throughout Southern California. It began  as a hat shop founded by Daniel Desmond and grew into a major apparel retailer  selling men's, women's and boys' specialty clothing.  </P> <P> Shortly after the chain's centennial, Huesman streamlined Desmond's  merchandising, redesigning the stores to make items traditionally stored in  glass showcases more accessible to customers. Retailers, he said, had an  obligation to make shopping pleasant as well as to supply merchandise.  </P> <P> Huesman is survived by two daughters, Joan Madden and Marianne Huesman, and one  son, Ralph F. Huesman, and eight grandchildren.  </P> <P> His brother, Father John E. Huesman, will say the funeral Mass at 7 p.m. Sunday  in Christ the King Church, 624 N. Rossmore Ave. Interment will be at 11 a.m.  Monday in Calvary Cemetery.  </P> <P> The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the Fred B.  Huesman Scholarship Fund at Loyola High School, from which Huesman was  graduated. Contributions can be addressed to the president's office at the  school, 1901 Venice Blvd., Los Angeles 90006.  </P></p>

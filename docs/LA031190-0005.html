			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> URBAN BESTIARY  </P> <P> I am privileged to care for 12 different animals, nine of which are California  desert tortoises. I understand why Jordan would not include these -- they are  not considered wild things living among us.  </P> <P> But you'd be surprised at how many people think tortoises can fend for  themselves. Many are left out in yards with no shelter. Many tortoises are left  behind when their owners move. Probably 80% do not receive the nutrition they  need because people think "all they eat is lettuce." Often, when left to roam  free, they are hit by cars or, worse yet, they sometimes are eaten by dogs and  other animals.  </P> <P> The most common comment is that they come from the desert where it's hot during  the day and freezing at night so tortoises must like it that way. We often find  people taking their tortoises back to the desert in a gesture of kindness. I  would attempt to educate these people as to the fact that a domesticated  tortoise cannot make it in the desert any more than a dog could make it in the  forest. I know that people also drop off dogs to fend for themslves.  </P> <P> ROBIN PUGLIESE, Redondo Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / MMC to examine medical fees: Private insurers worried that BMA guidelines are driving up costs PRIVATE MEDICAL fees in the UK are to come under official scrutiny for the first time in a widespread investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday asked the MMC to investigate the way in which private medical fees are set by consultants. The inquiry has been prompted by concerns over guideline charges first published by the British Medical Association in 1989. The OFT says these 'set recommended fee rates' for medical and surgical procedures, with separate amounts for the contribution made by anaesthetists. The BMA strongly rejected the OFT's assertion that it had laid down recommended rates and said the guidelines reflected the average rate charged by consultants for private work around the country. 'We have always acted in the spirit of competition in producing these guidelines and our publication serves the public interest,' it said. The MMC will investigate whether a monopoly exists and, if so, whether any aspect of the supply of these services operates against the public interest. It now has 12 months to report to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The referral to the MMC appears partly to have been spurred by complaints from private medical insurers that increases in costs have been driven by the BMA guidelines. The OFT said yesterday that the inquiry had not arisen from any specific complaints. The announcement carried the underlying suspicion that consultants who carry out private work and the BMA, their professional association, may have created a fee monopoly. Health service professionals have noticed private fees, many of which were originally below the BMA guidelines, creeping up to the levels of the published figures since they were introduced three years ago. The rising fees have particularly concerned big private medical insurers which are under growing pressure from patients demanding their services. They claim the guidelines will have the effect of increasing medical rates and reducing competition. Private health care has grown rapidly during the 1980s. More than 12 per cent of the UK population now has medical insurance which pays the bulk of the estimated Pounds 500m charged annually by private consultants. The OFT said that, if adhered to by a significant proportion of consultant doctors, the BMA scales 'may affect the nature of competition and the level of fees in the market for the supply of private medical services'. Mr Roy Forman, chief executive of Private Patients Planning Group, said: 'All through the period since these guidelines were established we have said that they were not advisable.' Mr Tim Baker, business development manager with Norwich Union Health Care, said consultants had historically used rates published by Bupa, one of the UK's largest private insurers. He said the rates in the BMA guidelines had generally been above the levels published by Bupa, and prices charged by consultants had risen to the BMA rates as a result. 'A growing number of doctors are using the BMA schedule,' he said. 'It is gaining weight within the profession.' Mr Baker added that the prices charged reflected a period in the past when private treatment represented a far smaller proportion of the work of doctors. 'There needs to be a public debate on these issues,' he said. The announcement came only days after the BMA had carried out its second review of the guidelines first published in 1989.

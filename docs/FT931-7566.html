			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Fall in confidence shrugged off: US outlook is still bright, economists say THE US economic outlook remains bright in spite of an unexpected fall in consumer confidence this month, economists said yesterday. The Conference Board said its closely-followed index of consumer confidence fell 8 points to 68.5 this month. This followed a smaller dip in confidence in January. Most analysts, however, brushed off the figures, pointing out that the survey was conducted during the wobbly initial weeks of the Clinton administration, when the focus was on divisive issues such as gays in the military and the search for an attorney general. The successful launch last week of President Bill Clinton's deficit-cutting economic package is expected to shore up confidence in March. Many forecasters now expect the Commerce Department to revise up its estimate of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of last year to show growth at an annual rate of nearer 5 per cent than the 3.8 per cent initially reported. This would reflect new data showing a higher level of corporate inventories, a stronger trade performance and more buoyant consumer spending than previously estimated. However, the consensus view is still that growth will decelerate somewhat in the current quarter to an annual rate of about 3 per cent, reflecting a cooling of consumption spending and weaker net exports as a result of the economic slowdown in Europe and Japan. Looking further ahead, however, the sharp recent decline in long bond yields to below 7 per cent - a reflection of bond market approval of the administration's plan to cut the deficit - is expected to stimulate growth by sharply reducing the cost of servicing consumer and corporate debt. Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said the drop in confidence mainly reflected apprehension about future prospects rather than current economic conditions. There had been a significant rise since January in the proportion of respondents expecting conditions to worsen and jobs to become scarcer. A rebound in confidence seems likely, however, because more recent polls indicate strong initial confidence in the administration's plan to strengthen the economy. In congressional testimony yesterday, Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the plan provided an immediate stimulus and a 'down payment' on the longer-term investments that would create jobs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 15 (TANJUG) -- The Sarajevo daily  LJILJAN, an organ of the Bosnian Moslem leadership, admits that  the Moslem Army is receiving tonnes of weaponry despite the arms  embargo, and describes large shipments that arrived in late 1992  via a military airfield in Croatia.    "There will be arms, even if the blockade is such that not  even a needle can slip through," says the daily in reaction to  the latest debates on exempting Moslems from the arms embargo.    In September 1991, the United Nations imposed an embargo on  arms exports and imports in the entire territory of former  Yugoslavia, but the breakaway republics of Croatia, Slovenia and  the Bosnian Moslem government in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, as  well as certain Islamic and Western countries have repeatedly  violated this resolution.    A shipment of 2,000 tonnes of weaponry, for which Moslems  paid 27 million dollars abroad, reached Zagreb through the  Adriatic Sea in mid-September 1992, says LJILJAN as carried by  the Bosnian Serb News Agency SRNA. In the night between  November 24 and 25 of 1992, Moslems from foreign countries  launched a ship, The Dolphin, to take 6.7 million dollars' worth  of arms to Bosnian Moslems from an unnamed port to Croatia.  According to the LJILJAN report, The Dolphin was carrying four  cannon with around 60,000 shells, 122mm mortar sets, 700,000  12.7mm calibre bullets, 3,500 anti-tank shells, 82mm mortar sets  with 1,500 shells and 10,000 122mm calibre rockets.    The cargo also included Toyota army jeeps with  communications  equipment used in the Desert Storm operation in the Gulf war and  10,000 modern uniforms for the Bosnian Moslem Army. The Dolphin  arrived at its destination port in late December, a month after  it left dock, but it was intercepted by NATO military patrols in  charge of implementing the U.N. resolution on the ban of arms  shipments to former Yugoslavia. The ship was turned back and  sent to Italy and the weapons and equipment were sold, LJILJAN  says.    In parallel with the Dolphin operation, five Boeings left  for  one of Croatia's military airfields with a cargo of 90 tonnes of  weaponry for the Bosnian Moslem government, including arrow  missiles with launchers, 100 rpgs with around 8,000 shells.  This cargo reached the Moslems in Bosnia, LJILJAN says.    The U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST said on Friday that an  Iranian plane with at least 60 tonnes of explosives landed in  Zagreb last week and that the shipment was part of the agreement  between the Croatian authorities and the Bosnian Moslems to  renew military operations against Serbs.</p>

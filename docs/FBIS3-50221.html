Duray told CTK that  Kvarda's dismissal was revenge of the government for his  participation in organizing the meeting, at which ethnic  Hungarians' demands were formulated. Duray said that even  before the Komarno meeting chairman of the district council Eva  Bubniakova threatened to remove Kvarda. "At that time we  considered it the expression of a momentary mood," Duray said.  As a member of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny  Island (SMOZO), Kvarda was one of the main organizers of the  Komarno meeting.    Kvarda was not given any reasons for his dismissal. He told  CTK that given the fact that his performance had recently been  assessed very positively and that on November 24 he was given a  bonus for "the fulfillment of exceptional and especially  important work tasks," he considered his dismissal to be  unambiguously politically motivated. Kvarda added, however,  that the chairman of the district council was not obliged by law  to give reasons for dismissal, adding that he himself had  practically no possibility of legal protection.    Duray said it was thus far the first known case of  punishment  for the organization of the Komarno meeting, but he did not rule  out that others will follow as several chairman of district  councils attended the meeting. At the Komarno meeting,  representatives of ethnic Hungarians raised demands for the  creation of regions in which the Hungarian minority would make  up majority as well as for educational and cultural autonomy.</p>

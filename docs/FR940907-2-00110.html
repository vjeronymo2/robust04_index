			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes that the proposal provides an alternative means by which to deter violations of the Phlx's policy regarding specialists' handling of stopped orders, thus furthering the purposes of Section 6(b)(1) of the Act. An exchange's ability effectively to enforce compliance by its members and member organizations with Commission and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory functions. A rule included in an exchange's minor rule violation plan should not be deemed an unimportant rule. The Commission notes that inclusion of rules under a minor rule violation plan may reduce reporting burdens on a self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') and also may make its disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting violations of such rules. This would be the case in situations where the initiation of a full disciplinary proceeding is unsuitable because such a proceeding may be more costly and time-consuming in view of the minor nature of the particular violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, because the Phlx retains the discretion to bring a full disciplinary proceeding for any violation included in its MRVE Plan, the Commission believes that adding proposed Advice A&hyph;2 to the MRVE Plan will enhance, rather than reduce, the Phlx's enforcement capabilities regarding this Exchange policy. Indeed, the Commission expects the Phlx to bring full disciplinary proceedings for violations of the advice's requirements where the violation is egregious or where there is a history or pattern of repeat violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Commission finds good cause for approving Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 2 corrects a typographical error in the text of the proposed advice, while Amendment No. 3 merely clarifies procedures for implementing the advice's display requirement. The Commission did not receive any comments on the original proposal, which was noticed for the full statutory period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule changes that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 between the Commission and any persons, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &sect;552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;41 and should be submitted by September 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

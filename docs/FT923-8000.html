			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Tighter rules of origin will hinder expansion of local output HONDA has had problems this year persuading US customs officials its Canadian-assembled Civics meet existing 50 per cent local content requirements in the 1989 bilateral free trade pact between the US and Canada, Gordon Cramb reports from Tokyo. Japan's vehicle industry warned yesterday that tighter rules of origin under Nafta hindered expanding local output in North America. Honda's problem centres on varying readings of content-measuring rules. One of the few aspects of Nafta greeted in Tokyo was tighter definition of how content is measured in goods eligible for preferential tariffs. Attention focused on an unwelcome rise to 62.5 per cent in minimum local content of vehicles made in one Nafta member country but sold in another, if their manufacturer wishes to avoid punitive tariffs. Japanese vehicle groups made 250,000 cars in Canada last year, with 80 per cent for sale in the US. Local content levels at best are not much above the present minimum: the proportion for a Canadian-made Toyota Corolla was put at 53 per cent yesterday. Honda and Toyota account for two-thirds of Canada's output of Japanese cars. The rest comes from a Suzuki venture with GM, expected to be exempted from the stipulation; its output would be used only in calculating GM's overall North American content ratio. The Nafta ratio would not rise until halfway through an eight-year period phasing in the requirement. But some in the industry said North American component suppliers could not always compete on price or quality grounds.</p>

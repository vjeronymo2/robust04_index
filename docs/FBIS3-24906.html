Addressing about 8,000 enthusiastic  supporters at Dal Josaphat stadium in Paarl in the Western Cape,  he said opinion polls had consistently shown that the ANC was  the most popular organisation in the country and that it would  win an outright victory if an election were held now.    "The party that follows us in comparative strength is  nothing  more than a Mickey Mouse. But the greatest danger to democracy  is you, the supporters of the ANC." Mr Mandela said the ANC had  to ensure that every one of its supporters would be able to vote  and to achieve that, activists had to work very hard.    Earlier the ANC leader praised Justice Minister Kobie  Coetsee, saying Mr Coetsee had had "the courage and vision" to  initiate discussions between himself and former President P W  Botha while Mr Mandela was still in Victor Verster Prison.    Mr Mandela also thanked the community of Paarl for their  support while he was held at Victor Verster and praised a number  of white warders who had treated him with sensitivity and  kindness.    The ANC leader was wildly applauded when he arrived at the  packed stadium and circled the track on the back of a bakkie  [pickup truck] waving to the crowd. Mr Mandela was presented  with a symbolic freedom torch which had been lit outside Victor  Verster prison on Wednesday morning and carried to the stadium  by runners.    Crowds lined the streets of Paarl and many shops were closed  as the ANC leader's entourage passed through the town on its way  to the stadium.</p>

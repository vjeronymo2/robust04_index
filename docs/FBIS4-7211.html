			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono on Thursday [28  April] expressed willingness to confront the newly inaugurated  administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata through  parliamentary debate on the fiscal 1994 budget.    The LDP "will take issue of (some aspects of the budget bill  the LDP cannot accept) and urge the government to amend what  should be amended," the leader of Japan's largest opposition  party told a group of reporters.    Japan's fiscal 1994 state budget to cover outlays for the  12-month period that started on April 1 is already one month  overdue.    Kono also criticized Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key  coalition party, of trying to dominate the policy-making  process. "We cannot deny the fact that Shinsieto has come to  assume greater weight in the government," he said. "Without  question, it will be a fragile cabinet, as the ruling coalition  has been reduced to a parliamentary minority."    He rapped Shinseito, a former LDP breakaway, for maintaining  the "two-tiered power structure," in an apparent reference to  the growing dominance by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa of the policy-making process. Hata "is not the prime  power in Shinseito," he said.</p>

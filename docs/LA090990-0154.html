			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SECOND AMENDMENT SHOULDN'T NEED DEFENSE  </P> <P> It is disheartening for those of us who believe that the Second Amendment of  the U.S. Constitution is just as important as the First to be forced to defend  it every time there's a murder or fatal accident with a firearm. I refer to the  "plea" for handgun control by Rod and Lois Briggs (Letters, Sept. 2).  </P> <P> The Briggs' reading of the Second Amendment is that the people are allowed to  have firearms only to support militias. James Madison, however, saw the state  militias as a way to give the people's right to keep and bear arms maximum  effect.  </P> <P> The fact that we do not at present live under tyranny is no reason to relax our  vigilance because would-be tyrants are everywhere, willing to take advantage of  a people who have given up the means to defend their liberties.  </P> <P> BOB BECKETT  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

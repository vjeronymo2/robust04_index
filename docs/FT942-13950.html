			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Energy bill merits support Sir, If anything shows the total bankruptcy of the government it is its systematic attempt to sabotage the energy conservation bill on Friday by tabling 216 amendments and seven new clauses, thus ensuring that it will run out of time. This will prevent it from significantly mitigating the effect of 17.5 per cent domestic fuel VAT on the elderly and poor, and helping itself achieve CO emission reduction targets by the year 2000. It will mean flying in the face of the views of the majority of MPs, including many Tories, and the huge consensus of organisations and local authorities supporting the bill. Why should the government choose to shoot itself in the foot in this way? Is it suicidal, or is it so foolish as to fear that a proper programme of energy conservation would make more difficult the sale of its 40 per cent stake in Powergen and National Power? In fact, reduced demand would obviate the need for substantial investment in new generating capacity and thus enhance the profitability of those two companies. Let us hope that Conservative backbenchers recognise the political as well as the environmental, economic and social benefits of the bill, and the severe corresponding costs of blocking its passage. Cynog Dafis, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

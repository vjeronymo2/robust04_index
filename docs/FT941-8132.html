			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Smirnoff aims at Kazak market Grand Metropolitan has formed a joint venture to market Smirnoff vodka in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. Having seen dramatic growth in Smirnoff sales in Russia, GrandMet's IDV spirits arm is now keen to attack the Kazak vodka market which is 40 per cent bigger than the UK. Mr Paul Curtis, IDV's head of international marketing, said:'Kazakhstan represents another great opportunity for developing the strength of IDV's international brands in emerging markets. 'We are uniquely positioned with Smirnoff, which is already available and well known in some of the major cities.' He said there was also potential for IDV's other brands which include J&amp;B Rare Scotch whisky. IDV, which recently secured US distribution rights to Stolichnaya Russian vodka, has been marketing US-made Smirnoff in Russia since 1989. Last year it sold 600,000 cases in Russia, compared with just 10,000 cases in 1991. In June, the Pierre Smirnoff Company set up its own office in Moscow. The new Kazakhstan company, called IDV Central Asia, is a joint venture with Coromin Inc, an importer and marketing company with warehousing and transport facilities. Unilever has acquired 90 per cent of the shares in Severnoye Siyaniye, a St Petersburg-based producer of lotions, after-shaves and colour cosmetics.</p>

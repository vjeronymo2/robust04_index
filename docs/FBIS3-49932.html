The letter stresses Turkey's admiration of the progress  marked by Romania since 1990 and the satisfaction at the fine  and close collaboration within the North-Atlantic Cooperation  Council, as well as the interest confirmed by Romania in the  collaboration with that forum that has brought NATO and Romania  closer.    "We see the Partnership for Peace initiative as an  operational formula in this period of transition and believe it  will help enhancing the security, stability and fertile  cooperation in Europe and around it," the January 5, 1994 letter  by Turkey's president reads.</p>

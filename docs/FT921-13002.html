			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / LEP shares fall after warning LEP Group, the troubled security and freight forwarding group, saw its already depressed shares halved to 8 1/2 p yesterday after it announced that it would have to make 'a very substantial amount of write-offs and provisions' against its property exposure and renegotiate its finances. The refinancing of the group's Pounds 470m debt is likely to lead to a partial swap of debt for equity by its bankers and follows a refinancing agreed in September. That agreement was 'basically a holding position whilst we ascertained what the long-term needs (of the group) would be', according to Mr John East, finance director. Shares in ADT, the security group which owns 27 per cent of LEP, also dropped on the news, losing 3 per cent to 423p. LEP Group said that write-offs and provisions would have to be made for 'most or all' of its exposure to US property, as well as some of its UK property exposure. The sum is likely to be significantly higher than the Pounds 20m extraordinary provision it suggested it would have to make against its US property exposure, when it reported interim results in September. LEP's involvement in US property is mainly in California, where property values have been particularly hard hit. The group's US properties were valued in its 1990 accounts at Dollars 150m (Pounds 83.70m). Further provisions are likely to be needed against its UK properties which were valued at the end of December 1990 at about Pounds 145m. Most of this relates to the Swiss Bank House, which is in the books at Pounds 123m. The UK properties are being individually valued, Mr East said. The group's dire financial situation has triggered an extensive reassessment of its activities. 'We're reviewing the whole business,' Mr East said. After discussions with bankers, LEP is reconsidering the disposal of its US security business, National Guardian Corporation, which was planned to reduce debt. The US business has been on the market since at least June last year and talks were continuing with two prospective buyers, Mr East said. However, if the banks decided to take a long-term view of the group by converting some of their debt into equity, they might decide that in the long run it would be better to keep NGC as part of the group, according to LEP's financial adviser.</p>

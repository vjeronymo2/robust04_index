			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ghidella relinquishes most of his Saurer posts Mr Vittorio Ghidella has stepped down from almost all his positions at Switzerland's Saurer engineering group following personal legal problems and heavy losses at a Milan subsidiary. The decision, 'for family reasons', follows Mr Ghidella's arrest earlier this year in a judicial inquiry into alleged corruption at Oto Trasm, a south Italian engineering company in which a local subsidiary of Saurer is a shareholder. Mr Ghidella faces charges regarding an alleged attempt to defraud Oto Trasm by transferring machinery from its Bari plant to the Turin base of Grazioni Trasmissioni, the north Italian engineering group in which Saurer has a 90 per cent stake. He has rejected the accusations.</p>

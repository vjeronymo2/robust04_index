			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TI and Snecma in aircraft joint venture TI Group, the engineering group, and Snecma, the French state-owned aero-engine manufacturer, yesterday said they had been given the go-ahead from the European Union regulatory authorities as well as from the French government to combine their aircraft landing gear operations into a joint company called Messier-Dowty. The joint venture will become the world's biggest landing gear manufacturer with annual sales in the region of Pounds 250m employing about 2,300 people. TI, which took over Dowty two years ago, signed a preliminary agreement with Snecma last December after nine months of negotiations. Apart from requiring approval from the European Union competition authorities, the joint venture also needed French government approval because it is considered to be a semi-privatisation, Mr Tony Edwards, chairman and chief executive of Messier-Dowty, said yesterday. Mr Edwards also said that the venture followed long standing co-operation between the UK and the French landing gear groups. TI and Snecma said they had agreed that the market value attributable to the Dowty side of the business was about Pounds 30m greater than the value attributable to the French side. As a result, TI will make an adjustment to its net contribution to the joint venture and will be entitled to a greater share of the profits in its first three years. The joint venture will have its headquarters at TI's head office in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and will have an operational co-ordination centre at Messier-Dowty's head office in Velizy, France. Mr Edwards said that through the new partnership the two companies would strengthen their market position by supplying landing gear to both the European Airbus consortium and Boeing in the commercial airliner sector, and landing equipment for European and US military aircraft programmes.</p>

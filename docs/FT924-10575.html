			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: Brecker Brothers are still kicking - Jazz They're back and they're still bad - or 'kicking' as their fans would have it now. It is ten years since The Brecker Brothers last crossed horns to create their gangsterised fusion of rock and jazz. And judging from the air of anticipation that filled a packed Festival Hall, they have been sorely missed. A new contract and a new album, The Return of The Brecker Brothers (GRP 96842), is the reason for a world tour. The inclusion of fusion guitar hero Mike Stern and a pulverising rhythm section in Dennis Chambers (drums) and James Genus (electric bass) is the added appeal for the GTi driving classes. The atmosphere created by Breckers, Randy on trumpet and younger Michael on tenor, both miked up and roving around the stage among a battery of pedal effects, is that of a rock concert. The performance, punctuated by whoops from the crowd, is a dazzling showcase of heroic solos and technological firepower. Both Brothers have a cold metal tone, Randy alternating between a trashy mute sound and synthesised Donald Duck voice; Mike busier, squiggling and almost Ornette-like. 'We're having a great time,' said Michael pleasantly after opening with two crushers from the new recording and an old crowd pleaser in 'Skunk Funk'. George Whitty's keyboards, on a foundation of heavy funk backbeat, sets the scene for each number. Randy peep-peeping tantalisingly, Michael pigeon-toed, knees together and wringing out the notes and wearing out reeds. When Mike Stern embarked on another incandescent, spiralling and squealing solo effort with the CD single (single?), 'Big Idea', some headbanging even broke out in the stalls. 'Song for Barry' was the sort of technological tour de force of which stablemate and technocrat Chick Corea would be proud. A tribute to trombonist Barry Rogers, the piece begins with Michael blowing into an innocuous looking device called the ewi (electronic wind instrument). It looks like a melodica but in brother Michael's hands is more like a latter day horn of Jericho. Blowing into it gently at first conjured up the sounds of an African village, bass mumbling and shouts, then a booming orchestra of didgeridoos. More vigorous application set the walls of the Festival Hall shaking dangerously. Exchanging the ewi for a walkabout with the tenor and some caustic notes, however, heralded the return of Stern and a spinning coda held down by Chambers' bludgeoning bass drum. Yes, they're back alright.</p>

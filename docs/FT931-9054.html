			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: IMI raises Dollars 200m in seven-year loan deal ISTITUTO Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), the Italian financial group, is raising a Dollars 200m seven-year loan, the first substantial deal for an Italian state-controlled borrower since Efim, the state industrial holding group, went into liquidation last July. Bankers said the deal was a key test of sentiment towards Italian borrowers, which until recently have been virtually barred from the syndicated loans market, as a result of the Efim debacle. A recent flurry of deals consisted mainly of small transactions for financial institutions. Mediocredito Lombardo, Istituto Nazionale per il Credito Edilizio and Monte dei Paschi di Siena were among those that have recently tapped the market. Because they are constrained to match the maturity of their borrowings to their assets, Italian financial institutions face heavy medium-term financing needs, which are divided between the domestic bond market, the international bond market and the syndicated loans market. Italian and foreign banks are still owed L9,500bn (Dollars 6.1bn) following Efim's collapse. After initially proposing to repay the loans using bonds with below-market interest rates, the Treasury bowed to pressure from the banks and agreed to full repayment, which creditor banks are hoping to start to receive towards the end of April. Nevertheless, some banks remain ill-disposed towards lending to Italian state borrowers. However, IMI does not appear to be paying punitive rates. It will pay interest of 0.35 point over the six-month London interbank offered rate for the first five years, rising to  3/8 -point over Libor. Repayment will be in 11 six-monthly instalments after an initial two-year grace period. The commitment fee is 17 1/2 basis points. The deal, arranged by ABN-Amro, is fully underwritten.</p>

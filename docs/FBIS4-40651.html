			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Vladimir Nikishin, commander of the </F> Regiment of Russian Peacemaking Forces in the Dniester Region,  by Senior Lieutenant Artur Gulko; place and date not given,  under the "Life of the Troops" rubric: "Peacekeeping Forces in  the Dniester Region: Too Soon To Return Home Yet"]    [Text] The regiment of Russian peacemaking forces  commanded by Colonel Vladimir Nikishin recently fulfilled its  peacemaking mission in the Dniester Region. This is the second  time. The regiment's officers and men separated the opposing  sides in summer 1992.    Our nonstaff correspondent's conversation with the regiment  commander focused on the everyday lives of the peacemaking  troops from the Volga Military District.    [Gulko] Vladimir Fedorovich, what is the situation like  today in the region where your regiment was operating?    [Nikishin] Just like last year, the regiment fulfilled its  duties in the heightened security zone on both banks of the  Dniester River. It served at five posts in accordance with the  documents of the joint control commission. On the right bank it  served together with peacemakers from Moldavia [Moldova] and at  seven posts on the left bank together with people from the  Dniester Region. There are also posts in Dubossary, Bendery,  and at the Kitskany bridgehead...    Our main mission was to perform the functions of military  observers, to monitor the movement of combat hardware and  troops, and to inspect transport which might possibly be  carrying weapons, ammunition, explosives, or drugs. Thanks to  strict monitoring the shipment of this entire range of goods  through the Dniester Region has virtually ceased. But this does  not mean that the peacemakers are no longer needed here.  Everything is peaceful in Moldavia today but the Russian  soldiers are still the guarantors of stability in the region.    The attitude toward our officers and men on the part of  local  inhabitants on both sides of the Dniester is the very best. And  that is true despite the reports filtering into the Moldavian  mass media about the urgent need for the withdrawal of the  peacemaking forces from the region.    [Gulko] The specific conditions of your service have surely  had an impact on the combat training process. What are the  characteristic features of that training in the Dniester Region?    [Nikishin] Exercises were planned and organized according to  the program for the training of Russia's peacemaking units.  They were held on a daily basis, according to a schedule, and  involved all personnel apart from those on actual service. Fire  practice took place at the 14th guard's army range, the  remaining subjects were studied at our own base at Bendery in an  old fortress reminiscent of the Russian Army in Aleksandr  Vasilyevich Suvorov's time.    Admittedly, the shortage of officers and NCO's at  platoon-company level took its toll: We had 10 officer  vacancies and 17 NCO vacancies. People were in no hurry to come  here, for understandable reasons... Including social reasons.    [Gulko] But it has been stated numerous times at various  levels that the social and everyday problems facing men serving  in the "hot spots" have all but been resolved. There are, after  all, laws which provide various privileges...    [Nikishin] Those privileges have not been prescribed for us.  The peacemaking forces are only covered by the defense  minister's order on privileges -- unlike the 14th Army, which  enjoys privileges laid down by edict of the Russian Federation  President for servicemen serving in the "hot spots." Why is  that? Formally speaking we are serving in the Volga Military  District. However, we were stationed in the Dniester Region not  through choice, but from the state's need, a fact which is not  taken into account.    Of course, we made our own efforts to obtain privileges for  officers and NCO's. For example, we are doing a lot to that end  at the winter quarters in Totskoye. Officers, NCO's, and men  were sent on regular furloughs. In short, we tried to keep  people's spirits up. But all that, of course, is not enough.  Now we have been relieved by the regiment under the command of  Colonel Aleksandr Grigoryev and I hope that our wishes will be  taken into account when it comes to providing backup for its  service.</p>

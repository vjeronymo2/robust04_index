			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREE AIDES OF MINKOW SENTENCED FOR FRAUD  </P> <P> A former weightlifter -- who Barry Minkow said threatened and beat him into  staging an elaborate fraud at his ZZZZ Best Carpet Cleaning Co. -- was  sentenced Monday to three years in federal prison.  </P> <P> Daniel Krowpman, who claimed he was just another of Minkow's victims, also was  ordered to serve five years probation and pay a $5,000 fine for helping  generate a series of fraudulent financial documents that helped carry off the  multimillion-dollar swindle.  </P> <P> "I never meant to hurt anyone," he told U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian.  "If I'd have known what was going on, I'd have never been involved. Never. . .  . You heard a lot of bad things about me, but they weren't true."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Sentences  </P> <P> An accountant who demanded a bribe to conceal the ZZZZ Best swindle from  lawyers and auditors, Norman Rothberg, was sentenced to one year in prison, and  a third player in the ZZZZ Best fraud, Edward M. Krivda, was ordered to serve  60 days in a halfway house and contribute 300 hours of community service for  making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Minkow, 22, who was convicted on 57 counts of fraud for swindling banks,  investors and customers out of at least $26 million by staging a series of  phony insurance restoration jobs, is scheduled to be sentenced March 13.  </P> <P> Krowpman went into business with Minkow after the two men met while working out  at a San Fernando Valley gym. He was the man who, Minkow said, initially beat  him and threatened him into making huge interest payments on the money he put  into the company. At one point, Minkow testified, Krowpman attempted to rape  him.  </P> <P> Both prosecutors and the judge discounted Minkow's story, although Assistant  U.S. Attys. James Asperger and Gordon Greenberg said Krowpman did help generate  paper work showing that a tool company he represented was supplying large  quantities of tools for ZZZZ Best's phony insurance restoration work, when in  fact it was not.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Knew He Was Lying'  </P> <P> Asperger said it is even possible that Krowpman believed Minkow's story that  most of the insurance restoration jobs were real. "But he knew he was telling  lies . . . He was used and manipulated by Barry Minkow, but Barry Minkow was  capable of using and manipulating some incredibly sophisticated people."  </P> <P> "Every one of the defendants comes here and says how naive they were," the  judge said. "This is not a situation where the Keystone Cops masterminded this  tremendous fraud."  </P> <P> Tevrizian also noted the estimated $600,000 Krowpman allegedly took in through  his dealings with ZZZZ Best.  </P> <P> "You don't get $600,000 over a short period of time just standing around in  line," the judge said. "He doesn't want to destroy that income stream. It's not  naivete. It's greed."  </P> <P> Tevrizian also was harsh with Rothberg, who accepted more than $17,000 to  backtrack from his initial reports to auditors that ZZZZ Best was faking the  insurance restoration work.  </P> <P> "You're educated, you're articulate, you're intelligent, and I think what  happened is you got caught in that whole Barry Minkow thing, going for the home  run each and every time you step up to the plate," the judge said. "You caught  the greed bug, the greed disease."  </P> <P> Rothberg's attorney, Richard D. Burda, said Rothberg was a relatively poor  staff accountant who was watching everyone around him make millions.  </P> <P> "I just think he's been poor and scraping for so long . . . that he wanted a  taste for himself," Burda said.  </P> <P> The attorney also said it was Rothberg who initially raised the suspicion of  outside lawyers and accountants, touching off the investigations that  eventually led to ZZZZ Best's downfall.  </P> <P> "He was the whistle-blower in this case," he said, prompting Tevrizian to  interject:  </P> <P> "The whistle got plugged up."  </P></p>

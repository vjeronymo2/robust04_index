			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Eurotunnel to settle bill with shares EUROTUNNEL, the troubled Channel tunnel operator, plans to pay part of its fee to Bechtel, the US construction group, by issuing shares rather than with cash. The transaction, which will involve Eurotunnel issuing 2m new shares, comes at a time of intense speculation about the group's finances because of costly delays in the tunnel's construction schedule. The anticipated cost of the project has escalated from Pounds 4.8bn in 1987 to the present estimate of Pounds 8.4bn. Eurotunnel, which said last month that it might need to raise up to Pounds 850m in additional cash by the end of 1995 because of the delays, plans to seek shareholders' agreement for the Bechtel issue at a meeting on June 10. It will also ask for permission to raise its nominal capital by up to FFr1.92bn (Pounds 230m) to issue new shares and by FFr565m to issue warrants. Bechtel has since 1986 acted as an external consultant to Eurotunnel and has seconded executives to work for the group. Eurotunnel said that it was allowed to pay part of Bechtel's bill in shares under the terms of their agreement.</p>

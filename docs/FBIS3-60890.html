			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Saygi Ozturk: "War Between PKK and TWPLA"] </F>   [Text] The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has emerged defeated  from the struggle it waged against the Turkish Workers-Peasants  Liberation Army [TWPLA] in Tunceli to establish an upper hand  over that organization. It has been ascertained that the TWPLA  militants have wounded one of PKK's leading members, Muslim  Durgun alias Dr. Baran, and captured two PKK commanders.    The TWPLA, which is the armed wing of the Turkish Communist  Party -- Marxist-Leninist Organization [TCP--MLO], adopted a  decision to move against the PKK after it declared Tunceli the  "Dersim Province." In an extraordinary party meeting in the  Mercan valley in the Munzur mountains, the TCP--MLO decided to  wage a struggle to obstruct the PKK's effort to gain the upper  hand in Tunceli. Moving in light of that decision, the TWPLA  strengthened its armed mountain groups. TCP--MLO Secretary  General Yusuf Kose and TWPLA Commander Hakki Alpan decided that  PKK's strength in Tunceli must be weakened, TWPLA's militants  must maintain their training on the Munzur mountains winter and  summer, and the number of TWPLA's militants must be increased.    It has been ascertained that the PKK has failed to achieve  its objectives in Tunceli and has been forced by the consecutive  defeats it has suffered to try to reach an agreement with the  TWPLA. However, the TWPLA has refused to reach an agreement with  that organization. It has also been ascertained that the TWPLA,  which has adopted an aggressive stand against the PKK, has  contacted Armenia and asked to be allowed to establish a camp in  that republic.</p>

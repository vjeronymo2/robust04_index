			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Green light for Allied- Carlsberg UK merger ALLIED-LYONS and Carlsberg were yesterday given government clearance for the Pounds 510m merger of their UK brewing and wholesaling operations. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, gave the go-ahead after the companies reached agreement with the Office of Fair Trading on measures to remedy any adverse effects on competition from the joint venture. Carlsberg-Tetley, the merged business, will include Carlsberg's one UK brewery and Allied's five beer plants. It will have sales of more than Pounds 1bn a year and an 18 per cent share of the beer market. The move will create a third force in the industry, rivalling Bass with 22 per cent of the market, and Courage, with a 20 per cent share. It will also reduce Allied's Pounds 1.9bn borrowings by Pounds 135m though that may be offset to some extent by initial rationalisation costs. In a joint statement yesterday, Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Allied's brewing division, and Mr Michael Iuul, managing director of Carlsberg International, said: 'We are obviously delighted that we have now received final approval for this merger and look forward with confidence to implementing our plans.' Thirteen months after the deal was first announced, the companies are now completing legal work on the venture which is expected to come into operation early in the new year. A Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry earlier this year expressed concern about the effects of the merger on competition in the UK lager market. The combination of Allied's Castlemaine and Skol lagers with the Carlsberg brands would adversely affect regional and local brewers and independent wholesalers, the MMC said. Allied and Carlsberg have now agreed to the MMC's recommendations that the merged company should not worsen the terms of supply to Carlsberg's existing customers, and that the supply agreement with Allied's pubs should be reduced from seven years to five years. However, they have succeeded in renegotiating a third condition laid down for the merger - that after two years Allied should free tenants of 1,785 of its pubs to buy half their lager from suppliers of their own choice. In negotiations with the OFT, Allied argued that such a move, which could have cost an estimated Pounds 7m profits, would be impractical and impossible to monitor. It has now been agreed, instead, that Allied will free 400 of its pubs completely from exclusive beer supplies. The first 100 will be freed over the next two years, and another 300 over the following two years. The compromise is expected to prove far less costly to Allied than the original condition.

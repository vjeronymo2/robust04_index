			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Power cuts 'crippling India's prospects' INDIA was warned yesterday that worsening power shortages are threatening its economic reforms and its ability to attract foreign investment. Mr S Rajgopal, who recently retired as chief cabinet secretary, said the growing shortage of electricity was holding back industrial development. The position was so serious that if all the planned foreign investment actually materialised, India would not be able to provide the basic infrastructure these companies would require. Also consumers were angry. 'We saw power riots in Delhi this summer and it's going to increase,' warned Mr Rajgopal. Mr Rajgopal was speaking at an industrialists' conference in Delhi at which many of the participants echoed his gloomy views of the future of the Indian economy and the inadequate impact of the reforms carried out since 1991 by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao. Mr Rajgopal said the government had originally planned to add 48,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the five years 1991-1996, but this had been cut because of financial constraints to a target of 30,558MW. However, a recent government review showed that the public sector, which dominates the electricity industry, would probably build 13,000MW to 14,000MW of capacity. India's efforts to attract private investment into the industry had won great attention. But none of this would come on stream before 1996; at best private companies would have started work on installing stations with an output of 3,000MW. Mr Rajgopal said later the answer was to revive public sector investment in electricity generation. Most other countries, including developed nations, did not rely on private companies. But he said other changes were also needed including reform of the rules governing electricity distribution and sale to tackle transmission losses, theft and the supply of free or subsidised electricity to many farmers and others. Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, told the conference he was concerned the economy was growing more slowly than expected. Compared with an annual target rate of 5.2 per cent, economic growth in the year to the end of March 1994 may only be 4.5 per cent. He admitted that the pace of reform had slowed. Heading a minority government, ministers had no choice but to take political factors into account. He called for a national consensus to support further reform. So far, the government had often taken soft options in reforms - such as cutting government borrowing by reducing capital investment in infrastructure and other needs instead of cutting current spending. Mr S L Rao, director general of the National Centre for Applied Economic Research, also warned that growth was slower than had been expected and there was a danger of resurgent inflation.</p>

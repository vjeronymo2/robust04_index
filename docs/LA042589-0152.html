			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER AND FILM / JAN HERMAN: STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> COURAGE AND BEAUTY EMERGE FROM CRUELTY OF HOLOCAUST  </P> <P> From 1942 to 1944, about 15,000 Jewish children passed through Terezin, a Nazi  concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. It was set up as a way station or "model"  camp to be shown to the Red Cross and visiting dignitaries before the children  were sent on to the gas chambers of Auschwitz.  </P> <P> Forcibly separated from their parents, they spent as much as 2 years in the  barracks at Terezin -- euphemistically termed "children's homes." There they  subsisted on a prison diet and received schooling clandestinely from the camp's  few adults, who encouraged them to write and to draw. Then, one by one, their  Nazi captors chose them for deportation and execution.  </P> <P> None of the children were more than 15 years old. Only 100 survived. One was  Raja Englanderova, a teen-age girl who is the central figure in Celeste  Raspanti's stage adaptation of "I Never Saw Another Butterfly." The play is  based on writings by the children of Terezin, which have been preserved in a  permanent exhibition in Prague and as a book with the same title.  </P> <P> Presented over the weekend at the Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach by the Laguna  Playhouse Youth Theatre, "Butterfly" was an act of remembrance. While not  exactly religious, its performance seemed nonetheless sacred. "The heaviest  wheel rolls across our foreheads to bury itself deep within our memories," a  chorus intoned. It might have been a ritual elegy.  </P> <P> Themes of loss and despair naturally dominate the play, which takes place in  Raja's memory in 1946 and is set on a stark gray stage occasionally enhanced by  dramatic lighting and photographic projections of the actual children of the  camp. "Goodby -- it was the motto of Terezin," Raja says bitterly. "It should  have been written above the gate instead of 'Work Makes Us Free.' "  </P> <P> Yet Raja (Jennifer Triebwasser) is not without hope. "I learned the word  courage," she recounts, "and found the determination to live, to believe in  life." It is not entirely persuasive when she says this in the first act, if  only because she has been so traumatized that simply to repeat her name to  herself "was an achievement."  </P> <P> But by the second act we believe her when she says in a triumphant curtain  speech: "My name is Raja. I am a Jew. I survived Terezin, not alone and not  afraid." Indeed, her transformation from despairing victim to defiant survivor  carries symbolic meaning for all victims of the Holocaust as well as the rest  of us.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most affecting scene occurs after Raja's best friend has received  her deportation number and is packed off by train with other doomed camp  prisoners. "Where did Renka go?" she asks her teacher, Irena (Lisa Hale),  without waiting for a reply. "To Auschwitz. She won't be coming back. You die  in Auschwitz. You think because we're children we don't know."  </P> <P> Irena, unable to console Raja, reveals her own terrible story: how her  9-year-old daughter was torn from her arms and thrown from a train; how she was  prevented from jumping off the train after her; how she has found in Terezin  "many children" who need her love. It is an extraordinary moment and manages to  avoid histrionics.  </P> <P> As directed by Scott Davidson, "Butterfly" provides both the child actors and  the audience a dramatic history lesson. Its timeliness is readily apparent in  the recent spate of movies and novels about the Holocaust -- not to mention the  fact that Hitler was born 100 years ago last week.  </P> <P> "I just want people to know the characters (we play) were real people," Josh  Wheeler, an eighth-grader in the Laguna troupe, told the audience at a  post-performance discussion of "Butterfly" on Sunday. Nothing was closer to the  truth of the play nor more fitting as a memorial to victims of the Holocaust.  </P> <P> 'I NEVER SAW ANOTHER BUTTERFLY'  </P> <P> A production of the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theater.

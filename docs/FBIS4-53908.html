			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 24 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and  the Philippines Tuesday agreed in principle to step up military  cooperation including maintaining security in the joint  territorial waters off the east Malaysian Sabah state.    Malaysian Defence Minister Najib Razak said the agreement  was  reached in line with the improved bilateral relations between  the two countries following the exchange of visits by their  leaders recently.    We have agreed in principle that military relations should  also reflect the new direction in the bilateral relations of  both countries, he told reporters after Philippines Defence  Secretary Gen. (R) [Retired] Renato De Villa called on him here.    Gen. De Villa is here to attend the three-day 27th  international general meeting of the Pacific basin economic  council opened by Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed Monday.

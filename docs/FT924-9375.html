			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wm Low picks up in second half WM LOW, the Dundee-based food retailer, yesterday reported a 12.5 per cent fall in profits, but said problems which led to a poor first half had been overcome. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 20.6m in the year to September 5. Most of the decline came in the first half, when profits fell 23 per cent to Pounds 8.82m, because of falling margins and one-off costs. Mr James Millar, chairman, said: 'This has been a game of two halves. The first half was a one-off and we've got it out of the system'. Operating margins, which fell to 3.98 per cent in the first half, partly because of increased promotional sending, recovered to 5.93 per cent, only slightly below the comparative period figure of 6.1 per cent. Turnover increased 9.4 per cent to Pounds 420.1m, mainly due to new store openings. Five new stores were opened while three neighbourhood branches were closed, leading to a net gain of 90,000 sq ft. Like-for-like sales increased 2.7 per cent, about half of which came from inflation. Depreciation was Pounds 7.8m with capital expenditure - mainly on new stores  -unchanged at Pounds 44.3m. The expansion programme pushed up net borrowings to Pounds 37.9m (Pounds 11.3m) with gearing at 24.8 per cent. A lower than expected tax charge of 17 per cent, due to the release of unnecessary provisions, could not prevent a fall in fully diluted earnings per share to 24.92p (27.9p). The company proposes an unchanged final dividend of 5.7p, to give a maintained total of 8.4p. Mr Colin Mitchell, the former managing director who left abruptly in February, received severance pay of Pounds 223,000. The company said Mr Philip Spicer, presently national food manager with Co-operative Retail Services, had been appointed chief executive. COMMENT Wm Low's shares gained 15p to 239p yesterday and have now recovered much of the ground lost following the poor interims. Margins have been restored and new stores appear to be performing well. But despite the assurance of Mr Millar's footballing analogy, retailing is a funny old game and Wm Low's sceptics are still not convinced. Some point to the company's erratic profit record, and others question whether it can really survive a dual assault on its Scottish heartland by majors like Sainsbury and discounters like Shoprite. Forecast profits of Pounds 23m put the shares on just under 9 times, which looks cheap relative to the sector. The shares may go higher, but long-established reasons for the company's low rating - its size and store portfolio - are still valid.</p>

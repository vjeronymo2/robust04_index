			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Yeltsin delivers second challenge to parliament PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday threw down another constitutional challenge to the country's parliament when he stated in a letter to Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, that he would not sign a budget law sent to him by parliament. Mr Yeltsin justified this second, unconstitutional, refusal to sign by claiming the budget law was new because it had a new name. Mr Khasbulatov, in an angry reply, insisted it be signed. The clash came as a senior government adviser warned that the government was now powerless to stop hyperinflation and financial collapse. Irrespective of the outcome of this exchange, the parliament is due to discuss yet another budget law, with revised figures, which would mean an even larger budget deficit than that already forecast. The present bill already calls for a deficit amounting to 20-25 per cent of GDP. Mr Yeltsin will eventually have to choose between unconstitutionality and signing a bill with huge deficit implications. In a series of comments gloomy even by Russian standards, Mr Andrei Ilyaronov, adviser to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, said the government would have to operate one or other law passed by the parliament - and that would mean a collapse of the state's finances by the end of the year. Mr Ilyaronov, supported by Mr Sergei Vassilyev, head of the government's Centre for Economic Performance, and Professor Anders Aslund, a government adviser, said the agreement between the government and the central bank to limit credit expansion to 20 per cent in the current and the fourth quarter of the year was already destroyed. Credit expansion in the current quarter would be at least 43 per cent, while that figure would be exceeded 'several times' in the final quarter because of budget demands. Mr Ilyaronov and his colleagues said the government no longer controlled finances since, irrespective of what programme was agreed, spending decisions were made and carried through outside the Ministry of Finance and the cabinet room. A close aide to Mr Yeltsin yesterday forecast the creation of a political union of former Soviet states which would 'logically and inevitably' follow the steps now being taken towards greater economic integration. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's chief spokesman, said in the popular daily Komsomolskaya Pravda that 'a new deal which will define the geopolitical contours and the strategic parameters of a new community' was now possible, after the 'uprooting of a few prickly nationalist weeds'. It was only, he said, 'a matter of time'.</p>

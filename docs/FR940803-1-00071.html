			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A scientific collecting permit is required by the State of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Georgia to collect mussels for scientific purposes. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredging, brailling, or any form of mechanical harvest of mussels is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illegal. In addition, a size limit has been placed on mussels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvested commercially in Georgia. Handpicking mussels requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only a resident or non-resident fishing license. In the State of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida an individual must purchase a fishing license to collect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mussels. Despite these permit requirements, there are no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions on the seasonality or sites of harvest, quantity, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species of mussels collected in Florida or Georgia. Alabama has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently imposed a set of guidelines concerning commercial harvest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of mussels, including species-specific size limits, restricted areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for harvest, and closed seasons. Existing authorities available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect aquatic systems, such as the Clean Water Act, administered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engineers, have not been fully utilized and may have led to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degradation of aquatic environments in the Southeast Region, thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting in a decline of aquatic species. If these seven species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are listed under the Act, it would provide protection under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9 of the Act by prohibiting the take of these species except under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal permit. Further, listing will require consultation with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA in relationship to water quality criteria, standards, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Water Act, and implementation of actions to recover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The range of these seven mussel species has been fragmented,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and significant portions of the Apalachicola and Ochlockonee river  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems have been permanently altered by various reservoirs. Many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the streams these species inhabit exhibit moderate to heavy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degradation from poor land use practices. These factors have caused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local extirpation and fragmentation of most of these species'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations. It is not known how many populations of these seven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species are viable, but few juveniles have been observed in recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. The restricted distribution of these seven mussels makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them vulnerable to extirpation from catastrophic events, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxic chemical spills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The introduced Asian clam ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Corbicula fluminea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) has invaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearly all of the river systems in which these mussels occur,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competing with native mussels for nutrients and space. Densities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Asian clams are sometimes heavy in Apalachicolan Region streams,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with estimates running from approximately one hundred per square  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meter (Flint River, Sickel 1973) to thousands per square meter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Santa Fe River, Bass and Hitt 1974). In some streams the substrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has changed from one of a fairly homogeneous silty sand or sand to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one with a gravel-like composition comprised of huge numbers of live  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and dead Asian clam shells. In some of these streams, the Gulf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moccasinshell and Ochlockonee moccasinshell were once common but are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now extirpated or severely reduced in numbers. This exotic species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be particularly competitive with small native mussels such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the diminutive moccasinshells.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing this rule, the Service has assessed the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present, and future threats faced by these seven mussels. Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon these evaluations, the preferred action is to list the fat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three-ridge, shiny-rayed pocketbook, oval pigtoe, Gulf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moccasinshell, and Ochlockonee moccasinshell as endangered and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chipola slabshell and purple bankclimber as threatened. These seven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mussel species are endemic to the Apalachicolan Region in southeast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alabama, southwest Georgia, and north Florida, where they occur in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from one to four isolated marine river systems. The fat three-ridge, Chipola slabshell, and Ochlockonee moccasinshell are endemic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to single drainages, the former two species to the Apalachicola and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the latter species to the Ochlockonee river systems. The shiny-rayed pocketbook and purple bankclimber are restricted to both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Apalachicola and Ochlockonee river systems, while the oval pigtoe is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in these two rivers in addition to the Suwannee River and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Econfina Creek systems. The Gulf moccasinshell is now restricted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Apalachicola River system and Econfina Creek.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

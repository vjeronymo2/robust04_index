			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (3): Pragmatism may prevail - Robert Graham examines labour relations The Italian trades union movement finds itself increasingly in the role of chief opponent of the Berlusconi government's economic and financial policy. The general strike called on October 14 to protest against cuts in pensions and the general content of the 1995 budget, could mark a turning point in relations between the government and the unions. Unless the trades union leadership sees the government willing to make some concessions on pensions and health service cuts, street protest is likely to continue. There could be a spill-over effect on relations between the unions and the employers. This then risks undermining one of the most remarkable achievements of recent years - the July 1993 tripartite agreement between the government, unions and employers that ended wage indexation (the pernicious scala mobile) and linked wage rises to productivity. Pragmatism may well prevail; but such a scenario is disturbing industrialists who had hoped to be able to rely on stable industrial relations as a central building block of the economic recovery. Since 1992, the level of industrial unrest has been decreasing. The three main trades union confederations have preferred negotiation to confrontation. The number of hours lost through strikes in the first half of this year was a 25-year low. In part this reflects a decline in the influence of the unions and lower membership. Perhaps more importantly the traditional bastions of trades union power - the workforce in the big engineering-manufacturing groups - have been weakened by job losses in the industrial restructuring of the past five years. As a consequence, job security has been put before pay rises, or even work conditions, as the unions recognise that some of the privileges they have acquired over the years will have to go. It was significant that the engineering workers broke with their confrontational tradition and agreed to renew their national contract in July without even a token protest strike. The wage element has been the simplest aspect of negotiations in the past two years. Since 1992, wages have declined in real terms. Last year, wages on average rose 3 per cent, a good percentage point below inflation (with public sector pay rising marginally behind the private sector). This year, there has been no suggestion that wage levels will be able to recover lost earning power. Indeed, with inflation slightly higher than projected in the official figures, the decline in real earnings will continue. The huge improvement in the climate of industrial relations, at least until this autumn, has undoubtedly been helped by the 1993 tripartite agreement. The agreement ended the old system whereby wages in the private sector were based upon three elements - an agreed industry-wide rate, specific company related payments and an indexation payment. Now, nominal wages are renegotiated every two years within a four-year nationwide framework. The increases in pay cannot exceed projected inflation, while company payments above the norm must be linked to productivity. Beyond this, the government is committed to stimulate spending on research and development, improve job training and address the problems of industry in depressed areas. In conjunction, the unions accepted that further reforms were necessary in the labour market, including the need to tackle the issue of temporary employment. The unions feel they have played their part in terms of job sacrifices and wage restraint. They are now awaiting the government to deliver on its part of the bargain. However, they suspect the government is far more interested in first securing a greater liberalisation of the labour market - as are the employers. The Berlusconi government made the first, albeit timid, steps to liberalise the labour market in July. The measures introduce the principle of temporary employment but then circumscribe it with a series of rules. For example, employers can only resort to temporary work contracts where jobs are being added to the company payroll - but not in substitution of existing jobs or where jobs have already been shed. Companies are also limited in the number of temporary employees. At the same time, temporary employment cannot last longer than 12 months. As a corollary, companies were also given tax breaks for hiring either long-time unemployed or new job-seekers. This falls short of an easy hire-and-fire policy, and does not address many of the employers' complaints of the high non-wage cost of employment. Nevertheless, an environment is emerging in which more flexible rules can be applied to employment. As a result, there should be a gradual change in the structure of employment, reducing the unacceptably high levels of youth unemployment and the high degree of exclusion of women from formal jobs. Female unemployment at 17 per cent is almost double the average for males and the gap is even wider in the south. Another anomaly being eroded is the national minimum wage applied regardless of the differing conditions in the north and south. This has been a big disincentive to investors, reluctant to pay the same wages in the south where productivity has been historically lower and the cost of elements such as housing are well below those in the north. The north-south wage differential is now being encouraged indirectly by the European Union. Brussels is forcing Italy to stop fiscal rebates on the wage and social security bills of companies operating in the south - breaks which allowed wages to be roughly the same nationwide. Against this background - with reform of the labour market half complete and wage agreements based on a finely-balanced sense of give-and-take between the government, employers and the unions - it suits neither side to provoke a 'hot autumn'.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Uncertainty remains STERLING futures dipped yesterday after the pound dropped below DM2.8200 for the first time since Britain joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism. But trading in both the futures and cash markets was thin, and period rates ended the day virtually unchanged from Wednesday night's levels. The quiet trading of recent days is partly due to the summer holiday. But there is also a determined lack of position-taking in both the cash and futures markets. Uncertainty unites the market more than any other sentiment. Dealers are waiting for the outcome of next month's French referendum on Maastricht, which could blow the ERM apart, and push rates down. They are also uncertain about whether there will be another Lombard rate rise in Germany. Yesterday's UK economic indicators were mildly encouraging but had no impact on trading. The 29,100 rise in July unemployment was slightly higher than the market had forecast, and manufacturing output rose 0.2 per cent when a fall had been predicted. Sterling futures dealers were therefore guided by the currency alone. The September contract dropped 8 basis points from its previous close to a low of 89.57, and closed at 89.60. One clearing bank dealer said that this was as low as the contract could dip with base rates at 10 per cent. The September contract would dip to 89.50 if there was the immediate prospect of a  1/2 percentage point rise in base rates, but dealers would be taking too much of a risk to sell the contract down to that level now. In the sterling cash market, dealers appeared to be unwilling to offer bills to take out a Pounds 700m shortage forecast by the Bank of England. They may have been waiting to push the overnight rate down today, making borrowing conditions cheaper over the weekend. In the morning, the Bank purchased only Pounds 10m in a repurchase agreement, at 9 15/16 per cent, and the overnight rate responded by moving up to 10 3/4 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 700m, and the Bank purchased Pounds 172m in Band 1 at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 150m in the repo. There was late assistance of Pounds 220m. Three-month money closed unchanged at 10 1/4 per cent on the offered side.</p>

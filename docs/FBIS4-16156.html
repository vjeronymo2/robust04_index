			<p>BFN     [Text] A press group of the Crimean Security Service has  circulated the following report: On 11 April, the president of  the autonomy, Yuriy Meshkov, notified Crimean Security Service  personnel of the decrees that terminated the plenary powers of  its head, Major-General Ivan Kolomytsev, and appointed Volodymyr  Lepikhov, who was transferred from the armed forces to the  reserve 18 months ago in the same rank of Major-General, to this  post.    On the same day, the Crimean Security Service received a  telegram from the leader of the Security Service of Ukraine,  Yevhen Marchuk, in which the above decrees are qualified as  running contrary to the constitutions and the laws of Ukraine  and Crimea, which regulate the order of appointments to and  dismissals from this post.    At the same time, Ivan Kolomytsev was told to continue  fulfilling the duties with which he was charged. At present,  the personnel of the Security Service are carrying out planned  operational-procedural activity on guaranteeing security and  maintaining civil peace and accord in Crimea.    The press group summarizes this by indicating that the  situation brought about by Yuriy Meshkov's decrees is fraught  with the threat to the inviolability of the principle of  lawfulness in the formation and activities of the security  service bodies and the implementation of constitutional powers  by this service.    The press group expresses the hope that the precedent, which  occurred exceptionally on the principles of legality, law and  order, and respect of the rights and freedoms of every citizen,  will be solved.</p>

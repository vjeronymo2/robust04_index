			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Boots takes heart from licence agreement MANOPLAX, Boots' congestive heart failure treatment that received its first licence yesterday, probably represents the British group's last chance of a meaningful presence in the lucrative pharmaceuticals industry. While Boots' turnover is dominated by retailing, the pharmaceuticals division generated an operating profit of Pounds 120m last year, 32 per cent of the group total. The success of Manoplax is vital to the division because most of its existing products are off-patent and therefore vulnerable to cheap generic competition. Meanwhile, its pipeline of new medicines - other than Manoplax  -appears unpromising. Boots' pharmaceuticals business is a minnow compared with the industry's giants. It risks not having the critical mass to develop and successfully market new medicines on a regular basis. 'We are betting heavily on Manoplax. It is a very important drug capable of reshaping the whole business,' said Mr Terry Richardson, international and marketing managing director. The drug could eventually generate sales of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 300m a year. Yesterday's licence is a relief for Boots after repeated delays led to analysts describing the drug as 'Mananaplax'. However, some are less confident than Boots about Manoplax's potential sales and ability to transform its drugs business. Doubts exist about European demand for the product. Worldwide sales of Ace-inhibitors, the main class of competitor to Manoplax, are about Dollars 500m (Pounds 262m) a year. But although Merck, the US drug giant, has thrown vast resources at marketing Vasotec, its best-selling Ace-inhibitor, in Europe, only 5 per cent of European patients are prescribed such medicines. 'If Merck with all its marketing muscle finds it difficult to overcome European doctors' conservatism, what hope has Boots?' asked one analyst. To overcome its marketing weakness in Europe, Boots has signed co-marketing agreements for Germany with Astra, the Swedish group, and plans to sign a similar agreement with an Italian group. It aims to market the drug directly to hospital specialists in France, the UK and Spain and plans to invest Pounds 20m in additional marketing infrastructure this year. Manoplax's ultimate success will be decided in the US, the world's largest single market. About 25 per cent of the 3m congestive heart disease patients are prescribed Ace-inhibitors there. However, analysts fear Manoplax will only be used in the US as a second-choice treatment when Ace-inhibitors fail. Last October the FDA's cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee recommended the drug for approval, but only in patients who still had symptoms after using Ace-inhibitors or were intolerant to alternative therapies. Mr Richardson hoped that data from recent clinical trials would enable wider approval to be gained, possibly making it a first-line treatment. Analysts believe that a successful launch for Manoplax could offer an ideal opportunity for Boots to withdraw from prescription pharmaceuticals. It could sell at a moment of maximum potential, while avoiding the full brunt of marketing costs. The group could then concentrate on its strengths in retailing and over-the-counter medicines.</p>

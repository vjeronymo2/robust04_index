			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BILL WALSH SPURNS JOB WITH JETS  </P> <P> Former San Francisco 49er coach Bill Walsh told the New York Jets he is not  interested in coaching the team, which is expected to fire Coach Joe Walton  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Dick Steinberg, the Jets' new general manager, said Sunday he has discussed the  Jets' coaching job with Walsh, an analyst with NBC. Walsh was in New York  Saturday for the Jet-Buffalo Bill game at Giants Stadium.  </P> <P> "I asked Bill if he had any interest in returning to coaching," Steinberg said.  "He likes what he's doing now and wants to make a go of it."  </P> <P> Steinberg is scheduled to meet with Walton Tuesday, at which time he is  expected to announce Walton's departure.  </P> <P> Walsh recommended his former offensive coordinator, Mike Holmgren, and  Cincinnati offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet as possible replacements for  Walton, and Steinberg said: "Those two guys will go right on our list because I  respect Bill's opinion."  </P> <P> Walton, 54-59-1 in seven years with the Jets, declined to talk about his future  after Saturday's 37-0 loss to the Bills.  </P> <P> Jet wide receiver Al Toon said Walton spoke to the team earlier. "He talked for  22 minutes," Toon said. "He thanked us for all the work we've done. He wished  us a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Then he said goodby."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 800 MCDONNELL WORKERS WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS  </P> <P> McDonnell-Douglas Helicopter Co. said Wednesday that it will lay off 800  workers in late February because of cutbacks in defense spending and production  of the U.S. Army's Apache attack helicopter.  </P> <P> The company said the layoffs include about 400 of the 5,900 workers at its Mesa  plant and another 400 at its California Manufacturing Center in Culver City.  </P> <P> The California plant has 1,650 employees at present. The layoffs are effective  Feb. 23.  </P> <P> The company said production of the Apache helicopters, currently at the rate of  10 aircraft a month, will be reduced to six per month in June, with final  Apache deliveries to the Army scheduled for mid-1993.  </P> <P> President William P. Brown said that, while McDonnell Douglas is pursuing  opportunities for international sales of Apache helicopters, "In the meantime,  we must reduce our work force to meet the reality of our delivery schedule with  the U.S. Army."  </P> <P> Brown said that adding to the need for reductions in spending is a recently  announced $137-million writeoff on helicopter programs attributed to  re-estimated material costs incurred over the life of several government  contracts.  </P> <P> In addition to the layoffs, Brown said the company will reduce employee travel,  participation in industry trade shows, replacement of non-critical equipment  and other discretionary spending. It also has delayed plans to expand its light  helicopter facilities.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas had planned to begin in January an expansion of its light  helicopter facilities to accommodate production of its new MDX and MC 520N-530N  helicopters. That plan has been put on hold.  </P> <P> "We will need the facility when full MDX production begins in 1993," Brown  said. "Until that time, existing facilities will be used for these programs."  </P></p>

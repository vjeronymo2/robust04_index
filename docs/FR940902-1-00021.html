These two acts expand this program by adding new types of permissible training such as apprenticeship and other on-job training, cooperative training, and flight training. Furthermore, the eligibility provisions are significantly liberalized. For instance, the attainment of a baccalaureate degree or equivalent evidence of completion of study will no longer bar some reservists from training under the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. This proposal will acquaint the public with the way in which VA (Department of Veterans Affairs), the Department of Defense, and the Department of Transportation intend to implement these provisions of these two acts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before November 1, 1994.

L. 101&hyph;237) and the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;189), contain provisions which affect the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. These include expanding this program to include additional types of training, liberalizing the eligibility requirements for this program, and permitting recipients of benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve to participate in VA's work-study program. The provisions concerning work-study were further amended by Pub. L. 102&hyph;16 to permit training at Coast Guard and National Guard facilities. Regulations must be amended so that they implement the new provisions of law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

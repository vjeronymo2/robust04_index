			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Water from the  Yellow River [Huang He] is now flowing into Cangzhou and  Hengshui cities in the thirsty North China province of Hebei.    This is part of the water diversion project to quench the  thirst of industries and agriculture in this water short  province.    According to the decision by the State Council, pending the  water diversion project from Chang Jiang, an estimated 500  million cubic meters of Yellow River water would be diverted to  Hebei for the next 15 years.    To date, the project has progressed smoothly. More than 100  million cu m of water have been diverted from the Yellow River  into the cities of Cangzhou and Hengshui on the vast "North  China" plain.    The water diversion project was proposed jointly by the  Ministry of Water Resources of China and the provincial  governments of Hebei and Shandong.    Seriously suffering from water shortages, most of the  farmland on the plain averages an output of only slightly more  than 1,500 kg of wheat per ha.    Moreover, the over-exploitation of groundwater resources has  lowered the water quality and has seriously hindered the  development of both industry and agriculture.    Ye Liansong, governor of hebei, pointed out that the water  diversion project from the Yellow River to Hebei could yet not  solve the problem thoroughly, as the rate of flow of the Yellow  River has decreased year-by-year.    He said that the only way to supply enough water for arid  Hebei is to divert water from the lower reaches of the Chang  Jiang River.</p>

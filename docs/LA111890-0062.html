			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR FARE SPECIALISTS;  </P> <P> LA VERNE: BRACKETT FIELD COMES COMPLETE WITH A DREAM LOCALE BY THE CRAGGY SAN  GABRIEL MOUNTAINS AND A FRIENDLY LITTLE RESTAURANT WHERE THE AIRPORT REGULARS  TAKE MEALS ON A SHADED TERRACE.  </P> <P> So you're up there. The little airplane bobs lightly across airy swells, and  the San Gabriel Valley is spread out 1,000 feet below. Where do you go?  </P> <P> How about Brackett Field in La Verne? There's a little restaurant in the  administration building. You can sit on an open-air terrace there and watch all  the Beechcraft and Cessnas touching down daintily on the airport's parallel  runways.  </P> <P> Once in a while a whistling Lear jet, as sleek as an M-1 round, will rocket  into the sky, or some World War II antique will sail in with a guy who looks  like a young Van Johnson at the controls.  </P> <P> It's an airplane fanatic's dream locale, with a backdrop of the craggiest San  Gabriel Mountains. People have been known to move, lock, stock and barrel, to  La Verne or San Dimas just so they could be close to Brackett.  </P> <P> Take Alan and Karen Smith, formerly of Yorba Linda. Alan Smith says their  recent move to the Via Verde section of San Dimas, a mile away from Brackett,  placed them in a rare statistical category -- "people who actually moved out of  Orange County."  </P> <P> The couple are regulars at Norm's Hangar these days, taking their coffee and  scrambled eggs on the awning-shaded terrace before going up for a spin in their  Cessna 310, a nifty twin-engine plane with room for six people.  </P> <P> "We really liked the airport and we wanted to be close," says Alan Smith,  customer services manager for Southern California Edison.  </P> <P> John and Ken Nissen, the brothers who manage the little restaurant, say there  are a lot of people like the Smiths. Their customers shove the tables together  on Saturdays and Sundays to plan airborne excursions to Death Valley or the  High Sierra, or they just sit there, dreamily taking in the panorama or  listening to the control tower chatter that is broadcast over speakers in the  restaurant.  </P> <P> "You have your pilots and your wanna-be pilots," says Rob Cheek, another  recreational pilot who lives nearby.  </P> <P> There are also plenty of folks flying in from Las Vegas or Anaheim for  breakfast or lunch at Norm's.  </P> <P> "On nice days, you'll see them coming in, one after the other," says John  Nissen, a short man with a neat, marmalade-colored beard. You'll probably see  them ordering omelets and bacon cheeseburgers at Norm's too, or else waiting at  the front door for an empty table.  </P> <P> Norm, for whom the restaurant is named, is the brothers' father, a longtime  restaurateur who has operated coffee shops at county golf courses for more than  20 years. Right now, he's in Palm Springs, keeping tabs on his restaurant at  the Palm Springs Municipal Golf Course.  </P> <P> Like most of the customers, father and sons have all been bitten with the  flying disease. "Yeah, I'll get up a couple of times a week for a half hour, 45  minutes," says Ken Nissen, stepping from behind the grill.  </P> <P> Nowadays, the conversation at Norm's focuses a lot on fuel prices. The price of  100 octane low-lead airplane fuel has shot up about 25%, to better than $2 a  gallon, since the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> "You used to be able to just jump in a plane and say, 'Let's go fly,' " says  Roy Wallace, a flight instructor who is one of the Sunday morning regulars at  Norm's. "Now you have to make an event of it."  </P> <P> People also fret a lot about privatization. The 286-acre airport is owned by  Los Angeles County, which is committed to selling off its five airports.  Airport Manager Doug Nelson acknowledges that the Public Works Department has  been negotiating with contractors to take over Brackett.  </P> <P> "I think the only thing people have to worry about is if a private contractor  decides to raise the (rental) rates," Nelson says.  </P> <P> Brackett is, of course, a choice location for Southern California recreational  fliers. It's outside that 30-mile radius around LAX, where private planes must  be equipped with special transponders to broadcast their altitude and location.  </P> <P> "You don't have to cross the Los Angeles Basin to get in or out," says Smith.  Natural passes through the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains, carrying  fliers north, northeast or east, extend out from Brackett like spokes from a  hub.  </P> <P> Nestled between Bonelli Park and the Fairplex, the airport is largely isolated  from residential areas -- and neighbors complaining about the noise.  </P> <P> And pilots say it's a gem of an airport.  </P> <P> "It's the prettiest one in Southern California," says Joyce Johnson, who got  her pilot's license to keep up with her retired husband. "In the wintertime,  there's snow in the mountains . . . the whole bit."  </P> <P> But hangar space is in short supply. The airport's 260 hangar spots rent for  between $265 and $470 a month, says Nelson. And there's a long waiting list.  Brackett's 250 tie-down spots go for $52 a month.  </P> <P> Part of the ritual at Norm's is grumbling about expenses. "People have this  idea that we're all rich," says Cheek. "But most of us are poor because we're  pilots. It's paying $50 for a cup of coffee . . . Think of it. We travel 100  miles for a cup of coffee and a hamburger."  </P> <P> But for most, the experience of flying is clearly a liberating one, worth every  penny that it costs. "You're looking at somebody who used to be afraid to get  into an airplane," says Johnson, whose husband, Bob, learned how to fly after  he retired.  </P> <P> "I decided that, if we were going to be up there, I ought to learn how to land  the thing in case anything happened," she says. After a few hours of flight  instruction, she was hooked. "I decided I better take my own ticket," she says,  laughing. "Now I've lived long enough to be a worry to my kids, instead of the  other way around."  </P> <P> Of course, not everybody at Norm's is enamored of the idea of pitching through  the sky in a flimsy single-engine plane.  </P> <P> Penny Downing, whose husband, Norm, is a flying enthusiast and frustrated  pilot, says she'll never get into one of those babies again.  </P> <P> "A friend insisted that I go up with him once," she says, watching the planes  on the Brackett runway the way a rabbit ponders a cobra. "I hyperventilated so  bad up there. When I got off, my legs felt like water. Never again."  </P></p>

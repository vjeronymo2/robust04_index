			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Prudential ends involvement in commercial lines Prudential Corporation, the insurance and financial services group, is divesting the remainder of its commercial lines business in the UK. The move follows its announcement in March that it would no longer sell general insurance in the UK through brokers, after losses of Pounds 77m in that business in 1991. Prudential said it has reached an agreement with Kendal-based Provincial Insurance, the 12th largest general insurer in the UK with premium income last year of Pounds 331m. Under the agreement Prudential will recommend its existing commercial policy holders to switch to Provincial when their policies come up for renewal after April next. Prudential will receive a commission for introducing new business based on the volume of business written by Provincial.</p>

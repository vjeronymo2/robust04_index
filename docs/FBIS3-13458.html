			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First installment of interview with former Prime Minister </F> General Michel 'Awn by Bisharah Shirbil in France; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Shirbil] Numerous developments have taken  place in Lebanon and the region since the liberation war: An  authority formed as a result of the al-Ta'if accord has  strengthened, governments have been formed, elections have been  held, and a treaty has been concluded with Syria, which is  responsible for Lebanon's future if it enters the peace process,  as it defines the future features of the region. How do you  view Lebanon's position?    ['Awn] Lebanon does not exist. Lebanon today represents a  differential in the Syrian-Israeli equation. It has surrendered  itself to Syria and can no longer sign or reject anything. It  is completely silent. The Lebanese negotiator's position has  been humanly disgraceful, standing like a dummy in front of the  Israeli negotiator. It cannot discuss anything, or say yes or  no. So it has become the object of ridicule. The proper thing  is for the Lebanese to suspend their participation in the  negotiations so that Syrian negotiations can advance. It is not  a vacation in Washington. Let them wait for Damascus' signal to  return. I say that Lebanon's participation does not mean it  exists. It only exists as a differential variable between the  Syrian view and Israeli view of Lebanon. It is regrettable for  us to become a margin in an equation, not a personality in its  own right. This is what I meant before when I said that we  should sit at -- not on -- the negotiating table [as published],  and I called for a three-sided, not two-sided table, that is a  table at which Lebanon, Syria, and Israel would sit and through  which Lebanon could talk about its right. [passage omitted]    [Shirbil] You reject what you call Syrian occupation of  Lebanon and yet accept what the Arabs consider Jewish occupation  of Palestine.    ['Awn] No. I reject the Israeli occupation. But is the Jew  present in Israel not entitled to set up his entity or not? Is  Palestine not his territory or not? Your will tell me that he  is an immigrant and a stranger. But I ask you: When have human  societies ever been fixed? Are there not ten times more Arabs  in the United States than Israelis in Palestine? Here, in  France, there are some 3 million people of Algerian origin.  Human societies are not fixed ethnically or religiously.    [Shirbil] But ethnic and Arab communities in France or the  United States do not set up separate entities hostile toward  their environment.    ['Awn] Yes, there are entities causing problems. But their  members enjoy the civil and political rights enjoyed by the  Americans or the French. There is no discrimination in the law.  [passage omitted]    [Shirbil] What is your expectation as regards the future of  fundamentalism?    ['Awn] It will inevitably come to power in Islamic states,  but it will fall after reaching power. Then a reexamination  will be conducted from within Islam.    [Shirbil] Did you hope that fundamentalism would assume  power in Algeria?    ['Awn] I do not wish that to happen, but they will come to  power. It is a natural, historic rule. It has nothing to do  with whether or not I wish that to happen. I am not a  fundamentalist, and I reject fundamentalism openly. However, I  expect them to come to power. Then they will fail because they  make many promises of solutions to the problems. But they are  primitive solutions which will complicate difficult problems.  [passage omitted]    [Shirbil] How can the fundamentalist tendencies which you  expect to come to power influence Lebanon?    ['Awn] We are in the region, and certainly fundamentalism  will influence Lebanon. We have people who support  fundamentalism and consider it a hope for a reasonable solution.    [Shirbil] You cannot say that there is a sweeping  fundamentalist tendency in Lebanon. It is one of the parties...    ['Awn] Lebanon is disorganized demographically. There is  horrific population growth. A sizable proportion of Lebanese  used to emigrate, but this is not possible now. The Lebanese  abroad cannot find jobs, and they want to return to Lebanon.  Western societies are full of unemployed people. France has 4  million of them, and the United States 23 million. [passage  omitted]    [Shirbil] Can the growing fundamentalist tide lead to a  coexistence crisis in Lebanon, or does the crisis already exist?    ['Awn] A coexistence crisis exists in most pluralistic  societies. But when there is a national authority and dialogue  over the issue, problems will be solved. It is always possible  to find solutions for them. But what happened in Lebanon was  that, as a result of existing pressures caused by coexistence  and pluralism, some external parties intervened and stability  was undermined and Lebanon taken over by Syria. This is in  addition to the Israeli occupation in the south. Every occupier  says the other occupier is the cause of its presence. But both  are occupiers: an enemy occupation and a brotherly occupation,  as they say. Their effects on citizens are the same. There is  social pressure in a country that is pluralistic ethnically,  religiously, and culturally. Anyone who says otherwise is lying  to himself. Freedom and equality are the foundation of the  relationship among the Lebanese. Equality should be through  opportunities, not rights, because rights necessitate justice,  and justice necessitates distinguishing between people:  everyone should be rewarded on the basis of his competence.  [sentence as published]    If a section of the Lebanese does not accept that, a  referendum should be held -- a referendum on political ideas.  So if the idea is accepted, it should be accepted with all its  results. And if it is rejected, it should be rejected with all  its results. On that basis, if unification is not accepted on  the basis of a constitution, equality, and everyone's rights and  duties, federalism becomes a solution. [passage omitted]    [Shirbil] The events witnessed in pluralistic states that  include sectarian and ethnic...    ['Awn, interrupting] Let us talk freely and very openly. The  ball of unification is in the Lebanese Muslims' court. If they  have any courage, let them embark on unification within not  'Awn's concepts but universal concepts, because these concepts  are not mine.    [Shirbil] As though your plan is outside...    ['Awn] Let them adopt the Bosnia plan.    [Shirbil] Which is?    ['Awn] A federation and a confederation like the one signed  between the Croats and the Bosnians. This or that.    [Shirbil] Is there anything else which you consider amiss?    ['Awn] The present situation is not under control. There  are no state structures to exercise powers and assume  responsibilities at all levels. Because the state is based on  excesses. The head of state said that General 'Awn left Lebanon  following an agreement with him and with several other parties.  Do you imagine that they hit me by aircraft under an agreement  with me. And that they stripped me of my rights in the military  establishment under an agreement with me. [passage omitted]    [Shirbil] Do you support the resistance against the Israeli  occupation in the south?    ['Awn] I support the resistance in every sense of the word.  However, I would to explain one point: At the negotiations held  in Washington Israel clearly announced that it does not want a  single inch of Lebanese territory or a drop of water in return  for border security. Israel says that it wants to withdraw in  return for border security and joining the peace process, which  is supported by the Arab states and on the basis of which they  are negotiating. So why the resistance now? I should ask this  resistance about its links. You should not ask me whether or  not I support the resistance. The continuation of the  resistance forced Israel to stay and forced the parties using  Israel's presence as an excuse to stay. If Syria's value  increases as a result of the resistance, who is going to pay the  price? Will Israel pay Syria from Israel, or will the  resistance pay the price if a solution is secured? [passage  omitted]    [Shirbil] Has anyone invited you to return to Lebanon?    ['Awn] There are numerous offers. There are open  invitations from Nabih Birri, Eilie al-Farzali, and Eilie  Hubayqah.    [Shirbil] Do you believe your security is not guaranteed?    ['Awn] Nothing is guaranteed in Lebanon. Tell me any major  crime whose clues have been unraveled.    [Shirbil] Will your remain as an oppositionist...    ['Awn] More than an oppositionist. I am not an  oppositionist. I am a resister. Oppositionists recognize the  regime and oppose it. I do not recognize the present regime,  which is why I am resisting. Resistance does not necessarily  mean carrying a gun. [passage omitted]</p>

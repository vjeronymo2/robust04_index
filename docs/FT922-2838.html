			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Panini sale at advanced stage NEGOTIATIONS have reached an advanced stage for the sale of Panini, the Italian cartoon stickers company controlled by Maxwell Communication Corporation, to a consortium of domestic, US and Spanish investors. No price has been revealed as auditors are still going through Panini's books. However, Mr Pier Domenico Gallo, an executive of the financial boutique negotiating the transaction, said a sale could be signed 'within a month'. Panini, based in Modena, was bought by MCC for about L200bn between 1988 and 1989. However, the sale price is likely to be considerably lower owing to the collapse in the company's profitability. Panini is believed to have lost about L20bn (Dollars 16.7m) in its last published set of accounts, and has an outstanding debt to MCC of some L40bn. The consortium, which includes members of Panini's management and institutional investors, also involves De Agostini, the Italian publishing and cartographic house. Although likely to buy only a minority stake, De Agostini may end up as the biggest single shareholder and take operating control of Panini, according to Mr Gallo.</p>

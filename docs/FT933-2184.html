			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Left sees gains in Polish polls POLAND'S former communists appeared to have made gains in close-run parliamentary elections yesterday as many voters switched allegiance from the mainstream, ex-Solidarity, parties in power since the communists fells in 1989. Straw polls in Warsaw indicated a leftward shift, but the high volatility of voting signalled a very close race. The mainstream Democratic Union (UD) party of Ms Hanna Suchocka, the outgoing prime minister, which has been at the centre of government since 1989, might be relegated to third place. If opinion polls are borne out, the strongest parties will be the two with roots in the communist past. They are the Polish Peasants party, which is tipped to become the largest single party with about 18 per cent of the votes, and the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), with up to 15 per cent. Huddles of voters were still making up their minds yesterday afternoon at the polling station on a housing estate on the edge of Warsaw. Many voters there and at nearby polling stations said they had little enthusiasm for any of the 35 parties competing for election to the 460-seat Sejm, the lower house of parliament, or the 100-seat Senate. While many voters agreed that their lives had improved since the Solidarity movement brought down the communist system, several cited the alliance's acrimonious disintegration as grounds for shifting their votes. More than 27m were eligible to vote yesterday in the second general election since Poland became the first country in eastern Europe to sweep communists from power in August 1989. Lengthy inter-party horse-trading is likely to begin this morning in the light of the poll results.</p>

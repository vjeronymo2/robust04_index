			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BORDER AGENTS SEIZE 433 POUNDS OF POT IN 4 INCIDENTS  </P> <P> U.S. Border Patrol agents in San Diego foiled four marijuana smuggling attempts  in a 12-hour period, seizing 433 pounds of marijuana valued at more than  $200,000.  </P> <P> The four unrelated incidents happened between 4 p.m. Monday and 4 a.m. Tuesday,  said Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford.  </P> <P> "All of them were just stumbled on in one night," Swofford said.  </P> <P> Four men, three of them illegal aliens from Mexico, were arrested during the  seizures and are being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center on  suspicion of possession of a controlled substance, Swofford said.  </P> <P> In the first incident, Border Patrol agents at the San Onofre checkpoint said  they found more than 30 pounds of marijuana in a car and arrested Alex Velasco,  42, of Los Angeles, and Luis Mendival, 22, an illegal alien who had been living  in Whittier.  </P> <P> About four hours later, a Border Patrol agent saw a car drive south and park  near a closed warehouse near the border on Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> When the car didn't come back north, the agent investigated and found it  abandoned, Swofford said.  </P> <P> The agent resumed his patrol but later returned to the car. He found a duffel  bag filled with marijuana in the back seat and three more duffel bags of  marijuana in the trunk -- a total of 135 pounds.  </P> <P> At about 1 a.m. Tuesday, agents from the Imperial Beach station stopped two  illegal aliens carrying duffel bags across a Little League baseball field about  three-quarters of a mile north of the Mexican border. Agents found 93 pounds of  marijuana and a stolen 9-millimeter, semi-automatic pistol. Arrested were  Javier Guillen, 22, and Jesus Martinez, 22.  </P> <P> Three hours later at 4 a.m., other agents from the Imperial Beach station saw a  car drive through a hole in the border fence south of the 3200 block of  Monument Road and park in the driveway of a house.  </P> <P> When agents got to the car, the driver was gone but they found a large bag in  the back seat stuffed with tin cans filled with marijuana. Five more bags of  marijuana-filled tin cans were found in the trunk.  </P> <P> "We're always looking for narcotics, and this was a result of that," Swofford  said, "but we certainly didn't know any of them were coming."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- Cuba has called the forceful  entry by a group of 20 people into the German Embassy in this  capital early this morning as an obvious provocation.    Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso has  confirmed  to PRENSA LATINA the illegal entry of 17 men and 3 women into  the German Embassy by crashing a truck with Camaguey Province  license plates into the iron gate of the embassy's garage.    Shortly after this incident, German Ambassador Georg Trefftz  reported the incident to Cuban authorities and requested the  presence of Cuban Foreign Ministry officials.    Luis Garcia Peraza, deputy director of the Europe Department  of the Foreign Ministry, went to the embassy in representation  of his ministry. The ambassador told him the occupants refuse  to leave the site despite the fact he personally has urged them  to leave immediately.    The German mission has its own security. PRENSA LATINA has  learned that four guards are in charge of this embassy's  protection.    Trefftz said he would keep the Cuban Foreign Ministry  informed about the situation, although he has not given the  names of the people inside the building.    Alfonso explained that the Cuban Foreign Ministry has  reiterated the well-known Cuban position that this type of  violation of diplomatic missions accredited in the country is  unacceptable as an alternative to the legal procedures that must  be followed to travel outside national territory.    Cuba considers this a provocation and also a carefully  planned illegal action executed at the moment the president of  Mexico was arriving in Cuba and on the eve of the 4th  Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias.    The spokesman noted that the origin of this incident is the  growing sense of frustration among people who form what he  described as the anti-fatherland sector abroad, because of  Cuba's victories in the international arena.    This also constitutes, according to Alfonso, additional  evidence of the negative results of the United States policy of  denying visas to people wanting to travel to that country.</p>

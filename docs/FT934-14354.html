			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Dissident claims strong supportas row brews up at Baldwin A SHAREHOLDER row is brewing at Baldwin, the holidays, printing and properties group, writes David Blackwell. Mr Martin Moir, who is thought to hold about Pounds 100,000 of the stock, has sent a letter to Mr Ong Beng Seng, the Singapore entrepreneur whose Augsburg Investments has nearly 22 per cent of Baldwin. The letter, dated October 18, and being circulated to shareholders, urges Mr Ong Beng Seng 'to intervene and restore Baldwin plc's reputation and institutional backing' or to sell his stake. Mr Sandy Singh, Baldwin's chief executive, confirmed yesterday that he had seen the letter to shareholders, but added: 'At the end of the day, the board has no control over who buys and sells shares in Baldwin.' Mr Moir could not be contacted yesterday. Mr Ong Beng Seng, who runs the Kuo International trading group and owns the Halkin Hotel in London's Belgravia, is travelling in the Far East until Wednesday. Mr Moir claims to have received a large number of letters of support from other shareholders. His main complaint appears to be the fall in value of Baldwin's shares. 'In the five years before you became de facto controlling shareholder of Baldwin plc, the share price rose from 10p to Pounds 1 or more,' he writes in the letter. 'In the four or five years since you have been de facto controlling shareholder the price had fallen from over Pounds 1 to around 73p per share when I first wrote to you in August.' The shares closed yesterday at 89p, up 1p. Baldwin, which earlier this year acquired the Muswell's chain from Allied-Lyons for Pounds 2.65m, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.25m for the half-year to April 30.</p>

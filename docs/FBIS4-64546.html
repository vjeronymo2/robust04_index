			<p>BFN     [Text] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has  declared that the Cyprus negotiations cannot be conducted  through pressure and that there is no benefit in continuing the  talks until the Greek Cypriot side accepts equal status with the  Turkish Cypriots.    Erbakan received a delegation headed by Dervis Eroglu,  leader  of the National Unity Party of the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus [TRNC]. During the meeting, Erbakan said that there  cannot be any concessions in Cyprus. Pointing out that the work  conducted for the past 20 years to solve the problem has failed  to yield any results, Erbakan remarked that the experiences in  the Caucasus and the Balkans have clearly demonstrated that the  kind of federal state planned for Cyprus cannot bring peace and  tranquillity. Erbakan stressed that the Turkish and Greek  sectors in Cyprus are living in peace as two separate  communities and two separate states.    [Begin Erbakan recording] Given the circumstances, we see  that the plans to eliminate the TRNC, which are being  implemented step-by-step by foreign forces, constitute part of  the grand scheme they wish to undertake in Bosnia and  Azerbaijan. Moreover, the political status accorded the  patriarch in Istanbul, as if he were a Byzantine king, is also  part of the same grand scheme. [end recording]    Nationalist Action Party leader Alpaslan Turkes has declared  that no government can adopt a decision against the Turkish  Cypriot community. Eroglu visited Turkes at parliament today.  In a statement during the meeting, Turkes said that if the two  communities in Cyprus must live together and cooperate, this can  be realized within a confederation. He explained that there are  two separate states on the island and only a confederation to be  established through their agreement can constitute a solution.  In other words, Turkes remarked, we do not see any benefit in  the forced marriage the United Nations is trying to impose. He  said: Furthermore, we do not believe this is possible, because  there have been very painful incidents and it is impossible to  trust the Greek Cypriot community.    Turkes remarked that the Turkish community on the island  cannot be allowed to face the threat of genocide again or be  deprived of its human rights.    [Begin Turkes recording] No government can adopt a decision  that will harm the Turkish Cypriot community or go against its  interests. It cannot underwrite such a decision, because the  cause of the TRNC and of the existence of the Turks on the  island is the cause of the Turkish nation. The Turkish nation  embraces this cause zealously. It is not possible for a  government representing Turkey to adopt a decision contrary to  the wishes and will of the Turkish nation. Even if such a  decision were adopted, the people would not recognize it and  such a government could not remain in power. [end recording]    In turn, Eroglu stated that the whole world must be told  that  there are two separate states in Cyprus and that the people are  living in peace.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Italians assure Japan on cars ITALY yesterday denied it was imposing a block on car imports from Japan and Tokyo's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said it had been assured by the Italian government no such action was being taken. Miti said it had been confused by conflicting statements from the Italian government after inconclusive talks in Tokyo last month between the EC and Miti. Fresh uncertainties also appeared to be raised over Italy's view of Japanese cars built inside the EC - mainly in the UK. Italy's foreign trade ministry said its minister, Mr Claudio Vitalone, had been 'misinterpreted' by newspapers on action Italy was taking. 'There will be stricter monitoring of Japanese imports,' said Mr Renigio Cavedon, a ministry spokesman. Import levels would be reported immediately from frontier points. If the authorities found imports were 'much higher' than in the past, Italy would request the Commission to take action, he said. But there was no question of imports being blocked. The ministry indicated that the stepped up 'controls' of Japanese imports would include vehicles produced at Japanese-owned plants in the EC. Such 'transplants' should in theory be allowed free access to EC countries under the single market. 'We can't stop the UK-made Japanese cars,' said Mr Cavedon. 'But obviously, if 100,000 Japanese cars flooded into Italy, that would have serious consequences for the domestic motor industry.' December's talks to agree the overall number of vehicles shipped from Japan to the EC this year under an EC-Japan 'understanding' are expected to resume later this month. Importers themselves appeared confused over Italian government plans. Nissan in Italy said it believed imports were blocked 'for the time being', but admitted the company had not yet experienced any hold-ups. Around 90 per cent of Nissans sold in Italy are produced at its Sunderland plant in the UK. The agreement between the EC and Miti allowed for 56,000 Japanese imports into Italy last year. The figure included 'transplants'.</p>

Only the PS absolutely refuses  the possibility of resignation. The party of the  French-speaking socialists repudiated former Minister Philippe  Moureaux, who provided material to investigating Magistrate  Vronique Ancia for the Agusta case. MP's from Flemish majority  parties told DE STANDAARD they would find it difficult to vote  no to a proposal calling for the dismissal of Come.    The official CVP [Christian People's Party] position is that  any judgment on political and criminal responsibility should be  suspended until Come has defended himself before the  parliamentary committee on Thursday [13 January]. However, the  CVP does want the investigations to speed up "as requested by  investigating Magistrate Ancia."    The SP [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] says that the matter  must be clarified and has "full confidence in the SP MPs and  senators in the parliamentary committees" which are judging the  question. Deputy Prime Minister Willy Claes, who was minister  for economic affairs when the helicopters were purchased, did  not attend the meeting due to the NATO summit.    When asked by DE STANDAARD, most CVP MPs said that in any  event it would be best for Come to resign voluntarily. If a  proposal was made to parliament demanding his dismissal, most of  them would find it hard to vote against. The same answer was  heard from numerous SP MPs.    The party bureau of the Flemish liberals said the three PS  ministers mentioned in the Agusta case -- Federal Deputy Prime  Minister Guy Come, Walloon Minister-President Guy Spitaels, and  Walloon Regional Minister Guy Mathot -- should resign. "They no  longer have the moral authority for their position," the party  leadership said. "If Come does not reach that decision himself,  then Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene must force him to resign."    The Volksunie [People's Union] said the PS ministers should  resign and noted "with amazement the corrupt partners with which  the Flemish Government parties" remain in government. The VU  pointed to the differences in political culture which "are an  obstacle to living together in a federal state."    The Vlaams Blok [Flemish Block] wondered why the blame was  being shoved onto Come, while former Economic Affairs Minister  Willy Claes (SP) was jointly responsible for the purchase of the  Agusta helicopters.    For Agalev [Dutch-speaking Green Party], Deputy Prime  Minister Come should resign at least temporarily. Agalev said  it was unacceptable that "PS President Philippe Busquin is  denying there is a problem."    The French-speaking liberals [PRL] said that "a situation  should be avoided where a scandal which affects a few leading  figures spreads to the whole political system." The PRL said  the matter should proceed quickly, "with respect of the rights  of the suspect."    The PSC [Social-Christian Party] said that "calm was  necessary to uncover the truth."</p>

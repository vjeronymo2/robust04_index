			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Clinton pulls out all the stops over fast-track - But he seems set to pay a heavy price to clinch an accord with Congress President Bill Clinton will win an important victory if he succeeds in his ambitious attempt to get Congressional renewal of fast-track authority to negotiate new trade deals along with legislation to implement the Uruguay Round. His trade officials have already had to severely weaken language allowing inclusion of labour and the environment in future deals. This has infuriated many Democrats but also left unsatisfied many Republicans, who would like to totally forgo the option. Mr Harry Freeman, a veteran of many trade battles in Washington, has concluded that even if the president gets his fast-track, he will have paid a heavy price. 'This fast-track has less freedom for the executive branch,' he said. 'I've never seen a fast-track that had such specificity in the negotiating goals,' he said. Besides excluding labour and environment as negotiating objectives, the current fast-track language agreed with House Republicans specifically endorses negotiating trade in services, financial services and telecommunications. It orders the Administration to 'maintain vigorous and effective disciplines on subsidies practices with respect to civil aircraft products' under the multilateral subsidies code. The fast-track concept was developed in 1974 when Mr Dick Rivers, then a staffer at the Senate finance committee, wrote a memo suggesting Congress cede to the executive branch authority to negotiate trade deals and promise that any trade agreements reached would be considered by Congress on 'a fast-track.' This meant that any deal would get a simply up or down vote with no Congressional amendments. 'Each house of the Congress can even now change the procedures in a New York minute,' he says now. 'But without a fast-track there won't be significant trade negotiations.' This is well understood by the Clinton Administration, which could have waited until next year to push for a fast-track. But it badly wanted the authority for the president when he goes to Jakarta for the annual meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Council and Miami for the Summit of the Americas. The Apec agenda has grown increasingly ambitious; it could propose negotiations for a regional investment treaty at the very least. In the Americas, there is a free trade deal long promised to Chile to pursue, and the hemispheric economic integration under study. The former executive director of the MTN Coalition, the business group which lobbied for years for passage of the Uruguay Round, Mr Freeman was leery about a fast-track fight this year. 'But when the administration decided to go for fast-track it crossed the Rubicon,' said Mr Freeman. 'There is no backtracking. A defeat means red faces in Jakarta and Miami.' Defeat is still possible. Senate Patrick Moynihian, chairmn of the finance committee, is unenthusiastic at best. Senator John Danforth, the leading Republican, is opposed. Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, just does not like a fast-track request included on a fast-track vote. The AFL-CIO, the umbrella labour group, had been unenthusiastic but quiet about the Uruguay Round, but it is moving into active opposition on fast-track. Mr Freeman is more optimistic about its approval than some trade officials. But, he said, 'it has become a matter of politics rather than trade policy'.</p>

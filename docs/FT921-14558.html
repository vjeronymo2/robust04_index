			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Nedo chief warns on devaluation A SENIOR UK official warned yesterday that a devaluation of sterling would put Britain back in the European Community's 'third division' in terms of inflation and would lead to a further rise in interest rates. Mr Walter Eltis, director-general of the National Economic Development Office, said that reducing sterling's value or trying to force down interest rates would do nothing to alter the underlying challenge facing the UK economy, which was to ensure that industry adopted Japanese-style best practices in management. He told a conference on the economy organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market think tank, that Britain needed another nine-year period of expansion, like the one experienced in the 1980s, which would allow further industrial restructuring. The motor industry had been successfully restructured since the mid-1980s with Japanese capital and working methods, and a new period of sustained expansion could allow other sectors to follow that example. It was more important to create the right conditions for such a sustained expansion than to worry about the timing of the recovery, Mr Eltis said. Other speakers at the conference were more concerned about the weakness of the economy. Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist of Robert Fleming Securities, became the first City economist to fore-cast zero growth this year. He urged the immediate floating of sterling and a cut of 2 percentage points in interest rates to restore activity and stop job losses. Mr Warburton said that uncertainty over the result of the general election was postponing economic decisions. Moreover, the economy was in unknown territory because of the unpredictability of the response of consumers and busines to the accumulation of debt. Mr Giles Keating, chief economist of Credit Suisse First Boston in London, gave a warning that recovery might be hindered by weakness of the banking sector, and urged a substantial cut in bank base rates this year. Mr Keating said political uncertainty was adding to the linked difficulties of the pound and high interest rates. He added that Britain needed an election as soon as possible to overcome the troubles of the economy and the banking sector.</p>

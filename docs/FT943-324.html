			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome hit Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome wilted under waves of selling from institutions after news that the US Food and Drug Administration had issued a written warning to Wellcome about production problems at its US manufacturing plant in Carolina. The news was badly received in the stock market, where Wellcome shares, buoyed recently by persistent talk that the company could be the target of an overseas bid or a merger with one of the UK pharmaceuticals companies, lost 19 at 659p, having fallen to 647p at one point. Turnover in Wellcome was a heavy 7.6m shares, the highest since mid-July.</p>

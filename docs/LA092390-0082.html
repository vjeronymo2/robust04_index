			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER IS NOT CONTENT ON SIDELINE  </P> <P> In the first month of the rest of his life without baseball bossdom, a wounded  George Steinbrenner misses the clubhouse and the "player talk" and is bitter  about the commissioner who took it all away from him.  </P> <P> "My heart was not cut out by this, no way," Steinbrenner said in an interview  with The Associated Press last week in Tampa and aboard his private jet to New  York. "No man, and certainly not Fay Vincent, is ever going to be able to do  that."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Steinbrenner still bristles over Vincent's announcement that the  New York Yankees owner had accepted a lifetime ban from day-to-day management  of the team. He says he did nothing to justify even a suspension and  volunteered to step aside only because Vincent was going to suspend him for two  years regardless.  </P> <P> "There was no ban, no suspension, no probation," Steinbrenner insists. And  while he accepts the consequences, he adds, "I'm not happy with the way the  agreement is turning out."  </P> <P> However it came about, the bottom line is that Friday marks one month since  Steinbrenner resigned as managing partner of the Yankees after baseball's  investigation into his association with a Bronx gambler.  </P> <P> The 60-year-old Steinbrenner, who usually plays his personal feelings close to  the vest, said he has been hurt by the whole experience and is embarrassed,  particularly when people approach him and forlornly ask how he's holding up.  </P> <P> "I was not kicked out of baseball," Steinbrenner states emphatically. He notes  that his family still owns controlling interest in the team and expects  21-year-old son Hal, a senior at Williams College, to follow in his father's  footsteps and run the club.  </P> <P> "I stepped down from the day-to-day operation of the team under an agreement  with the baseball commissioner," Steinbrenner said. "It was not a punishment;  it was an agreement, pure and simple."  </P> <P> Vincent ruled on July 30 that Steinbrenner had violated the rules of baseball  in conducting his own investigation of Dave Winfield, now with the California  Angels, and in paying $40,000 to gambler Howard Spira, a former employee of  Winfield's charitable foundation, to get dirt on the outfielder.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner said he signed the agreement to resign by Aug. 20 because the  suspension Vincent was about to slap on him, while "totally unwarranted,  totally," might have cost him his vice presidency with the U.S. Olympic  Committee.  </P> <P> "Outside of my family," he said, "my involvement in the U.S. Olympics has meant  more to me than anything else. I didn't want to jeopardize that.  </P> <P> "The Olympics thrills me. It makes me proud of America and proud of our young  people. That doesn't mean I'm not proud of our athletes that play major league  baseball, but they have strong agents and an effective union to take care of  them. Our Olympians don't."  </P> <P> The USOC didn't ask him to resign, but he was placed on inactive status.  </P> <P> That says a lot about Steinbrenner's last month.  </P> <P> It has been a month when his beloved Yankees, who already were having their  losingest season since 1912, have been even worse (50-70 before he left, 10-18  since) and he hasn't been able to anything about it, least of all fire or trade  anyone.  </P> <P> It has been a month of watching games on television and perusing the boxscores  but never stepping foot in Yankee Stadium.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner, wearing a World Series championship ring and impeccably dressed  in beige slacks and a pink monogrammed shirt, appeared rested and relaxed as he  sat on a sofa in a suite of his hotel overlooking Tampa Bay, not far from the  offices of his American Shipbuilding Company.  </P> <P> He's been spending a lot of time at his 760-acre Kinsman horse farm in Ocala,  Fla., with his son, Hank, who runs the family's thoroughbred interests.  </P> <P> He says he doesn't miss the spotlight, but does miss being around the  excitement of the game.  </P> <P> "I'd love to be back up at the stadium," he said. "I miss my players, and the  player-talk."  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Steinbrenner can attend Yankee home games but can't sit in  the owner's box or the press box. He hasn't gone to a game since his  resignation and doesn't plan to the rest of the season.  </P> <P> He has returned to New York on other business and said he has been uplifted by  the warm response from some of the fans.  </P> <P> He recalls one trip two weeks ago, while walking down Manhattan's posh Park  Avenue late at night, a patrol car pulled over and began trolling alongside the  curb for several minutes.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner said he asked the officers what they wanted, and they replied: "We  just want to make sure you get home OK, Mr. Steinbrenner."  </P> <P> "Nobody says, 'Get ... out of New York, you no good bum,' but you'd think that  to read the New York papers," Steinbrenner said. "Sure, there are some fans at  the stadium that reporters interview who attack me. But they interview three  guys wearing T-shirts that say 'Kill George.' What do you think they are going  to say about me?"  </P> <P> Steinbrenner prides himself on being tough, but he admits to being offended the  night the fans stood at Yankee Stadium and applauded when they learned he was  out as managing partner.  </P> <P> "Hey, nobody likes getting booed or being torn apart in the New York tabloids,  but I can handle it," he said. "I'm mentally tough. You have to be if you are  going to be anything in sports. I look at it as a moment of great testing."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner found solace during the most turbulent days of his life in the  movie "Hoosiers" about a small Midwestern town high school basketball that  overcame insurmountable odds to win the state championship.  </P> <P> He has watched it more than 40 times, often as he shuttled between Tampa, New  York and Cleveland in the midst of the baseball season.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner closely identifies with the coach, played by Gene Hackman, who  triumphs despite opposition from parents and school officials who want him  fired because of his unorthodoxed methods.  </P> <P> "Here is a guy who had his own way of doing things," Steinbrenner said. "The  guy stuck to his beliefs despite all the criticism and the team ends up  winning. It's my favorite. It makes me feel real good inside."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner certainly had his own way of doing things with the Yankees, and  now that he has had a chance to step back and reflect, he acknowledges some bad  decisions.  </P> <P> "There's plenty of dents in my armour," he said. "I've made a lot of mistakes.  Maybe there were too many managerial changes."  </P> <P> He can't resist justifying them, though, pointing out that five of the 19  changes in 17 years involved the same man -- Billy Martin.  </P> <P> "I loved the guy," Steinbrenner said. "Billy Martin was one of the dearest  friends I ever had, and one of the greatest managers I've ever seen in the  game. ... He had a drinking problem and would self-destruct."  </P> <P> Some might argue that Steinbrenner self-destructed, too, that the feud with  Winfield that was his undoing was part of the constant chaos created by none  other than Steinbrenner, "The Boss" or "Patton in Pinstripes."  </P> <P> "When you win, you're a hero, when you lose, you're a bum," he said, pointing  out that HIS Yankees won two World Series, four American League pennants and  five divisional championships, even if none were after 1981.  </P> <P> He declares that he will never sell the franchise which he purchased in 1973  along with 10 limited partners for $10 million and which now is valued at  better than 20 times that much.  </P> <P> And as he soars toward New York in his eight-passenger jet, always stocked with  peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and his favorite movie videos, he can't help  but raise the idea:  </P> <P> "Maybe I'll look for another team to buy -- a football or basketball team," he  suggests with an angelic grin, "that's if an owner would have me."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Sad For Press Freedom"] </F>   [Text] The resignation of senior news executives and  journalists at ATV [Asia Television Limited] last night has  brought the debate over self-censorship in the Hong Kong media  into sharper focus. The phenomenon has often been discussed but  rarely has there been such clear evidence of it happening.    The self-censorship at the territory's television stations  has now got to the stage where material relating to sensitive  subjects may be cut, even when it appears to reflect the  official Beijing view. ATV's decision not to screen a film in  commemoration of the June 4 massacre is illogical. There is  even less logic in the decision made by ATV as it should know  well that some material in the programme actually purported to  show there were no killings on Tiananmen Square itself.    Self-censorship is not driven by logic. It is driven by  fear. Its proponents are always having to second-guess the  powers they are trying to impress. Braver organisations would  be tempted to push the limits of Beijing's tolerance, attempting  to see how far they can go without provoking an angry reaction.  Paradoxically, silence from Beijing makes the self-censors more  timid. When in doubt, runs their creed, cut it out.    Such timidity will be counterproductive in the end. The  journalists who quit are not the only losers. The Hong Kong  public are also deprived of a programme which after all may not  be as offensive to Beijing leaders, who have occasionally shown  flexibility, as ATV management thinks. The TV stations must  recover their self-respect or they will drag others down with  them. They should have the courage to broadcast sensitive, not  malicious, material. Showing a documentary recording a  historical event would not necessarily mean ATV is anti-Beijing.  By choosing not to screen it, ATV has alienated and  disappointed the public.</p>

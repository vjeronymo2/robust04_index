			<p>BFN     [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani confirmed yesterday that  the negotiations for a free trade agreement between Mexico and  three Central American countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El  Salvador -- have gained "great momentum," particularly in our  nation.    The president said the treaty negotiations with Mexico are  going well: "I believe that the negotiations have advanced  considerably." Cristiani stressed that negotiations for the  trade agreement are not being carried out bilaterally between El  Salvador and Mexico, but also include Guatemala and Honduras.  "There is willingness by the Guatemalan, Honduran, and  Salvadoran Governments to establish the mechanisms to conclude  the treaty with Mexico as soon as possible," he said.    The Salvadoran president explained that the free trade  agreement (FTA) with Mexico is on course, and that proof of this  is the creation of 12 work groups to give simultaneous  consideration to different FTA issues. In addition,  President-elect Armando Calderon Sol announced on Thursday that  the agreement with Mexico would be signed at year's end, a  statement that prompted reactions from the country's business  sector.    For businessman Pablo Tesak, the date given for  implementation of the FTA is "impossible" to meet because  Salvadoran private enterprise must modernize "a lot" to be able  to compete with Mexican industry.    Regarding this issue, President Cristiani said there is no  problem in complying with the date set for the signing of the  trade agreements: "perhaps the difficulty lies in the Salvadoran  businessmen's participation." According to president Cristiani  the businessmen's participation is fundamental to the efficient  operation of a trade agreement of this nature, "because the  businessmen will provide the dynamics needed for the proper  development and operation of the trade agreement." The  president said the role of the government is to create the  operational framework to set up the economic agreement, the rest  is up to the nation's productive sector.    Meanwhile, the Corporation of Exporters of El Salvador  (Coexport) points out in a communique that the conversations on  the possible signing of a trade agreement between Mexico and  Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, "should not be conducted  in haste." Coexport asks the government to be "cautious" during  negotiations for a new trade agreement with Mexico, because the  latter has experience in this area as a result of NAFTA.</p>

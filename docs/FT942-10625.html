			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Brooke delays Channel 5 further The government admitted yesterday that it will be unable to decide this month whether Channel 5 should go ahead. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, had told the Independent Television Commission that he hoped to have a verdict in time for the commission's meeting next Monday. The ITC told the government in February that it wanted to re-advertise the Channel 5 franchise but needed to know whether the frequencies were still available. Ministers will not now be able to take the final decision in time although they will do so 'within weeks', and possibly before the commission's June meeting. The delay has been caused by the time needed to obtain new technical information. NTL, the former transmission and engineering division of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, has been researching the issue for the Radio Communications Agency. It is believed that NTL has advised the government that it is possible, with some compromises, to have the best of both worlds - a conventional analogue television service that can reach nearly 70 per cent of the UK population but does not preclude the possibility of moving to digital television when the market allows. The Radio Communications Agency has first to assess the NTL view before ministers take a decision - although the go-ahead for a conventional Channel 5 now looks more likely. Three groups have been publicly identified as being interested in applying for the new franchise - NBC, the US network company; Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group; and a consortium which brings together Time Warner, one of the world's leading media groups, MAI, the television and financial services company which controls Meridian Broadcasting; and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Meanwhile, the white paper on the future of the BBC has also been delayed until late June at the earliest. The heritage department had only eight 'acceptable' working days between the local government elections and the European elections to publish the white paper. The convention is that government policy statements do not come out in the middle of election campaigns. It had been hoped that it would would be published in mid-May, but there are still details to be finalised. However, there is no question of any change to the basic structure or financing of the BBC.</p>

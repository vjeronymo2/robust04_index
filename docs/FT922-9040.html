			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Back to the classics - Radio THE CLASSIC Serials on Radio 4, on Saturday evening, repeated on Friday afternoons, are the very thing for those who know the names of all the great English novels but either read them too long since or have not read them at all. I don't know when I read Smollett's The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, but it is so full of incident I certainly could not remember half of it. Scott Cherry's adaptation, extracting the events from the letters Smollett presents them in, is packed with amusing narrative detail. The first instalment on Saturday mostly covered Matthew Bramble's journey from Brambleton to Bristol, Bramble being the splendid Timothy West. In his party are his sister Tabitha, his nephew Jery, his niece Lydia, his doctor, Lewis, the servant Winifred. Love is frustrated whenever it appears - Tabitha's for Lewis, Lydia's for the actor Wilson, whom Jery challenges to a duel but succeeds only in killing a cow. Transient affairs like Jervis's death after climbing a staircase to deliver a letter are done as importantly as the major things. And Humphry Clinker? He is the ragged postilion the party meets on its arrival in Bath at the very end of this first hour, in which there wasn't a dull moment. Clive Brill was the director. Radio 3's Drama Now on Tuesday, The Cello and the Nightingale, was less a drama than a dramatic imitation of a feature. Patricia Cleveland-Peck wrote it to mark the centenary of cellist Beatrice Harrison, and to recall her fascinating achievement in making the BBC broadcast the nightingales singing in her Surrey garden while she played the cello. She had trouble in getting the Company (as it was then) to try anything so improbable, even with sundry telephone calls direct to Mr Reith. When at last all was agreed, the necessary kit spread all over the garden, a mike next to the nightingales' nest, she also had trouble in getting the birds to sing. She sat playing favourite items for a couple of hours - then, just as the BBC was ready to pack up, they began. The broadcast was a tremendous success, and was done again every year for 12 years. Ms Cleveland-Peck had her troubles too, for the truth is that, for those of us not involved, that evening was tedious. Reminiscences of Beatrice Harrison's life, soliloquies of her thoughts as she played, touches of 1924 wireless, did not make it seem less so. Diana Quick was charming as Miss Harrison, and Julian Lloyd Webber played Elgar, Delius, Dvorak and the Londonderry Air. What would Smollett have made of Radio 5's Open Mike on Monday, a six-part piece by Shaun Prendergast about life in a local independent radio station, Valley Sound? I reckon anyone as good on significant detail as Smollett would certainly have cared about such things. Mike (Gary Love) is the undisciplined guy who thinks the material they put out must attract attention even if it's risky. He has got one of the girl reporters pregnant and is virtually under three weeks' notice (though not for that). I could not follow everything, because the voices (young, eager) are so much alike; and at least so far there seems too little discipline in the station. But I'll be back. I heard the second of Radio 1's current social programmes, Tell it like it is, to learn what new problem would be exhibited. There was miserable talk of jealousy, poverty, bullying and sexual abuse, particularly of girls by their mothers - not a common subject of discussion. How typical can all this be of our society? And how are such wretched people persuaded to talk, not to Samaritans, but to recording engineers condensing their wretchedness for, as we must concur, public benefit?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 13 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Mongolia is  the fifth Asian country joined the convention on the rights of  children, said today the head of the National Children's Centre  N. Bolormaa at the press conference. Speaking with Mongolian  and foreign newsmen she said about the measures supposed to be  done within the framework of the national programme for  development of children in Mongolia up to 2000. The national  programme was endorsed by the Government of Mongolia on May last  year.    According to Bolormaa, are being improved the conditions for  getting education by children, developing their gifts. Although  the children's problem remains to be actual one for today.  [sentence as received]    The right of children for education is being exercised  insufficiently. From year to year the number of children  quitting their lessons for financial or other reasons is  growing. In accordance with the 1993's data, more than 100  thousand children of school age are out of school. A high  mortality rate for newborns and small children yet remains to be  recorded. On the scale of the country there are some 924.8  thousand children orphans. The number of homeless children is  ever growing.    There appeared quite a new notion of street children which  up  to recently was not available in the lexicology of Mongolians.  All this, according to Bolormaa, dictates the necessity for  unifying efforts of people for settling down the key children's  problem under the conditions of the transition to a market  economy.</p>

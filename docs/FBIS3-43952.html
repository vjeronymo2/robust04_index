			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], says his forces will continue to be  confined in assembly points despite the slow pace at which  government troops are proceeding to their areas.    [Begin Dhlakama recording] The situation is bothersome  because both sides are obliged to implement the General Peace  Accord. Actually, I am disappointed with the situation. Yet, I  am not prepared to cancel the confinement of troops because that  would be helping the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] to  continue making mistakes.    Earlier we said that if by 22 January Frelimo does not give  any explanation we would look into the situation. Right now I  am being pressured by our generals in the bush. They want to  know why Frelimo is not confining its forces. I cannot give our  generals a reason because I do not belong to Frelimo. So, the  confinement will continue. We will not stop the confinement  process. Right now we are working with the international  community to see if it can pressure the Frelimo government. I  am waiting for President Chissano to return to Maputo from his  vacation to explain to me the situation in his capacity as  commander in chief of the Frelimo army and head of state.  Likewise, Defense Minister Chipande, Chief of General Staff  Hama Thai, and Army Commander Tobias Dai should also explain why  they are not sending their troops to the assembly points.

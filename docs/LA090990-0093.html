			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BLACK MARKETS THRIVE AS EAST BLOC ECONOMIES EVOLVE;  </P> <P> EUROPE: WEAK LOCAL CURRENCIES AND PERSISTENT SHORTAGES OF FOOD AND CONSUMER  GOODS MAKE ILLEGAL TRADING A SORT OF TEMPORARY LIFELINE.  </P> <P> On a drab Bucharest street, an 8-year-old boy hawks beer for twice the price it  was intended to sell for in the empty shop it failed to reach. Nearby, his  father buys dollars from tourists at an inflated exchange rate.  </P> <P> From a car in Sofia's bitpazar market, a dealer sells sugar and soap powder,  which have long vanished from the dreary stores of the Bulgarian capital, where  they once cost a third of today's price.  </P> <P> In Budapest, visitors from all over Eastern Europe hawk consumer goods that are  either unavailable or too expensive in Hungarian stores. Poles, Russians and  Vietnamese are changing money on the streets of Prague.  </P> <P> The dark days of communism may have passed and Eastern Europe may be moving  toward capitalism, but black markets are thriving in the region as its people  struggle with weak local currencies and shortages of food and consumer goods  during the painful transition to a market economy.  </P> <P> Poland and Yugoslavia, which have opted for economic shock therapy, have  virtually wiped out their once-rampant currency black markets in a single  stroke through reforms that made their currencies convertible.  </P> <P> However, while the new democratic governments of Czechoslovakia and Hungary  have a clear commitment to the market, shortages persist and the black market  economy could remain a lifeline for their citizens until the new system is  firmly in place.  </P> <P> Romania and Bulgaria, ruled by former communists, have an ambivalent attitude  toward market economy. As they hesitate to dismantle inefficient state sectors,  black market activity is running wild and the governments seem at a loss in  coping with it.  </P> <P> "I'm really glad the Socialist (formerly Communist) Party won the Bulgarian  elections," said Todor, a black market dealer in Sofia's bitpazar, a bazaar  where everything from baby food to car parts changes hands at inflated prices.  </P> <P> "This is the only system under which my business could survive. Soaring  inflation, empty shops and hungry people are the best possible conditions for  my business," he said.  </P> <P> Bulgaria is bringing back rationing in response to dire shortages of essentials  such as sugar, cooking oil and detergent. "These things are the real currency  in Bulgaria," said the black marketeer. "Without them you are a poor man."  </P> <P> Despite recent crackdowns by Romanian police, similar markets have sprouted  along the streets, providing clothes, food, electronic goods and other luxuries  brought in from abroad or illegally diverted from Romanian factories.  </P> <P> The police arrested 1,500 black marketeers last month, but the trade continues  to grow, and the government is drafting new laws to regulate it, ranging from  the mundane to the bizarre.  </P> <P> Romanian customs recently seized 100 pounds of mercury from Romanian travelers  crossing into Turkey.  </P> <P> The valuable mercury could have been sold for a handsome sum in Istanbul, where  the travelers could have bought jeans, cigarettes and cosmetics -- prized  products in short supply back home.  </P> <P> Long lines of cars form in Romanian towns to buy gasoline. Line-jumpers  discreetly hand the pump attendant a couple of packets of Kent cigarettes,  Romania's stablest currency, and, as if by magic, their tank is filled.  </P> <P> Bulgarians hop across the border into Yugoslavia to top off their tanks because  fuel is often virtually impossible to buy at home.  </P> <P> Tourists get seven Bulgarian leva for one U.S. dollar at official exchange  offices, while on the street they can get 11 leva.  </P> <P> The dollar officially fetches 20 Romanian lei, but the black marketeers give up  to 140 lei per dollar.  </P> <P> Romanians line up outside travel agents and banks for the $75 worth of hard  currency they are allowed once in two years for traveling abroad. Many of them  immediately change it into lei on the black market.  </P> <P> The currency weakness in both countries gives racketeers a field day, enabling  them to grow rich overnight.  </P> <P> One returned Romanian emigrant, using lei obtained at the black market rate,  bought tons of furniture cheaply, shipped it to Sweden for sale and became an  instant millionaire.  </P> <P> In Czechoslovakia, the black market turns over an estimated $200-million worth  of hard currency per year, more than the country's income from organized  tourism.  </P> <P> But the exchange rate difference has steadily narrowed, and the government has  introduced currency auctions as a first step toward creating a regular foreign  exchange market.  </P> <P> Demand for hard currency is high among Czechoslovaks, who are officially  allowed only 100 West German marks (about $65) per year for travel abroad.  </P></p>

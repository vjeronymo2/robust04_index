			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (2): Seeking undiscounted recovery - This year's equity performance in the main markets At the turn of the year, opinion on the main stock markets was almost unanimous: Europe was the place to be and France was the market most likely to perform. Interest rate cuts had powered US equities in 1991 and UK shares in 1992, and so (the reasoning ran) falling rates would do the same for continental stock markets in 1993. France was favoured because it had come further through its recession than Germany. French interest rates would fall rapidly, either because the Bundesbank would cut rates or because France would leave the ERM. Once the rates fell, France was the European economy best placed to grow. Events, of course, did not quite pan out that way. De facto, France has left the old ERM - but has continued to peg its monetary policy to Germany. As a result its recession has intensified. Small wonder, then, that Paris has not fulfilled the best hopes of the bulls. The CAC-40 index is up by 13 per cent, only slightly more than the 12 per cent gain for the FT-A All-Share index. More surprising, perhaps, is the performance of the market no one liked in January: the economic news from Germany has worsened over the year, yet the DAX index is up by almost a third. Liquidity - particularly American liquidity - is the driving force behind the rally. Low deposit rates and falling US bond yields have tempted investors into equities. Mutual fund receipts are running at record levels, with some Dollars 60bn a quarter flowing in. Yet despite hitting new highs, Wall Street has proved a dull performer and the S&amp;P composite index has only risen by 7 per cent this year. So about half of that money has flowed into markets where recovery prospects are not so heavily discounted. There has been heavy US buying of UK gilts, French OATs and, particularly, German bunds. Equities - their yields looking cheap by comparison - have followed. Even more spectacular have been the gains in those Pacific Rim markets which benefit from booming regional economies and trade with China. Hong Kong equities are up by three-quarters, largely on the strength of US buying. The only market to fare poorly in the region has been Japan, which is up 1 per cent on the year thus far. It is saddled with deflationary forces, political instability and a rising yen; its problems will take years rather than months to resolve. The government's inability to agree a fiscal stimulus for the economy is further damaging shares. The main worry now for most equity markets is the degree to which such a liquidity-driven boom can be sustained. 'By the conventional measures of earnings ratios or absolute yields, shares look expensive. In our model portfolio we have gone underweight in equities.' says David Roche of Morgan Stanley. Yet because the rally was led by a lowering of bond yields and reduced inflationary expectations, the ratio of bond to equity yields still shows most stock markets to be relatively cheap. Such yield ratios should be treated with some caution since they only give strongly reliable signals near extremes. But they do at least offer some comfort that equity valuations can hold so long as bond markets do not suffer. Andrew Bell of BZW says that slow growth rather than renewed inflation is the greater threat. Markets may thus be able to hold on to the gains of the last year. Even if inflation ticks up slightly in the US and the UK during 1994, real bond yields are still satisfactory by long run historical standards. Most countries still have substantial unemployment and output gaps, subduing inflation. Commodity prices also remain depressed. More alarming is the prospect that growth will be too slow for companies to generate significant earnings increases. P/e ratios are high in all the important markets - and astronomical in many emerging ones. Many industrial managers continue to make exceptional provisions against further rationalisation, and trading statements are often downbeat. Companies are also backing words with deeds. Rights issues are running at record levels in the UK and the new issue market is buoyant. Initial and secondary public offerings in the US are also running at high levels as the de-gearing of balance sheets continues. Companies are increasingly choosing to demerge or float off subsidiaries rather than make trade sales. The market is valuing prospects much more highly than most company directors. If these managers are right and earnings prospects are poor, then a correction may set in. Set against that is the weight of money. Unlike some previous booms which relied on margin trading and borrowed funds, much of the cash coming into shares is as a direct transfer of assets from deposits to equities. That should help prevent panic selling, but it does raise the question of whether investors sufficiently appreciate the risks they run. A 3.5 per cent yield on equities may have more appeal than a 2 per cent return on cash while markets are rising, but when shares start to fall minds may change quickly. The other risk is that US short term interest rates may start to rise, not because of renewed inflation, but because competition for capital will increase if the recovery gathers pace. David Roche of Morgan Stanley thinks that the US economy may expand by almost 4 per cent next year, and with savings low, funds for investment may be low. If that happens the flow of US money out of international equities would be hard to replace. Ironically, given how unpopular it was earlier this year, Germany may be the market best able to cope. Bond yields in that country may have further to fall, and the extensive retrenchment programme needed may make its capital goods exports industries competitive. The UK and US markets may also be relatively successful, if modest performers, next year. But the seemingly intractable problems of Japan, and the slow recovery in the continental economy, will make it hard for equities to make substantial gains in those markets. Overall, equities are caught between the risk of slow worldwide growth producing disappointing earnings, and stronger US growth sucking funds back into America. The difficulty for investors now is in deciding how far they dare ride the liquidity wave before it hits the beach.  ------------------------------------------------ EQUITY FUND MANAGEMENT TOP GLOBAL CENTRES  ------------------------------------------------ End 1992                         Dollars bn  ------------------------------------------------ Tokyo                                  1367 New York                                584 London                                  533 Zurich                                  333 Boston                                  269 Geneva                                  211 Paris                                   189 San Francisco                           171 Frankfurt                               152 Los Angeles                             141 Philadelphia                            110 Chicago                                 102 Toronto                                  96 Edinburgh                                88 Hartford Ct                              77 Hong Kong                                67 Houston                                  55 Basle                                    49 Montreal                                 47 Atlanta                                  47  ------------------------------------------------ Source: Technimetrics  ------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MANAGEMENT CENTRES (RANKED BY HOLDINGS OF US EQUITIES)  --------------------------------------------------------                                       Dollars bn  -------------------------------------------------------- London                                      50.2 Zurich                                      49.9 Geneva                                      31.7 Paris                                       19.1 Frankfurt                                   11.7 Basle                                       11.6 Edinburgh                                    9.4 Munich                                       7.9 Milan                                        4.7 Lugano                                       4.3  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: Technimetrics  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

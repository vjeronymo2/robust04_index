			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Arts: Two CP Taylor plays - Edinburgh International Festival WHAT kind of playwright was CP Taylor? One who required excellent and sympathetic direction and performances, it would appear from this Edinburgh Festival. Without those, little of his work is standing the test of time. This second week of the festival has produced two more of Taylor's plays. Though both are more absorbing than either The Ballachulish Beat or Walter last week, they are heightening the impression that, in terms of craftsmanship, exposition and characterisation, Taylor was a likeable, humane, satirical but inadequate dramatist. Operation Elvis, in morning or afternoon performances at the Corn Exchange, is an example of Taylor's work for children. Because it is also about children, it becomes watchable for adults too. 10-year-old Malcolm, the child of a selfish and silly mother whose mind is solely on the men in her life, insists that he is Elvis Presley; sings his songs, wears his jacket. When, however, Malcolm meets and strikes up a friendship with Michelle, who has cerebral palsy, he becomes so absorbed in helping her that he forgets all about his Elvis obsession. The play itself is thin, schematic and sentimental, and its final line - 'I'm Malcolm] I'm Malcolm]' - is crude. Yet for much of its duration you are held, thanks to first-rate performances by Andy Milarvie and Annalu Waller (Michelle), both making their professional debuts. Milarvie gives Malcolm energy, ingenuous charm and openness; Waller's squawks, flops and heaves all convey perfectly the eloquence that only Malcolm perceives. The Black and White Minstrels (premiered in 1972 at the Traverse) is much funnier than this under-cast King's Head Theatre production demonstrates, yet has its flaws too. Half its comedy depends on the way its characters do not converse so much as conduct separate monologues that only occasionally interleave. One woman talks of which man she wants to go to bed with that night, one man talks of his problems with prose creativity and another man yells about the other man's political incorrectness. This is not so amusing when it happens in every scene, and it is less amusing when you have just seen it in several other CP Taylor plays. Still, the idea of The Black and White Minstrels is a hoot. Cyril, a leftwing, politically correct writer, and his wife Gil are involved in a wife-swapping quartet each weekend with Harry and Pat. Cyril, however, is distracted by the pressures of this set-up, by financial problems, and by his guilty suspicion that his hostile Nigerian lodger is exerting voodoo spells to bung up his creative flow. Pat and Harry are not only rabidly leftwing, randy, and selfish but also inanely blind to these traits in themselves. The situation is worthy of Malcolm Bradbury or David Lodge. The play wins laughs but not guffaws. The role of Gil is ungratefully written. Several farce moments are mistimed. The four lead characters are so cast that you do not realise Cyril and Pat are meant to be the two best-looking until the lines say so. Only Jason Isaacs, as Cyril, has the skill and pacing to create a character at once convincing and yet absurd. The Black and White Minstrels continues at the Church Hill Theatre until August 29; Operation Elvis at the Corn Exchange until August 27</p>

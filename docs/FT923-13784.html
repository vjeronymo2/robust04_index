			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: OMV expects to end year in profit OMV, the Austrian oil group which the government is planning to merge with the Verbundgesellschaft utility, expects to make a positive operating profit this year. The company said it would make operating losses of around Sch500m (Dollars 47.2m) for the first half of 1992 but would end the year with a significantly positive result. Wolfgang Ruttensdorfer, finance director, said the final figures for the half-year were not yet available but he expected OMV's second-quarter performance to match the first when an operating loss of Sc247m was incurred. Richard Schenz, who has just replaced outgoing OMV chairman Siegfried Meysel as interim company chairman, said he expected the company's performance to improve in the second half. Mr Schenz said a two-pronged cost-cutting programme attacking unnecessary investment and personal costs was under discussion by the company's supervisory board. The company still plans to undertake a Sch6bn investment programme this year, to be mainly financed from cash-flow, Mr Ruttensdorfer said. The company's energy operations, suffering from bad oil refining profit margins, had poor results in April and May. But there was a significant improvement in profitability in OMV's energy operations in June. Results at OMV's petrochemicals and chemicals areas remained 'unchanged and negative', Mr Ruttensdorfer said. Plans to merge OMV with Verbund are part of the process of reorganising Austria's state-owned industrial companies. If it goes ahead, the deal would create an energy group with a turnover in excess of Sch85bn.</p>

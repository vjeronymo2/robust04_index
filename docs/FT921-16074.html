			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US importers in plea to escape China 'hit-list' US companies and trade industry groups handling Chinese imports yesterday urged Washington to exempt them from the punitive duties it proposes on any such items. 'Penalising Tsingtao beer would be fatal to Monarch,' Mr Glen Steinman, president of Monarch Import Company, founded in 1978 to import the beer, said in a grim Congressional hearing. The company has invested Dollars 25m (Pounds 13.7m) in the product, which would be lost if Tsingtao were chosen to be a casualty of the US-Chinese eight-month dispute over intellectual property rights. In Beijing, vice-foreign trade minister Wu Yi said talks on protecting US copyrights, trademarks and patents could succeed if the US showed more flexibility. Wu Yi is China's chief negotiator at the talks. In seeming reaction to US pressure, China has begun publishing some foreign trade rules. Wu Yi and assistant US trade representative Joseph Massey are shortly to meet in Washington, in one last attempt to reach agreement before January 16, the 'firm deadline' set by Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative. Without agreement, 'the US Customs Service will implement any decision to collect increased tariffs very shortly after that date,' Mrs Hills said. The US complains about China's copyright law, mainly its poor protection for computer programmes and sound recordings, and failure to safeguard copyright for US works first published elsewhere. The row yesterday focused on the impact of retaliation on US companies and the US economy. A 'hit-list' of imports worth Dollars 1.5bn has been selected, to be at least halved if final sanctions are imposed. Trade officials have said they will try to focus retaliation on China's state-run factories. Mr Steinman stressed that Qingdao Brewery, producer of Tsingtao beer, is owned by the city of Qingdao, which has been seeking improved intellectual property rights protection. Other targets may include leather goods, textiles, watches, apparel, electronics and bauxite. Mr J Sy Hoying, president of the North American Processing Company, said his small business would be crushed if aluminium tariffs were imposed. The company, which began selling Chinese bauxite products in 1990, employs 25 workers in West Virginia in an area 'devastated' by unemployment.</p>

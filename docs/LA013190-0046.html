			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEFT, RIGHT  </P> <P> Why is it necessary for presumably objective journalists to characterize  Nicaragua as "leftist" when noting that Nicaragua opposed the invasion of  Panama by rightist United States military aggressors ("World Reaction to  Noriega's Arrest," Jan. 5)? Centrist Spain, left-centrist Mexico and the  leftist Soviet Union also opposed the intervention, but their political  persuasions were not worthy of comment. Your staff even failed to observe the  "rightishness" of Britain, Japan and Thailand.  </P> <P> SPENCE CARLSEN  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Shots fired at policeman after City bank raid ARMED bank robbers yesterday opened fire on a police officer during a chase in the City of London. It happened after two men armed with handguns escaped with a small amount of cash from the Royal Bank of Scotland in Great Tower Street, near the Tower of London, late yesterday morning. A passing police motor-cyclist saw the robbers and chased them to Southwark Bridge, where they stopped their car and opened fire. The car moved on before stopping halfway across the bridge where the gunmen fired more shots. The raiders' white Vauxhall Astra car, driven by a third man, was later found abandoned near Hays Galleria at London Bridge. Southwark Bridge was closed to traffic briefly while police officers searched the area for spent cartridges. City of London police said the unarmed PC, who was not named, was 'shaken up' but uninjured. They added that the British Bankers' Association had put up a Pounds 15,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the gang. They appealed for witnesses to the incident to contact Bishopsgate CID on 071-601 2670.</p>

It is one of the two steam  generators that will replace those in the Kyushu Electric Power  Co.'s Genkai nuclear power plant (Shige Ono, company president),  the construction work for which is to start in May 1994.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industry entered into the final stage of the  production of the steam generator at its Kobe shipyard.    This steam generator, called the "52F model," is the newest  type of steam generator. It is 21 meters high and is made of an  alloy of nickel, chrome, and iron. The ratio of chrome is higher  than in conventional types of steam generators, so it will  resist corrosion better. In addition, the steam generator has  three fittings, instead of the usual two, to hold down the  vibration of the 3,000 and some heat-exchange pipes that shake  because of the energy when steam and water rise in the  generator, and the materials of the fittings were changed to  increase safety.    The steam generator of the Genkai No. 1 plant will be  replaced this time because damage in the heat-exchange pipes  continues to occur. A training center was set up in the Kobe  shipyard in April so that the steam generator replacement work  will be done safely. Although most of the actual work will be  done outside by remote operation, the replacement of the steam  generator is being rehearsed over and over because the steam  generator replacement work that will start in December, 1993, at  the Kansai Electric Power Co.'s Mihama No. 1 plant will be the  first such replacement in Japan.</p>

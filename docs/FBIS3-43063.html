Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection of the RF  as No 37-2-7/435, dated 25 May 1993, and by Ye. N. Belyayev,  chairman of the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological  Oversight as No 01-19/22-22, dated 25 May 1993; registered with  the RF Ministry of Justice, registry No 279, on 18 July 1993]    [Text]  <H5>  1. General Statutes </H5>   1.1. These instructions were prepared to implement Decree No  869 of the Russian Federation, dated 12 November 1992, ``On  State Registration of Potentially Hazardous Chemical and  Biological Substances'' and in accordance with the Statute on  State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and  biological substances, which was adopted in the said Decree.    1.2. State registration of potentially hazardous chemical  and biological substances (hereafter referred to as State  registration) is performed to implement the requirements in  articles 12, 13, and 14 of the Russian Federation Law on  Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare of the Public, and articles  51 items 2 and 3 of the Russian Federation Law ``On  Environmental Protection.''    1.3. State registration is implemented in a Russian Register  of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances  (hereafter referred to as Register) for detection, accumulation  of physicochemical, toxicological, eco-toxicological and other  information, record-keeping and regulation of said substances in  order to prevent their deleterious effects on human health and  the environment.    1.4. An individual naturally occurring or synthetic  substance  (compound) that can have a deleterious effect on human health  and the environment, when produced, used, transported,  processed, as well as in household use, is considered a  potentially hazardous chemical and/or biological substance.    1.5. All individual chemical and biological substances  (compounds), including those contained in mixtures, produced  and/or used on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well  as imported substances, are subject to State registration.    Substances containing impurities formed in the production  process or when used are registered as individual substances.    1.6. Compound commercial chemicals, which must undergo  hygienic certification in accordance with Decree No 1, dated 5  January 1993, of the Goskomsanepidnadzor [Russian State  committee for sanitary and epidemiological oversight], are not  subject to State registration.    1.7. The procedure for State registration established in  these Instructions does not extend to chemical and biological  agents used to protect plants, farm crop and tree plantation  growth regulators, pharmaceutical preparations, as well as  radioactive substances, which are recorded or registered  following previously established procedure by pertinent  organizations.    1.8. Chemical and biological substances intended for  production and use after 31 March 1993 (``new substances'') are  subject to registration prior to production and use.    Substances produced, used and processed on the territory of  the Russian Federation, as well as imported, prior to 31 March  1993 (``old substances''), are subject to mandatory State  registration within three years from the time of publication of  these instructions. Specific registration dates must be  coordinated with agencies of State sanitary oversight before 1  July 1993.  <H5>  2. Procedure for State Registration </H5>   2.1. Chemical and biological substances (compounds) are  registered when submitted by ministries, agencies, enterprises,  organizations, institutions, other juridical entities, as well  as individuals responsible for production and import of a given  substance (compound), regardless of forms of ownership.    2.2. The registration process includes receiving  applications, examining them and making the decision to  register, and issuing a registration certificate.    2.3. The ``List of information needed for State registration  of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,''  which is filled out by the applicant who is responsible for  accuracy of furnished data, is the basis for registration.    2.4. Substances for which complete information could not be  submitted at the time of registration, but the properties and  area of application of which warrant belief that its hazard to  man and the environment is immaterial, are subject to  registration for a term of 3 years with assignment of a State  registration number and issuance of registration certificated  with annotation of the 3-year validity. Fullness (or lack of  necessity to submit data for some parameter or other) of  submitted information is determined in each specific instance by  the Register in accordance with existing standard-setting and  methodological documentation.    If an applicant does not submit the necessary information  within 3 years, as stipulated in the certificate, the  registration certificate is no longer valid.    2.5. In the Register, there is a permanent group of experts,  which is confirmed following established procedure, representing  institutions of the Goskomsanepidnadzor of the Russian Ministry  of Environmental Protection examines the most difficult cases  related to making decisions on State registration of potentially  hazardous chemical and biological substances.    2.6. Assignment to a chemical and biological substance of a  State registration number and issuance of a registration  certificate confirm the adequacy and quality of ecotoxicological  and other parameters, and serve as grounds to enter them in  standards and specifications documentation (NTD, such as GOST,  TU and others) in the sections ``Safety requirements'' and  ``Environmental protection.''    2.7. The finding as to conformity of specific production and  use conditions for a substance with a State registration number  to environmental protective and sanitary rules, adequacy of  methods of assaying substances and conformity to NTD (GOST, TU,  and others), as well as hygienic certification, are implemented  by agencies of State sanitary and epidemiological oversight and  Ministry Environmental Protection of the Russian Federation in  accordance with sanitary and environment protective legislation.    2.8. Assignment of a State registration number and issuance  of registration certificate are implemented on the basis of the  expert finding of the Register's specialists and its approval by  the director of the Register.    2.9. When registering a substance, the applicant remits  payment in advance to the Register in accordance with the  Statute approved by Decree No 552 of the Russian Federation  Government dated 5 Aug 92, as well as for upgrading performance  and material-technical support of the system of State  registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological  substances.    2.10. Applications for State registration are addressed in  the name of the Register's director at 101479 Moscow, Vadkovskiy  Lane, 18-20.    2.11. Documentation for registration must include:    2.11.1. a referral (cover letter) signed by an enterprise  administrator or individual entrepreneur;    2.11.2. filled out ``List of information needed for State  registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological  substances'' (Appendix 1);    2.11.3. materials, on the basis which the ``List of  information....'' was filled out;    2.11.4. payment authorization to pay for the registration  fee;    2.11.5. official conclusion of the applicant as to possible  publication of State registration materials in the free press.    2.12. Registration materials are to be examined within 30  days. After assignment of a registration number, the Register  issues a certificate of State registration of the established  specimen (Appendix 2) and information form (Appendix 3) to the  applicant, and publishes information about registration in the  Register's information bulletin.    2.13. Validity of a registration certificate can be  suspended by the Register if new data are received concerning  previously unknown hazardous properties of a substance. The  Register notifies the applicant of suspension of the  registration certificate and/or ban on the substance within 10  days of making this decision, and publishes this information in  the Register's information bulletin.    2.14. The Register guarantees confidentiality of information  about a substance that is an industrial secret unless it poses a  threat to humanhealth and environmental safety.    2.15. The Register may, under specific conditions,  rightfully refuse to issue a registration certificate.    2.16. An appeal of the Register's decision must be filed, no  later than 30 days after it is made, with the chairman of the  Russian Goskomsanepidnadzor. The appeal is examined within 30  days. The decision of the chairman of the Russian  Goskomsanepidnadzor may be appealed in Arbitration Court.    2.17. Enterprises and other business entities, regardless of  the agency to which they pertain and form of ownership,  organizations and institutions situated on the territory of the  Russian Federation, individuals carrying out development,  production and use, export and import of potentially hazardous  chemical and biological substances bear responsibility in  accordance with the ``Statute on State registration of  potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,''  approved by Decree No 869 of the Russian Federation Government  dated 12 November 1992.

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Management: Sleazy relationships in the office Does the appointment, from outside and at the same time, of a husband and wife to an organisation constitute sleaze at work, or simply a fairly negotiated package deal? In the university world it is very widespread, but because females keep their maiden name it is difficult to detect. Some organisations frown upon the process, believing that nearly always one of the pair is a freeloader often appointed to a position or role less for ability, effort or motivation, more because of a relationship by blood or marriage. A sort of 'job for the relatives' idea we used to dismiss as unacceptable nepotism. Others have come up with a rather grandiose theory based on the biological idea of assortive mating. This argues that in general tall people marry tall people; the bright seek out the bright; the sociable each other - so that couples are frequently similar one-to-another. A wonderful study done years ago showed people with the name of Schneider (or Taylor), that is people who took their name from their job and were required to be nimble of finger but not large of stature, were in fact shorter than those called Schmidt (Smith) who being blacksmiths needed to be big and strong. Hence, appointing two spouses of near equal merit is hardly corrupt but a double bonus for the organisation. If this theory were true, though, wouldn't one find lonely-hearts columns involved in mate selection mentioning such things as consciousness, computer-literacy and managerial competence? Ever seen; 'Male with strategic perspective, decisional flair and organisational ability seeks prioritising female to implement proactive visioning'? Most interviewers have favourite questions which they believe reveal the most about their interviewees. They acquire these from a range of different sources. Some may have been asked a question themselves in the past and, having then struggled with the answer, now think others might do likewise. Some people may have heard other interviewers pose a question, been suitably impressed and so plagiarised it. Others have purchased those 'self help' type paperbacks, titled items such as One Hundred Tough Interview Questions. A high-yield question is one that, quite literally, provides maximal amounts of salient information. There is one question which I find most effective and I have a pet theory about its high yield. The question is pretty simple. 'What is your favourite compliment?' I believe this question taps into two things simultaneously: values and insecurities. Almost by definition a good compliment is one which appeals to one's values and priorities, and that makes it interesting in its own right. Second, compliments often pick up insecurities. Beautiful women aren't interested in compliments about their appearance, rich men are bored by comments on their wealth. They both seek other accolades. Many beautiful women attempt to write and would like to be thought of as intelligent, sensitive and articulate (as well as beautiful). Intelligent people often want to be witty, physically strong people, caring. A favourite compliment reveals what one values and also what one is not quite certain about. To learn that from one question can't be bad. One of our technicians died very suddenly just under 10 years ago. He was a computer enthusiast and a hungry consumer of catalogues, brochures and magazines dedicated to the field. Of course his post kept coming from eager manufacturers and publishing houses. And it still does. In the past month he has received well over a dozen letters. Were these being simply thrown away or were they being happily consumed by someone else? Was it in fact convenient not to stop them or is it simply a nuisance that nobody has taken the responsibility for? I decided to investigate. I found that because identical catalogues and magazines went to other technicians, the late, departed colleague's mail was simply dumped. Some publishers were told there was no point continuing, but they did. How long, I wonder, will this persist and what does it tell us about the business? What determines when a name is taken off the file? I presume, perhaps naively, that someone, somewhere, updates, checks, verifies and even monitors a mailing list. But perhaps mailing lists are sold on without ever being 'cleaned-up', as the computer jargon might have it. It may be that because the hit rate for this sort of selling is so poor (maybe 2 per cent of readers respond) it does not really pay to spend time and effort checking out the corporeal status of those on the list. It may not be a way to eternity, but getting on these junkmail lists may certainly keep one's memory alive. The author is head of the business psychology unit at University College London.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA LIFTS TRAILER PARK FEE FREEZE  </P> <P> Six months after freezing rents at the city's three mobile home parks, the City  Council voted Tuesday to lift the moratorium. As a result, residents of Laguna  Beach's three mobile home parks face rent increases as soon as today.  </P> <P> Worried residents who packed the council chambers expressed disappointment with  the council's 3-0 vote. Council members Robert F. Gentry and Martha Collison  were absent.  </P> <P> "The city didn't do one thing for the residents of Thurston Trailer Park," said  Sam Alessi, president of the homeowners association at the park. "We would have  had that type of increase with their input or not."  </P> <P> The vote followed a month of talks between city staff members and park owners,  during which the city tried unsuccessfully to negotiate three agreements to  regulate increases and offer relief to low-income senior citizens living in the  parks.  </P> <P> Last month, the council endorsed a proposal from the owners of Treasure Island  Trailer Park to allow a 7% rent increase for one year while freezing rents for  low-income senior citizens. At the same time, the council extended until  Tuesday a moratorium that has been in effect since December to allow city staff  members time to seek a consensus with owners of the other two parks.  </P> <P> The Thurston owner agreed to accept a 6% increase but would not exempt senior  citizens from the boost. The owner of Laguna Terrace Mobile Home Park agreed to  rent increases of slightly more than 7% but would not commit to an agreement to  exempt seniors, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said.  </P> <P> Treasure Island residents were notified that if the moratorium was not  extended, they could expect a 7% rent increase starting today. Thurston is  expected to impose a rent increase in August, Frank said, but there is no word  about whether Laguna Terrace plans to raise rents soon.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the City Council followed Frank's recommendation by approving the  agreements with Treasure Island and Thurston and directed the city to negotiate  with Laguna Terrace. Council members reserved the right to take further action  on behalf of Laguna Terrace residents if an agreement is not reached within two  weeks.  </P> <P> The moratorium was imposed as a result of the dispute between the residents and  owners of Treasure Island, the largest park in the city. The 27-acre,  oceanfront park was bought for $40 million in August by Merrill Lynch Hubbard  and Costa Mesa businessman Richard Hall, who expect eventually to close the  park to make way for other development.  </P></p>

Lambeck report: "A German Is To Administer </F> Mostar"]    [Text] Bonn -- After a solid peace agreement for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the FRG Government is planning to help  rebuild and administer the city of Mostar. Bonn government  circles confirmed such intentions to DIE WELT. Hans Koschnick,  former Bremen mayor and Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  politician, is to manage the reconstruction of Mostar on behalf  of the European Union [EU]. He is to take over the office of  administrator for the capital of Herzegovina. The FRG  Government proposed this to the EU partners, the Foreign  Ministry reported yesterday. The 12 have not yet made a  decision. SPD foreign policy expert Karsten Voigt stated that  Koschnick has already agreed to the proposal.    In the Chancellor's Office it was stated that Koschnick is  "an experienced politician," but a "personnel decision" has not  yet been made in connection with the first plans for the Bosnian  city. Moreover, it was learned from the Chancellor's Office that  the whole Mostar project is "by no means settled yet." One is  "in the first stages of planning." Nevertheless, it is regarded  as certain that FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic  Union) wants an active German contribution to the reconstruction  in Bosnia. It can only take place within the European framework  and in close cooperation with the EU partners. No military  mission whatsoever is envisaged. Only civilian help after the  signing of a peace agreement is under consideration.    In the planning phase, which is still going on, it is also  discussed to send perhaps about 300 officers of the Federal  Border Police as policemen to Mostar. However, there is still a  controversy over this proposal. In government circles, one  talks of "considerable objections." The fear of attacks by  Serbian units is behind it. Moreover, the policemen would have  to act as a force to maintain public order. This is problematic.    However, the development work of German administrative  experts who are to support the German administrator for Mostar  -- who is to be appointed -- is regarded as unproblematic. The  employment of the Technical Assistance Office in the  reconstruction of the city is also possible. Moreover, the  Federal Government wants to repair a hospital in Mostar with  civilian personnel.</p>

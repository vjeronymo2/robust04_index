			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de las </F> Casas, Chiapas State; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast --  live]    [Excerpt] About 45 minutes ago, we received three Indian  Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command [CCRI-CG]  communiques from the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army].  In two of the three communiques, the CCRI-CG of the EZLN appeals  to the nation and international communities. They are classical  communiques by Subcommander Marcos. Nonetheless, one of them  attracts more attention because the EZLN openly criticizes the  government, pointing out that the reports saying peace  agreements have been reached are false. The EZLN says that the  first stage of the dialogue has concluded, but this only means  precisely that, the first stage of the dialogue has concluded.  No specific agreements have been reached for signing a peace  agreement. The communique points out that consultations continue  to be held in Lacandona jungle, in the EZLN-controlled  communities, and that these consultations will continue. The  important thing to remember is that one must not think this  first dialogue has led to the signing of specific agreements.  The EZLN points out that a lot still remains to be done.    Regarding this communique which circulated today in San  Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Manuel Camacho Solis, special  commissioner for peace and reconciliation, was here in San  Cristobal de las Casas. First, he met with the coleta [natives  of San Cristobal de las Casas] community to discuss the problems  that have arisen within this dialogue process causing serious  unhappiness among many of the residents of the area. They have  had problems with their normal lives, and now they have another  problem stemming from the land squatters. Let us listen to what  Manuel Camacho Solis had to say in the news conference when he  referred to all of this and settled some doubts on the most  recent EZLN communique dated 15 March, which we received here  today.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I am going to be very brief,  as I am about to leave and return to Mexico City. I want to  report on two very important points. The first refers to the  meeting I had with the various groups from the city of San  Cristobal de las Casas, where there has been a certain amount of  tension. We have reached an atmosphere of cordiality, however,  and we have searched for the path of reconciliation for  everyone, and all the groups fully support the entire peace  dialogue process occurring in the State of Chiapas, particularly  the city of San Cristobal.    Concerning the dialogue, I would like to take advantage of  my  visit here to strongly insist on a point that the media has not  made sufficiently clear and which could cause confusion. The  point is: The EZLN presented its list of demands. The  government, through me, made a counteroffer. This counteroffer  is being presented to the communities for consideration. At no  time, has it been said... [pauses] nor can it be said that these  are the points of the agreement. We have made a lot of progress  because we were able to establish a dialogue, but these  discussions are most important. If the situation is not  sufficiently clear, this could create the wrong idea among the  communities with regard to the good will there has been in the  entire peace process. I want to ask you to help us with this  clarification because otherwise the wrong idea about the nature  of the process could be reached. Now, the most important thing  is that there are two basic issues:    One, this is a process of searching for peace, which we are  going to pursue regardless of the circumstances. Two, this is  what allowed us to hold a dialogue. The dialogue is of great  value. We are not going to stop talking under any circumstances.  We have learned that the EZLN is a serious organization with  leaders that have clear political ideas, and this factor is  going to help us overcome any confusion and tension which is  sometimes generated by the wrong interpretation of public  messages.    I repeat: There was a list of demands; the government  countered with a proposal that is being presented for  consultation and approval by the communities. Second, we are  pursuing the path of peace, dialogue, and a political solution  which will not be changed. This commissioner is fully committed  to overcoming any confusion and continuing to move forward on  the path the State of Chiapas and all of Mexican society wants.    I think this clarifies the two important points. The  situation in San Cristobal is clear; the points of conflict will  be resolved. This afternoon, I met with all sectors of society.  Therefore, the correct atmosphere for the peace process prevails  here. The other central point is about the meeting, which I  think is very important, to clearly establish that we respect  the procedures and what we talked about in San Cristobal with  the EZLN. Thank you very much [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

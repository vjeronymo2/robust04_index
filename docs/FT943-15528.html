			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Royal Oak Mines bids Dollars 1.4bn for Lac Minerals Royal Oak Mines, the upstart Vancouver-based gold producer formed in 1991 from five penny stocks, has made a USDollars 1.4bn hostile bid for Lac Minerals, one of North America's longest-established mining groups. The combined company would produce more than 1.3m ounces of gold this year, making it the biggest miner of gold in Canada. Royal Oak, which has gained a reputation for hard-nosed management, is expected to rely on the generous terms of its offer and Lac's recent lacklustre performance to win over Lac shareholders. Lac said it would evaluate the bid in its shareholders' best interests. A Royal Oak spokesman said that one of its financial advisers told Lac's senior management of the bid shortly before the offer was announced yesterday morning. The meeting was described as 'brief'. Royal Oak, which has built up a 2.5 per cent stake in Lac, has offered CDollars 3.75 in cash and 1.75 of its shares for each outstanding Lac share. Alternatively, Lac shareholders can opt for 2.416 Royal Oak shares for each Lac share. Based on Wednesday's closing share prices, the offer represents a 20 per cent premium over Lac's market price. The offer is conditional, among other things, on the gold price, which is currently around Dollars 383 an ounce, remaining above Dollars 360. Lac produced 1.1m ounces of gold last year as well as copper and zinc from mines in Canada, the US and Chile. By contrast, Royal Oak's output was 276,000 ounces of gold from four mines in Canada. But Royal Oak posted a CDollars 15.1m profit, compared with Lac's USDollars 63.5m loss. Royal Oak's chief executive Ms Peggy Witte is one of the few women to head a large mining company. She has gained a reputation as a tireless manager and a ferocious cost-cutter. Ms Witte said yesterday that Royal Oak had identified savings that could reduce Lac's annual operating costs by more than Dollars 40m in 1995 and almost Dollars 50m in 1996. 'Our offer allows Lac shareholders to participate in the significant growth and increased efficiency we plan for the combined companies,' Ms Witte said. The Dollars 400m cash portion of the offer will be financed by three US and Canadian banks. Royal Oak has also obtained binding commitments for Dollars 700m in long-term credit facilities to retire the tender facility, provide working capital and, if necessary, to pay down Lac's debt.</p>

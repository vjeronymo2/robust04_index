On the eve of the NPC session, the  abovementioned leader particularly stressed Deng Xiaoping's  exposition that "stability must override everything."    According to the authoritative source, the senior central  leader recently talked especially about maintaining a sustained,  rapid, and healthy development in the national economy, and  called on all party members, leading cadres in particular, to  reach a common understanding on this issue, especially on the  complete meaning of the words "sustained, rapid, and healthy."    This senior leader said: The sustained, rapid, and healthy  development is a dialectical unity. In the end, the economy  will not be boosted if the development is rapid but not  sustained and healthy.    He added: In proposing the general tasks of "seizing  opportunities, deepening reforms, opening wider to the outside  world, promoting development, and maintaining stability" for  1994, somebody suggested changing the term "promoting  development" to "accelerating development." Later, after  repeated deliberation, it was not regarded as feasible to  accelerate only the speed because, by doing so, an organic  entity cannot be formed with the other aspects. Furthermore,  the word "rapid" is contained in the expression "sustained,  rapid, and healthy development" already, so the term "promoting  development" was finally decided to be written in the  20-character general tasks.    The central authorities called for leading cadres at all  levels to correctly handle the relationship between reform,  development, and stability. It is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  remark -- stability must override everything -- that counts.  Without stability, nothing will be accomplished. For the  entire party and society, stability must override everything.  If we lack a stable situation, we simply have no way of  developing the economy and carrying out the in-depth reform.  Conversely, if the economy attains a sound development, there  will be a more solid foundation for stability. How should we  boost the economy? We must depend on the in-depth reform  because, without it, we cannot build up a socialist market  economy.</p>

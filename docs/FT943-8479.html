			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Management: European Case of the Year Insead and IMD, the Continent's leading business schools, have dominated 1994's European Case of the Year Awards. These bouquets are handed out by the European Case Clearing House, the world's biggest source of management case study material with offices at Cranfield University in the UK and Babson College in the US. Decided by the number of new users of each case study - considered a more objective method than a panel of judges - the awards acknowledge the contribution of the growing band of European authors. European schools are often criticised for relying too heavily on North American case material. This year's overall winner, for the second time in the four-year history of the event, was Sumantra Ghoshal of Insead (who has recently been appointed to a new chair at the London Business School). Written in 1992, his case concerns the special problems and challenges of managing a professional service firm (Andersen Consulting Europe). Presentations were made to the 12 authors of the most successful case studies in six management sub-categories (accounting, control and business environment; finance; policy and general management; human resources/organisational behaviour; marketing; production and operations management). Insead achieved three category winners, IMD two category winners and four runners-up. The only UK success was Andrew Brown of Nottingham University (previously of Manchester Business School) who triumphed in the Policy and General Management section for his study of managing change in Britain's National Health Service. 'Cases don't attract the same attention as scholarly research even though they require a lot of work and skill,' says Jeff Gray, director of ECCH. 'That is why it is important to have a mechanism for recognising them.' ECCH, set up in 1973, is a non-profit company with charitable status and 325 member organisations. It gathers case materials from worldwide sources - it now has 13,000 titles spanning all aspects of management - and provides facilities for their selection and examination. Apart from business schools, Gray says that the ECCH attracts companies and firms such as IBM, Shell and Ernst &amp; Young with their own management development activities.

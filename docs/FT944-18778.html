			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: The making of a vintage brew - Giles MacDonogh travels to India to take tea, of the finest sort When the sun breaks through the clouds you may catch a glimpse of the peak of Kangchenjunga from the terrace of the Darjeeling Club. At 28,148ft, Kangchenjunga is the second highest mountain in the Himalayas. That is to the north, in the province of Sikkim. Darjeeling is still called hill country, although the hills rise to a dizzy 7,000ft. Those hills are remarkably fertile. Waterfalls spout from every crag. Occasionally, the sheer slopes are splashed with the multi-coloured saris of the teams of Nepalese women who earn a crust by picking tea. Making great tea is not so different from great wine. For grape variety read tea bush. The best of all is the China bush, brought to Darjeeling by the first planters 150 years ago. Then there are China clones, Assam bushes and Assam clones. The Assam bushes will give you a much brisker, more tannic cup, but they will never have the delicacy of great Darjeeling. The leaves are withered before they are dried. This process removes the excess moisture in the leaf and begins the bio-chemical transformation. Correct withering is crucial to the quality of the tea. If the tea garden takes trouble over the wither, it will preserve the green-leaf character in the China bushes; it is this which gives certain top quality Darjeeling teas that raisiny, muscatel aroma. Following the wither, the juice is extracted by rotating presses and allowed to ferment. The leaves are then dried. But, here again, great care must be taken: if the heat is too great the juices caramelise, giving the tea a noticeable malty taste. Like vineyards, each tea garden has its own character. There are 93 in the hills of Darjeeling, plus another 44 down on the Terai, or plain. Terai tea is mostly big, black stuff made by the the highly extractive CTC process, although there are a few estates, such as Nuxal Bari, which produce a wonderfully refreshing green tea. Real quality, however, comes from the hills. About 20 miles south east of Darjeeling town is Goomtee, where the south-facing slopes rise to around 4,000ft. At Goomtee they are at pains to separate the different varieties of bush and process them apart. A good, second flush Goomtee, where the highly prized shoots have accumulated more sap in their slower growth, often has a fruit aroma: peaches or mangoes. On the other side of the valley is Jungpana, one of the most sought after teas in Darjeeling. Jungpana is astonishingly remote: there is no road, and the tea needs to be brought over the valley to Goomtee before it can be loaded on lorries. When I was there in June, some leopard cubs had been seen among the tea bushes, leading the pickers to conclude that an anxious mother would not be far away. Second-flush Jungpana has a cult following in Germany, and the garden's favoured customers have convinced them to stop using pesticides on the bushes. In general, the move to organic farming in Darjeeling is greeted with relief among the tea traders of Calcutta. The widespread use of nutrients in the past has overworked the region's thin soils. If the Germans appreciate the mellow, walnut flavour of Jungpana, they are also the principal fans of the much more robust teas of Seeyok, a stunningly beautiful estate south west of Darjeeling. Seeyok has fully embraced organic methods now that three quarters of its production goes to Germany. The bushes are not separated out, however, and the garden is dominated by Assam hybrids, giving a bigger, more powerful tea which has none of the delicacy of Jungpana. Under the same ownership, and just across the river, is Selimbong. As the teas here tend to walk out of the factory doors they are less in a hurry to go over to organic farming. The second-flush teas from Selimbong are among the very best Darjeeling has to offer. There are no Assam bushes here and the style is the purest China in all its delicacy. Darjeeling tea is very similar to great wine. It is produced by a combination of the right plants; the right soil and the perfect exposition. But these geographical factors are not enough in themselves: there must also be sufficient attention paid to the production. Heavy-handedness in processing the tea can rob the leaves of that nuance which expresses Darjeeling's landscape and the clean, crisp air of the Himalayan foothills.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign demand pushes Nikkei to high for year SHARE prices surged on active buying by investors eager to increase exposure to Japanese stocks, and the Nikkei average briefly rose above the 20,000 level before losing some of the gain on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 342.43 ahead at a peak for the year of 19,829.23. It opened at the day's low of 19,506.58 and surged as high as 20,054.51 in the morning session. Profit-taking by institutional investors later eroded part of the rise. Volume increased from 734m shares to 850m. Rises led falls by 809 to 271, with 112 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks appreciated 29.75 to 1,559.22, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.10 at 1,234.95. Traders said investors, especially UK and US pension funds, were eager to buy stocks on a dip. Japanese brokers pointed out that the rise was liquidity driven rather than a rally supported by economic fundamentals such as corporate earnings. 'We are telling clients to ignore fundamentals for the moment,' said one broker. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone led the rise, advancing Y20,000 to Y1.06m in active volume. Traders said investors remained bullish about NTT. Companies with close links to NTT gained ground, with Iwasaki Electric rising Y16 to Y586 and Nitsuko Y8 to Y758. Fujikura, the telecom company, however, receded Y20 to Y1,010 on profit-taking. Exporters, which have been slow to respond to the recent rally due to the higher yen, surged on bargain hunting. Fujitsu moved ahead Y12 to Y662 and Sony Y420 to Y4,950. Car manufacturers were also firm, with Toyota Motor adding Y110 at Y1,680. Drug issues were also picked up as laggards, relative to the Nikkei index. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical improved Y130 to Y2,480 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical Y50 to Y1,670. Dowa Mining retreated Y22 to Y645. The issue had gained on reports that the company had discovered a gold vein in northern Japan. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 389.97 to 21,547.41 in volume of 39.2m shares. Roundup A FIRM trend was evident in a number of the Pacific Basin markets. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index finished at a fourth consecutive all-time high, up 10.42 at 1,721.20. Solid institutional and retail buying activity took volume up to a hefty 361m shares from Tuesday's 255m. Singapore property stocks were in demand on local media reports that mortgage rates would remain soft. TAIWAN finished at a 12-month peak in heavy trade. The weighted index, up more than 100 points before profit-taking set in, ended 30.67 ahead at 5,013.28, its highest close since 5,029.61 on March 14, 1992. Turnover amounted to TDollars 81.24bn. Profit-taking in banking issues, which have led recent gains, deterred investors from pushing the market up more sharply. But most industrial shares gained, with textiles and electronics particularly strong. China Steel appreciated 80 cents to TDollars 20.10 in very heavy business. SEOUL saw active trade which took the composite index above the 700 level shortly after the opening. But profit-taking on large-capitalisation shares dragged the index back to close a net 2.38 higher at 699.49. KUALA LUMPUR closed mixed, although Idris Hydraulic resumed its surge on speculative buying. The composite index breached the 660 resistance level to end 5.46 firmer at a year's high of 661.35. Idris, in spite of saying that it had no material announcement to make, surged 70 cents to MDollars 2.71 in volume of a record 214.1m shares. MANILA continued to rise for a third day on bargain hunting in anticipation of a rally. The composite index closed 26.75 higher at 1,556.13, for a cumulative 4.87 per cent advance since last Friday. AUSTRALIA declined in dull pre-holiday trade, brightened only by Mr Kerry Packer's reported raid on John Fairfax. The All Ordinaries index lost 3.4 to 1,654.9 in turnover of ADollars 283.4m. Some 36m Fairfax shares were traded at USDollars 2.10 each after the market closed on Tuesday. Reports that Mr Packer was the buyer sent Fairfax up 6 cents to ADollars 1.98. HONG KONG closed almost 1 per cent down, although there were signs of support at lower levels. The Hang Seng index slid 59.13 to 6,281.70 in turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn. BOMBAY ended with the BSE index 97.24, or 4.2 per cent, higher at 2,408.68. Unfortunately, the interest rate cuts expected from the Reserve Bank of India after the close were not forthcoming; and although the RBI changed its credit policy, allowing borrowing against shareholdings of up to 50 per cent of their value, against 25 per cent previously, brokers were divided on which way the market would move today.</p>

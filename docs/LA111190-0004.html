			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> The Memphis Belle (Channel 28 Sunday at 4 p.m.; Discovery Channel Sunday at 7  p.m. and 11 p.m.). Here's a chance to see the landmark 1944 William Wyler World  War II documentary about a bomber mission over Germany that is the basis for  the current film of the same name.  </P> <P> The Little Thief (Cinemax Wednesday at midnight). This fine 1989 French film is  derived from a treatment prepared by Francois Truffaut not long before his  death in 1984 and brought to the screen in deceptively simple and marvelously  subtle fashion by Claude Miller. Charlotte Gainsbourg invests the teen-age  delinquent heroine with delicate, bruised sensibilities and a smile that can  twist your heart.  </P> <P> Imitation of Life (AMC Friday at 6 p.m.). It's the 1959 Douglas Sirk version of  the Fannie Hurst story that has developed a cult, but the one you may remember  the best is this 1934 original in which Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers  strike it rich with Beavers' pancake recipe -- and in which Beavers'  heart-breaking daughter (Fredi Washington) tries to pass for white. Directed by  John M. Stahl.  </P> <P> The Bank Dick (TNT Friday at 9:30 p.m.), You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (at 11  p.m.) and Never Give a Sucker an Even Break (at 1 a.m.). Three of W. C. Fields'  best.  </P></p>

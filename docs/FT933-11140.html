			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: ISMA calls for reduced period of settlement THE International Securities Market Association has described a reduction in the Euromarket settlement period, to trade date plus two to three working days from trade date plus seven calendar days, as 'both necessary and justified', Reuter reports. ISMA said it prefered the trade date plus two days settlement option. ISMA's full board and market practices committee has been discussing the matter since its annual meeting in May, when members voiced strong support for such a move. Cedel and Euroclear, the two clearing houses, say they foresee no technical problems with the proposed shortening of the settlement period. ISMA said a shorter settlement period would reduce overall systemic risk, bring the Euromarket more into line with the cycle for domestic debt instruments traded internationally, and help members to meet capital adequacy requirements. The date set for the changeover is January 1995.</p>

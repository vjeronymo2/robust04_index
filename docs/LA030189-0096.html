			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE VALLEY: THE LIGHTS AND THE REST OF THE HOUSE ARE RUN BY A TALKING  COMPUTER NAMED ALEXANDER.  </P> <P> "This is Encino's version of affordable housing," Mayor Tom Bradley said,  gazing at a talking mansion with more white columns than Scarlett O'Hara ever  dreamt of, aflame with "Star Wars" lighting and stuffed with men in tuxedos and  women in furs.  </P> <P> His Honor's little joke was as close as the night came to understatement.  </P> <P> The mayor and about 280 others attended a political fund-raiser/real-estate  promotion/media event/art exhibit and society goosepile to unveil builder  Dennis Michael Nouri's "House of the 21st Century."  </P> <P> Americans traditionally jockey for a good view of the future, but futurology's  record is spotty. In 1947 it was Sunday supplement wisdom that, in the 1980s,  atomic power would reduce the workweek to four hours and there would be two  helicopters in every garage. But who foretold massive drug abuse and the winter  of the nuclear family?  </P> <P> So it's open to question whether Nouri's house foreshadows the life style of  2005. If it is to be the life style of the common man or even the  run-of-the-millionaire, the economy has much work to do.  </P> <P> The palatial, 7,500-square-foot house has four bedrooms with marble baths and  fireplaces. In the dining room, a waterfall flows over crystal rocks and the  embedded ends of severed optical fibers, creating underwater pinpoints of  colored light, like drowning fireflies.  </P> <P> Large abstract paintings by Iranian artist Massoud Arabshahi, featuring  networks of strings, decorate it. The 20-by-18-foot "Return of the Comet"  dominates the entryway, its vertical strings "showing that we strive to go up,  up in our fantasies, but the day-to-day world pulls us down," explained one of  Nouri's representatives.  </P> <P> The interior is done in bleached-bone white oak. And the house is on White Oak  Avenue. Does that mean. . . ?  </P> <P> "Yes," said Nouri with a grin. "Yes, it's no coincidence."  </P> <P> The swimming pool too is embedded with optical fibers, duplicating the  constellation Orion. Nouri even has optical fibers twined in the trees,  creating a perpetual Christmas.  </P> <P> "There are 10 miles in that one tree alone. Yes, I know it is 10 miles,  exactly," he told a skeptical visitor, "because I just paid the bill."  </P> <P> The lights and the rest of the house are run by a talking computer named  Alexander.  </P> <P> Alexander speaks in a sleepy male voice, like HAL from the film "2001" on  Quaaludes. It replies to commands with "As you wish, master." A rebuke of "No,  Alexander" draws a contrite "Sorry, master."  </P> <P> Alexander can take phone calls, Nouri's assistants said, and can have a hot  bath waiting when the master drives up.  </P> <P> "Don't you wish you had the listing?" an onlooker asked Mike Glickman, former  boy wonder (now 28) of San Fernando Valley real estate. Glickman smiled a  Cheshire-cat smile, because he does have the listing and expects "no trouble  selling this for more than $3.7 million."  </P> <P> This is the first of four houses he plans to build in the neighborhood, Nouri  said, "and this one is going to be the smallest." The largest will have a  man-made lake with a three-passenger submarine. And he'll throw in a free yacht  with every purchase. (Not a back-yard yacht, the usual oceangoing type.)  </P> <P> Mingled with the Iranian art fans and limousine looky-loos were 160 people who  paid $500 per couple, as a fund-raiser for "The Committee for the Future of  LA," a political action committee founded by Bradley to raise money for  projects that "parallel" his political goals, a spokeswoman for Bradley said.  </P> <P> Men wore black tie. Women wore flashy evening dresses, displaying more breasts  than the poultry freezer at Gelson's.  </P> <P> Except for Rene Piane, who wore a demure white silk robe and 3-foot wings with  white feathers. Piane, a Santa Monica hairdresser, calls herself the Angel of  Los Angeles. She attends public events, "sprinkling blessings of love," she  said, hoping to become well-known "so the mayor or somebody will officially  appoint me the angel of L.A."  </P> <P> She was accompanied by her manager, Debbie Munford.  </P> <P> "I'm her cousin," Munford said. "Who else would work 60 hours a week and then  hang out with an angel at stuff like this? No one, that's who. Only cousins."  </P> <P> A string quartet played Mozart's Third Divertimenti as Nouri showed Arabshahi's  giant artwork to Bradley and demonstrated Alexander.  </P> <P> "Mr. Mayor," Piane trilled from the staircase. "Remember me from the Mormon  church?"  </P> <P> Bradley looked up. It was not a question to ignore from an angel.  </P> <P> "We met at the Mormons, remember? Will you name me the official angel of L.A.?  C'mon, please."  </P> <P> "Right, right," Bradley said, his face frozen in a smile, moving on.  </P> <P> Later, actor Robert Wagner introduced Bradley to the crowd. Bradley praised  Nouri's house. "I own it," he joked.  </P> <P> Mrs. Nouri dropped her purse.  </P> <P> "Don't worry," the mayor said. "I'm only kidding."  </P> <P> "You're the mayor," Nouri said.  </P> <P> "Yes -- for life," replied Bradley, who appears a shoo-in for reelection.  </P> <P> Most of the crowd missed the exchange, off-microphone, so Bradley repeated it:  </P> <P> ". . . And then I said, 'Yes, mayor -- for life!"  </P> <P> The Bradleyites laughed enthusiastically.  </P> <P> Bradley said it was time for Alexander to put on the laser light show, in which  a woman in a gold lame cape representing "the angel of the future" (sorry,  Rene) danced by the pool and dived through a cloud of dry-ice fog into the  water.  </P> <P> "I thought you'd never ask," Alexander said, sleepily.  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Mayhew hopes Sinn Fein is in the frame: Sir Patrick tells Tim Coone why he is insisting the IRA must make it plain that the violence is over for good Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, is hopeful that the republican movement will respond to British requests for clarification of the IRA ceasefire and that the process of involving Sinn Fein in direct exploratory talks leading to round-table negotiations can begin within three months. In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, he explained why London, unlike Dublin, does not yet accept IRA bona fides that the violence is permanently over and also what role he hopes the US will play in the peace process. He also hinted at the contents of a forthcoming 'framework document' for round-table talks, being drafted by the British and Irish governments. He said the ceasefire was 'a remarkably important step and a very welcome one'. He added: 'There was no condition attached. There was no finite character to it. Those are very welcome features.' But he said that the 'profound levels of suspicion which are endemic on both sides of the community and very strongly present in the unionist side' made it essential to clarify that the ceasefire was permanent. 'Both governments have insisted that there shall be a permanent end to violence. I don't doubt for a minute the sincerity with which the Irish government believe that it is over for good. We have to be satisfied from what these people say themselves about their own intentions. We are not insisting on a particular form of words. We just need to have an unequivocal assertion that they intend it should be over for good.' In a seeming effort to make it easier for Sinn Fein and the republicans to respond, he repeatedly stressed that the key to opening the door to talks was a public assurance by republicans that the intention behind the ceasefire was a permanent end to violence. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, wrote last week in the Irish Times that Dublin, the US and the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party in the province had responded 'positively and correctly' to the ceasefire. Sir Patrick said: 'That just falls short, why not just say 'they got our intention right'. If Mr Adams were to say 'the Irish have correctly perceived our intention, to give it up for good' that's fine. Why not say it?' He ruled out a proposal mooted in Dublin last week for a trilateral heads of state summit between the US, the UK and the republic, but saw a positive role for the US in using 'its unique channels of communication with republicans' to persuade them to make it plain publicly that they intend that violence is over for good. The US understood the realities of Northern Ireland, he said, and it would be very helpful if the Clinton administration were to point out to the republican movement the genuine basis for the British government's uncertainty over IRA intentions. If British concerns could be satisfied, he said, it was worth remembering that Sinn Fein could be included in direct exploratory talks with London within three months. The word 'within' had been used, he said, to preserve some sort of flexibility. The framework document intended to kick-start all-party talks later this year, would be a negotiable document. 'There is no question of imposition.' He acknowledged there were on-going difficulties but said London now accepted that amendment to the republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland 'would need to be put as part of an overall package'. This would be essential to win unionist support for an overall accommodation. Sir Patrick was ambivalent on whether Dublin's insistence on amendment of the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which established partition, would be included in the framework document. 'Everybody knows the government of Ireland Act is relevant to the package. What the circumstances in which they are going to be relevant maybe time will tell.' He said the dispute over whether future cross-border structures would have executive powers could possibly be dealt with by legislatures in both Northern Ireland and the republic delegating powers to joint boards or bodies. 'That seems to make a lot of sense,' he said.</p>

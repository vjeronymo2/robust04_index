			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "JB Report" column by Teodomiro Braga] </F>   [Text] Maneuvers, pressures, and last-minute conspiracies  wiped out half a dozen names from the Budget CPI's  [Congressional Investigating Committee] list of people who will  have their political rights stripped, thus making the CPI's  final report look somewhat like a pizza.    The name of Deputy Jose Luis Maia, the PPR [Progressive  Renewal Party] leader in the Chamber of Deputies and a friend of  [former Sao Paulo Governor Paulo] Maluf, was removed from the  list due to pressures from the party leadership, while the  Senate's corporatism saved Senator Saldanha Derzi, the Sarney  administration's last leader in the Chamber of Deputies.    Maia and Derzi were condemned by the subcommittees that also  incriminated the dwarf [referring to the so-called `seven  dwarfs' inner circle of corruption] Jose Carlos Vasconcelos, who  was also helped by corporatism.    PDT [Democratic Labor Party] leader Luiz Salomao credited  Paes Landim's removal from the list of those indicted to an  alleged agreement between the PT [Workers Party] and the Sarney  group.    Pressure from the Bahia State PFL [Liberal Front Party]  saved  Deputy Jose Carlos Aleluia from the guillotine. Aleluia was  reported by the amendments subcommittee as a "forwarding agent"  for construction companies in Congress.    Previous arrangements had already saved a group of sure  candidates for having their political rights stripped, like  Senator Mansueto de Lavor and the dwarf Messias Gois.    The CPI's portion of the pizza would have been much larger  had it not been for the resistance from rapporteur Roberto  Magalhaes, who had received strong appeals to remove other names  before sending the report to the printing shop.</p>

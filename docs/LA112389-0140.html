			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DURABLE GOODS ORDERS OFF 0.6% FOR OCTOBER  </P> <P> Orders for durable goods, items ranging from refrigerators and automobiles to  aircraft, inched down 0.6% in October after a revised 1.1% fall in September,  the Commerce Department said Wednesday.  </P> <P> It said a 3% jump in transportation orders tempered the overall decline, which  was propelled by a sharp fall in defense orders. Rising orders for ships and  civilian airplanes more than offset a decline in auto production and parts.  </P> <P> Excluding the volatile transportation sector from both months, orders fell 1.8%  in October after a 2.8% rise in September.  </P> <P> The October decline fell short of economists' expectations of a steep 2.1%  drop. The September order rate was revised down sharply from a previously  reported rise of 0.2%.  </P> <P> Excluding defense orders, which fell sharply in October, durable goods orders  rose a slight 0.5%. The September figure, exclusive of defense orders, showed a  3.5% fall.  </P> <P> Orders for military capital goods fell 12.4% in October after a 33.9% jump in  September. Non-defense capital goods, boosted by transportation orders, rose  3.2% last month after a 4.7% fall in September.  </P> <P> Overall durable goods orders in October totaled $124.59 billion, compared to  $125.33 billion in September.  </P> <P> Built to last three years or more, durable goods are a key part of the  manufacturing sector, and orders for the big-ticket items are closely watched  as an indicator of the economy's health.  </P> <P> The department said shipments of durable goods last month fell by 1.7%  following September's 3% fall. Unfilled orders, an indicator of future  activity, rose by 0.5% after a 0.2% gain the previous month.  </P> <P> The industrial sector has lately been under pressure, and that was reflected in  the fall in orders for non-transporation goods. Manufacturing employment has  dropped for seven straight months, durable goods orders have declined for two  consecutive months, and industrial production has contracted sharply.  </P> <P> Although the Federal Reserve has eased credit to prevent the weakness from  spreading, economists say interest rates could come down further if the  economic slowdown persists. But the Fed is also treading a cautious path,  fearful that looser credit could reignite inflation, which is running at a 4.6%  rate so far this year at the consumer level.  </P> <P> Among other sectors, orders for electrical machinery and primary metals each  fell 3.8%, while non-electrical machinery fell 4.6%.  </P> <P> "The U.S. manufacturing sector is in a recession. Very few industries are  hiring, and most are laying off employees," said John Hagens, chief economist  for the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting company in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  </P> <P> The open question, economists said, was whether the sluggishness in  manufacturing would spill over into the rest of the economy and spell an end to  the economic recovery, which has already lasted a peacetime record of seven  years.  </P> <P> Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., predicted that economic  growth would dip below an annual rate of 1% in the final three months of this  year, and she said economic activity would remain lackluster through the first  half of 1990.  </P> <P> "We are not forecasting a recession but we are forecasting miserable growth. It  is so close to the edge that the economy could slip into negative growth," she  said.  </P> <P> The last time the economy faced such an extended period of weakness was in  mid-1986.  </P></p>

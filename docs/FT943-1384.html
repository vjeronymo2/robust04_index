			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hepworth at Pounds 35.6m midway - Lower interest and finance costs contribute to a 29% advance Hepworth, the building materials and boiler group, reported a 29 per cent rise in half-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 35.6m, although the figure was flattered by lower interest and finance costs. At operating level, profits to 30 June rose marginally to Pounds 37m (Pounds 35.8m). Mr John Carter, chief executive, cautioned that the group's markets would remain tough for the rest of the year. Turnover edged up 2 per cent to Pounds 338.6m (Pounds 331.9m), while earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 10.2p (9.1p). The interim dividend is maintained at 5.5p. In the UK, which accounts for 60 per cent of the group's sales, operating profits were 14 per cent ahead at Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 18.7m) on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 202.1 (Pounds 184.6m). Building products sales increased 10 per cent, with the new house market providing strong support. The home products division saw sales growth of 7 per cent, with a firm performance from the gas boiler business offset slightly by weakness in garage door sales. Operating profits in the refractories business fell 43 per cent to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 3.7m) on turnover down 9 per cent at Pounds 63.9m Pounds 70.3m). Mr Carter said: 'This is our toughest market by far but we are taking steps to broaden our market base.' He added that North America and the Far East were being targeted. To this end, the company had recently signed an Pounds 11m contract in Taiwan to provide stove linings. The French boiler division, Saunier Duval, experienced mixed trading, profits improving slightly to Pounds 13m, compared with Pounds 12.5m, on turnover down marginally at from Pounds 102.4m to Pounds 99.3m. Stable glass sand sales and firm foundry product sales helped mineral and chemical division operating profits increase from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 5.2m on turnover up from Pounds 34m to Pounds 37.5m. Mr Carter said: 'Our strategy is to infuse each of our operations with new ideas, products, innovations and investment and we intend to use our strong balance sheet imaginatively. It's a long-term slog, but eventually the success of these initiatives will outweigh the difficulties.' COMMENT The fear for Hepworth is that one or more of the group's businesses - refractories the obvious candidate - will continue to act as a drag as the recovery gathers pace. Management dismisses talk of slimming down and insists investment is the key. Hepworth's latest contract successes in refractories would appear to support this view. The shares are currently on a market rating and analysts' profit forecasts of around Pounds 74m for the full year would keep them there and slightly ahead of that of the sector. While the yield - one of the highest in the building materials sector - is likely to support the shares, the downside would appear limited.</p>

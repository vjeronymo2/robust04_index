			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Defense Agency chief  Atsushi Kanda denied Friday that a U.S. study for possible use  of Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF) bases is linked to the  current crisis over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program.    Kanda admitted at a news conference the U.S. forces are  conducting a study with Japanese bases, but stressed it has  nothing to do with the deepening Asia-Pacific crisis.    "We have been conducting research and studies (on Japanese  bases) to secure efficient operation in view of maintaining and  boosting reliability of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," he  said.    "Japan's Self-Defense Forces have been cooperating with  these  studies, and (the ongoing study) is one in line with them,"  Kanda said. "The U.S. forces are always doing (such studies).  The study now under way has nothing to do with the North Korean  issue."    The daily TOKYO SHIMBUN reported in its Friday edition that  the U.S. forces are studying Air Self-Defense Force bases for  possible use as airbases for fighters apparently in preparation  for any military involvement in the Korean peninsula.    The U.S. appears to have already selected four bases in  Chitose, Misawa, Matsushima and Komatsu as proper sites to serve  as bases for U.S. fighters which would fly from the U.S.  mainland, the daily said.    Kanda denied he has received any request from the U.S. for  such use of Japanese bases.    The U.S. forces conduct studies on SDF bases to renew data  once or twice every year, according to the Defense Agency.</p>

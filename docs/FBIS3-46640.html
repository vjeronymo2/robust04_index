In view of Hata's slanderous remarks against the DPRK in his  first official appearance in the new year, it is not hard to  predict that the anti-DPRK policy of the Japanese reactionaries  will get more hostile this year.    The continued provocative utterances of the Japanese  authorities against the DPRK show that they still seek a  sinister purpose of isolating and stifling the DPRK in  conspirary with seditious forces, far from atoning for the  immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings they imposed on the  Korean people in the past and establishing good-neighbourly  relations with the DPRK.    Lurking behind their persistent outcries over the "suspected  nuclear programme", a fiction, is a heinous intention to divert  elsewhere the world's attention to Japan's stockpile of much  plutonium and its scheme of nuclear arms development and build  Japan into a nuclear power under the pretext of the suspicion  and, further, stage a comeback to Korea.    They overtly revealed time and again their ambition for  reinvading Korea by force of arms, defining the DPRK as "number  one potential enemy." Judging from this fact, the Japanese  reactionaries' acts are very ill-boding and their hostile acts  on the springboard for overseas aggression and aggrandizement  are very grave.    Their attempt to contain the DPRK with "strength" is a  futile  dream.    They must look straight at the trend of the times and act  with discretion.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Another closing record for the Footsie JUST AS the equity market was closing at a new all-time high, dealers were astonished to find that Goldman Sachs, one of the leading US investment banks, had swooped to execute one of the most sought-after bought deals in the market. It placed Hanson's 2.82 per cent stake in ICI, the chemicals giant. One of Goldman's fiercest rivals in the London market said the deal was; 'a beautifully timed and beautifully executed piece of stockbroking.' 'I'm sure we'll see a burst of takeover speculation in the so-called bid favourites when the market opens on Monday,' was the reaction of a leading marketmaker to the news. Details of Goldmans' move were not known during market trading and therefore had no impact on the share prices of either company although traders said both stocks were being marked higher in unofficial trading. Hanson shares, basking in the afterglow of a Pounds 28m profit on the purchase and sale of the ICI shares, were being chased after-hours, dealers said. The deal was seen as the icing on the cake for London's market operators after a another scintillating performance by the equity market. This week's half-point cut in domestic interest rates, a similar move by the French authorities to cut their own rates and evidence that the UK economy may be emerging from recession were the reasons behind some exceptionally heavy domestic and overseas buying of the London market. The FT-SE 100 share index settled at a record high of 2,725.7, up 23.8 on the session, having earlier raced up to an peak of 2,734.8. Over the week, the index has risen 65.9 points, extending its gain since news of the Conservatives' general election victory to 289.3 points. Dealers were surprised by the speed and substance of yesterday's gains. The Footsie opened more than 6 points down but the weakness lasted less than an hour. A surge in the Footsie future and heavy overseas buying followed the latest burst of strength in sterling. The buying drove the Footsie up to an intraday high of 2,734.8, up 32.9, before late profit-taking. The market's latest surge confounded many observers who had expected the last session of the account to trigger a burst of heavy profit-taking. Dealers were wary of selling the market short. Yesterday's turnover, just short of 900m, backed up the argument that there has been a substantial inflow of foreign money into the UK market. Retail, or customer business, in London remained at an exceptionally high level, boosted by a series of big placings and big overseas buying.</p>

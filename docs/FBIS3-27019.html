			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Exports in Surge, but </F> Deficit Lingers"]    [Text] China's exports surged upward in January, but  remained short of imports, resulting in a deficit of $900  million, it was announced yesterday.    The 14.5 per cent growth over the first month of 1993  (adjusted for holidays) indicated a rare recovery of the  nation's exports, which were teetering throughout last year,  trade officials said.    The General Administration of Customs put last month's  exports at $4.8 billion.    Imports soared by a massive 42.3 percent to $5.7 billion in  January.    Customs officials did not say whether China will be able to  sustain a trade balance for this year. The country sustained a  deficit of $12.2 billion last year, the first since 1989.    According to Customs, January's export surge was still led  by  foreign-funded enterprises, which numbered more than 170,000  nationwide by the end of 1993. Their exports rose 55.2 percent  to $1.49 billion, or 31 percent of the nation's total.    At the same time, exports by State-run and other types of  enterprises managed a 2.5 percent growth to reach $3.3 billion,  Customs said.    This compared favourably with last year, when exports posted  negative growth partly due to high export costs.    Most of these enterprises shifted to a more lucrative  domestic market buoyed by a 13 percent growth rate in the gross  domestic product (GDP) last year.    Customs officials said China's move to curb credit since  last  July and the unification of foreign exchange rates last month  were major factors behind the export growth.    The exports of finished industrial products jumped by 18.7  percent to $4.04 billion, while those of primary products  dropped 3.9 percent to $760 million.    Broken down, the exports of garments, machinery and  electronic products grew by some 22 percent each.    But the exports of traditional high-growth items, like  shoes,  luggage and dolls plateaued.    Crude oil, oil products, coal and other fossil fuel sectors  saw exports go down, but still some other primary products like  foodstuffs saw an increase in exports.    The country's exports via barter trade plummeted 37.5  percent  from January last year to $80 million.    It was the barter trade, which enjoys certain preferential  tax policies, that had attracted a considerable part of China's  exports last year.    But barter trade usually does not produce foreign exchange  for the State coffer.    The country obtains foreign exchange cash mainly from  general  trade. The exports in this form saw a sharp recovery last month  to $2.18 billion, up 18.9 percent.    Overall, China's exports are apparently on the way to a  steady growth, but analysts said the State-run companies have  yet to make further progress.    It is still not easy to root out a deficit should exports  fail to chalk up a higher speed, especially when imports are  continuing to surge, trade officials said.    But Customs showed that the import boom was led by the  foreign-funded enterprises, which do not use the State's foreign  exchange reserves.    Imports by these ventures jumped 116 percent last month to  $1.07 billion.    And the imports of raw materials for processing rose by 46.2  percent to $2.14 billion.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says  the threat of more air strikes by NATO to protect United Nations  safe areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina provides some ground for  optimism. Senator Evans said he supports the decision and hopes  the show of force will bring all parties back to the negotiating  table. However, he warns that the threat of bombing alone may  not be enough to stop the violence in Bosnia.    [Begin Evans recording] Well, it is not clear that there is  any other alternative at the moment. I mean the downside risks  are that the bombing won't be enough without ground support of  the kind that there is still no will to supply. The risk is  also that this kind of action in these new exclusionary zones  will simply generate additional complications elsewhere. [End  recording]    Meanwhile, Senator Evans has welcomed the Zulu Inkatha  Party's decision to participte in the South African elections,  saying it should reduce the level of violence in the country.    Senator Evans said although sporadic violence can still be  expected in South Africa in the lead-up to the election, the  across-the-board bloodbath which was feared can hopefully be  avoided.</p>

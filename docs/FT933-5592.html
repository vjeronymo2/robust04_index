			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Strong US performance helps Senior to Pounds 11.4m A STRONG performance in the US helped Senior Engineering Group, the tubing, ductwork and thermal engineering company, increase pre-tax profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 11.4m in the six months to June 30. Sales rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 181.4m. For the first time North America accounted for more than half of group operating profits, which improved 19 per cent to Pounds 11.8m. Mr Don McFarlane, chairman, said this performance had been achieved in spite of continuing poor conditions in the UK, which accounted for only 40 per cent of operating profits during the period - down from 60 per cent a year ago. He said: 'The group's order book is very healthy, particularly in the US, which should ensure that the year's result will demonstrate a period of very satisfactory progress. There are some signs of the long awaited recovery in the UK and as this develops we should see further benefits for the group.' Mr John Bell, chief executive, said he was delighted with the performance of Flexonics, the US manufacturer of flexible hose and expansion joints, which the group bought for Dollars 40m in February last year. Mr Bell added that Flexonics was now a leading supplier of flexible couplings to the US and British automotive industry and was winning more orders from Japanese and European car makers. A greenfield development for Flexonics Automotive in Wales will begin trading in the second half of the year. Engineered products accounted for 46 per cent of group sales, up from 42 per cent. The depressed construction services division was responsible for 17 per cent of sales (20 per cent). The thermal engineering division's contribution was steady at 37 per cent of sales, against 38 per cent, with substantial growth in the US offsetting reduced activity in the UK. Earnings per share rose to 3.33p (3.07p). The interim dividend is lifted 5 per cent to 1.26p (1.2p). COMMENT Senior's exit from the mining equipment industry and the closure of its large power contracting business look well-timed, even if FRS 3 meant that the full-year results for 1992 took a knock. These figures highlight another good piece of timing by the group - its purchase and then heavy investment in Flexonics, which has given it a strong and growing position in the automotive industry. With gearing standing at a comfortable 26 per cent, Senior is likely to increase its Flexonics presence in Germany by acquisition. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 23m put the shares, up 3p to 119 1/2 p, on a prospective multiple of 18. That is not unreasonable for a company that has weathered the recession better than most other engineering stocks.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Management: Sun sets on share scandal - Stefan Wagstyl reports on Nomura's efforts to regain its reputation / Japanese securities In New York or London, the combination of the worst stock market scandal in memory and a long bear market might drive even a strong securities company into bankruptcy. But in Tokyo, neither last year's scandals involving links with gangsters and secret compensation payments to clients, nor a 90 per cent decline in stock exchange turnover, is likely to remove Nomura Securities from its top position in the securities industry. The mood at the company's headquarters has changed since last summer when Nomura staff witnessed in horror the resignations of Yoshihisa Tabuchi and Setsuya Tabuchi - the two men who had headed the group for 12 years. They quit over links with a gangster organisation, over compensation payments made to favoured clients and allegations of stock manipulation. Today there is a quiet determination to make sure the company pulls through the bear market and recovers its reputation. As Atsushi Saito, an executive managing director, says: 'We have no intention of making money at the expense of other brokers but Nomura will be the least damaged by the bear market'. The company is going through a management reform designed to increase efficiency, improve contact with customers and erase the memory of the scandal. Executives want to rid the company of the reputation for arrogance which dogged it through the 1980s. Nomura used to move like a bulldozer in the market, with headquarters instructing salesmen across Japan which stock to promote and the salesmen pushing the shares on to their hapless clients. Saito and his colleagues want the new Nomura to be more responsive to customers' needs. There is little doubting the commitment to reform at the top. But it is a moot point how fast the company can remould the attitudes of staff in its domestic branch network. As one foreign broker in Tokyo says: 'What internationally-minded people like Saito think is one thing. What the branch managers think is another'. The root of the company's self-confidence is its formidable financial power. In the year to the end of March 1991, it made Y142bn (Pounds 639.63m) net from interest and dividends on its own cash and securities holdings - equivalent to half the pre-tax profit and enough to cover the wages bill for 10 months. In the six months to September, the period when last year's scandal was at its height, Nomura made a pre-tax profit of Y39.7bn - down 64 per cent compared with the same period in 1990 but still almost twice as much as second-ranked Daiwa Securities. Certainly Nomura is hurt by the fall in business on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where turnover last month was less than one tenth of the average in 1988. Like other brokers, Nomura is cutting costs, including its lavish entertainment budget. More significantly, Nomura is reducing the number of new graduates it hires from 1,525 in 1991 to 1,000 this year and probably fewer still in 1993. But cutting the intake is different from dismissing existing staff - a last resort for any large Japanese company. As a result, Nomura and other big brokers are able to rely on the loyalty of the workforce, even in times of crisis. Under the regime of lifetime employment, from other groups. So the managers of a troubled group have no choice but to redouble their efforts to avoid disaster. Moreover, tight regulation has saved Japanese brokers from the worst effects of the bear market. The finance ministry frowns on brokers trading on their own accounts, which has partly shielded them from big investment losses. The finance ministry is as much a guardian of financial companies as their regulator. So even though officials handed out penalties to Nomura for its involvement in the scandals, there was no possibility that the punishments would break the company. Nevertheless, the scandal has forced Nomura to acknowledge a need for reform. Top of the list is winning back the trust of private investors who account for some 50 per cent of brokerage income. The most important departure is training staff to tailor products to clients' needs. The risks of securities investments will be clearly explained to clients: 'health warnings' have already been printed on promotional pamphlets. This is a tacit acknowledgement that the company's bull market tactics of foisting high-risk instruments, such as equity warrants, onto private investors have back-fired. At the same time, branches are being given more freedom to decide which products to sell. Yasuyuki Idotsuji, the manager of the Ginza branch in central Tokyo, says: 'In the past, head office told us which products to sell. Now we decide.' Idotsuji says company training sessions once consisted only of lessons in 'how to sell more'. Now sales staff are being taught how to collate and interpret information. Nomura has also reformed its staff assessment system to put success in reaching sales targets and more on their knowledge of products and ability to train staff. Greater freedom for branches is being coupled to a transformation of the Nomura's Research Institute. According to Saito, NRI researchers have in the past produced work which is overly academic - long analyses of issues with little relevance to picking stocks. Nomura is anxious to show that it is already handling investment information more openly than before. For example, the company's forecasts, once famous for their permanent optimism, are this year notably pessimistic. Officials are free to voice the most damning opinions. Cynics say these reforms are superficial: it suits Nomura to trumpet their importance to create an impression of change. But, say critics, the moment share prices recover and the customers return, the temptation to return to the old ways will be strong. The company's transformation is certainly incomplete. Hideo Sakamaki, the new president, was the close lieutenant of the disgraced Yoshihisa Tabuchi. Also, even though both Tabuchis have lost their board seats, they still have honorary posts and their own offices. Moreover, Nomura, along with other Japanese brokers, has announced reforms in the past which achieved less than had been promised. For example, in 1988, the group said it was building Chinese walls - internal barriers - to divide its underwriting business from broking, in order to prevent brokers using inside information gained from the underwriters. But last year's scandal showed close co-operation between the two areas. Similarly, finance ministry officials have said that the brokers are dragging their feet over the elimination of discretionary accounts which they manage on clients' behalf. Such accounts are open to abuse by brokers who might want to generate commission rather than maximise a client's returns. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to minimise the extent of change at Nomura, not least because reform is in the company's own interest. The old system of generating commission by promoting a small selection of stocks very intensely worked in a bull market. In a bear market, it is in the broker's own interest to market other products more aggressively, even if these generate less commission. Moreover, the steady advance of financial deregulation in Tokyo will gradually give retail investors, as well as institutions, more choice. The finance ministry is planning to introduce next year legal reforms which will greatly increase the range of products which can be sold as securities. At the same time, the ministry is considering the reduction of stock exchange commission charges and their possible elimination. Even if the securities industry succeeded in postponing cuts for a while, it accepts that equity broking will never be as lucrative as it was in the 1980s. Diversification is essential. Executives at all the larger brokerages acknowledge the force of these arguments. But Nomura alone has the resources to meet the challenge head on.</p>

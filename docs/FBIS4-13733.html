			<p>BFN     [Text] Self-determination for the former Spanish colony of  Western Sahara made the news again today in Madrid as the terms  of the never-met requests of Polisario [Popular Front for the  Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] were formulated  again.    Three years after the agreement for a referendum was reached  at the United Nations, the Sahraoui organization highlights the  Moroccan trick of carrying out the referendum with an electoral  role twice as long as the one established by Spain. Over to our  reporter Maria Jose Castejon:    [Castejon] The hope for peace in the Western Sahara that  began three years ago could well boil down to nothing. The  former Spanish colony is once again threatened by war if the  block on the self-determination referendum is not lifted within  the next three months. In this race against the clock, a  movement formed by European municipalities, parliamentarians,  and other nongovernmental organizations, has held a conference  in Madrid to raise awareness and to put pressure on the United  Nations so that Morocco abandons its stubborn position that it  has maintained over the last few years.    One of the speakers, Odon Elorza, the mayor of San  Sebastian,  believes that the international community should be held  responsible if war flares up again in the Sahara. [indistinct  passage omitted]    [Castejon] Mohamed Abelaziz, the president of the Sahara  Arab  Democratic Republic, who is also head of the Polisario, is at  the conference. Despite the threat of war, he never stops  talking about hope. Abelaziz has asked Spain to play a more  active role because it is well aware of what is happening in the  Western Sahara.    He wants the electoral role drawn up by the Spaniards in  1974  to be respected. Its use as the basis for the referendum is the  main claim of the Polisario. Abelaziz says that the UN  secretary general's proposal to add to the electoral role is  unacceptable because it would mean giving Morocco a free hand in  turning the referendum into a joke by adding hundreds of  thousands of voters who are not from the Sahara to the role.</p>

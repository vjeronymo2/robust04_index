A delegate from Elbasan,  who did not agree with the dissolving of this commission, said  that it's early to undertake such an action, but one of the  leaders of the party, Mr. Gramoz Ruci argued that this is the  opinion of specialists and the majority of the leading council  of the Socialist Party.    The leading committee of the party will set up basic party  organizations even abroad in accordance with the foreign laws.    The delegates who discussed in the conference supported the  request of the Socialist Party for premature elections, for the  functioning of the round table of the parties as well as for the  release of the leader of the Socialist Party, Mr. Fatos Nano,  who is in prison since July last year, accused for corruption in  the case of the Italian aid granted to Albania during the time  he was the premier of the country.</p>

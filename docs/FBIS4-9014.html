			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva] </F>   [Excerpts] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- The signing of an  agreement on reciprocal protection and promotion of investments  was the last item on the agenda of the official visit of  Sweden's Foreign Minister Ms. Margaretha af Ugglas. [passage  omitted]    The Swedish guest this afternoon was received in turn by  National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, Acting Prime  Minister Evgeni Matinchev, and President Zhelyu Zhelev in turn.  Bilateral relations and the situation in the Balkans and former  Yugoslavia in particular were in the focus of all meetings.    The Yugo-conflict was high on the agenda of Ms. Ugglas'  meeting with Dr. Zhelev who briefed the guest on Bulgaria's  stand on this matter, said a presidential spokesman who had  attended the meeting. Asked by Ms. Ugglas what he thinks could  provide an outcome for the crisis, President Zhelev said that  what the United Nations have done to date in former Yugoslavia  is good but the actions seem to be lacking in determination.  Answering a question about Russia's role in the conflict and  Turkey's intentions to send blue helmets to Bosnia, Dr. Zhelev  reiterated this country's principled position for noninvolvement  of Balkan countries in the conflict and went on to say that with  their involvement Russia and Turkey added fuel to the  hostilities between Christians and Muslims. Ms. Ugglas  appreciated in highly positive terms Bulgaria's policy on the  Yugo-conflict and commitment to the UN resolutions. Dr. Zhelev  asked Ms. Ugglas to extend his invitation for a visit to this  country to Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf.    Ms. Ugglas' meetings with Aleksandur Yordanov and Evgeni  Matinchev highlighted the issue of granting compensations for  the embargo-related losses this country is sustaining. Mr.  Matinchev thanked the guest for Sweden's support in overcoming  the consequences Bulgaria's economy has suffered, as well as for  its help within the framework of the G-24.    After the signing of the agreement the Bulgarian and Swedish  foreign ministers called a news conference, where they described  the visit as an important step toward activating the bilateral  contacts in all spheres. Most of the questions to the Swedish  foreign minister pertained to Sweden's upcoming joining the  European Union.</p>

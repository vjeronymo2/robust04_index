			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reduced overheads behind Billam surge J Billam, the specialist engineering group, lifted pre-tax profit from Pounds 117,000 to Pounds 306,000 in 1991. Turnover, however, showed a 15 per cent reduction. That reflected the considerable time spent on reducing head office overheads and tightening control over costs and working capital. Gearing was cut from 70 per cent to 47 per cent. Turnover came to Pounds 5.85m (Pounds 6.9m), producing an operating profit of Pounds 508,000 (Pounds 432,000), which was boosted by a cut in interest charges to Pounds 95,000 (Pounds 139,000) and a reduction in the exceptional charge to Pounds 107,000 (Pounds 176,000). Earnings per share trebled to 13.3p (4.2p). The final dividend is 2.64p to make 4.28p (4.04p).</p>

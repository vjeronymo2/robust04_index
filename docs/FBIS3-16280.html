Shokhin described some peculiarities of the economic reform  in Russia at a press conference following the meeting.    Acceptance of "the debts of the former Soviet Union, the  burden of Russia's "donorhood" in regard to other CIS member  states" make economic transformations in the country peculiar.  In this connection, he confirmed that the government intends  "to go ahead with reserved financial policies".    "On the one hand, the cabinet succeeded in getting the  inflation rate down to an all-time low of 9.9 percent, on the  other - the slump in production continues to grow, which results  in a drop in efficacy of tax extraction as a whole," Shokhin  said as he described contradictory nature of the current  situation in Russia.    According to Shokhin, the government will "find it hard to  keep within the planned limits of the budget deficit", unless it  takes "extraordinary measures and looks for new sources of  income". When working out the draft budget, "several  expenditure items should be specified, including national  defence expenses", Shokhin said.</p>

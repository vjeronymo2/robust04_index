			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Arts: Miami City Ballet - Edinburgh Festival Ballets die each time the curtain falls. Every performance after the first night is an act of erosion, albeit also one of exploration, as dancers and public come to understand what the choreography is saying. A revival is an act of betrayal, as the egos of producers, coaches, dancers, have their way with the text, declaring that the creator wanted this, that he intended that  -with no two authorities ever in accord. How then to preserve ballets, to save masterpieces for the future in something like their original form? It is a question to which Miami City Ballet has provided some fascinating answers in its programmes of Balanchine ballets at the Edinburgh Festival this year. The troupe is only in its ninth year but it is directed by Edward Villella, a star of Balanchine's company for two decades. He has transmitted to his artists his reverence for Balanchine as a creator, together with something of his own power and vitality as a dancer. So the company shows Balanchine ballets with a verve and a freshness which make every step seem vital, restoring that freshness of impetus, that sense of committed energy, which is the life-blood of the Balanchine manner. They are not so polished as New York City Ballet casts, but nor do they look as glossy in manner. For them, dancing Balanchine is a journey of discovery - of themselves as artists quite as much as of the ballets. They are not coherently schooled, yet variety of training brings a savour of individuality to illuminate the choreography. Most important, Villella and his coaches have inspired casts to dance these masterpieces as if they were new. And new-minted, freshly exciting is how the ballets looked in performance last week as the Miami season ended at the Edinburgh Playhouse. A quadruple bill brought Serenade, Four Temperaments, the Tchaikovsky pas de deux, and Western Symphony, danced to the hilt. I did not suppose that, after all these years, Serenade could look so youthful. But Maribel Modrono, Myrna Kamara, Sally Ann Isaacks and their colleagues darted and sailed on the music's pulse as if hearing it, and being inspired by it, for the first time. It was, in the best sense, urgent, and their joy was our joy. Four Temperaments was strong in flavour, bright in outline. A remarkable young Chinese dancer, Lin Zhen, sunk deep into the troughs of the Melancholic variation. Christopher Roman made much of the broken outlines of the Phlegmatic writing. These performances, and Myrna Kamara's raging force as the Choleric humour, were authentic, splendid. What MCB showed us, as it did in its newest acquisition, Western Symphony, was Balanchine danced with the love, dedication and understanding which can, despite all the odds, still guarantee the continuing life of choreography in the theatre. Miami's energies may sometimes seem a little raw, but Balanchine reproached polite dancers in class by asking: 'What are you saving yourself for?' Miami's dancers do not save themselves for a second. They dance for Balanchine, and they are splendid. The musical standards of this visit have been high, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra playing each score lovingly under Akira Endo's baton. MCB's visit was sponsored by Hertz.</p>

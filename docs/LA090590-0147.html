			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> VANISHING CATS WORRY POLICE  </P> <P> Police and animal shelter officials said today that they are worried that the  disappearance of dozens of cats in Lincoln County may mean that the animals are  being stolen either for medical research or satanic rituals.  </P> <P> No one has found any evidence that the cats are being sacrificed or sold to  medical labs, officials said. But they said the sheer number of missing cats  indicates that something out of the ordinary is happening to the animals.  </P> <P> Ann Harford, manager of the Lincoln County Animal Shelter, said more than 50  cats have been reported missing since mid-July. Most of the cats have  disappeared during daylight hours from porches, driveways, yards and other  areas near their homes.  </P></p>

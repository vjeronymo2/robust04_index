			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Pay and performance 'unrelated': Directors' salaries examined THE LARGEST study of the link between top directors' pay awards and company performance has found there to be no such connection since the economic downturn began in 1989. The study of 288 of Britain's top 500 quoted companies will add weight to the call by Mr John Major for tighter control of pay in the boardroom in the light of the public-sector pay squeeze. The researchers, from the London Business School and the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, looked at the salary-plus-bonus level of the highest paid director - which has to be disclosed under the Companies Act - and companies' share price and dividend returns between 1983 and 1991. They found that during this period the rate of growth of directors' remuneration averaged about 20 per cent per year and was 'very weakly' linked to performance. They said, however, that any such link broke down after 1988 'when the very high pay awards received by top directors in the recessionary period up to 1991 appear to be unrelated to the performance of their companies, whether corporate performance is measured using stock market data or using accounting data on earnings per share'. Corporate growth was the most important determinant of pay. That fact called into question the effectiveness of current systems of pay determination for top directors. The link between increase in sales and increase in pay was very strong. They concluded that high pay awards for directors irrespective of the company performance should be a cause for concern for anyone who owns shares, directly or indirectly, since the failure to set incentives in ways that align the interests of directors with those of shareholders was likely to reduce shareholders' returns. 'Also, if remuneration is driven more by size than performance, then directors have a clear incentive to pursue merger and acquisition activity regardless of any benefit to shareholders, workers, or the economy as a whole.' Another recent analysis by Incomes Data Services, the pay research group, in a sample of 69 of Britain's top 100 companies, similarly found 'no discernible relationship' between performance and pay. Of the 26 companies where profits and/or earnings per share fell substantially, 23 of the most highly paid directors received pay increases.

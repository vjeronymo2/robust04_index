			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Azeris may join CIS and improve chances of peace THE chances of settling the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict improved yesterday after talks between Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Gaidar Aliyev, acting head of state of Azerbaijan. Speaking after meeting Mr Yeltsin, Mr Aliyev said that the 'self-imposed isolation' visited on Azerbaijan by the previous government of Mr Abulfaz Elcibey was now over - and that he may apply for membership of the Commonwealth of Independent States at its next summit meeting on September 24 in Moscow. On Nagorno-Karabakh, Mr Aliyev said that the problem was 'not that of Azerbaijan's alone, but of the entire Caucasus. The Russian Federation cannot remain indifferent to the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.' Membership of the CIS would bring Azerbaijan into closer contact with Armenia, a member since its inception - while Mr Aliyev's comments on Russia's interest in the Caucasian conflicts clearly marks out a role for Russia as mediator and peace-maker. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish prime minister, is to visit Moscow tomorrow, for talks on the conflict - which has seen Armenian forces take the south-western part of Azerbaijan up to the Iranian border, with floods of refugees crossing the frontier. Mr Aliyev is expected to remain in Moscow to meet Mrs Ciller.</p>

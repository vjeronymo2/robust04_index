			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs to fresh record high Wall Street The bellwether US blue chip index pushed further into record territory as investors digested a fresh batch of corporate results, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 7.59 up at 3,891.96, the fifth consecutive all-time high. NYSE volume totalled 310.4m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed 0.68 to 474.98. The American SE composite put on 1.53 at 484.81, while rebounding technology issues lifted the Nasdaq composite index 3.75 to 793.03. The day's economic news was mixed. On a favourable note, December housing starts climbed 6.2 per cent to an annualised rate of 1.54m units, well ahead of expectations. That development was partially offset by a rise in weekly claims for unemployment benefit. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's January index of business activity slipped to 34.2, from last month's lofty 42.9 level. But the net impact of the moderating growth trend was positive for stocks, which drew comfort from the decline in bond yields on the heels of the survey's release. With the expectations of investors inflated by weeks of strong economic news, several companies retreated even though their results matched or exceeded forecasts. The trend was exemplified by Computer Associates, which posted earnings of 72 cents a share, against forecasts of 67 cents, but the stock fell Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 . Transportation issues were generally weaker. Union Pacific was marked down Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 63 7/8 after posting a 22 per cent increase in net income. CSX shed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 86 1/2 on a flat profits performance. Among defence and aerospace concerns, General Electric slipped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 108 3/8 in spite of fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 1.73 a share, against Dollars 1.57 a year earlier. Loral's 28 per cent advance generated little excitement: the stock edged Dollars  1/2 lower to Dollars 37 1/2 . Investors shrugged off a strong earnings report from Monsanto, down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 78 1/8 Amid weakness in other banking stocks, Bankers Trust added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 79 1/8 on reporting record earnings before accounting charges, and announcing plans to buy back 1m to 2m shares in the current quarter. Canada Toronto declined in heavy trading, ending a winning streak that saw the TSE 300 index set record-high closes in each of the previous six sessions. The index ended 20.5 off at 4,542.4 and falls led rises by 452 to 356 after volume of 87.5m shares. Golds lost 3 per cent.</p>

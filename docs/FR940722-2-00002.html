This system of records, entitled Electronic Corpsmember Information System (ELCID), USDA/FS&hyph;51, is necessary to monitor individual Job Corps Enrollees' educational progress as well as to provide cumulative results of training programs at each individual Forest Service Job Corps Center. The data could be used to counsel enrollees as well as to adjust a Center's training program to more effectively meet enrollee needs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice will be adopted without further notice, on September 20, 1994, unless modified by a subsequent notice to incorporate comments received from the public.

The purpose of the system of records, entitled ELCID, would be to track administrative information on Job Corps students so that training for the students may be presented in a most efficient and effective manner. The information compiled on Job Corps students would include: Name, social security number, address, phone number, date of birth, date of entry, race, legal guardian, recruiter, test scores from the Test of Adult Basic Education, educational progress, vocational progress, Job Corps Center progress, behavioral reports, leave record, dormitory assignment, and pay status. The Forest Service Job Corps Center frequently require such data to be updated and reviewed to train Job Corps students more effectively. Some of this information (name, address, social security number, date of birth, date of entry, test scores, educational progress, vocational progress, overall program progress, and pay status) also would be shared with the Department of Labor's Student Pay Allowance and Management Information System (SPAMIS) date base, which is located in San Marcos, Texas, at Gary Job Corps Center. SPAMIS is the system that provides the students with their monthly living allowance. The information that ELCID will compile is currently recorded in the administrative record of each enrollee. Currently, these records must be reviewed manually for the purpose of discerning trends in educational progress of enrollees or in the effectiveness of a particular training course. Data would originate and be maintained at each individual Center. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mike Espy, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Russia glimpses heaven through hell: Economic outlook is improving, writes John Lloyd, but is fraught with risk A street in central Moscow is cordoned off. The uniformed militia compete to keep order with big men in suits with walkie-talkies and bulges below their armpits. A high-ranking delegation is in town: in this case, top executives from Credit Suisse and its sister company, CS First Boston. They are here to open their Moscow offices in the street, having refurbished a 19th century mansion to contain them (and their tenants, who include the International Monetary Fund). Mr David Mulford, the former US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, now chairman of CS First Boston Ltd, talks of the 'impressive results' of Russian reform. 'We are investing so much in here because we think this place could be as big for us as New York or London.' The prudence of the former public servant constrains him to add: 'Ultimate success will require steady continued application of policy reform and the restructuring of Russia's economy if this country is to assume its appropriate place in the global economy.' Between the hope and the practice, between the present stability and future fears, Russian and foreign business people and investors oscillate like iron filings between magnets. Is it time to invest or to wait? How to evaluate the government's commitment to reform? How much does it matter? Much of the present reality is good. Inflation is down from 21 per cent in January to under 5 per cent last month. The agriculture and energy lobbies have received extra credits, but these have been relatively restrained. Privatisation continues, having already brought to market some 70 per cent of the economy. 'This is a private economy now,' says Mr Kakha Bendukidze, head of the Nipek Corporation, one of the biggest of Russia's new businesses. 'The people are owners, even if sometimes they don't know it.' He, like many other business people, professes not to care too much what the government does (though he wishes they would tackle organised crime while it is still possible). He believes the flywheel of the private market is now turning so swiftly there is little any leader can do to stop it. Foreign investment in Russian stocks is booming. The demand is such that Russian financiers like Mr Mikhail Alexandrov of Alpha Capital are spinning off offshore companies to capture more of the inward flow. Service industry growth has been very large, compensating, on the official figures, for the continued steep fall in industrial production. In the longer term, the scenarios which can be painted are even rosier. Russia is a fabulously rich, fabulously ill-managed country: with huge oil and gas reserves of which the first are declining rapidly because they have been so badly developed and so starved of investment; with deposits of almost every precious metal and stone which have been subject to an over-strict monopoly and are now preyed upon by criminals; and with, in the black-earth zone and elsewhere, tremendously rich farmland which produces at between a third and a tenth of the productivity of the median European level. Russia, better run, could be the miracle state of the 21st century - even, if it hurries, the closing years of the 20th. But it must go through hell first. The last few weekly meetings of the special commission on the day-to-day running of the economy, chaired by Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy premier, have seen bitter confrontations between ministers. Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, said on Wednesday that at the most recent of these sessions, his colleagues had been 'talking about abandoning the course for economic reform' but had been beaten back. But for how long? As ministers acknowledge, the boom and evident signs of wealth are largely confined to Moscow (and, to a lesser extent, St Petersburg and Ekaterinburg) through which some 70 per cent of financial transactions are routed. Out in the provinces, the slashing cuts the government has had to make in the budget, as it fails to collect up to half its predicted tax revenue, cause real pain. More is to come. Unemployment is officially low but, according to internal government forecasts, is likely to turn sharply upwards. The International Monetary Fund, with a high-level delegation in Moscow this week for exploratory talks with the government, is deeply worried. It granted a Dollars 1.5bn systemic transformation facility loan to Russia last spring, in exchange for promises of budgetary and monetary orthodoxy. The government has delivered these at least on paper, but has done so by not paying workers, not supplying the northern cities properly for winter and not funding capital investment programmes normally considered essential. How much longer a quiescent society will tolerate such a breach in the implicit civil contract which exists between a state and its citizens is perhaps the largest question of the second part of 1994. In the finance ministry, the clever young ministerial team and its advisers are trying to keep spending nailed down, while juggling with ideas to get income up. The tax compliance rates are terrible: the rate on VAT has sunk from 70 per cent in the first quarter of 1993 to under 40 per cent now; profit tax from a peak of 90 per cent in the second quarter of 1993 to under 50 per cent; oil excise runs at around 40 per cent, though this has tended to rise. Only income tax is on track. The Russian market rollercoaster rolls on, more rapidly than ever. Many Russians and some foreigners have jumped on, and gone higher than they could have dreamed. They all expect a descent: how deep and how prolonged is the unknown.</p>

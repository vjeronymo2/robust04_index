			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [APA report: "Busek -- Vranitzky: Uncertainty About </F> Austria -- NATO"]    [Text] Linz/Vienna -- Yesterday there was uncertainty  about a NEUES VOLKSBLATT report. The Linz newspaper reported in  its Wednesday [27 April] edition that Austria would join NATO's  Partnership for Peace. Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek and  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky had reportedly agreed on this without  giving a date for signing the treaty. Busek reportedly made a  corresponding statement during a visit to the newspaper's  editorial office.    Busek's office then said that the report on an agreement  between the chancellor and the vice chancellor is "not topical."  The talks did take place, but the central subject was "the  expansion of specific cooperation with in the framework of  NATO's humanitarian activities," according to Busek's spokesman.  A statement by Busek that Austria cannot continue to be a  "beneficiary of others' security policy" [sicherheitspolitischer  Trittbrettfahrer] was not made in this form.    A spokesman for the chancellor also denied such an  agreement,  and spoke of an "excessive interpretation" by NEUES VOLKSBLATT.</p>

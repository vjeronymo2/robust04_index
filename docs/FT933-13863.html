			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stands firm on hopes of support for economy BROADLY BASED buying prompted by hopes of fiscal and monetary support for the economy lifted share prices, but late afternoon profit-taking by dealers and arbitrageurs wiped out most of the gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 18.91 up at 20,158.02 after a day's high of 20,394.64 set in the early afternoon which reflected buying by overseas investors, domestic institutions, individuals and dealers. However, arbitrage-related selling towards the close, after a fall in the futures index, pushed the Nikkei to a day's low of 20,144.21. Volume rose to 400m shares from 308m. Advances outnumbered declines by 678 to 321, with 168 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 8.10 at 1,639.68, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 3.30 firmer at 1,245.18. Traders said opinion polls which suggested that the ruling Liberal Democratic party could retain its pre-election strength also encouraged index sentiment. 'There is a gradual recovery in confidence as some of the initial uncertainties are starting to be removed,' one trader remarked. Cosmo Oil, the day's most active issue, climbed Y13 to Y880 on reports that it was participating in an oil field development project in Vietnam. Nippon Kayaku, a chemicals group which trailed Cosmo in volume, jumped Y32 to Y866. Buying orders came in on speculation that it would gain a large share in the epoxy resin market, after an explosion at Sumitomo Chemical's epoxy resin plant earlier this month. Kirin Brewery, the country's largest brewer, receded Y20 to Y1,260. Company executives were arrested on Wednesday on charges of paying about Y33m to racketeers. Gajoen Kanko, whose top shareholder, Dream, filed for court protection, dropped by its daily limit of Y80 to Y143 after Wednesday's trading suspension. Kyocera, the leading maker of semiconductor ceramic packages, put on Y230 at Y6,230 on hopes of firm profits due to a recovery in the semiconductor industry. Speculation that Daini Denden, in which Kyocera has a 25 per cent stake, would apply for listing also supported sentiment. Banks were stronger on hopes of lower interest rates. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y50 to Y3,180 and Sakura Bank Y10 to Y1,650. Brokers were also higher, with Nomura Securities up Y10 to Y2,060. In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 131.34 to 22,288.77 in volume of 32.2m shares. Roundup THE overnight advance on Wall Street supported some of the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG rose on active trading in Tsingtao Brewery - the first Chinese company to be listed in Hong Kong - and in other China-related stocks. The Hang Seng index gained 23.04 at 6,978.54 in turnover up from HKDollars 3.34bn to HKDollars 3.77bn. Tsingtao ended at HKDollars 3.625, against its offer price of HKDollars 2.80. A total of 173.6m shares in the brewery, worth HKDollars 623.9m, were traded. Among other China-related issues, Tung Wing Steel rose 65 cents, or 12 per cent, to HKDollars 6. SINGAPORE's shipyard stocks took the heaviest falls as the Straits Times Industrial index shed 12.16 to 1,762.95 in volume of 99.4m shares. Neptune Orient Lines dipped 8 cents to SDollars 1.55 amid uncertainty over the exercise price for converting the company's 13.2m preference shares into ordinary stock. Brokers said the authorities were investigating a sharp fall in Neptune shares on Monday over possible price manipulation. TAIWAN reported selling of financial shares as the weighted index slipped 53.30, or 1.3 per cent, to 3,969.17. Turnover was a thin TDollars 14.4bn, against TDollars 15.3bn. Leading banks, which had performed well after announcing an average 80 per cent growth in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year ended June 30, retreated yesterday. Chang Hwa Bank relinquished TDollars 3.50 to TDollars 123, First Bank TDollars 4.50 to TDollars 145.50 and Hua Nan Bank TDollars 3 to TDollars 133.50. MANILA was supported by Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which added 5 pesos at 1,005 pesos. The composite index gained 7.09 at 1,624.07. Turnover was 415.6m pesos. NEW ZEALAND's Lion Nathan moved forward 6 cents to NZDollars 3.36 following its share placing on Wednesday. The NZSE-40 index rose 4.83 to 1,711.45 in turnover of NZDollars 44m. BOMBAY lost ground in a session limited to just one hour of trading. The BSE index closed 25.31 down at 2,159.93. KARACHI moved higher after a government announcement of incentives to boost exports. The KSE index finished 4.49 firmer at 1,268.20.</p>

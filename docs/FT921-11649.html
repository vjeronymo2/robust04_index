			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Arts: The Cotton Club - Aldwych Theatre With the best will in the world, it is very difficult to find much good to say about The Cotton Club, the latest in a line of musical derivatives to land on the London stage. Indeed I am coming to the conclusion that the genre is not for theatre critics who expect more from a show than a bit of song and dance. I shall try my best, however, to be kind. In one respect, The Cotton Club is an improvement on Sophisticated Ladies, the celebration of Duke Ellington that arrived at the Globe Theatre earlier this month. It has at least some dialogue and elements of a story line. Millie Gibson, the singer, is on drugs and is destroying her career as a result. The rising star at the Club, Dinah Andrews, admits to having an affair with the manager. There is occasional talk about the difficulties of being a black star in New York in the early 1930s. It is better to stay in the Club because if you go on a road show, half the time you're hungry and have to sleep in the van since the hotels won't serve you. Yet in the end the dialogue and the story simply peter out. Like Sophisticated Ladies, the show is full of hits. Few people would deny the merits of 'I'm just wild about Harry', sung by the fetching Debby Bishop as Dinah Andrews, as a song. The same goes for 'There'll be some changes made', sung in a startling change of dress by Joanne Campbell as Millie, and a string of others. There is also some stunning tap-dancing by Marcel Peneux as Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson. Questions arise, however, about whether the theatre is the right place for what is essentially extended cabaret. On the whole, theatre-goers expect something to happen. Those who go to cabaret at least have other diversions, like eating or drinking. Over 2 1/2 hours of song and dance in the theatre can be a strain. As for tap-dancing, there was a very good example of it in Sophisticated Ladies. Marcel Peneux is clearly at the top of his profession, yet the fascination lasts for about five minutes. I have seen enough tap-dancing this month to suffice for the rest of the year. It is possible that such shows can be redeemed by brilliant settings and brilliant costumes. It is not the case with either. I reported that Sophisticated Ladies was anything but sophisticated. Some of the sets and costumes in The Cotton Club are distinctly tawdry. Audience participation might help as well. On the first night it did not really come off. It was not helped by an invitation for white folks to show that they have rhythm being apparently deliberately aimed at the stately theatre critics of The Times and The Guardian. That cast a damper. Still, some people obviously enjoy this kind of show and rumour has that there is more of the genre to come. The Cotton Club is directed and choreographed by Billy Wilson.</p>

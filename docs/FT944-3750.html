			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / MPs to hear of WDA share deals Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, will make a statement to parliament today about how the Welsh Development Agency acted as underwriter in privatisation share issues. The government-funded WDA lost Pounds 50,000 on the British Petroleum flotation, although overall it made a profit of Pounds 19,000 on privatisations. The agency lost Pounds 168,000, however, in underwriting the share issues of Welsh-based companies, including Laura Ashley. The underwriting, which stopped in 1991, was not made public at the time and has been uncovered by investigations by the agency's new management team. The Welsh Office said last night: 'The secretary of state has made it clear to the board that he no longer regards this as an appropriate role for the agency.' Mr Redwood is expected to refer to the outcome of other WDA investigations into its past, including a report commissioned from Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, into a complex land deal at Aberdare. Mr Barry Hartop, who was appointed chief executive of the WDA earlier this year, will tell the Commons public accounts committee today of the results of the inquiries. He said last night: 'We have been working hard to get all the skeletons out of the cupboard and we do believe they are now out of the cupboard. We look forward to a new start.' Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West and a Labour frontbench spokesman, said yesterday he was 'absolutely stupefied' that a development agency had engaged in underwriting government share issues. 'Whose idea was it - how high did it go?' he said. He wished to learn whether the Welsh secretaries at the time, Mr Peter (now Lord) Walker and Mr David Hunt, had known. 'Was the Treasury aware of it, or did it take the initiative?' he said. Mr Morgan is tabling questions asking Mr Redwood whether the underwriting had been disclosed in the WDA's accounts. 'If it was not shown, who authorised the burying of it in the accounts?' he said. The WDA has been revamped since the publication last year of a damning report by the public accounts committee, which fuelled the controversy over the accountability of quangos. New board members have been appointed and nearly all the senior managers replaced by outsiders.</p>

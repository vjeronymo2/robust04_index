			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> In an item in last week's Outtakes, Richard Gere was quoted as saying that he  would like to get a film project going about the life of Buddha and portray the  religious leader in that movie.  </P> <P> Gere, through his publicist, has denied speaking with the author of the item  and says that he would never consider casting himself in such a role, which he  feels should be played by an Asian. Gere, in fact, was never interviewed.  </P></p>

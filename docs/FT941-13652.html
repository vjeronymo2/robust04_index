			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Girobank staff vote to strike Staff at Girobank, a subsidiary of Alliance and Leicester building society, have voted to strike and take other forms of industrial action in protest at a 1.5 per cent basic pay offer plus Pounds 300 lump-sum bonus payments. The executive of the National Communications Union is expected to notify the bank that its 3,300 staff will begin an overtime ban from midnight on Wednesday next week. Other disruption is likely to follow unless the bank improves its offer. In the postal ballot 1,317 bank staff supported strike action with 933 against. The result was more overwhelming when staff were asked whether they were ready to take action short of striking with 1,691 supporting that position and 559 against. The turnout was just under 63 per cent.</p>

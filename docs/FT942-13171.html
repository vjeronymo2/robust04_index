			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: IFC in plan to securitise emerging market loans The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector finance arm, plans to securitise part of its emerging market loan porfolio. 'We have a scheme under design which would allow us to pool selected corporate project loans as collateral to issue rated securities', said Mr Richard Frank, the IFC's chief financial officer. The loans involved will be located in Latin America and Asia. The IFC is in discussion with credit rating agencies to agree the level of enhancement required to support issuing high-grade securities. 'We are looking for high-quality securities on the basis of the loan pool collateral and supporting features,' Mr Frank said. One difficulty is that while the corporate borrowers are investment grade, they may be located in sub-investment grade countries, he said. Taking existing loans off its balance sheet through securitisation will allow the IFC to increase its loan capacity. 'There is a high level of demand for our funding, and this will allow us to finance a larger volume of loans,' he said. The IFC's disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio totals some Dollars 5bn, of which 42 per cent is Latin American and 23 per cent Asian. The initial scheme would involve about Dollars 300 to Dollars 400m in corporate loans, but as the IFC disburses more loans it may create new pools for securitisation, Mr Frank said.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> CITY DELAYS BAN ON WATER-WELL DRILLING  </P> <P> The Ojai City Council this week delayed adoption of an emergency ban on  drilling water wells.  </P> <P> Consideration of the measure was delayed until Oct. 9 after City Atty.  </P> <P> Monte Widders asked for more time to research legal issues involved in banning  well drilling where a water shortage exists.  </P> <P> The Casitas Municipal Water District declared an emergency shortage throughout  the Ojai Valley in April that could continue indefinitely. Southern California  Water Co., which has held the city's water franchise since 1948 and has  proposed drilling a new well just outside the city limits, submitted a letter  to the city objecting to the proposed six-month ban.  </P> <P> Although the company's plan would not be affected by a city ban, the letter  says well drilling is a matter of private property rights.

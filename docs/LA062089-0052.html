			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mosbacher Defends Get-Tough Approach: Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher  defended the Administration's get-tough approach to opening foreign markets to  American products, saying the effort must be made to correct huge trade  imbalances. In an address at the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute,  Mosbacher called last year's U.S. trade deficit of $120 billion unacceptable  and said more has to be done to reduce the imbalance. Mosbacher defended the  Administration's decision last month to target Japan, Brazil and India for  erecting barriers to sales of American goods.  </P></p>

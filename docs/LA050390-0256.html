			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAVRATILOVA EASILY GAINS QUARTERFINALS OVER CUETO 6-2, 6-2  </P> <P> Martina Navratilova breezed past Isabel Cueto of West Germany 6-2, 6-2 today to  reach the quarterfinals of the Citizen Cup women's tennis tournament.  </P> <P> Navratilova won in 77 minutes, and was much sharper than in Wednesday's opening  match Wednesday in which she dropped a set to Australian Rachel McQuillan.  </P> <P> Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, the No. 3 seed, cruised to a 6-2, 6-1 victory  over 16th-seeded West German Sylvia Hanika; fifth-seed Helena Sukova downed  fellow Czechoslovak Regina Rajchrtova 7-6, 6-2 and Judith Wiesner of Austria,  the No. 8 seed, defeated West German Wiltrud Probst 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> Navratilova was never in trouble against Cueto, who was slowed by an aching  knee.  </P> <P> "She wasn't able to move as well as she can and that took a bit of the wind out  of her sails," Navratilova said. But I felt more comfortable today.  </P></p>

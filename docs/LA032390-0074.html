			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIVIL RIGHTS REPORT ALLEGES ALIENS DENIED JOBS BY LAW  </P> <P> In an effort to force changes in landmark immigration legislation, a coalition  of civil rights advocates Thursday charged that provisions of the law have led  to employers denying jobs to people who look or sound foreign -- even though  they are entitled to work in this country.  </P> <P> A provision of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act -- which punishes  businesses and individuals who knowingly hire illegal immigrants -- has caused  employers to improperly deny jobs to workers -- immigrants and citizens -- who  look or sound foreign, the coalition charged.  </P> <P> "This backs up what we feared all along, that employer sanctions have caused a  great deal of harm," said Anne Kamsvaag, an attorney for the Coalition for  Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, which issued an 18-page report that  documents 1,085 cases of alleged workplace discrimination.  </P> <P> The coalition is fighting to end the sanctions and plans to use the report to  lobby Congress.  </P> <P> Fearing they will be fined or jailed for hiring illegal immigrants, employers  frequently refuse to hire an applicant they think is foreign, the report said.  Or, employers require the applicant to supply more proof than is legally  necessary to show he or she is entitled to work in this country.  </P> <P> The employer might also refuse to recognize documents that, in fact, are  legitimate.  </P> <P> While the charges are not new, the timing of the report -- the latest in a  string of surveys that describe alleged ethnic discrimination -- was  significant. Next Thursday, the General Accounting Office is scheduled to  release its third and final progress report on the provision of the immigration  law that establishes employer sanctions.  </P> <P> If the GAO report finds "widespread" instances of discrimination as a result of  the law, Congress must act to review the legislation. In its 1988 report to  Congress, the federal agency concluded that although 16% of employers have  discriminated against workers who look or sound foreign, this did not  constitute widespread discrimination.  </P> <P> With the final report now due, advocacy groups across the country, among them  the Los Angeles coalition, are stepping up their campaign to have the sanctions  overturned.  </P> <P> "We are here to tell Congress, 'I told you so,' " Linda Wong, president of  California Tomorrow, an immigrant advocacy group, said in labeling the  sanctions provision a failure that has not fulfilled the government's stated  goal of stemming the tide of illegal immigration.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said the agency is  confident the sanctions are working.  </P> <P> Increasingly, employers too are speaking out against the sanctions, saying the  complicated law is too costly and confusing.  </P> <P> Josie Gonzalez, a private lawyer who has represented several businesses that  have been fined by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said employers  often would rather risk a discrimination complaint than the "wrath" of  immigration agents.  </P> <P> "They (employers) find this law quite burdensome to comply with," Gonzalez  said. "They tend to err on the side of not hiring if there are any doubts."  </P> <P> She said she knows of six cases of people who applied for political refugee  status and were entitled to work, but they were denied jobs because the INS  form they were given was mistakenly printed with the word "Sample."  </P> <P> Rene Martinez, who came to Los Angeles from El Salvador in 1983, is not  eligible for amnesty but has applied for political asylum. He carries a letter  from the INS that says he is entitled to work, but no potential employer  respects it, he said. "I was better off before, without any permit," he said.  </P> <P> The report released Thursday was actually the compilation of several studies  conducted over a three-year period.  </P> <P> Among the studies was one conducted in Los Angeles which described  discrimination against Latinos who speak English with an accent. By comparing  employers' reactions to paired individuals posing as job applicants -- one who  spoke English with an accent and one without -- the study found that in nearly  one-third of the cases, the accented speaker was treated less favorably. In one  out of five cases the accented speakers were not even considered for the job.  </P></p>

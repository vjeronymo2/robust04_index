			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al'Aziz al-Dali, envoy of Yemeni vice </F> president, in Cairo; date not given--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ  introduction]    [Text] Former Yemeni Prime Minister Mr. 'Abdallah al-Asnaj  has said that what is happening in Yemen is the cause of intense  unease, sorrow, and misery, and that it was hard for anyone to  find a justification for fighting between two armies belonging  to a single family; no official of the Yemeni Government had the  right to push things this far. It was, he said, the duty of  every rational person and every official in Yemen to stop this  war: "We call for urgent Arab intervention, and for redoubled  efforts to stop this war and this bloodshed." Al-Asnaj asserted,  in a statement to AL-SHARQ, that "the union is not the private  property of any one person; it is the expression of the  steadfast wish of the Yemeni people." He explained that the  continued present military confrontations would make it possible  to say that the union was drowning in blood. On another front,  AL-SHARQ met with Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, the envoy of Yemeni  Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the  [Yemeni] Socialist Party and member of the party's politburo.  Al-Dali discussed the current situation in Yemen as follows:    [Husayn] Is the Socialist Party ready for a unilateral halt  to the fighting?    [Al-Dali] We are ready, but this will not happen as long as  the other side continues to fight. In principle, we are ready to  stop fighting.    [Husayn] Are you prepared to accept the deployment of Arab  forces?    [Al-Dali] If circumstances demand it, and there is no other  way to stop the fighting but that solution, then we would not  oppose it, if all other paths are closed to us. The other  parties that were mediating have suggested the need to meet, in  the framework of safeguarding Yemeni unity and implementing the  document.    [Husayn] Are you prepared to accept the holding of a meeting  in any Arab country that offers to host it?    [Al-Dali] Yes, we accept that. Inevitably, first of all, the  basis for this meeting must be the necessity of a halt to the  fighting, first of all, and studying all ways of implementing  the pledge and agreement document. It would be mistaken to say  that this is an internal matter. If it were an internal matter,  why wouldn't we agree to solve the problem? Since we have failed  to solve this problem and have resorted to bearing arms, and to  fighting, this means that the situation is no longer an internal  one; I believe that the situation has become dangerous and  complicated, and now concerns every Arab nation.    [Husayn] What is the real way out for solving the crisis and  stopping the bloodshed?    [Al-Dali] We think we are enduring the caesarian birth of a  new situation in Yemen, and when we ask for a halt to the  fighting, we want to ease the pain of this caesarian birth. We  insist on a halt to the fighting, not because we feel defeat, or  are running away from the outcome, but to spare the blood of the  youth of Yemen who are fighting there.</p>

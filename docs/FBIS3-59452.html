Nedeljkovic: "Hundred of Problems in Oil </F> Industry"]    [Excerpt] -- Data on oil and gas production and oil  refining speak louder than words. In 1991, NIS [the Oil Industry  of Serbia] processed 7 million metric tons of oil derivatives;  in 1992, 2.6 million tons; in 1993, 1.17 tons. There is no magic  wand; the constant shrinking of state priorities is of no help.  Such drastic reductions of available quantities made it  impossible to meet the market's normal requirements. According  to NIS Director Djakovic, it was a real achievement to muddle  through the sowing, harvesting, and heating seasons. At the same  time, domestic oil and gas production has been growing until  this year, while imports of oil and gas began decreasing last  year to eventually grind to a complete halt this year. According  to Production Manager Stankovic, NIS is spending its own  reserves and cannot sustain even zero economic growth anymore.  In oil and gas production, zero growth means that the exhausted  reserves -- equivalent to about 2 million tons of oil a year --  must be replaced by new deposits. Besides, oil wells' yields  decrease with age, and, of 800 oil and 100 gas wells, half are  more than 20 years old.    The problem lies not only in the absence of imports of oil,  gas, derivatives, spare parts, equipment, raw materials, and  intermediates but also in the government pricing policy. Oil and  derivatives are sold at the 8 to 13 percent of the world price.  Stankovic says that it would be better to give them away as a  gift than to "charge" them to consumers using some complicated  procedure.    And what about the oil refinery in Pancevo? This enterprise,  valued at one billion dollars, which had the lowest number of  employees per ton of processed material in the former Yugoslavia  and whose productivity was on a par with that of the rest of  Europe a few years ago, is forced to work below the minimum  efficient production level. Instead of processing 12 to 13 tons  daily, the refinery workers must be satisfied when they have raw  materials to process two million tons [sentence as published].  The work force endeavors to use ingenuity to make up for  scarcity of everything -- from chemicals to spare parts. It is  better not to think about how long we can continue this way and  what the results will be. After all, the elections are coming.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue suffers bid talk Banknote printer De La Rue fell sharply as the City began to receive whispers that it was ready once again to pay possibly more than Pounds 600m for Portals, the security and specialist paper maker. The speculation was strong enough to force a joint announcement by the two companies to the effect that although De La Rue was keen there was nothing under discussion. Several analysts and traders suggested that the rumours have been emanating from those at Portals keen to maintain its independence. In addition, the close relationship between the two companies means it is unlikely that De La Rue will launch a hostile bid. The conclusion is that De La Rue will have to pay a premium price to achieve a mutually agreeable offer. The worries over how deeply it will have to dig saw its shares fall 38 to 963p. Meanwhile, speculation that it might pay around 900p a share saw Portal shares leap 66 to 771p. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo put on a strong performance as the market gave its interpretation to a negative report about Astra, its Swedish rival. US investment bank Merrill Lynch told clients that Astra had run into problems with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over its anti-asthma inhaler. The FDA has apparently suspended a review of the inhaler until Astra produces more satisfactory data. Any removal or deferral of competition is bound to be good news for Glaxo, which is the world's leading supplier of asthma products and which generates about 10 per cent of its total sales through US asthma treatments. Glaxo shares bounced 3 to 619p with 7.8m traded. Mr James Culverwell of Merrill Lynch said: 'We have made no comments on Glaxo, but the market has drawn its own conclusions.' Recently floated TeleWest Communications caused a flurry of telecoms activity, with the shares falling back to their issue price of 182p at one point during the day. The stock finished 2 down at 182 1/2p following 7.9m turnover. The stabilisation period for the issue has 15 days to run but Kleinwort Benson, joint broker to the float, claimed not to be supporting yesterday. The merchant bank also quashed speculation that TeleWest had been hit by flow-back from the Wall Street tranche of the issue in the wake of a rough patch for US telecoms shares. Further reflection on the big reorganisation at its Mercury unit - which supplies 16 per cent of group operating profits - left Cable and Wireless 10 off at 368p in 5.1m turnover. Reports that the government was likely to lose the vote on the second stage of the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel continued to cast a shadow over the regional electricity companies' shares, causing a retreat in several stocks in the sector. Seeboard gave up 9 to 412p and PowerGen receded 4 to 538p, while Norweb tumbled 16 to 780p. Those worries were combined with disappointment at the dividend increase from Midlands Electricity, whose shares fell 15 to 765p. The group raised the dividend payment by 22 per cent to 9.3 per cent, but that was below market expectations of around a 24 to 25 per cent increase. A further slide in the shares was prevented by a 14.4 per cent rise in headline profits to Pounds 102.4m, well ahead of market expectations. Such was the sentiment that not even the news that Yorkshire was to receive Pounds 17m compensation from Stockholm City Council for a terminated contract could lift the stock out of the gloom. The shares weakened 13 to 715p. SmithKline Beecham closed a penny firmer at 429p after US house Smith Barney upgraded the stock, along with Merck and Eli Lilly. Fisons retreated 3 to 114p on talk of a James Capel downgrade. The house declined to comment. Yorkshire Chemicals held its ground at 346p as Hoare Govett recommended it in its weekly sector review. Allied Colloids dropped 13 to 117p on disappointment over the group's interim figures. A number of diversified industrial groups had an active day, notably BTR, which rose 7 1/2 to 284 1/2 p in surging trading volume as bargain hunters reversed the recent downtrend. The shares have underperformed the market by 7 per cent over the past month and 24 per cent since September. Charter unveiled strong interim results, lifting the shares 25 to 780p and prompting leading analysts to upgrade full-year profits forecasts. Nomura Securities went up by Pounds 10m to Pounds 71.5m. The black spot in the sector was Powell Duffryn, which tumbled 25 to 517p following an unexpected Pounds 71m rights issue. Slower than expected profits growth and an absence of top management news sent freight specialist NFC tumbling. The shares closed 15 lower at 147p after 7.8m traded. UBS trimmed its full-year profits estimate by Pounds 10m to Pounds 115m, although the securities house saw some comfort in the solid dividend and the promise of a statement before Christmas on NFC's chief executive vacancy. Engineering group Siebe eased 5 to 548p as interim profits failed to exceed expectations. Hoare Govett shaded its estimate for the full year payout to just above 12p. Hazlewood shed 6 to 104p after disappointing interim figures. Profits fell Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 10.7m - below the market's worst fears. Analysts were also disappointed by the lack of further news on current trading. The improvement in interim profits at Taunton Cider was below market forecasts and the shares responded by sliding 11 to 143p. Retailing stocks remained in the doldrums as nervousness about Christmas trading continued. Great Universal Stores dipped 5 to 530p, while Kingfisher surrendered 7 at 441p. Marks and Spencer eased 3 to 389p as Panmure Gordon reiterated its sell recommendation. Dixons was one of the few bright features. The shares improved 6 1/2 to 187 1/2 p on a view that an Office of Fair Trading report into warranties, due shortly, will be more lenient than originally thought. J. Sainsbury, traditionally a defensive stock, rose 4 to 402p. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson firmed a penny to 486p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing recommending the shares. Rival SG Warburg slipped 6 to 671p, although talk of a takeover bid by one of the US financial heavyweights returned late in the day. Exploration and production company British Borneo moved ahead 5 to 213p after announcing a 'potentially commercial oil discovery'.</p>

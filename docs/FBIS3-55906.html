			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [POSTFACTUM report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Arrest of </F> Generals"]    [Text] It has come to light from confidential sources that  yesterday at 0730 one of the depots and the quarters and  utilities unit of the Northeastern Group of Forces [NEGF] in a  Riga suburb were captured by forces of the 13th country defense  battalion. Major General Vodopyanov, aide to the commander for  work with personnel; Major General Taylokov, first deputy  commander of the NEGF; and Major General Yakushev, chief of the  combat training directorate, arrived at 1030 at the site of the  incident to investigate. They declared to the head of the  city's administration who was present there that the actions by  the Latvian servicemen were unlawful, and demanded that the  captured installations be vacated. Negotiations were fruitless,  however, and around 1400 Generals Vodopyanov and Taylokov were  handcuffed, put into a minibus and taken away to an unknown  destination. General Yakushev immediately reported the incident  to the commander of the Northeastern Group of Forces who  reported the incident to the president of Latvia. The president  stated that the actions of the country defense forces were  unlawful and that measures would be taken for an immediate  release of the Russian generals. POSTFACTUM has come to learn  that Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev gave orders to put  on combat alert units of the Pskov Airborne Division, and should  the hostages not be released, to take adequate measures to free  them. Normond Beltskis of Latvia's Foreign Ministry press  service advised, as this NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA issue went to  print, that an urgent conference to resolve the situation was  under way at the office of republic President Guntis Ulmanis.</p>

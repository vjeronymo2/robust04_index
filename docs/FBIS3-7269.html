			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Brendan Pereira and Warren Fernandez] </F>   [Text] Tharman Shanmugaratnam committed a series of  security breaches which gave private sector analysts an  opportunity to obtain secret information, the Attorney-General  said yesterday.    Mr. Chan Sek Keong noted that the director ot the Monetary  Authority of Singapore's [MAS] economics department had handled  a secret MAS report "in a most hazardous way" and failed to  protect its secrecy.    He urged the court not to believe parts of the evidence the  accused had given in court, saying that it contradicted the  position he took in a statement to the Internal Security  Department [ISD].    Opening the prosecution's submissions yesterday, Mr. Chan  noted that Shanmugaratnam had brought a copy of a secret MAS  report, which contained the flash estimates, to a meeting with  Crosby Securities analysts Manu Bhaskaran and Raymond Foo. This  was a breach of MAS security rules, he argued.    The report, he noted, had not been marked "secret". This  made it more likely that it would not be handled with the  required care, he argued.    It was designed to highlight the flash estimate, had no  cover  and was not placed in a file, he said.    The only precaution Shanmugaratnam took was to cover the  report with a piece of paper.    He made no other effort to ensure that the paper remained in  place. He also removed the sheet of paper when he referred to  the report during the meeting.    Mr. Chan noted that Shanmugaratnam had argued in court that  it did not make any difference whether the document was put in a  file or covered with paper. He had said he saw no reason why  secret documents should not be brought to meetings with private  sector economists. This reflected his attitude towards security  rules, said Mr. Chan.    Shanmugaratnam had testified that more important than  whether  a document was placed in a file or not, was the way it was  handled. He was confident he would not give away the data as he  did not expect to be careless, he said.    Taking issue with this, Mr. Chan said it was not clear how  anyone could "expect not to be careless".    He added that Shanmugaratnam's explanation that he had  brought the report to the meeting to refer to the unclassified  data in it, showed that he was more concerned about having a  useful reference than the need to protect the secret information  in it.    He urged the court to reject Shanmugaratnam's statement that  he had handled the secret document with more care than other  government officials.    During his day-long submission, he also took up the  defence's  argument that all the memos and reports from the Ministry of  Trade and Industry [MTI] containing the flash estimates that had  been admitted as evidence had been graded incorrectly or were  not graded at all.    Responding, he said that there was a lower degree of risk in  these cases than Shanmugaratnam's. Two of these were internal  memos, while the third, an MTI report, had been stamped secret  and had a cover, he said.    Later, he urged the court not to believe Shanmugaratnam's  testimony when he said that he now thought it unlikely that  Bhaskaran had sighted the figures when they met at the MAS.    This contradicted a statement he made to the ISD in which he  said he could not rule out the possibility that Bhaskaran had  seen the data. This statement, he noted, was made before  Shanmugaratnam had been charged.    The Attorney-General continues with his submissions on  Shanmugaratnam and the other accused today.</p>

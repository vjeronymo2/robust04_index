			<p>BFN     [Text] Hai Phong, Vietnam, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Ground was  broken Friday for a steel rolling mill here with an annual  production capacity of 200,000 tons of steel bars in a joint  venture between Pohang Iron and Steel Co. (Posco) and Vietnam  Steel Corp. (VSC) at a cost of 56 million U.S. dollars.    Attending the ground-breaking ceremony were Posco President  Kim Chong-chin, Vietnamese Heavy Industries Minister Tran Lum  and VSC chairman Ngo Huy Phan.    The 18,000-pyong (59,400-square-meter) VPS (VSC-Posco  steel),  due to be completed by September next year, will produce 70,000  tons of rebar, 70,000 tons of round bars and 60,000 tons of wire  rods.    Posco and its affiliate Keoyang Co. hold respective 45  percent and 5 percent stakes in the company with 34 percent and  16 percent holdings by VSC and the Hai Phong People's Council  (HPC).    Posco has run a joint-venture factory called "Posvina" with  an annual output capacity of 30,000 tons of corrugated steel  sheet since April 1992 in Ho Chi Minh City, and is almost  finished with work on a pipe mill with an annual capacity of  30,000 tons in Hai Phong.    Korea's steel-making reached 33 million tons last year,  compared with Vietnam's 210,000 tons, and the Vietnamese  Government hopes to boost the industry as a major state project  by joining up with Posco.    Due to increased steel demand brought by various  infrastructure programs, Vietnam imported more than 60 percent  of its steel bars -- 67 percent of its steel imports.    Encouraged by various joint ventures with Vietnam, Posco  plans to advance into other Southeast Asian countries like  Myanmar and Malaysia.</p>

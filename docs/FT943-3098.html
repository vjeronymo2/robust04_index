			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais sees European review completed by year-end Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group, expects by the end of the year to have completed its review of its European operations. Mr Jean Peyrelevade initiated a comprehensive review of Credit Lyonnais' activities outside France when he was appointed chairman last year by the French government, with a brief to rescue the heavily loss-making group. Credit Lyonnais, a state-controlled company, created one of Europe's largest banking networks in the late 1980s in a series of acquisitions. The first phase of the Peyrelevade review was completed earlier this week, when the UK subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais announced plans to cut costs by closing seven offices and branches. The cuts are concentrated on the retail banking network which, said the group, did not have sufficient critical mass to compete efficiently in the UK. Credit Lyonnais intends to concentrate on its more competitive areas in the UK such as corporate banking, private banking and capital markets trading. Similar reviews are approaching completion in other countries, notably Belgium, Spain and Italy. However, Credit Lyonnais ,said yesterday the group did not envisage making significant cuts in these countries because its operations were larger and more cost-effective.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Speranskiy, independent expert, under the </F> "Parliament" rubric: "A Structure That Will Not Work. A Few  Bureaucratic Puzzles"]    [Text] "I feel sorry for this parliament" is what one is  tempted to exclaim, rephrasing Vereshchagin from "The White Sun  of the Desert" [a Russian customs officer from a movie about the  civil war set in Central Asia, who keeps saying "I feel sorry  for this State"], as one looks at the provisional structure of  the Russian Federation Federal Assembly's staff. Under the  current Russian Federation Constitution, the parliament's  chambers are completely independent of each other in their  activity. For unknown reasons, however, the chambers' staffs  turned out to be directly subordinated to the chief of staff of  the Federal Assembly, and also to his deputies. Also  effectively subordinated to the chief of staff are the reception  rooms of the Federation Council's and the State Duma's chiefs,  along with all staff structures of the Federal Assembly in  general. To whom the chief of staff is subordinated and by whom  he is appointed, the above structure does not clarify.    But this is only half of the trouble. The parliament is  completely devoid of analytical services. The staff's entire  activity for the most part boils down to purely technical  processing of documents. This is what will be the main scope of  the Information-Technological Support Administration's activity,  which accounts for over half of the staff's personnel -- 272  people. What do the administration's services include? A  Department of Document Turnover Support. What is hidden behind  this sophisticated name is the old general department, well  known from ministers' staffs and other organizations, with those  same old functions. A Protocol Department, in charge of the  purely technical procedure of registering parliamentary  documents. An Information-Technical Department, primarily  servicing electronic voting systems. What is the reason for  bringing the above departments together, given that both  chambers plan to have their own registers of clerical work and  their own voting systems? It is not clear. However, there will  be yet more unclear matters. The Information-Technological  Support Administration is an eclectic mixture of services  diverse in their objectives and functions. They include  libraries, the editorial- printing department, the department of  control and verification, and so forth. Why should they have  been brought together under one administration chief? It would  be logical to presume that someone needed yet another  high-ranking office, and badly so. A faint hint of a semblance  of an information-expert service -- the Information-Legal  Department, which is part of the same administration -- has only  19 staffers. This is for a Federal Assembly with over 600  deputies. Apparently, the department's work will be as  "effective" as that of another division, the International  Cooperation Department, designed to provide support for the  deputy corps' international contacts, with a staff of 20 people.  It is obviously planned that it will be made up only of  geniuses. This is unlikely because geniuses have already been  absorbed by commercial businesses, but given that the  International Cooperation Department is an integral part of the  secretariat of the Federal Assembly's chief of staff, it will be  able to forge international ties for its chief even at this  strength. What will be more difficult, however, is to do so for  the deputies.    Let us proceed further along the wiring diagram. A  Development Administration is to be set up. I wonder what or  whom it is going to develop? And so forth.    Most important, the total number of the staff's personnel is  set at 537 people. There is no need to argue that this is  clearly not enough. Apparently, the architects of this  structure proceeded from the desire to save as much Russian  taxpayers' money as possible by cutting down on the staff. One  can recommend yet another method of saving to them -- not to  create a staff at all. All the more so because given its  numbers and its structure, the staff will be simply unable to  give deputies any substantive support in performing their duties  provided for in the new Constitution.    A deputy has the right to retain three aides, who, according  to the concept, must work at a committee on which the deputy is  sitting, and, accordingly, in his faction and his district. It  is they who will have to conduct the bulk of analytical and  other studies. Isn't it too much of a good thing?    It is clear that deputies cannot do with this number of  aides, especially when they deal with narrowly professional  subjects. In our view, it is essential to set up faction staffs  and to create secretariats of sorts in committees and  commissions with organizational and technical functions, while  leaving analytical studies to the factions. It is also  necessary to set up specialized research divisions of the entire  parliament capable of conducting politically neutral and  objective analyses of subjects under discussion. It would also  be important to set up deputy commissions supervising the  activity of both the chambers' joint staff and the staff of the  entire parliament.    The above structure is provisional in its very name. I wish  its time would pass faster, for, as the ancients used to say,  there is nothing more permanent than the temporary.

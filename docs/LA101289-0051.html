			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: BLUEBIRD OF HAPPINESS FLIES PAST TRUTH  </P> <P> The first victim in the war of the sexes is truth -- or at least the truth as  we know it. One of the arguments that wives constantly use against their  husbands is, "If I don't tell you the truth, who will?"  </P> <P> The only sensible response to that is, "So what?"  </P> <P> I was witness to such a discussion on the beach the other day.  </P> <P> Susan Allen said to her husband, Paul: "Your problem is that nobody tells you  the truth."  </P> <P> "What's wrong with that?" Paul asked.  </P> <P> "It means that you think you can get away with murder. I'm the only one who  levels with you."  </P> <P> Paul wanted to know, "Who anointed you the 'Goddess of Truth'?"  </P> <P> "That's what wives are for," Susan said indignantly. "We have to see you as you  really are -- warts and all."  </P> <P> Paul protested: "Men don't want the truth -- ever, and they certainly don't  wish to hear it from their wives."  </P> <P> "I suppose you expect us to behave like cheerleaders."  </P> <P> "Exactly. We want you to swing your pompons back and forth, kick your legs and  spell out H-U-S-B-A-N-D in the middle of Yankee Stadium. Is that asking too  much from someone who provides you with extravagantly beautiful towels from  Macy's?"  </P> <P> "Every male has to have one honest person in his life to tell him when he has  no clothes on."  </P> <P> "Maybe so, but it shouldn't be the person he's married to. The trouble with  wives is that they don't just tell husbands about one thing that's wrong with  them -- they tell them about everything. It's a litany of boo-boos -- from  forgetting to put gas in the car, to mixing up the names of the new Polish  leaders.  </P> <P> "The worst part is when you correct me in front of other people, rather than  when we're alone. This is not something for a woman to do while searching for  the bluebird of happiness."  </P> <P> Susan said: "The fact that you won't take my criticism means that you won't  accept criticism from anybody."  </P> <P> "There," yelled Paul, "you're doing it again. You're criticizing me for being  unable to take criticism."  </P> <P> "I'm not doing anything of the kind. I am just making a statement of fact. If  there was anything wrong with me, I would expect you to call my attention to  it. That's what marriage is all about."  </P> <P> "Marriage is not about that at all. Show me the license that allows you to tell  me when I am making a fool of myself in public."  </P> <P> "I don't have a license but, as your wife, I have been given the right to let  it all hang out. I know husbands who would kill to know when they use the wrong  fork at a dinner party."  </P> <P> "This may surprise you, but I didn't want to hear that. Neither did I wish to  know the correct way to hang up my pants when I lost money on the stock market.  You think I like to know the truth about myself, but you have to believe me  when I say that it's not something I yearn for."  </P> <P> "A wife can't get close to her husband unless she tells him what he's doing  wrong, even if it's just in conversation."  </P> <P> "There," screamed Paul, pounding his head, "you're doing it again."  </P></p>

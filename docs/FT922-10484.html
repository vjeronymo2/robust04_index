			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y sued for CDollars 1.25bn MR Robert Campeau, the fallen Canadian property and retail tycoon, has given Olympia &amp; York another headache by filing a CDollars 1.25bn (USDollars 1.05bn) lawsuit against the cash-strapped developer. Mr Campeau, out of the public eye since financial difficulties forced him to relinquish control of his family company, alleged that O&amp;Y paid Campeau Corporation an unrealistically low 'insider's price' for the 50 per cent O&amp;Y did not already own of Scotia Plaza, one of Toronto's biggest office buildings. The allegations are spelt out in detail in a 32-page statement of claim lodged with an Ontario court. The claim is also directed at National Bank of Canada, the largest single shareholder in Campeau Corporation after seizing a block of Mr Campeau's shares. O&amp;Y is likely to defend the claim vigorously , but the threat of the large lawsuit will be of no comfort to the banks negotiating to restructure its Dollars 12bn debt. Mr Campeau alleges that Campeau Corp directors nominated by O&amp;Y and National Bank approved the Scotia Plaza sale. He said O&amp;Y paid CDollars 225m for the 50 per cent stake in Scotia Plaza last year, while a leading Canadian pension fund had offered CDollars 776m for the entire building in January 1990. Mr Campeau said he obtained reputable valuations a month before the sale which indicated that the value of the building 'was well in excess of what O&amp;Y had paid'.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: NKT subsidiary expands into US with DKr650m purchase of rival Fisker &amp; Nielsen, a subsidiary of NKT Holding, the electro-technical and engineering group listed in Copenhagen, is to acquire Advanced Machine Company of Minnesota, one of its main US rivals, for DKr650m (Dollars 100m). The purchase will make the Danish company the world's largest manufacturer of vacuum clearers, carpet cleaners and floor treatment machinery for professional use. The new company, which will take the name Nilfisk, after the brand name of Fisker &amp; Nielsen's cleaners, will form a group with a turnover of about DKr2bn and about 2,500 employees. Fisker &amp; Nielsen is market leader in Europe for industrial and institutional vacuum cleaners. Advance claims second place in the US market. Advance will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fisker &amp; Nielsen. Through an exchange of shares, the deal will give Advance's 11 private shareholders a 16 per cent stake in Fisker &amp; Nielsen, and an option to acquire another 7.5 per cent. The remaining shares will be held by NKT. A stock exchange listing for the new group within three to five years will be considered, said NKT. Fisker &amp; Nielsen made a pre-tax profit of DKr94m on turnover of DKr1.14bn in 1993. Advance made a pre-tax loss of DKr45m on sales of DKr610m. As a consequence of bringing in new shareholders, Fisker &amp; Nielsen will make an extraordinary dividend payment of DKr700m to NKT, the group said.</p>

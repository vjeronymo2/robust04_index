			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura, detained on a bribery charge, again  asked Tuesday [12 April] to be freed on bail so he can take part  in a Diet vote to pick the next prime minister, his lawyers said.    Nakamura, 44, has been detained since mid-March after  prosecutors arrested him on suspicion of taking a bribe from  leading contractor Kajima Corp.    On April 5, a judge at the Tokyo District Court rejected  Nakamura's bail application, saying he might destroy evidence.    In a fresh petition to the same court, defense lawyers  argued  that Nakamura, as a member of the House of Representatives,  needs to perform his duty and take part in the vote for a new  prime minister. The vote is very important in that it will  decide the future of Japanese politics, they said.    No date has yet been set for the two houses of the Diet to  hold the vote on a successor to Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced  his resignation last Friday.    Under Japan's code of criminal procedure, a suspect under  arrest is automatically detained for two months upon indictment  but can apply for release on bail. The detention order has to  be renewed every two months.    Nakamura is charged with taking the 10 million yen bribe  January 13, 1992, from Shinji Kiyoyama, then vice president of  Kajima Corp. Nakamura was at that time acting head of the then  governing Liberal Democratic Party's panel on antimonopoly  policies.    Prosecutors opposed Nakamura's previous petition for bail,  saying he may destroy evidence because he has stayed completely  silent when questioned about the case.    Nakamura quit the LDP just before his arrest and is  currently  an independent member of the lower house.    He served as construction minister from December 1992 to  August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.</p>

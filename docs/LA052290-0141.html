			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> BOARD CONFIRMS ITS SCHOOLS CHIEF CHOICE  </P> <P> The Tustin Unified School District board on Monday confirmed David L. Andrews  as its choice to replace outgoing Supt. Maurice A. Ross, who resigned last year  after some stormy years heading the district.  </P> <P> Andrews, superintendent of the 18,647-student Rialto Unified School District in  San Bernardino County, will take over the job June 29.  </P> <P> Ross, 58, who joined the district in 1977, gave his notice last September,  citing a "difference of philosophy" between him and the board. During his  13-year tenure, the school district was plagued by school closures and  financial and labor problems. Three months before he resigned, teachers had  given Ross a no-confidence vote, accusing him of ignoring needed improvements  in curriculum and learning conditions.  </P> <P> "Let's just say I believe in accountability and the welfare of Tustin's  students," Ross said Monday. "I wish the district luck, and I think the school  board deserves to have someone to share their ideology with."  </P> <P> When Ross resigned his post, his annual salary was $83,000. District officials  would not disclose Andrews' salary.  </P> <P> Ross said he plans to take time off to decide what he wants to do next.  </P> <P> Andrews, 52, has been both a teacher and an assistant principal in the Tustin  district, and he lived in Tustin from 1965 to 1986.

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Not the cheeriest way to round off Monday, but The New Middle Ages (11.15pm, BBC 2) is totally riveting. Expert predictions of new plagues, mysticism and millennial panic are all the more impressive for lack of portentousness or hysteria. Old enemies return in newly medicinally resistant shape 'almost in cataclysmic proportions'. New killers emerge, including Ebola, a 'level four monster' according to American Richard Preston (Aids is only level two), which needs a biological space-suit to handle and could, if released, assume Black Death dimensions. Professor Norman Stone evokes the Wars of the Roses and 'robber barons' to describe our new tribalism. Yet, as the medieval mind held to religious certainties, so today scientists fitfully discern a pattern in nature, a 'mysterious organising principle'. And the fanatic, unctuous gleam of a member of the architectural profession certainly recalls the privileged medieval church: unaccountable, disdainful of the populace, and inflicting misery in the name of its own superior wisdom.</p>

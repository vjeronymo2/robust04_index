			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Income tax for Cubans next year Cuba will impose taxes on property and income at the start of next year as part of a government effort to cut the budget deficit, ease pressure on the peso and shore up the troubled economy. The taxes, the first of their kind since the revolution 35 years ago, will be levied first on the self-employed and on Cubans who earn from foreign sources. The legislation, passed at the weekend by the National Assembly, includes provisions for taxes on salaried workers when the economy improves. The legislation also imposes taxes on a range of property and on some services. The rates will be announced in the next three months. Their imposition of the taxes is the Cuban government's response to a widening budget deficit, which reached 4bn Cuban pesos (Pounds 2.5bn at the official exchange rate) last year. It also wants to mop up much of the 11.75bn pesos in circulation, which officials say has contributed to a depreciation of the currency on the unofficial market. The government announced a 50 per cent cut in the armed forces' budget this year, saying the military should cost the country 'as little as possible'. For the past two months Cubans have been paying higher prices for a range of consumer goods and public transportation. Cigarette prices rose by an average of 600 per cent while alcohol prices were doubled. The cost of air and sea travel was also increased. Last week police clashed with demonstrators protesting over the price rises in Havana's port area after what diplomats describe as a perceptible rise in political tension in the capital. Cuban newspapers said 35 people, including 10 policemen, were injured. Cuba's economy has been thrown off course by the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was the Caribbean island's main trading partner, the failure of last year's sugar harvest and a significant cut in foreign earnings. Fuel, food and medicines have been in short supply, power cuts are frequent and lines of ration card holders have been growing. US Coast Guard ships picked up 230 Cuban refugees in the seas between Cuba and Florida over the weekend, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Miami. The people, on makeshift boats and rafts, left Cuba amid reports of unrest after three ferryboats were hijacked in nine days by Cubans hoping to reach the US.</p>

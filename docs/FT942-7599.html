			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Radio station numbers may surge The Radio Authority yesterday offered the possibility of licensing as many as 150 new commercial radio services in the UK - virtually doubling the existing number of services. The new stations, which could go on air from the beginning of 1996, will be a mixture of large metropolitan stations and more local services. The authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, rejected a plea that the new frequencies between 105MHz and 108MHz should be used to create a fourth national commercial radio network. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which won a national medium-wave frequency for its 1215 pop station, lobbied heavily for a new national FM station. The option chosen will allow up to two new FM services in most large metropolitan areas and a number of local services. The authority said yesterday that its chosen option offered the greatest flexibility and would also accommodate 'a wide variety of types of radio service, while at the same time broadening choice for the largest number of listeners'. Lord Chalfont, chairman of the authority, said the mixture of licences advertised would depend on demand. Commercial radio is expanding fast in the UK. Five new regional stations begin broadcasting on September 1, and applications for four new London stations close next month.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (26): Wolfe in sheep's clothing THE DEVIL'S CANDY by Julie Salamon Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99, 423 pages The Devil's Candy is subtitled The Bonfire Of The Vanities Goes To Hollywood. Most famous novels that go to Hollywood never come back: or not until they have been made into a glossy meld of stardust and hype in which you need not bother to look for traces of the real Dostoevsky, Conrad or Hemingway. Tom Wolfe is none of these. But The Bonfire Of The Vanities, if not a great novel, is a strongly defined one. The flames of its social and racial satire are non-discriminating: they crackle through New York from the Bronx to the Battery, pausing longest in Wall Street where they climb tall buildings to find their stockbroker hero, Sherman McCoy, and pull him down like a burning Icarus. The cardinal crime of Brian De Palma's film of the novel, which on reaching the screen crashed even more spectacularly than its hero (less Icarus, more the Hindenburg), was to soften the original's ferocity. As Wall Street Journal film critic Julie Salamon tells us in her engrossing story of the production, Warner Brothers spent Dollars 50m dressing Wolfe in sheep's clothing. Yes, there is some generic, half-witted satire in Bruce Willis's picture of the drunken, originally English tabloid reporter, Fallow. Yes, the rabble-rousing black leader Reverend Bacon is allowed to sizzle a little under De Palma's wide-angle lenses. But all that most filmgoers remember are the over-lavish production values, the game but miscast Tom Hanks, and the risible attempt at racial even-handedness in the transformation of the novel's goodhearted deus ex machina Judge Kovitsky (Jewish) into the movie's Judge White (black). The heart-searching that produced this decision is one of the high points of Salamon's chronicle. When Morgan Freeman stepped into the Judge's role to deliver the cringe-making final speech fashioned by scriptwriter Michael Cristofer - 'Decency is what your mother taught you' etc - The Bonfire Of The Vanities finally consumed itself. Its flames, unlike the caustic ones created by Wolfe, were the self-devouring ones of box-office opportunism. Salamon's book may become a classic because its author, in addition to writing well, has happened on a classic case history. Neither she nor the film's makers could have foreseen that Bonfire would attract all the night-flying, fabric-eating, spendthrift idiocies modern Hollywood is capable of. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent combing the North-Eastern states to find the 'right' courtroom for Morgan Freeman. (Couldn't they have built one?) More six- and seven-figure sums were spent on showy establishing shots, like Concorde landing in a line with the setting sun; on providing human support systems for 'difficult' stars such as Melanie Griffith; and on  -but the list is as long, loud and unappeasable as Sherman McCoy's dachsund. Canine similes seem apt in a production which illuminates the besetting vice of modern Hollywood. In thrall to the pseudoscience of audience market research, the industry allows the tail to wag the dog. For studios the far-off imaginary twitches of filmgoer response dictate the choreographing of the movie's own gestures and movements in production. Given the responsibility of a big-budget film on which he was shadowed by Warner executives at every step, even a film-maker like Brian De Palma succumbs to the prognosticatory anxiety. Indeed it was De Palma, Salomon tells us, who cast Morgan Freeman as the Judge. Aim: to sweeten the film's eventual appeal to black and liberal filmgoers. Nothing is more quietly horrific in Julie Salamon's book than the final fever of sneak previews. A film that might once have had a unified vision, back when De Palma first read the novel, is shredded and re-edited in the weeks before its Christmas 1990 release on the say-so of a few thousand preview cards. The monosyllabic 'liked' and 'didn't like' verdicts of moviegoers in middle Texas or outer Wyoming are allowed to reshape an entire film. One cannot make good art like this; one cannot even be sure of making good entertainment. But Warners will no doubt have learned this itself after its Bonfire finger-burning. As Salamon mischievously notes, a month before De Palma's folie de grandeur opened, a low-budget, low-expectation comedy called Home Alone opened in America and began its climb to become the third most successful film in history. It was produced by 20th Century Fox after Warner Bros, its initial producers, passed on the project.</p>

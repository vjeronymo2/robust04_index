			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marius Laurinavicius: "Lithuania's Ambassadors, </F> Assembled from West and East, Assess Their Activities and This  Past Year's Foreign Policy Favorably"]    [Text] Yesterday, the representatives of the Lithuanian  diplomatic corps, gathered for the annual meeting-conference now  taking place in Vilnius, continued to discuss Lithuanian foreign  policy problems. In the morning, the ambassadors and heads of  diplomatic missions participated in a discussion held in the  Seimas of our country's foreign policy.    In the course of this Seimas meeting, an accusation was made  from the rostrum that even among Lithuanian ambassadors there  are some who act as politicians, not as officials of the nation.  A. Januska, deputy foreign minister and director of the  Political Department, requested by LIETUVOS RYTAS to assess  these accusations and, if there are any such ambassadors, to  identify them, said that the ministry did not believe that there  were any such individuals and that there were no reproaches  against any of them in this regard on the part of the ministry.  According to Januska, this idea was voiced merely as a hope that  there not be such diplomats.    Yesterday, LIETUVOS RYTAS talked to the heads of the three  probably most important Lithuanian diplomatic representations.    The first thing we asked A. Eidintas, ambassador to the  United States, was whether, in the wake of the departure of some  of the workers at the embassy, he had now gotten his team  together, and how the embassy was operating. The ambassador  replied that this departure had not come as a great surprise and  that the current workers are fully covering all aspects of the  embassy's activity, that the work of the embassy did not stop  for even one day, and that he had now come to Vilnius without  any concerns regarding the embassy.    Despite the fact that most emigre Lithuanians favor former  ambassador S. Lozoraitis, the ambassador maintained that at this  time, relations with the Lithuanian Community of America are  businesslike. According to the ambassador, the embassy and the  Lithuanian Community of America had succeeded in agreeing that  they were working toward the same goal and that for this reason  it was not important who might be in charge of the government or  who the ambassador might be: relations ought to be businesslike.  The Community was now assisting the embassy.    On a five-point scale, the ambassador rated at a three the  performance this year of the Lithuanian diplomatic service. He  assigned this rating because he believes that the diplomatic  service has been slow in getting on its feet. However, even this  three reflects substantial achievement, in his opinion, because  it is not easy to get going after such a long interlude. And the  diplomatic representations are working and are of great  political and especially economic use.    When asked to assess the achievements of Lithuanian foreign  policy on the same basis, Eidintas said that everything was  overshadowed by the withdrawal of Russian armed forces and that  because this was accomplished, he would assign a score of five,  despite all the areas where performance fell short, e.g. lack of  a conceptual framework and absence of strategy.    Ambassador to Germany Z. Namavicius rated Lithuanian foreign  policy this year with a score of four. He believes that truly a  lot has been accomplished, and one can only be amazed by this,  because our diplomats lack experience and there are almost no  professionals among them.    When asked about possible solutions to the problem relating  to visas, he said that this problem really was being worked on  in Germany and that the interior ministry had been provided with  what German president R. von Weizsaecker had promised on the  occasion of his visit to Lithuania. The only thing holding up  the process is the absence of a treaty on the insurance of and  provision of aid to citizens in the event of an accident, and  other such situations. The preparatory work for this treaty  ought to be concluded as quickly as possible, but otherwise  everything is developing very favorably for us. The ambassador  believes that the treaty governing entry without visas will be  signed sooner or later, perhaps as early as next year.    When asked what Lithuania could do to attract more direct  investments from Germany, Namavicius said that the first thing  Lithuania should do is something that it has not yet done, but  which it may do in the future: sell land to be used for  production facilities. Investors would then feel much more  secure. The ambassador believes that Lithuania's duty and tax  policy is sufficiently favorable, but it ought not change around  every two months. With respect to where things stand on the  investment front, the ambassador was pleased that the trends  were good. In July, there were only somewhat more than 300 joint  enterprises with Germany, whereas now the total is up to 443.  There has not, though, been any large-scale investment, with the  exception of the Siemens company, which may have broken the ice.    We asked ambassador to Russia R. Kozyrovicius whether, in  view of the election results and statements by certain of  Russia's highest officials that corrections in economic policy  are anticipated now that the elections are over, one should not  also expect changes in Russia's foreign policy. Although the  ambassador believed that it was difficult to make any kind of  predictions at this time, he indicated that in a certain sense  Russia's foreign policy can be expected to change. The  difficulty is to say in which direction it will go. The  ambassador has noticed that the tone of Russian foreign minister  A. Kozyrev has even become less harsh. Kozyrovicius would not  want to believe that--with the entire world watching--Russia  will begin to implement a foreign policy reflecting the results  of the parliamentary elections. He would expect the emergence of  healthy and wise forces who will carry out a normal,  non-dictatorial, and non-imperial policy.    When reminded about the somewhat differing opinions of the  main implementors of Lithuanian foreign policy as to whether  Lithuanian foreign policy toward Russia will change or  not--foreign minister P. Gylys maintained at a press conference  on Tuesday that "there will be corrections" in the wake of the  elections in Russia, whereas president A. Brazauskas indicated  in an interview that appeared in a daily newspaper on Wednesday  that our policy will not change--Kozyrovicius said that first  there should be internal agreement, and foreign policy should be  formed subsequently. The ambassador believes that Lithuanian  policy should not change for the time being, because it is  uncertain what kind of situation will evolve. According to  Kozyrovicius, the results of the elections should not be totally  ignored, however, and if Russian policy changes then Lithuania  should change its policy as well.</p>

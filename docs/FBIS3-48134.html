Hosokawa made this clear at a meeting  of representatives from parties in the ruling coalition, the  officials said.    The package, which was rejected by a margin of 12 votes by  the House of Councillors on Friday, can be enacted if it is  passed again by a two-thirds majority in the lower house. The  bills also could be enacted if a joint committee of 10 members  each from both houses works out a compromise and wins approval  by a majority vote from the two houses.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. HONORS LUCY; FUNERAL WILL BE FOR FAMILY ONLY  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley ordered city flags at half-staff Thursday in  tribute to Lucille Ball while the comedienne's family disclosed that her  funeral will be private.  </P> <P> And Gary Morton, her husband of 27 years, expressed his gratitude for the  sentiments expressed following his wife's death.  </P> <P> "I have never seen or heard of such an outpouring of affection and love for  anyone as the world is showing for Lucille," Morton told United Press  International from the Beverly Hills home the couple shared.  </P> <P> "It helps me personally to know that my wife was so beloved and attracted as  much affection and good will as any head of state." He said a private funeral  service open only to members of the family will be held for Miss Ball "within  the next day or so."  </P> <P> "That's the way Lucy wanted it," Morton said, "and that's the way it will be.  I'm just enjoying the solitude now, being alone with my thoughts of Lucy. I'm  managing to hold myself together."  </P> <P> Morton said there may be a public memorial service "sometime in the future. But  right now, I don't know when that will be."  </P> <P> Meantime, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where Miss Ball died  Wednesday at age 77, said the family has asked that donations in lieu of  flowers be sent to the Lucille Ball Foundation. The foundation, established by  Miss Ball several years ago, has as its beneficiaries Childrens Hospital, City  of Hope, Center for the Partially Sighted and Los Angeles public television  station KCET.  </P> <P> Checks may be sent in care of Irella-Manella, a legal firm, 1800 Avenue of the  Stars, Suite 900, Los Angeles 90067.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, it was announced that the city of Jamestown, N.Y., Miss Ball's  hometown, will name a street in her honor. It will be called Lucy Lane.  </P></p>

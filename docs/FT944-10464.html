			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Last minute snag for Wellington Lloyd's of London yesterday created a last minute hitch for a new underwriting company planning a stock market listing when its ruling council failed to agree fresh rules for corporate investment in the insurance market, writes Ralph Atkins. Wellington Underwriting, which had announced plans to invest in seven Lloyd's syndicates run by the Wellington managing agency, is due to complete arrangements this week for placing 30m shares at 100p. It had been awaiting Lloyd's approval, originally expected last Friday, for arrangements to allow existing corporate vehicles to invest in others.</p>

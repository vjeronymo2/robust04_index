			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Councils face move to extend benefits for part-timers EUROPEAN COMMUNITY rules on equal pay will almost certainly require UK councils to introduce sick-pay schemes for their many part-time workers, mostly women, who are paid less than Pounds 52 a week. Mr Stephen Bubb, assistant secretary of the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said yesterday the association felt that it might not be treating part-time workers fairly and might be falling foul of EC legislation. Almost 70 per cent of the 800,000 manual workers in local government are part-timers, and many of those are paid less than Pounds 52 a week. A requirement to provide sick-pay for several hundred thousand workers previously excluded could significantly increase pay bills. Mr Bubb said it was difficult to determine how many workers would be affected by an extension of sick-pay schemes, but the equality audit being conducted by employers and unions would probably provide an answer. The exclusion of part-time workers from sick-pay and other benefits is likely to be a main theme of this year's pay bargaining on behalf of council manual workers. A local-government employers' consultation paper, to be issued this week, says the manual workers' interest is likely to shift to equality issues in this year's negotiations. 'They can be expected in particular to pursue the position of part-timers' conditions of service,' says the paper. It continues: 'Already there are indications of concerted union efforts, through industrial tribunal references, to have the national agreement's effective exclusion from occupational sick-pay of part-time manual workers earning less than Pounds 52 a week declared illegal.' Underlining that point, the National Union of Public Employees (Nupe) yesterday launched a test case at Leeds Industrial Tribunal on behalf of 1,000 school-meals staff employed by North Yorkshire County Council. Nupe said that following competitive tendering of the school meals service the council dismissed all its staff and offered them back their jobs with lower pay rates, reduced holidays and little or no sick-pay. Nupe is challenging the action under British and European equal-pay laws. The union said the women had been treated differently from groups of male workers, such as those in highway maintenance, who were also subject to competitive-tendering laws. Union leaders at Ford New Holland, the tractor maker owned by Ford and Fiat, will meet today to consider whether to order industrial action after the company said it would not increase a three-year pay deal including a 4 per cent rise in the first year from last November. Management was yesterday warned of the possibility of one-day or two-day strikes.</p>

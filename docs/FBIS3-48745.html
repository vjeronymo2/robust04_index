			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Hun Sen, second prime minister  of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC], recently paid a  four-day visit to Sihanoukville. Speaking at a get-together  with city officials, his excellency the second prime minister  said: We are currently encountering a lot of problems, but this  is quite normal. Even big, developed, and rich countries -- such  as Japan, France, and the United States -- have problems. Japan  is undertaking political reforms, while the United States is  facing the problems of unemployment, drugs, and AIDS. So every  country has problems; this is quite normal.    We have presented the RGC's working program to the National  Assembly. It includes the Khmer Rouge issue, which can be  regarded as a security issue; the problem of unidentified gunmen  who plunder the people's property; and so on.    Different opinions have been put forward on the Khmer Rouge  problem. Some say force should be used while others advocate a  peaceful settlement. We really want to use peaceful means; that  is why we have opened the door for a solution to this problem.  We have created a working group to interact with Democratic  Kampuchea's working group. The Khmer Rouge, however, do not  recognize Samdech Krompreah [Prince Ranariddh] as first prime  minister of the RGC. In their letters, they always address  Samdech Krompreah as chairman of FUNCINPEC [National United  Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative  Cambodia]. If Khieu Samphan regards Samdech Krompreah as  chairman of FUNCINPEC and me as vice chairman of the Cambodian  People's Party [CPP], nothing will be solved. Only the prime  ministers can give orders regarding military, police, and  financial matters; no political party chairman can do this.    Khieu Samphan demanded that a working group be established,  but when we sent H.E. Sok An for talks, Khieu Samphan said that  H.E. Sok An belongs to the CPP working group and refused to  recognize him. He also demanded the participation of H.E. Son  Sann. He does not recognize the RGC, but he wants to be a  minister in that government. The RGC has agreed to allow Khmer  Rouge leaders to occupy suitable positions, but they have  refused. When we call for a cease-fire, the Khmer Rouge leaders  demand that we implement the five points of the cease-fire. We  do not want war; we want to protect our people from being the  victims of Khmer Rouge massacres, oppression, and banditry.  During the celebration of Samdech Krompreah's birthday, the  Khmer Rouge attacked the Rumchang camp -- FUNCINPEC's command  headquarters -- killing people indiscriminately.    Speaking on behalf of the RGC, we do not want our territory  divided. The Khmer Rouge have forced the people to pay for  their actions, to forget what the people can never forget, to do  something good for those that have mistreated them, and to  accept unscrupulous individuals assuming power on their behalf.    The Khmer Rouge has about 8,000 troops. If we want to attack  them, we can use our forces. Our country has laws and a  constitution; the Khmer Rouge should abide by these laws if they  want to join us. Rebels exist not only in Cambodia but in other  countries as well. For instance, it took Malaysia many, many  years to solve their own problem.    On the investment issue, H.E. Hun Sen said: We have to  develop our country successfully. We are now on a stretch of  road that needs restoration. No country can develop when it  lacks political stability. For this reason, we should do  whatever we can to attract foreign investment. If foreigners  are not allowed to invest, and if people inside the country do  not dare to produce capital, we will never have an opportunity  to rebuild our country. If our country lacks foreign  investment, we can never rebuild our economy and we can never  use our state budget or state force. Therefore, we should  restore political stability and allow the people to own land.  We should never create complicated regulations. We should  improve the quality of our workers.    Concerning the issue of land in Sihanoukville, H.E. Hun Sen  said: We should clearly divide the city into trade, industrial,  and tourist zones and zones that can be owned by the people.  Stakes should not be randomly placed everywhere, as they are  now.</p>

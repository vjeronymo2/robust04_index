			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Development Securities acquires two City sites Development Securities is to undertake its first development in the City since it grew out of Clayform Properties under the hand of Mr Martin Landau, the property entrepreneur. It has exchanged a conditional contract for the purchase of Milton House and Shire House in Silk Street, EC2, which currently comprise 450,000 sq ft of offices. The deal is forward-funded by Haus Invest, the open-ended Commerzbank property fund, and the properties are to be acquired for more than Pounds 40m. The vendor is a consortium of five Japanese banks, led by the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, which is the receiver to EIE, the Japanese developer which went bankrupt. EIE paid about Pounds 200m for the properties. Mr Erik Raune, senior development surveyor at DS, said all of Shire House and a 'substantial' part of Milton House had been pre-let to Linklater &amp; Paines, the international law firm, for its new City head office. After refurbishment and with the benefit of pre-letting, the properties are expected to be worth about Pounds 170m, DS claims.</p>

For that reason, everyone  is watching the figures for confined and demobilized soldiers,  as such figures are made available. What we are witnessing from  both sides is worrisome, particularly from the government's  side. The truth is that practically no government forces went  into their confinement points between 21 December of last year  and 16 January. The UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, report  cites zero government soldiers joining their confinement centers  for almost each day that has passed since 21 December. By the  way of an example, let us look at government soldier entries  between 6 and 16 January:    6 January: zero soldiers;    7 January: zero soldiers;    8 January: zero soldiers;    9 January: zero soldiers;    10 January: one soldier;    11 January: zero soldiers;    12 January: six soldiers;    13 January: zero soldiers;    14 January: zero soldiers;    15 January: two soldiers;    16 January: zero soldiers.    Deputy Minister Tomas Salomao was the surprising head of the  government team to yesterday's important meeting of the  Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, to discuss the slow  troop confinement. He provided two justifications for it: the  accommodation centers' inability to take in so many soldiers --  after all, it seems that they take less soldiers than had been  thought -- and some logistical problems. The truth, though, is  that those explanations make no sense whatever. How can one say  that the problem has to do with lack of accommodation if not  even one soldier has made it yet to seven of those centers? Can  it be that they are already full before even one soldier has  arrived?    It is also difficult to believe that logistical problems  could be a reason. For example, the city of Quelimane has one  of the centers where not a single soldier has arrived yet. Can  it possibly be that the soldiers stationed in the capital of  Zambezia Province cannot be moved to a confinement center in the  city itself? Can it be so difficult to supply centers that are  mostly located in cities and villages? Deputy Minister Tomas  Salomao expressed optimism because the last few days have  already seen some entries. However, Unomoz only reports  movement at one troop confinement point, that of Casa Banana,  where 241 men arrived on 17 January. Not a single soldier made  it to the other 20 assembly points. In view of this, the  reasons presented by the deputy minister are less than  convincing.    Mozambican society has a right to know what is really  happening. If there are fundamental reasons for this situation,  then let them out so that everything can return to normal. If  there are no such reasons, then let the troops be ordered  immediately to go into the assembly points. What must not  happen is a continuation of this situation.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): PSBR depresses market - Gilts 'THE GILT market got the worst of both worlds from the Budget - a higher public sector borrowing requirement which it did not want, without the necessary tax cuts to win the general election,' said Mr Chris Dillow, economist at Nomura International. The UK gilt-edged securities market plummeted yesterday afternoon as it digested news of the government's heavy borrowing requirement. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn for 1992-93, whereas most City economists have been predicting a PSBR of between Pounds 22bn to Pounds 25bn. Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, said: 'You are talking about gross gilt issuance of about Pounds 33bn in the next year once gilt redemptions are taken into consideration.' This means that the Bank of England will have to sell an average of nearly Pounds 3bn of gilts a month, compared with an average of Pounds 1.3bn a month over the past year. Mr Kendall believes that the market should have no problem digesting gilt issues of about Pounds 3bn a month once the current political uncertainty is over. He added that the inflation forecasts - of below 4 per cent by the end of 1992 for the RPI and of 3.5 per cent by the middle of next year - are positive for the UK government bond market. The Bank announced yesterday that it would continue to use its entire range of issuing techniques in order to sell gilts. It has raised the size of its gilts auctions to between Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn (from Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn) and said it may hold even bigger auctions 'if market conditions warrant' to sell government bonds. The Bank said that the auction programme is likely to account for 'rather more than half of the total gilt funding requirement'. Economists and traders said the gilt market's reaction to the PSBR forecasts probably would not have been so negative if the chancellor had announced more attractive tax cuts to boost the government's chances of winning the election. Mr John Shepperd, director of sterling bond research at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'The gilt market got the costs without the benefit of any political kickbacks.'</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIME CHASE LEADS OFFICER TO LIFE-SAVING RENDEZVOUS  </P> <P> It looked like a kidnaping. It turned out to be a kid saving.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police officer Jim Tomer expected to nab some bad guys. Instead, he  was being credited Saturday with saving a 17-month-old boy who had suffered  convulsions and stopped breathing.  </P> <P> The child, Michael Roman, was reported in stable condition Saturday at  Childrens Hospital.  </P> <P> Tomer and his partner, Steve Razo, spotted trouble shortly after noon -- a car  filled with people and commotion racing down Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood.  The officers chased the vehicle as it ran a red light and swung onto Hollywood  Boulevard.  </P> <P> "There were three or four adults in the car. There was a lot of moving around.  They (the officers) thought it might be a kidnaping," said Hollywood Division  Sgt. Robert Plassmeyer.  </P> <P> But when the car stopped in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard, relatives of the  infant jumped out yelling, "My baby! My baby!" Plassmeyer said.  </P> <P> Tomer ran to the car and found the unconscious child on the back seat. The  officer lifted the child onto his hand and administered a Heimlich-like  procedure, patting its back and pushing up on its stomach. The child vomited,  gurgled and began breathing again.  </P> <P> The child's aunt, Wendy Ruiz, said in a telephone interview Saturday that  another aunt and uncle were baby-sitting Michael, who lives in Hollywood with  his mother, Juana Hernandez. Several relatives were on their way to a local  bank with the child when the boy suddenly became seriously ill, she said. "He  turned really pale," she said. "And then stopped breathing."  </P> <P> One relative tried to revive the boy with cardiopulmonary resuscitation while  the driver raced for the hospital, Ruiz said.  </P> <P> Plassmeyer said the child had been running a fever and been given an aspirin  product shortly before the incident.  </P> <P> The boy's mother, a department store sales clerk, was notified shortly after  the incident and rushed to the hospital, Ruiz said.  </P> <P> Tomer could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> After reviving Michael, Tomer was sent off Saturday afternoon to handle a  report of a body being found. "You save one life and another one goes,"  Plassmeyer said.  </P></p>

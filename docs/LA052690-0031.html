			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS TRADE WAS BIGGER THAN AN ORDINARY RIOT  </P> <P> In your May 19 Newswire item on Roberto Baggio, the premier "centrocampisto"  (midfielder) in Italian soccer, there were two inaccuracies.  </P> <P> Juventus paid Fiorentina $20 million, not $16.5 million, for the rights to  Baggio. And the item makes no mention of the fact that the night before the  transfer was announced, Juventus and Fiorentina played to a scoreless tie,  making Juventus the European champion.  </P> <P> It is as if after the fourth game of last year's World Series, Will Clark  announced he was moving from the Giants to the A's.  </P> <P> PETER STAMELMAN, Universal City  </P></p>

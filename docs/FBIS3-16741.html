Vasilevych, M. Chudakov, and V. Fadeyev held a  news conference on 17 March and commented on the principal  articles of the Constitution.    In the beginning they spoke about the "distinctions" and  advantages of the Belarusian Constitution. However then, driven  into a corner by reporters, the lawmakers had to admit that the  Constitution contains a number of inconsistent and ambivalent  provisions. For example, the vertical structure of presidential  power has been outlined very vaguely. With regard to this, the  authors of the constitution said that the article on  presidential power will be accompanied by a law that is "much  easier to adopt."    The issue of merging Belarusian and Russian monetary systems  was also raised. According to the new Constitution, the  Republic of Belarus shall pursue a single financial-credit  policy, which in a way contradicts the unification. However,  Yuriy Fadeyev clarified this issue by saying that a single  monetary system does not necessarily denote an independent  monetary system, adding that "there will be a single system in  Grodno, Minsk, Vitebsk, and Brest." Thus, everything seems to  be working just fine. However, confused by the questions that  followed, the working group member added: "One can predict that  the ruble zone will not be formed at all."    In the course of the news conference, it turned out that a  number of relevant provisions were excluded from the  Constitution. The legislative committee and working group  members explained this by saying that those issues could hamper  the adoption of the entire Constitution. Thus, one gets the  impression that the Supreme Soviet aimed for a hasty adoption of  the Constitution rather than its quality.</p>

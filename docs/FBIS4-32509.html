			<p>BFN     [Text] A delegation of the Turkish Defense Ministry, led by  Colonel General Teoman Ekran, this morning arrived on a two-day  visit to the Croatian Defense Ministry.    They were welcomed at Zagreb airport by their host Brigadier  General Antun Tus, military adviser to the Croatian president.    On the first day of their visit to Croatia the Turkish  delegation visited the naval institute in Zagreb.    [Begin recording] [Tus] The aim of the visit is come to know  each other better, to see at what technical and technological  level we are both at, what production lines we have, what  expertise and scientific potential we have and to achieve some  cooperation in future related to the development and production  of certain systems included in general economic programs and,  certainly also, some programs which can be significant for the  defense of the country. [end recording]    Questions related to the security in this part of Europe  were  also discussed. Croatia's integration in Partnership for Peace  as soon as possible was on the agenda.    The talks are just the beginning of the cooperation between  the two countries, Col-Gen Teoman Ekran said.    [Begin recording] [Ekran, speaking in Turkish, with  superimposed Croatian translation] As you know, the Republic of  Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize the Republic  of Croatia. This is a model start for the future cooperation  between the two countries. Turkey supports Croatian peace  efforts for the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia and lends its  full support to the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    After the visit to the naval institute the Turkish  delegation  visited Koncar complex. Visits to Karlovac and Turanj are  scheduled for tomorrow as well as talks with Croatian Defense  Minister Gojko Susak. [end recording]</p>

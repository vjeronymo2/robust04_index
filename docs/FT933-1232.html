			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (4): Down, but possibly not out - Inflation / Inflationary pressures are subdued across the developed world, but do not be fooled IS INFLATION a problem of the past? 'Yes' is the answer given by the new conventional wisdom. It may be true for the moment. It may even be true for the next few years. It is too early to be confident it will be true for good. Ever since the collapse of the gold standard, money has been subject to the discretionary management of the state, which has discharged this trust with remarkable incompetence or, worse, dishonesty. Consumer price indices show, for example, that the purchasing power of a 1933 pound had fallen to 3p by 1993, while that of the dollar had fallen to 9 cents. This great inflation began in the second world war and reached its peak in the 1970s. In 1974 and again in 1980 the annual rate of inflation in OECD countries peaked at between 13 and 14 per cent. The most recent cyclical peak in OECD inflation, however, which occurred in 1990, was only 5.8 per cent. This does not mean inflation is over, but it does show it has at least become considerably less rapid than it had earlier been. This decline in inflation has been general in OECD countries, one reason being that the 1980s did not see a repetition of the oil price shocks that coincided with the peak inflation rates in the 1970s. Yet, given last year's rate of about 4 per cent, it is impossible to argue that inflation in the industrial countries is definitively dead. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has argued that 'price stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household decisions'. Given the difficulty of measuring quality improvements, this level is often taken to be 0-2 per cent. Some leading OECD countries have already achieved that, if in the depths of recession. But others - not only the US, Italy and the UK, but even Germany - have not, or at least not yet. Even if inflation is not conquered, it is at least lower than for decades. One question is why this has happened. Inflation is a monetary phenomenon. There is no better explanation for it than that of 'too much money chasing too few goods'. The proximate cause of current relatively low rates of inflation, by the standards of the 1950s and 1960s, has been relatively disciplined monetary policy and, in an era of high real interest rates, greater willingness of investors to hold money in idle balances, rather than spend it. These monetary roots of current low inflation also give cause for optimism about inflation in the medium term. In a modern economy money is created less by governments than by banks. So weakened and frightened have banks become by their mistakes in the 1980s that they are not prepared to expand their balance sheets. This is now evident in countries as varied as the US, Japan, the UK and Australia as well as those of Scandinavia. At present, in fact, the only leading country worried by how rapidly broad money is growing is, amazingly, Germany. Another reason for optimism, it is argued, is the emergence of new low cost competition, particularly in east Asia. This development is similar in its effects to an increase in the rate of domestic productivity growth and should reduce inflation if other things remain equal. But inflation can still accelerate if the rate of increase in domestic nominal costs, particularly wages, accelerates. Domestic monetary conditions are what determine that. Given current monetary conditions, the medium term chances of continued modest inflation look good in almost all leading industrial countries. But what about the longer term? In the end, after all, economies will recover, banks will restore their capital base and borrowers will regain their courage. The monetary policies that cause inflation reflect political forces. Whether or not inflation will remain low depends ultimately on whether it has ceased to be convenient for governments. People go to jail for using fraudulent weights and measures. Governments try to buy elections by doing the same thing - undermining the value of the currency by printing more. The reason they do so is that while some voters lose, many benefit from the extra tax revenue that the fraud produces: unanticipated inflation is a way of achieving covertly what governments could not have legislated overtly. But this 'inflation tax' works only when inflation is unanticipated, and a given rate of inflation is unlikely to remain unanticipated forever. So the 'tax' works if the government continues to push inflation higher than people were expecting. In the 1950s and 1960s, unanticipated inflation was a part of the mechanism that delivered on the political commitment to 'full employment'. But the commodity price increases of the 1970s brought this process - and the commitment to full employment - to an end, since no politically acceptable level of inflation could secure the required reduction in real wages. A cogent argument for optimism about the long-term rate of inflation is that the benefits of inflation to policymakers are now much smaller than in the 1960s and 1970s, its victims are better able to protect themselves and its beneficiaries are also politically weaker. Meanwhile, potential victims either lend short or demand high long-term nominal interest rates in relation to current inflation. Policymakers know they are permanently on trial and, lacking exchange controls, face immediate penalties if they are condemned. Nevertheless, there are also four good reasons for fearing that high inflation might be politically attractive one day. First, managed money has never delivered stable prices, or even stable low inflation, over any long period. Second, each year of relatively modest inflation lulls the public further, thereby increasing the redistributive effects of another burst of inflation. Given the UK's current rate of issuance of long-term gilts with coupons of 7 per cent, for example, higher inflation might well become attractive once more, as the year 2000 approaches. Third, there are plenty of debtors who would adore higher prices. Finally, among those debtors are almost all leading governments, whose accounts are bleeding red ink. The abolition of exchange controls may make it costly for a country to choose inflation on its own. But there is always the alternative of global inflation, euphemistically labelled 'concerted reflation'. Buyers of long-dated conventional bonds should remember and beware.</p>

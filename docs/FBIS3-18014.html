The Belgian UN troops, who are taking about 15 armored vehicles  with them, are expected to arrive in Central Bosnia next  Tuesday, Belgian military sources revealed on Sunday.    The decision to send Belgian troops to Bosnia follows a call  for more troops from British General Michael Rose, the commander  of the UN troops in Bosnia, who had requested reinforcements  following the conclusion of a peace agreement between the  Muslims and Croats there.    No final decision has yet been made on where the Belgian  troops will be stationed. The front between Muslim and Croatian  troops is 350 km long. An advance party of Belgian soldiers  already left the Baranja region on Saturday, and is due to  arrive Monday in Bosnian Santici in order to reconnoiter.  Shortly afterwards a decision will be made as to where the  Belgian troops will be stationed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rocio Vicente and Mabel Valenzuela; from the </F> "Newspaper of the Airways" newscast]    [Text] Vicente and Valenzuela are five blocks away from  our radio station, behind RTP Television, at the Peruvian Air  Force Funeral Home, which was hit by an explosion. Some people  could have died. Let us listen to Rocio Vicente:    [Vicente] It has been confirmed that two people have died as  a result of the terrorist attack near RTP Television. We are  here with a lady. What happened?    [Unidentified speaker] There had been threats [words  indistinct]. That funeral home belongs to the Air Force and the  one on the corner is the Navy's. They are constantly receiving  threats. We are only residents of this neighborhood. We had  been told to be careful, because there had been threats; these  threats had been reported, but the funeral home was never  protected. We live in Tepun.    [Vicente] This woman was one of the victims. She was injured  by the explosion at the Air Force Funeral Home, which was the  site most damaged by the explosion. The explosion completely  destroyed several vehicles. There are broken windows and some  walls are about to collapse. Mabel Valenzuela is at another  area of the site of the explosion. Go ahead, Mabel:    [Valenzuela] We are with some doctors from the Social  Security Institute Field Hospital. How many people have you  cared for, doctor?    [Unidentified speaker] The Field Hospital arrived here two  minutes after the explosion. We arrived with two ambulances and  tended to six patients, two of whom are Air Force members.  These two patients have been taken to the Peruvian Air Force  Hospital by request from Intelligence [word indistinct].    [Valenzuela] What about the others?    [Doctor] Some have been sent to Revaliate Hospital, and the  rest were examined here and released.    [Valenzuela] You went inside the building. Could there be  people in there? There are reports that two people died.    [Unidentified speaker] We are here in case there are more  injured people to take away. We are ready for any incident.    [Valenzuela] Thank you, doctor. More firemen and Social  Security Institute people are arriving to back up those already  here. High-ranking Air Force officers have just arrived. They  are making no statement and are entering the damaged building.    [Vicente] The situation at Giron Torres Paz, in Santa  Beatriz  Neighborhood, a few meters away from RTP Television, is still  tense. Firemen are continuing to give attention to the injured.  We do not yet have the name of the person who died, but  according to initial police reports, the victim could be a girl.  She has already been covered with a sheet. The police and the  Air Force are maintaining absolute silence.</p>

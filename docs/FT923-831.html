			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Motoring: Volvo that feels like a Saab YOU always knew where you were with Volvos and Saabs. Volvos made in Sweden were square in shape, built solidly and rear-wheel driven. Saabs were shaped aerodynamically, built solidly and front-wheel driven. Volvo upset this neat and tidy arrangement last year by introducing its first all-new, Swedish-built car for a generation, the 850GLT. It still looked exactly like a Volvo but, under the sheet metal, it could easily have been a Saab. Its five-cylinder, 2.5-litre engine was mounted transversely and drove the front wheels through a very compact five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. When I tried it on its home ground, I found the all-independent suspension gave an excellent ride on anything from motorway to unpaved track. Its handling was predictable enough to suit the safety-minded Volvo owner; but I thought its sharpness - revealed when driven hard on a private test circuit  -would have pleased a Saab buyer who enjoys getting a move on. As luck would have it (I would have liked to say it was all down to meticulous forward planning), I spent a week recently driving a Volvo 850GLT on British roads, followed immediately by a fortnight in a Saab 9000 2.0t EcoPower. Both were automatics. The 2.5-litre, multi-valve, five-cylinder engine of the Pounds 22,680 Volvo and the two-litre, multi-valve, light-pressure, turbo-charged, four-cylinder power plant of the Pounds 20,215 Saab had much the same output (170 and 165 horsepower respectively), although the Saab's torque (pulling power) was nearly 20 per cent greater. But the Saab, tidied-up at both ends for 1993, looked more elegant and far more up-to-date than its new rival. Visually, the Volvo could easily have been a 1982, not a 1992, model. Its dull and angular shape must rank as a great styling opportunity lost. On the road, it was their similarities I noticed, not the differences. The Volvo has softer seats than the Saab although both proved comfortable over long distances. Both have excellent driving positions, with controls easy to reach and instruments visible clearly, although the Saab's fascia is the more attractive. Can a four-cylinder engine be as smooth as a five-cylinder? Really, without lifting the bonnet you would not have known which car had which. A moderate degree of turbo-charging smooths out a four-cylinder as well as boosting its output. In many ways, this kind of engine is ideal for powering a large car. When driving gently, the turbo-charger does little work. Only when full power is demanded does it force more fuel-air mix into the cylinders. A heavy-footed driver can, of course, make a turbo-charged car very thirsty indeed. Keeping the engine constantly 'on the boil' by accelerating hard from a standstill, and kicking down into a lower gear every time when overtaking, will ruin fuel economy. The secret is to exploit the turbo-charger's boost not as a habit but only when really necessary. Although conceding a half-litre in cylinder capacity to the Volvo, the Saab matches its performance. Claimed maximum speeds (134 mph/216 mph) are identical. The Saab is slightly, but not significantly, quicker off the mark. Both should reward economy-conscious drivers with close to 30 mpg (9.4 l/100km) on a journey. Is the Volvo 850GLT likely to seduce traditional Saab buyers out of their 9000s? I doubt it. Excellent car though it is - the best that Volvo has ever made - its face is not its fortune. Over the years, buyers of the big Swedish-made Volvos have said, in effect: never mind its looks, think how strong and safe it is. Saab buyers also go for strength and safety but like a touch of sportiness, too. Were they to try a Volvo 850GLT, they would probably be surprised how good it is. But I reckon its staid, quintessentially Volvo styling would be enough to put them off buying one.</p>

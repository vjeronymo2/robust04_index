Melara Granillo added, however, that experience shows that  continuous pursuit can lead to heavy blows against drug  trafficking, such as those delivered by the Drug Interdiction  Executive Unit [UEA] in 1993. The unit reported five major  seizures totalling 2.3 billion colones worth of cocaine.    The official told LA PRENSA GRAFICA that "had we not  intercepted the drugs, they would have harmed thousands of  people, if not in our country, surely in those for which it was  bound. This is not only a violation of human rights but a  violent attack against the victims who have fallen into the  clutches of this world-wide plague." Melara Granillo believes  drug trafficking is primarily an insidious activity in pursuit  of absolutely selfish, evil purposes. He acknowledged that drug  trafficking is highly profitable but said such economic benefits  are immoral.    The Prosecutor General's Office is well aware of its  position  regarding drug trafficking. It is making painstaking efforts to  fight this enemy with the law to see that those responsible are  tried and punished with the full force of the law.    Melara Granillo has been prosecutor general for five and  one-half months now, during which he has confirmed the seizure  of 121.598 million colones worth of cocaine. The drugs were  intercepted at El Pulido landing strip in Melara Canton, La  Libertad Municipality.    He has also certified the seizure of a second shipment worth  700 million colones at the San Jorge industrial complex on the  road to San Antonio Abad in San Salvador. A third seizure took  place 42 km off the coast of Puerto Acajutla, Sonsonate, and  included a total of 300 million colones in drugs.    The prosecutor general pointed out that never before has  there been such a relentless pursuit in El Salvador but added  that there are many clandestine landing strips remaining from  the war. There is no radar system to detect illegal aircraft.  Melara said "this is a paradise stopover that the armies of  drug traffickers have taken advantage of, because they have the  technological and economical resources to operate in countries  such as ours."    He indicated that despite all the institution's efforts, it  still faces serious financial and personnel limitations when the  ideal scenario would be for it to grow so as to face the  challenges of 1994.</p>

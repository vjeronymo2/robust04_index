			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / OFT probes property valuing THE OFFICE OF FAIR Trading confirmed yesterday that it has launched an investigation into the property valuations market. The move follows a large number of complaints from members of the public to the OFT and an exchange of letters between the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the OFT. The OFT believes the valuation market may involve enough anti-competitive practices to justify a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It warned the institution in a letter last November that it had received information about the valuation market which was of general concern. It said there was substantial evidence that many valuers were appointed to lender's panels in exchange for introducing mortgage customers to lenders. Mr Bernard Harris of the OFT said in the letter that the issue of reciprocal mortgage business appeared almost an invitation to give advice in bad faith. Under rules in force since the 1970s mortgage lenders are supposed to accept valuations where possible from surveyors nominated by borrowers. If a lender-nominated surveyor is used, the potential borrower will probably have to pay separately for a detailed structural survey. The Building Societies Association told its members in 1979 that reciprocal business should not be a 'driving condition' when selecting a valuer for a lender's panel of surveyors. It is clear, however, that this rule has largely lapsed. The association said yesterday that it was updating the circular and would issue it soon to its members and other mortgage lenders through the Council of Mortgage Lenders. The RICS has told the OFT it recognises that valuers are sometimes forced to supply mortgage business to lenders in return for being included in their panels. But it believes that this is imposed on valuers against their will by lenders.</p>

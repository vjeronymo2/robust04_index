However he gave no indication that members  would be any more ready to act than they have been since August,  when NATO threatened air strikes to relieve the siege of  Sarajevo. As expected, what we are hearing from the summit is  fine words about new partnerships for peace in East Europe but a  reluctance to deal with the most obvious source of instability  in the region. Perhaps, at heart, the President does not  consider the war in Bosnia to be a direct American concern; his  unwelcome enthusiasm for further political integration on this  side of the Atlantic suggests that he would prefer Europeans to  unite in sorting out the continent's problems on their own.    In domestic political terms, Mr Clinton can perhaps afford  to  keep his distance from the Balkans. He can hardly do the same  with the threat posed by North Korea's advancing nuclear  programme; countering proliferation is one of the main planks of  his foreign policy, and an American infantry division is  deployed between Seoul and the North Korean border. Yet the  same lack of will is painfully apparent. The main  protagonists--the United States, China, Japan and South  Korea--obviously dread the idea of Pyongyang's actually using a  nuclear bomb. But their actions suggest that mere possession of  nuclear materiel might, at a pinch, be tolerable. All concerned  hope that they can keep the situation within manageable bounds.  South Korea fears that precipitate disintegration of its  northern neighbour will result in a reunification process even  more debilitating than was Germany's. Despite their frequent  irritation with the unpredictable Kim Il-song, both China and  Japan regard a divided Korea as easier to deal with than a  united peninsula.    The main casualty of such cynicism towards the international  non- proliferation regime is the credibility of American foreign  policy. The United States has retreated from President Clinton's  fiery rhetoric of last July--when he vowed the destruction of  North Korea if it used a nuclear device--to actions that suggest  that almost any deal is worthwhile. Having declared then that  no inducements would be offered to Pyongyang until it fulfilled  its international obligations, the Administration is now  offering a string of concessions. In so doing, it has  undermined the International Atomic Energy Agency's insistence  on regular "challenge" inspections of undeclared sites.    Thus, both in Europe and Asia, Mr Clinton's much vaunted  emphasis on economic security is being undermined by his  reluctance to act decisively to safeguard political-military  security.</p>

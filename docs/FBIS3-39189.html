A  significant change has taken place in the main Western  countries, due certainly to last Saturday's [5 February]  massacre in Sarajevo, but also to the increasing realization  that the diplomatic and humanitarian effort has so far been  ineffective. This ineffectiveness has led more than one to  consider purely and simply withdrawing the UN troops in shame.    No matter what developments we will see in the coming days,  it is now clear that the Western world, under Franco-U.S.  leadership, has not opted for an immediate withdrawal from the  Bosnian theatre, but on the contrary decided to take risks there.    The White House, which has tried to ignore the problem as  long as possible, has apparently come to the conclusion that the  political price of inaction could finally be higher than that of  limited engagement. Public opinion and Congress are indeed  starting to rouse themselves and ask questions about the  abilities and leadership of President Clinton.    The U.S. decision is a double one. On the one hand it  concerns an operation with military implications to free  Sarajevo from its murderous stranglehold. On the other hand it  concerns the involvement of the United States in the peace  process. For some time the Europeans have considered U.S.  involvement of this kind in the negotiations indispensable, both  to impress the Serbs and reassure the Muslims, who do not  believe in a peace without U.S. guarantees.    This additional pressure from Washington is especially  important, at a time when the new Muslim offensive could lead to  new formidable developments in the war.    But not everything has been settled. Certainly unprecedented  pressure is being put on the warring parties, and as soon as it  is operational, the model adopted for Sarajevo could soon be  applied to Tuzla and other safe areas defined by the United  Nations. But it is not certain that the Serbs will yield. They  could play the game of resistance, reprisals, escalation and  cause the situation to become blocked. Then the question could  be raised soon of the solidity of the U.S. commitment. The  Somali and Haitian examples have showed the very relative  determination of the current administration in this type of  conflict.    It also remains to be seen if the Europeans and Americans  will agree on the nature of the peace plan to be proposed to the  three warring parties. The European Union says it is ready to  amend its plan, but it is known that Washington is very reticent  regarding a carve-up which it considers as rewarding aggression.    Finally there is the Russian problem. Moscow opposes air  strikes against the Serbs and more generally against any NATO  intervention in this region that falls within its former sphere  of influence. Russia in contrast could be a useful if not  indispensable ally in reaching a peace agreement. The Europeans  have shown their wish to gain its partnership, and Washington  has just sent an envoy there but, with the current rise in  ultranationalism and Pan-Slavism, it is certainly not the  easiest aspect of the issue to deal with.</p>

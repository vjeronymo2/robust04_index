			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Schroders ahead at interim stage Schroders, the merchant banking group, said profits for the first half of 1992 were higher than in the same period last year. Mr George Mallinckrodt, chairman, said that all three areas of the group's business - corporate finance, fund management and treasury and trading - had performed well. Schroders does not disclose detailed interim figures, but net profits for the whole of 1991 were higher at Pounds 52.1m (Pounds 31.6m). The interim dividend has been raised by 20 per cent to 6p (5p), but the company said that did not of itself imply any increase in the final for 1992.</p>

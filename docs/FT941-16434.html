			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets MILAN Italian markets are hoping that the date for general elections will be announced after Wednesday's parliamentary vote of confidence in the government. The markets became increasingly anxious last week over political infighting between those wanting an early election in April, and others who would prefer June to give the weakened centre parties more time to regroup. STOCKHOLM Today's Swedish budget is expected to provide the market with some support. However, continuing political rows over environmental issues involving the Oresund bridge project could offset otherwise positive expectations. Unibank says that with the marked strengthening of the krona and the sharp fall in long-dated interest rates in mind, the scope for a cut in the marginal lending rate has improved. FRANKFURT The German markets look likely to move sideways in the coming week, although UBS warns that the banks could continue to underperform. UBS adds that market participants were too optimistic about the impact of fresh liquidity in January. The market will be vulnerable until overhanging trading positions, bought in anticipation of a good performance, have been cleared. PARIS Inflation figures for December are due today. NatWest Securities says that another low figure should buttress the franc, reinforcing the ability of the Bank of France to lower rates once the Bundesbank moves again. LONDON FG Inversiones Bursatiles, the influential independent Spanish stockbroker, will be setting out its thoughts on the outlook for the Madrid market at a presentation in London tomorrow. Today, Davy Stockbrokers of Dublin is in London to present its view on prospects for the Irish market. TOKYO Shares, which recovered the 18,000-level after foreign buying last week, are likely to hover around that level as a result of profit-taking ahead of the March book closing. However, the Nikkei may see steady buying as a further fall in long-term interest rates could trigger a shift of funds into stocks.</p>

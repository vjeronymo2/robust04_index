			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PROPOSES TO LINK QUALITY OF CARE TO MEDICARE PAYMENTS  </P> <P> The federal Medicare program proposed new regulations Friday that would deny  payment to hospitals and physicians that deliver substandard hospital inpatient  care.  </P> <P> The new regulations would increase the government's ability "to ensure that  Medicare beneficiaries receive high-quality care," said Dr. William L. Roper,  administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration.  </P> <P> Under the regulations, peer review organizations, the watchdog groups in each  state that oversee health care for the elderly and disabled under contract to  the federal government, would be authorized to deny Medicare payments when  substandard care harms a patient or unnecessarily places the patient at high  risk.  </P> <P> Roper said poor quality care might include unnecessarily prolonged treatments  and complications that require readmission to the hospital or that lead to  disability or death.  </P> <P> The draft regulations require that patients be notified when payment is denied  for poor quality care; they also prohibit physicians and hospitals from  charging patients in such instances.  </P> <P> When the review groups find that care is substandard but does not result in  harm to the patient, Medicare would pay for the claim but the review group  would be expected to conduct a follow-up review and work with the physicians  and hospitals responsible to correct the problem.  </P> <P> The new regulations were required by Congress. The health care agency said it  would issue final regulations after a 60-day comment period.  </P></p>

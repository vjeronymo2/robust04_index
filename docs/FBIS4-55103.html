			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 8 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel  said today the engagement of Czech units in the Persian Gulf and  in the former Yugoslavia had followed up the performance of the  Legions in World War One and of the Czechoslovak soldiers in  fighting World War Two on the Allied side.    Havel was speaking at a ceremony at Prague Castle at which  he  appointed two new generals on the occasion of the 49th  anniversary of the end of World War Two. Rostislav Kotil will  hold the rank during his tenure as commander of the UNPROFOR  [United Nations Protection Forces] South sector.    Havel stressed that it was important that the Czech society  "be capable of expressing through concrete deeds our  willingness, will and courage to both defend our own freedom and  independence and to take part in the joint international defence  of democratic values anywhere where they are being trampled on."    "No one will give us any security guarantees unless he is  sure that we ourselves are capable of defending our country and  of taking on the broader responsibility which we are demanding  on the part of others at the same time," Havel stressed.    Present at the ceremony were military attaches from Russia,  the United States, Britain and France, and World War Two  veterans.</p>

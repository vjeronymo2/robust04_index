			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Arts: Mad laughter in the face of death - Martin Hoyle reviews three one-man shows on the Fringe Only Edinburgh at festival time could offer three one-man shows of such diversity in one day. The settings are Russia, England and New York, the performers British, Belgian and American. All three court mad laughter in the face of death. The Traverse has revived Moscow Stations. Stephen Mulrine's adaptation of Venedikt Yerofeev's novel was a success last year and comes back with its protagonist, Tom Courtenay, in unstoppable form. Since the shock ending casts a retrospective shadow over the preceding action, transforming it into a nightmare trip into eternity, I had forgotten how funny much of the play is. This year Mulrine's version seems more brilliantly apt than ever: it flows naturally, idiomatically, and convinces in its portrayal of a society classless enough for strangers on a train to discuss the bibulous propensities of Goethe and Schiller, the drink tragedy of Mother Russia, and how Mussorgsky was happier lying drunk in a ditch than completing Khovanshchina. The travellers are portrayed as grotesques by the narrator, the author himself, though how much credence we should give to Courtenay's beady-eyed mockery is uncertain; for the plaintively carping Yerofeev is an alcoholic. His gift for self-deprecation is defensive, getting in quickly to pre-empt others. He also has a dash of that favourite Russian figure, the holy fool. 'God is good. I too am good and blessed,' he avers; and we even hear the angelic voices that tell him how long it is to opening time and suggest that he might try the station buffet until then. Courtenay's great gift is the suggestion of vulnerable intelligence. Terminally weary, haggardly whimsical, Yerofeev is just the sort of literate social derelict to enrage the thugs who eventually kill him. Meanwhile he entertains us with the never-ending train journey to Petushki. The London Underground might do worse than adopt the Russian railway inspector's penalty for those found without tickets: a gramme of vodka per kilometre travelled. Failing vodka, he settles for cliff-hanging stories. Thus Yerofeev has made his weekly trip for three years without paying, holding the inspector spellbound with the spicier aspects of world history - though arriving at Bush, Saddam Hussein and Thatcher, he decides there is nowhere else to go. Distorted perspective, ominous music and sensitive lighting evoke that urban malaise and dream-like foreboding that are something of a speciality in Ian Brown's direction. Courtenay shows his mettle as a great actor, and his respect for 'other people's dark corners, even if there's nothing in them but garbage' transforms that garbage into treasure. In the studio space of Traverse 2, the late Derek Jarman goes rather more gently into that good night. The young Belgian actor Kris Cuppens performs, in only occasionally accented English, Modern Nature, an adaptation by Rudi Meutemans of the film-maker's diaries. The Brussels premiere was attended by Jarman himself late last year; he hoped to help the British production. Opening with the diagnosis in 1986 that Jarman was HIV positive, the reminiscences move forward to the cottage and beloved garden in Dungeness and back to the peripatetic childhood. Boarding school, art college, early sexual adventures; no bitterness: 'You won't hear me complaining. I'm happy.' Kuppens' likeable performance is relaxed and natural, a mixture of the character's no-nonsense insight and unquenched idealism: 'I've never believed in the gold at the end of the rainbow. I still believe in the rainbow, though.' Jarman would have enjoyed Nicky, the hero of The Diary of a New York Queen, inappropriately housed in the Church Hill Theatre with its austere church hall atmosphere. At first Harold Finley, small, hyperactive and black, seems a bit too much, too everything - eyes and teeth, screeching, mincing, flouncing. But gradually there emerges a tightly-controlled and highly stylised shape to Nicky's days and nights of work in theatrical costumes (for a musical called Grind, directed by Hal Prince, no less), clubbing, gossipping, insulting his long-suffering live-in boyfriend Harvey. Like those other great diarists Charles Pooter and Adrian Mole, Nicky reveals as much about himself as the world he chronicles.</p>

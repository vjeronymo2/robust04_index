Reexport of the commodities indicated in the first part of  the present article shall be conducted only with the properly  documented written permission issued by an authorized department  of the country of origin of the commodities.    The Parties shall exchange lists of commodities which can be  re-exported only with this kind of properly documented written  permission.

Other commodities shall be re-exported in compliance with  rules generally accepted in international trade.  <H5>  Article 2 </H5>   For purposes of the present Agreement re-export shall be  understood to mean the shipment of commodities originating on  the customs territory of one of the Parties by another Party  outside the customs territory of the latter in order to ship  them to a country that is not a party to the present Agreement.    Sanctioned re-export shall be understood to mean the  re-export of commodities with properly documented written  permission issued by an authorized department of the country of  origin of the commodities.

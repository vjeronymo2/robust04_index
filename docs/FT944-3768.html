			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Competition sends a tradition off the rails: ABB's Derby carriage works are threatened There are plenty of reminders of Derby's 150-year history of train making in the office of Mr Bo Sodersten, managing director of ABB Transportation's Derby Carriage Works. The slow tick of a pre-nationalisation railway clock accompanies the words of the man who has restructured the company over the past three years. On the wall above his desk hangs a 1950s painting of activity at the works by Terence Cuneo. But the traditions of a proud railway town came under threat last week. On Thursday London Transport announced that an order worth Pounds 800m to Pounds 900m for more than 100 Underground trains is to go to rival bidder GEC-Alsthom. The contract, one of the first under the government's private finance initiative, covers not only the supply of rolling stock for the Tube's ageing Northern Line but also 20 years' worth of maintenance work. Mr Sodersten said ABB Transportation, formerly British Rail Engineering (BREL) but acquired in 1992 by ABB, a Swedish-Swiss engineering group, has only a few months work left at its Derby works. It is completing the delivery of 700 carriages for the Underground's Central Line and has a small order to supply carriages for the Royal Mail. It expects to announce early in the new year the loss of up to 600 jobs out of the 2,500 currently provided by the carriage works. The repair and maintenance work which provides jobs for the rest of the carriage works employees has remained steady. Mr Eric Drewery, chief executive of ABB's UK operations, said he had no complaints about the way the Northern Line contract was awarded. But he felt that the failure to win the order was scant reward for the hard work ABB Transportation put into improving efficiency at Derby. 'When we first bought into BREL in 1989 there was low productivity, massive overmanning and inadequate investment,' he said. 'Since then business on all our sites has been transformed.' The workforce at Derby, Crewe and York has been reduced from 8,300 to 4,500 and costs have been pared. The company used to have two years' worth of stocks on average. It now has less than two weeks' worth. ABB made much of the threat to jobs when making its bid for the Northern Line contract. Mr Drewery feels it was valid to highlight the importance of maintaining jobs at Derby to government and customers. He said: 'In a couple of years, when the train operating companies have been franchised and the rolling stock leasing companies have been privatised, there will be a tremendous market for rolling stock. We needed help to maintain our core competences until the market comes back.' Mr Drewery said that with a monthly wage bill of Pounds 1.5m for the Central Line contract, ABB Transportation could not keep on the workforce unless there was work to do. Mr Stig Svard, who takes over responsibility for the carriage works from Mr Sodersten in January, sees parallels with the UK bus industry, which has been deregulated and privatised. He said: 'The bus industry adjusted to new orders after two to three years.' The dearth of rolling stock orders has been one factor in the poor performance of the UK business recently. In 1993 ABB Transportation made a loss of Pounds 9.8m on turnover of Pounds 518m, with a Pounds 12.4m charge for redundancy and other restructuring costs. Rolling stock orders have continued to come in from around the world, however. The company won a Dollars 900m (Pounds 550m) order for more than 100 locomotives from the German railway last week. Mr Svard believes he would approach things differently in future. 'We wouldn't put all our cards on the table (at the outset).  We would disclose as much as we needed to.  We know know that we would only need to put in the principles of our bid and not the figures.'</p>

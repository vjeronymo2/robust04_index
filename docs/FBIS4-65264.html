			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara and Denktas are playing games as they  attempt to remove all responsibility from the Turkish side, or  at least to have its responsibility diminished, for the lack of  progress in the talks due to the well-known stance of the  Turkish Cypriot leader. This statement was made today by acting  Government Spokesman Spiros Arotis when he was asked to comment  on the lengthy explanations Gustave Feissel, UN secretary  general's alternate special representative, gave in Vienna to  Rauf Denktas' two advisers. These explanations were made during  the past two days in the presence of Turkish Deputy Foreign  Minister Tugay Ulucevik and Robert Lamb, U.S. coordinator on  Cyprus. Mr. Arotis noted that Ankara and Rauf Denktas have  played the same game many times in the past. He added: If  Ankara wanted, it could find ways to persuade Rauf Denktas to  accept the 21 March document.    Responding to another question, the acting government  spokesman said the Cyprus Government hopes the UN secretary  general's report will be circulated without any further delay.  He also emphasized President Glavkos Kliridhis' statement that  the report should call a spade a spade and noted alternative  ways for a Cyprus solution.    Rauf Denktas has threatened to unite the pseudostate with  Turkey if Cyprus is accepted as a full member of the European  Union [EU]. His threat is aimed at putting pressure on the EU,  specifically on some of its members, so Cyprus' application for  accession will be denied. This statement was made by Spiros  Arotis today when asked to comment on the statement made by Rauf  Denktas in Turkey. Mr. Arotis expressed the conviction that  Denktas' threats would not find any response whatsoever in the  EU; he also feels that the international community would not  allow Rauf Denktas to proceed in this direction. Besides, Mr.  Arotis added, there is also the reaction of the Turkish  Cypriots. He pointed out that Turkey itself also seeks  accession to the EU.</p>

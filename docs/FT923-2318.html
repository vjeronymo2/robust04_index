			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Law firm retains earnings title SLAUGHTER and May, the City solicitors, has maintained its position as the UK's most profitable law firm in the year to March, according to an earnings league table published yesterday by the magazine Legal Business, Robert Rice writes. The firm had average net profit per partner of Pounds 390,000 on turnover of Pounds 113m, and profit per fee earner (lawyer) of Pounds 67,000. It has 567 fee earners. Slaughter and May has increased profitability against flat turnover. Last year it had average net profit per partner of Pounds 377,000 on turnover of Pounds 113m. Its nearest rival was again Linklaters &amp; Paines, with average net profit of Pounds 380,000 on turnover of Pounds 154m, and profit per fee earner of Pounds 75,000. Linklaters has 718 fee earners. The figures show that in general Britain's top law firms appear to be surviving the recession well. The magazine says gross revenues have increased slightly and profits have remained high. The top 35 firms had a combined turnover of more than Pounds 2bn.</p>

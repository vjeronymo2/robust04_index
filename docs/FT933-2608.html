			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities calm ahead of futures expiry A CALMER session in both stock index futures and equities saw the FT-SE 100 Index recover the 3,000 mark yesterday, to the relief of market analysts. There was an easing of the pressures of the expiry this morning of the September Footsie future contract which lay behind much of the setback in share prices in the previous session. By the close the futures contract was nearly in line with the underlying market, in readiness for today's expiry. The latest UK employment data made little impression, nor did the market respond to political nervousness over criticism of government policy by Mr Norman Lamont, former chancellor of the exchequer. Corporate developments provided the features and underlined the market's apparent readiness to trade at current levels. The most inspiring, if not the most unexpected, came from the confirmation that the administrator of Mirror Group Newspapers is ready to offer his 55 per cent stake. A slow start saw share prices at first continue the uncertainty which has plagued them for the past two weeks. Progress was slow but, closely mirroring the stock index futures contract, the Footsie recaptured 3,000 in mid-afternoon. Equities were helped by a firmer trend in UK government bonds and in other European equity markets. The second half of the session held steady but without providing excitement. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,003.9 for a net gain on the day of 14.5 points. London brushed aside a sluggish start on Wall Street, down 7 Dow points in UK hours. Trading volume was relatively high, although yesterday's Seaq total of 668.6m shares fell below the 741.9m of the previous day. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.5bn on Wednesday, confirming that profit-taking had been significant, but not particularly alarming. Analysts' views on this week's shakeout were summed up by Mr Trevor Laugharne at Kleinwort Benson, who said that the fall below Footsie 3,000 should not cause undue alarm, and reflected mildly negative forces rather than 'the first hoof beat from the horsemen of the Apocalypse'. Kleinwort 'welcomes a healthy correction' and stays with its belief that the Footsie is likely to fall to a support level of around 2,970. Although the rally in government bonds was very modest, confidence on base rate cut prospects recovered. Consequently, there were significant rallies among the interest-related issues, with retail stores generally adding a few pence. The sector was helped by a successful deal in the US by Dixons, the British high street electronics retailer. Wall Street's firmness overnight, together with a steadier one in the currency markets, enabled the blue chip international stocks to stage a recovery. Pharmaceuticals and oil shares, both heavily-weighted components of UK market indices, found support. Second line issues remained under a cloud, however, as would-be sellers still found it hard to find buyers for stock taken aboard at the market's peak. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a broad range of non-Footsie stocks, dipped 2.9 points to 3,421.2. While some turmoil in share prices is possible this morning during the futures expiry, dealers' nerves seemed much steadier last night.</p>

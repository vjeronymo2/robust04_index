			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Management: A very uneasy alliance - The client/consultant relationship Why are companies which hire consultants so often disappointed with the results? And why do consultants often feel disappointed with the practical outcomes of their work? A report* of a recent study of consultants and their business clients reveals the problem is caused by the different views each side has about the relationship. Consultants view 'relationship building' and achieving 'trusting, warm, equal, experimental and open relationships' as the most important part of client-consultant relationships. However, clients emphasise that consultants must be aware of the practicalities facing them and want value for money. When asked what happens in practice, clients say that consultants are often not expert in managing change. The study was carried out by researchers at the University of Sheffield who conducted interviews with 22 organisational change management consultants from a leading British commercial service organisation and with 16 of their clients. The report showed that consultants emphasised the importance of rapport, and of 'working together'. The consultants stressed working at the client's pace, rather than demanding too much change. Clients' overriding concerns were that consultants should use time effectively, remain objective (which consultants acknowledged they had difficulty doing) and give value for money. The results revealed that both sides felt the consultant should listen to the client's views and agreed the client should 'own' the problem and take responsibility for solving it. Both agreed there should be clear objectives and that mutual honesty was important. Consultants criticised clients for using unnecessarily technical language to describe their organisational problems. Clients, on the other hand, said consultants used too much 'consultancy speak' which hampered their ability to work effectively together. The report also describes what happens in practice during client/consultant relationships. Clients reported that in less than one in three cases did they feel confidence in the consultant's expertise to manage change. In the majority of cases they felt consultants were not aware of the organisational practicalities facing them. The report advises consultants and clients to place more emphasis on clarifying what they want to achieve and the type of working relationship they will have. Clear aims and objectives for the consultancy project should be established at the outset. There should always be a clear contract and, given the pressure on consultants to win contracts, clients should check relevant experience of the consultant. Both sides should be clear about whether the consultant is expected to provide expert advice or to adopt a counselling role. Consultants must understand the practicalities facing the client within the organisation and not simply adopt 'off-the-shelf' solutions. Clients want tailor-made solutions from the consultants which reflect the challenges they face, not formulas applied as universal panaceas. Consultants should also avoid using jargon and 'consultancy speak' which can alienate clients. Clients should be more accessible to consultants and less passive in the process by working with them to find answers. The process of consultancy the research suggests, involves clients and consultants working together in an active collaborative relationship to find solutions to organisational challenges. *Management consultancy: dimensions of client/consultant relationships.

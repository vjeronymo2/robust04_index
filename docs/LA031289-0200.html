			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVENTURE TRAVEL;  </P> <P> MOLOKAI AN EASY RIDE FOR BICYCLISTS  </P> <P> My wife, Elfriede, and I rented a tandem bicycle on Maui and brought it by  ferry across the 20 miles of the Molokai Channel.  </P> <P> A few moments of pedaling down the main street of Ala Malama showed us why this  island, long known as "Friendly Island," is being rediscovered as the "Bicycle  Island."  </P> <P> It has no stop-and-go signals, the pavement is wide and traffic is light. We  cycled slowly past colorful stores and quaint shops, its small civic center and  tiny budget-priced cafes and restaurants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friendly Smiles  </P> <P> Townspeople waved and smiled. One suggested we stop at Kanemitsu's Bakery for  fresh Molokai bread.  </P> <P> Progressive Travels, Seattle-based under new ownership, is capitalizing on this  friendliness by continuing a second year of Molokai bicycle adventures, with 11  tours scheduled through December. Bike tours have options for hiking and riding  mules on clifftrails.  </P> <P> The only public transportation on Molokai is three taxis. Rental cars are  available at the main airport. Traffic along Kamehameha Highway, east and west  of Kaunakakai, is light.  </P> <P> When biking Molokai on your own, the biggest decision is always which way to go  each day. The island is about 10 miles wide north to south, and about 60 miles  from east to west.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prime Choice  </P> <P> The Overlook at Palaau State Park on the north coast has one of the most  dramatic views in the Pacific, overlooking the vertical rise of the world's  highest sea cliffs, towering 3,300 feet above the crashing surf.  </P> <P> Directly below the Overlook, down 1,600 feet of cliffside, is Kalaupapa  Peninsula, site of the former leper colony and the spiritual center during 1989  for what has been declared the Father Damien Centennial Year by Hawaii and  Belgium.  </P> <P> Father Damien de Voester came to this isolated colony from Belgium and died  after he contracted the then-incurable disease of leprosy while serving its  victims from 1873 to 1889.  </P> <P> Asthey have for years, visitors take a mule or hike down the steep trail of 23  switchbacks. Writer Jack London also hiked this trail to pay homage to Father  Damien.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leprosy No Danger  </P> <P> The guided-mule ride down the three-mile trail takes about 1 1/2 hours. Mules  have been trained to step carefully and stay close to the inside edge of the  narrow trail.  </P> <P> Hiking down or up the trail can take 1 1/2 hours each way, although anyone  accustomed to mountaining can make the climb in about 40 minutes. The hike is  timed so not to encounter the mules. Trying to edge by could be upsetting to  them and dangerous.  </P> <P> The low green growth covering the rocks beside the trail give it the appearance  of a lei twisting down the face of the cliff. The trail was carved in 1886 as a  supply route.  </P> <P> </P> <P> White Surf, High Cliffs  </P> <P> Kalaupapa Peninsula is framed by white surf and the sea. The high cliffs rising  along the north coast seem to block it off from the rest of the world.  </P> <P> St. Philomena Church has been restored for this centennial year; April 15 marks  the 100th anniversary of Damien's death.  </P> <P> There will be special commemorative tributes throughout the islands.  </P> <P> To preserve today's tranquillity in Kalaupapa village, visits via the small  peninsula airport or the mule trail must be scheduled through Damien Hawaii  Tours or Rare Adventures. Residents also can sponsor a visitor.  </P> <P> The Rare Adventures Mule-Ride package is $75 and the Hike-In package is $30.  Both include the trail trek, community tour and picnic lunch.  </P> <P> Two of four other churches designed and built by Father Damien have been  preserved.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on the bike tour to other areas of the island, stop near the  junction of highways 470 and 460 where a hike of little more than an hour along  a forest-reserve road leads into the Kamakou Nature Conservancy rain forest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Largest Landholder  </P> <P> Molokai Ranch, the largest landholder on the island, is the site of Wildlife  Park with its giraffes, zebras, East African crowned cranes, antelope, Barbary  sheep and Japanese deer. Tour safaris are $12 for adults, $6 for children under  12.  </P> <P> On another day a bicycle ride to the east end of the island reaches the remains  of a 7th-Century village, small farms and two big waterfalls.  </P> <P> Progressive Travels bicycle and walking tours are based at the Kaluakoi Hotel  and Golf Club Resort, spread over 6,800 acres adjacent to Molokai Ranch.  Accommodations are in two-story redwood buildings around the entrance lobby.  </P> <P> The Progressive package for four days on Molokai and three on Maui is $1,495.  It includes a room, meals, bicycles, guides and support vehicles. Contact  Progressive Travels through your travel agent or call toll-free (800) 245-2229.  </P> <P> On your own a four-day, three-night package at Kaluakoi Resort starts at $399  per person, double occupancy. In addition to meals and accommodations it  includes a bicycle and compact rental car. Call (800) 367-6046.  </P> <P> To be centrally based near the town of Kaunakakai, the Hotel Molokai and Pau  Hana Inn maintain the Polynesian mood of old Molokai with double rooms  beginning at $55 at the hotel and $39 at the inn.

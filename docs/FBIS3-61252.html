			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Havrylovych Batyuk, ambassador </F> extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Ukraine to the United  Nations, by Lidiya Korsun, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA special  correspondent in the United States, under the rubric "National  Treasures," at the Ukrainian UN mission, date not given: "Not  Only the Gold Itself May Be the Gold of the State...."]    [Excerpts] Who is he, the permanent representative of  Ukraine at the United Nations? Why was this responsible mission  at the premiere international commonwealth in the world  entrusted precisely to him and a small group of coworkers?    So, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Viktor  Batyuk is an interlocutor of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA.    First, a short file. Viktor Batyuk is 54. He graduated  from the Institute of International Relations in Moscow. He held  diplomatic positions in the organization of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of Ukraine: at the Permanent Mission of Ukraine  at the United Nations (New York, 1968-1973), as an aide to the  minister, the general secretary of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs (1974-1977), the permanent representative of Ukraine at  the offices of the United Nations and other international  organizations in Geneva (1978-1984), and as the chief of the  department of international organizations and member of the  collegium of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine  (1985-1991).    On 4 March 1992 he was appointed a permanent  representative of Ukraine at the UN.    Within Ukrainian delegations, he has taken part in many  international meetings, as well as 20 sessions of the UN General  Assembly.    Also, he is a member of the Union of Writers of  Ukraine, a translator of the works of Indian and American  writers.    He is married with three children.    The diplomatic corps of the Ukrainian UN mission  consists of:    Volodymyr Khandohiy--deputy permanent representative;    Oleksandr Motsyk and Oleksandr Horyn--first secretaries;    Viktor Andriyaka, Ihor Humennyy, and Valeriy  Kyrychenko--second secretaries;    Vitaliy Malashchenko--an attache.    All have special higher education. Their average age is  37.    With one exception, all are married. [passage  omitted]    [Korsun] Viktor, let us discuss the issues of our mission.    [Batyuk] At present, Ukraine has its diplomatic missions in  a  few dozen countries. As has already been mentioned, 184 states  belong to the United Nations. Consequently, contacts are  maintained through us with countries in which our embassies do  not operate (we bring to their attention the positions of our  government, political statements, and so on). This is an  intensive and great effort. For us, vacations once every two  years have been established.    [Korsun] What is the difference between the functions of the  Ukrainian representative at the UN in the environment of the  former Union and at present, when we have an independent state?    [Batyuk] The difference is striking. Previously, it was like  this: The landlord and a live-in son-in-law sat on a block. The  latter merely listened, and had no right to put in a word of his  own. At one time, ours was a decorative, pro forma mission,  despite the fact that the flag of Ukraine flew over the common  building. We now say our word outloud, pursue the policy of an  independent Ukraine, and work out our course independently and  follow it independently.    [Korsun] How do our neighbors, the Russian mission, respond  to this? Does their leading, supreme role manifest itself (say,  through information)?    [Batyuk] We feel supremacy. To be sure, there are no  complaints concerning purely human relations between colleagues.  However, the congenital "great-power attitude" is frequently all  too obvious. Besides, we room with in-laws. For example, a  "directive" comes: Effective 1 February of this year, payments  for the use of such and such services will be increased by this  amount. There are no explanations as to why. Visitors come to us  here, to this reception room. Some ask before the conversation,  pointing at the adjacent wall: "Will Mr. Vorontsov  (representative of Russia at the UN--note by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA)  hear our conversation?" I happen to answer "Yes" because  important texts sent by fax to the UKRINFORM for some reason  suddenly end up in the adjacent mission. Or else this "thing"  which was recently installed by the neighbors. (He pointed at  the ceiling.) They said that this was additional fire protection  equipment. It is strange because issues of reliable fire  prevention were resolved here a long time ago. Once again, they  did not consult us even 'for the sake of appearances' about the  'fire alarm' system."    [Korsun] Can we say this in the newspaper? Is this not a  diplomatic secret?    [Batyuk] No, this is not a secret. This is our predicament.  This is why the issue of moving our mission to separate premises  remains pressing. A search for ways to resolve this problem is  underway. First of all, it is necessary for Russia to return the  share due us in a 13-floor building which was legally acquired  in 1964 by three states--the USSR, Ukraine, and Belarus. Russia  is in no hurry to relinquish its control over diplomatic  property. I think that our ministry should raise this property  problem before the Government of Ukraine in an acute and  resolute manner for the latter, in its turn, to press Moscow:  "Return to us what is ours." Otherwise, only Russia will present  bills for "our debts." At present, it is difficult, almost  impossible, for Ukraine to equip embassies in other countries  "from square one." For example, our diplomatic mission in Turkey  is crowded into a few hotel rooms. At the same time, it is felt  that the significance of our UN mission is somewhat  underestimated. To my mind, we should buy something even below  38th Street where establishments of this rank are not located.  However, housing costs two times less there. At the beginning,  let it be the way it is. Let our poverty shine through. However,  as Oles Honchar said, on the other hand, we have freedom and  independence. Enough of this living and feeling as if we are in  a single kolkhoz called the USSR.    [Korsun] I know that the Ukrainian community in the United  States, which has already established the Fund of Aid to  Ukrainian Diplomatic Missions, sympathizes with you.    [Batyuk] Yes. I am immensely grateful for this. The building  of our embassy in Washington is being outfitted with the monies  collected by the fund; the building of the consulate in New  York, the official opening of which is planned for this year, is  being repaired. The consulate in Chicago has been in operation  for a year now. Here, the fund has also joined us in order to  purchase some equipment. In particular, we received a copier and  installed a trident at the entrance to our floor; on request,  they provide consumer services to the members of Ukrainian  delegations, and so on. Thus, our countrymen help us here with  more than just words and applause....    [Korsun] A mountain of debts to the UN is dragging Ukraine  down....    [Batyuk] A contribution amounting to 1.87 percent of the UN  budget has been established for our state. This proportion is  obviously overstated. It was calculated on the basis of the  Union total when the ratio of the karbovanets to the dollar was  likewise overstated. There are also a number of other reasons.  Everybody understands them, but for now nothing can be done,  although we continuously strive to establish the truth. As of  today, our debt to the UN comes to $95 million. If we do not pay  $19 million before the end of this year, we will lose the right  to vote in the General Assembly. This has already happened to  some small countries. We would prefer not to end up on this  list. Unfortunately, only $1.5 million has been paid so far out  of the $19 million.    [Korsun] It would be interesting to know what the overall  budget for maintenance of the UN comes to.    [Batyuk] At present, $1 billion is the annual budget for  general expenditures and tentatively $3 billion for peacekeeping  and security measures. The latter number changes depending on  the situation and the existence of hot spots in the world. In  recent years this item of expenditure has increased severalfold.    [Korsun] You mentioned the 13-floor building which you  "inhabit" together with Russia. How many floors does your team  have?    [Batyuk] Russia has allocated one floor to us. Certainly,  this is not enough. Missions of independent states of the former  USSR--Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,  and Kyrgyzstan--also have some space. Both we and they have  cramped working conditions. Our team includes 13 employees, of  whom eight are diplomats and five are support personnel (a  secretary, an accountant, a driver, a typist, and a janitor).    [Korsun] In one of the interviews, you complained about a  lack of qualified cadres in conjunction with an extensive entry  by Ukraine into the worldwide diplomatic space. Are you happy  with your assistants?    [Batyuk] It is possible to do business with those I now work  with. Our shortcomings are common and concern almost all  diplomats. We grew up in the environment of Russification and a  lack of ethnic identity. Many lack the experience of working in  an independent state. Professional qualities are desirable for  each one of us first of all.    [Korsun] What are the arrangements for your coworkers as far  as the way of life, schooling for their children, etc., are  concerned?    [Batyuk] Three families--mine, the secretary's, and the  driver's--live in this building where our permanent working  offices are located. The rest of the families live in the  so-called "white house" (it is just that its color is white).  This is a residential building for families from the missions of  the former Union. It has about 200 apartments now.    The children of our employees go either to American schools  (if they began to study in younger grades here) or to a Russian  school (if they were older when they came here). All children  also attend the Ukrainian "Native School" on Saturday. For  example, my grandson Ivan, who is seven and a half, went to an  English school. Certainly, one day of instruction in the  Ukrainian school per week is clearly not enough. The example of  the former GDR would be desirable. As is known, Germans are a  nation with a markedly manifested national sentiment.  Previously, if there were as few as two school-age children in a  German diplomatic mission, a permanent teacher was assigned to  them for daily instruction. [passage omitted]</p>

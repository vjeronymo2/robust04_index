			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "If NATO Carries Out Air Strikes, the Negative </F> Impact Will Be Great"]    [Text] The ultimatum sent by NATO to the Bosnian Serbs is  going to expire at 0800 this morning (Hong Kong time). When  readers read this newspaper, UN troops and NATO commanders  should have made the final military assessment and decided  whether or not Serbian troops have met the demands set by the  ultimatum and whether or not NATO warplanes will bomb positions  held by Serbian troops.    Two new situations have arisen at the 11th hour before  making  a decision: The first is Russia's diplomatic and military  intervention and the Serbs' intended troop withdrawal, and the  second is that the withdrawal of Serbian troops is hindered by  heavy snow, and it is unlikely that the withdrawal can be  completed on time.    It is understandable that heavy snow creates difficulties  which make it impossible for the Serbs to complete the  withdrawal within two or three days, and it will be even more  difficult for UN and NATO authorities to examine whether or not  Serbian troops have met the demands. Moreover, the fact that  heavy snow has sealed mountain passes makes it easier for  Serbian troops to stay in concealment. It is hard enough for  NATO warplanes to find targets over boundless mountain forest,  but now it is even more difficult to do so. NATO and Clinton  asserted that the ultimatum would not be extended, but it is  another matter whether or not air strikes will be launched  immediately following the expiration of the ultimatum.    Russia's intervention helped Serbian troops back down, but  also complicated the problem, which may bring about U.S.-Russian  antagonism. U.S. President Clinton sets his diplomatic focus at  keeping Russia on the "reform" course of leaning toward the  West, particularly keeping Yeltsin's position since he has  assumed office. Hence, Clinton met Yeltsin three times over the  past year. However, nationalism is gaining ground and the  balance of political forces has changed in Russia under the  difficult situation. Therefore, Yeltsin has to take a high  profile towards the Serbs, but dares not follow the West. In  this way, if NATO and the United States wantonly take punitive  actions against the Serbs, U.S.-Russian relations will  definitely deteriorate and the political and economic situation  of Russia will certainly be affected, thus impacting the overall  international situation.    The Clinton administration has always wavered in dealing  with  the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina since it took power. In his  presidential campaign, Clinton criticized Bush as weak and  incompetent, saying that he would dispatch a shock brigade to  march to the Sarajevo Airport. However, faced with the  complicated situation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as acting  under the constraints of allied powers and the U.S. people, all  Clinton could do after assuming office was to air-drop food to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Now, in assuming airs of launching air strikes at whatever  cost, Clinton has two things in mind: The first one is to  coerce the Muslims to accept a political settlement package  which will be even more unfavorable to them than the previous  ones, and the second one is to seize the opportunity to increase  U.S. influence in the Balkans.    Although it fails to control the worsening situation of  former Yugoslavia, the United States has secretly penetrated its  influence there. Last year, the United States successfully  sought the approval of Albania in renting a naval base and  stationing two spy aircraft there, and then dispatched 300  troops, while flaunting the banner of UN forces, to Macedonia  where conflicts would break out. It was reported that every week  over the past few months, there has been a U.S. four-star  general coming to Macedonia for inspection. Foreign journalists  stated that these moves were certainly not as simple as  inspiring troops' morale.    Hence, this explains why Yeltsin must make a quick response  to the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    NATO is assuming a strong posture and it seems that air  strikes are imminent. However, viewed from the latest  situation, the worst-case scenario can be averted. As the Serbs  are "so wise as to suffer short-term losses" and are willing to  cooperate with NATO, it is believed that the West is also  willing to "back down after making small gains" in order to  avoid armed clashes.    If the armed clashes do break out, the negative impact is  obvious. First, bombs will lead to retaliation, the security of  UN forces will be severely threatened, and humanitarian aid will  have to be suspended again. Consequently, there will be greater  casualties and more civilians will suffer.    Second, the Serbs may intensify their retaliatory attacks  against other towns and areas after giving up their tactic of  besieging Sarajevo, and the war may spread to Kosovo, a region  mainly populated by Albanians, and to Macedonia. In this way  the civil war of Bosnia-Herzegovina will develop into an  international conflict, and Albania and Greece will be dragged  into it.    Furthermore, even when air strikes helped rescue Sarajevo  from the siege or put down the conflict between the Muslims and  the Serbs, it does not imply that the civil war will be over.  As a matter of fact, the war between the Muslims and the Croats  is no less violent than that between the Muslims and the Serbs.  Are NATO and the United States ready to intervene further?    It seems that the positive results of air strikes are  limited, but the negative impact cannot be underestimated. NATO  and the United States must deploy massive numbers of ground  forces if they want to rely on armed strength to settle this  civil war which has been fought for nearly two years. Are they  ready to fight a "Desert Storm-type" large-scale war? Now,  various countries in the West do not think so.    In any case, if NATO really launches air strikes today, it  does not imply the immediate ending of the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina but rather the beginning of another round of  more violent and complicated conflicts.</p>

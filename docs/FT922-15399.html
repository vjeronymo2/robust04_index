			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Smoking gun fires blanks - Ballot Box It is not the smoking gun of this general election. A leaked policy document on economic strategy prepared by one of John Smith's advisers had some of the Tory tabloids yesterday conjuring up chilling images of devaluation, tax increases and spending cuts under Labour. Their problem was that the paper was written two years ago - before the present recession and before John Major took sterling into the exchange rate mechanism. Neil Kinnock briskly disowned it. For all that, the paper provides a fascinating insight into the problems that an incoming Labour government would face - and of the policy options which are likely to be floating around if Smith makes it to the Treasury. The author was Andrew Graham, a Balliol don who has been helping to reformulate Labour's economic strategy since 1987. Well before the recession took its toll on public finances he was addressing the dilemmas that would face an incoming government: meeting its spending commitments without sparking runaway borrowing and inflation, and closing the trade gap by making British industry more competitive. It was Graham's preferred responses which provided the tabloids with their ammunition. His first was devaluation (he assumed correctly the pound would be in the ERM) to boost industrial competitiveness. His second was a tax increase to meet some of its spending commitments. His third was a deal with public-sector workers gradually to close the pay gap with the private sector. But what is striking about the document is its almost self-conscious sobriety. Devaluation, it suggests, should be accompanied by a squeeze on domestic demand to direct resources into the overseas sector and by a firm commitment to lock the exchange rate into European monetary union thereafter. The government would have to accept high unemployment as a fact of life. A tight fiscal policy would demand either spending cuts or tax increases. Smith can claim that none of these options are Labour policy. But if he makes it to 11 Downing Street, he might do worse than look again at the analysis.</p>

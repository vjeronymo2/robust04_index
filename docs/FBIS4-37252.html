			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah: "Al-Asnaj Tells AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT: Urgent Contacts With Ghali To Urge New International  Move"]    [Text] London -- South Yemen Foreign Minister 'Abdallah  al-Asnaj has stressed that the southern leadership is going to  seek urgent contacts with UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali  over the latest military developments.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT al-Asnaj said that the  south will urge the UN secretary general to make a move in the  framework of the UN Security Council resolution, which  authorizes him to brief the Security Council on developments in  the situation in Yemen and to discuss the means capable of  deterring the regime from violating international legitimacy and  putting it in its place as an enemy of humanity and peace in the  regime. The southern foreign minister accused President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih of working to thwart the efforts being made by  the UN secretary general and his special envoy to Yemen Lakhdar  Ibrahimi to establish peace in Yemen.    He said that the continuation of the war declared by  President Salih against the Yemeni people in the Democratic  Republic of Yemen confirms his aggressive tendency and the  untruthfulness of what he says, namely that he has accepted UN  Security Council Resolution 924, which calls for an immediate  cease-fire in Yemen. Al-Asnaj stressed that President's Salih  forces, which are besieging Aden, have over the past two days  shelled mosques, schools, and residential areas. And that they  have fired more than seven rockets on the city, killing many  children, women, and men in various parts of Lahij and Aden  Governorates.    He also said that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is living under a big  delusion, namely that he is still president of what used to be  called the Republic of Yemen. He said that his attack on Aden  and his haphazard bombardment of it have provoked feelings of  anger in Arab, Islamic, and many other states.    The Yemeni minister, who is expected to arrive in Washington  within the next 24 hours in the framework of southern diplomatic  moves designed to rally political support for the new republic,  added that the international community is tired of the northern  leadership's attitudes after the confirmation of its  noncompliance with the UN Security Council resolution, violation  of the principles of the Islamic Shari'ah, and persistence in  committing further war crimes. Al-Asnaj said that Sanaa's  continuation of the war confirms its involvement in expansionist  schemes of states outside Yemen designed to disrupt security and  undermine stability in the region.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kurd-A/Zalkah--With the clashes between the  Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] and the Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan [PUK] in south Kurdistan [north Iraq] about to end,  Cemil Bayik, head of the Workers Party of Kurdistan's [PKK]  Kurdish People's Liberation Army, has informed Kurd-A [KURDISH  NEWS AGENCY] that the fighting was the outcome of direct and  indirect provocation by various countries. Stressing that the  fighting involves those who want to maintain the status quo and  those who oppose it, Bayik said the people are against bloodshed  among brothers. He asserted: "Eleven organizations have  established two separate groups to work to end the clashes. But  some circles want to change the status quo in the south.  France, Turkey, and Iraq want to have the status quo changed in  favor of Mas'ud Barzani. They want to further the concept of  autonomy. The United States and Britain want the situation to  stay as it is."    Defending the view that the people can influence the effort  to end the clashes, Bayik said they will try to strengthen the  people's opposition to the fighting. He asserted: "The PKK has  made an intensive effort to obstruct the fratricide since the  clashes began. It considered the wish of the people for an end  to the fighting and received significant support. The people's  strengthening opposition shows that support. Professional  establishments, mass organizations, and students are part of the  protest move. The success of that effort depends on the stance  of the DPK and PUK. More effective results can be achieved if a  concerted effort is made. Time will show how effective the  effort that is being made will be. The clashes may escalate  because the DPK and PUK do not trust each other. They do not  seem willing to end the fighting. We are trying to strengthen  the people's opposition. We will make it more effective. The  people are opposed to the clashes. They are uneasy. They want  the fratricide to end as soon as possible. The people have  protested the issue and delivered warnings. Those who do not  heed them will be unable to account for their behavior."</p>

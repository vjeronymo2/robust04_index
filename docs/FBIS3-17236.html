			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Petr Zhuravlev report under the "Hearings" rubric: "Border </F> Guards Have Not Left the Kurils Yet. Russia Intends To Guard  'All That Coincides With ex-USSR Borders'"]    [Text] The Russian Armed Forces General Staff has received  no presidential directive to prepare a plan for the withdrawal  of border troops from four islands in the Kuril chain. This was  announced by Lieutenant General Leontiy Shevtsov, deputy chief  of the General Staff operations directorate, in parliamentary  hearings on the problems of the Russian Federation state border  yesterday. Answering a question from Duma security committee  head Viktor Ilyukhin on such a directive, Gen. Shevtsov said  that had it existed it is the General Staff operations  directorate that "would be responsible for preparations for and  the very pullout of troops, but there has not been even any talk  on this topic." The directorate deputy head is also sure that  had there been a directive, the General Staff's and Defense  Ministry's reaction to it would have undoubtedly been negative.  "I doubt the president could have issued such a directive  without having agreed on it with the General Staff; it is too  presumptuous to do such a thing without having consulted  specialists," Mr. Shevtsov underscored.    Major General Aleksey Shcherbakov, deputy border troops  commander, who presented a report at the hearings, stated:  "Everything coinciding with the borders of the former USSR  should be guarded." In his words, "It is important to produce a  series of measures to implement the law on the state border  passed last April and, in particular, to step up work on giving  the border validity under international law, on delimitation of  waters with contiguous countries -- primarily with Japan, the  United States, and the newly formed states." The border with  Mongolia should be strengthened, as well as in the "Arctic  region." Mr. Shcherbakov is convinced that the border with the  Baltic countries "should be equipped like the one with the 'far  abroad.'" Besides, he stated, it is necessary to resolve the  existing territorial problems with Norway, the Baltic countries,  Mongolia, China, and Japan, and to preclude possible problems  with Finland, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan.    Speaking about a concept of organizational development of  the  border troops in 1994, Gen. Shcherbakov intimated that, in the  view of their commanders, the principle of forming the units  sent, for example, to Tajikistan or Georgia, from volunteers  should be dropped. "The border is the face of the state," he  stated, adding that the volunteer service had entailed a decline  in the general level of literacy, training, and health of the  soldiers. Alongside this, Mr. Shcherbakov said, there is a  discussion that it may be wise to alter the call-up age to 19 or  even 21 years.    The resolution summing up yesterday's parliamentary hearings  notes that "in the wake of the USSR's disintegration... an  effectively functioning system of measures protecting the  Russian Federation state border only exists where it coincides  with the border of the former USSR." It is recognized as  necessary to prepare by June a draft of amendments to the law on  the state border so as to bring it in line with the new  Constitution. The Foreign Ministry was asked, in the interests  of implementing the law, to resolve, as soon as possible, the  questions of giving validity under international law to the  "borders with CIS-member states, as well as the question of  border rules depending on Russia's individual relations with  each of these states."</p>

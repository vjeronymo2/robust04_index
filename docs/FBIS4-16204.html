			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Northern Ossetia" column] </F>   [Text] Ali Aliyev, chairman of the Confederation of  Caucasus Peoples' parliament, who arrived in Vladikavkaz on a  peacemaking mission, has visited the Supreme Soviet of Northern  Ossetia. A. Aliyev told about the Confederation's activity to  restore peace and accord in Russia's southern republics.  Elaborating on problems of resolving the Ossetian-Ingush  conflict, Aliyev stressed that to a very large extent it "has  been provoked" by the Russian Federation law On Rehabilitation  of Repressed Peoples, which does not envision a mechanism for  territorial rehabilitation, and also by the Russian Federation  law On the Formation of the Ingush Republic, which does not  designate its administrative boundaries.</p>

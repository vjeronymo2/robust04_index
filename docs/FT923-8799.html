			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Three jailed for pension funds fraud THREE MEN were jailed for between two and four years yesterday for conspiring to defraud pension funds of the engineering company Aveling Barford of Pounds 6.7m. Aveling Barford, of Grantham, Lincolnshire, went into liquidation in 1988. Its assets were subsequently acquired by Mr Duncan Wordsworth, who is chairman and managing director of the company which now trades as Aveling Barford (Machines). Sentencing the men at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Clive Tayler QC said their extremely serious offences had been committed with a cynical disregard for the interests of the funds' trustees and beneficiaries. The case demonstrated a degree of commercial amorality deserving the utmost condemnation, the judge said. He added that he hoped steps had been, or would be, taken to give greater protection to pension funds. The judge said he took into account the fact that two men who had played leading roles in the fraud - Dr Lee Kin Tat, a Singapore businessman, and Mr Adrian Eschallier, a US lawyer - had not been brought to trial, and that in the end the pension funds had not lost any money. Also there had been evidence suggesting that there might have been a surplus in the funds from which the convicted men might have believed Aveling Barford was entitled to benefit. Sentencing Mr Robin Chapman, who was Aveling Barford's solicitor, to a total of four years on two conspiracy charges, the judge said he had orchestrated the fraud and received payments of more than Pounds 90,000. Mr Graham Severn, a former director of Mildminster, a financial adviser, who had been 'an essential participant in the conspiracy', was sentenced to three years for conspiracy and the theft of Pounds 424,525. Mr David Carter, a trustee director convicted on one conspiracy charge, was jailed for two years. The judge said he had been a trusted adviser on whom the honest trustees had relied. The outcome of the 4 1/2 -month trial will be a welcome boost to the morale of the Serious Fraud Office, which has recently been strongly criticised, notably for its handling of the Blue Arrow prosecutions. The central allegation was that Pounds 6.7m had been taken from the pension funds and was used as capital for the company and to pay commissions. Aveling Barford, formerly a subsidiary of British Leyland, was sold in 1983 to a company controlled by Dr Lee and Mr Eschallier. In 1986 it was lent Pounds 1m by the pension funds by means of a fraud on the honest trustees. In 1987-88 a further Pounds 5.7m was removed and reinvested through Mildminster in a Royal Heritage Life Assurance pension portfolio. After the fraud came to light, Royal Heritage repaid the Pounds 5.7m. The SFO alleged that the purpose of the reinvestment had been to create large commissions to be invested and used as security for bank loans to Aveling Barford. The fraud was uncovered in late 1988 when Standard Chartered, Aveling Barford's bank, put in administrative receivers. It also emerged that the company had had considerable liquidity shortfalls between 1983 and 1988 and was owed very large sums by Aveling Barford (World Trade), an international holding company set up by Dr Lee and Mr Eschallier.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shen Sixiang (3088 1835 3276) and Xu Dongyang (1776 2639 </F> 3152): "The Overall Agricultural Development Areas Become Ones  Where the Peasants' Income Is High"]    [Excerpt] Through the development and construction in the  past five years, the overall agricultural development project  areas, covering the region's 40 banners and counties, became  successful examples in modernizing the region's agriculture as  well as the areas where the peasants' income is high, and this  is becoming the focus of people's attention. In 1993, the per  capita income of peasants in the overall agricultural  development project areas was 840.40 yuan, 62.5 yuan higher than  the per capita income of the total peasants in the region. The  total agricultural output value in these areas reached 1.7  billion yuan, an increase of 63.5 percent over the figure before  development. The newly added grain production capacity in the  past five years reached 1 billion kilograms.    Since 1989, when the state approved implementing the  region's  overall agricultural development projects, the region has  increased the number of the projects from a large-sized project  covered in the first-phase development project in the three  leagues and one city in the eastern part of the region to five  projects, including the second-phase overall agricultural  development project, the experimental project for developing  animal husbandry on the grasslands, the project for transforming  the saline and barren land in Bayannur League, the project for  raising cattle with straw in Linxi County, and the base for  growing export vegetables in Manzhouli. The scale of  development has been expanded from 12 banners and counties of  three leagues and a city to 40 banners and counties of eight  leagues and cities. The amounts of funds for development has  increased from 110 million yuan annually (excluding the funds  collected from the masses) to 140 million yuan. A total of 810  million yuan was invested in the past five years (including the  funds collected from the masses.) So, this is the largest  agricultural development project in the region since the  founding of the PRC.    The overall agricultural development project areas have  become the region's key grain, oil, and sugar production bases.  In the past five years, 4.05 million mu of low- and  medium-yield farmland covered in the project areas were  transformed, more than 1 million mu of uncultivated areas were  developed for agricultural production, 680,000 mu of land were  afforested, 580,000 mu of grasslands were improved, and more  than 600,000 mu of paddy rice growing areas were newly  developed. The conditions for larger areas of waterlogging and  alkaline land have comprehensively been developed and improved  in the manner of linking project measures and agronomic measures  with biological measures. Intensity and scientific levels were  noticeably improved. The output of the major farm and sideline  products, such as grain, oil bearing crops, sugar beets, and  meat, increased by a big margin. All this plays a gigantic role  in ensuring the self-sufficiency in grain. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (25): Gripen flies into flak as Finns turn to the US - Swedes lose niche in a neutral market THE FUTURE of the military side of Sweden's aerospace industry has become a subject of growing concern. In May, the industry failed to acquire from Finland an expected bulk order for the JAS 39 Gripen multi-purpose fighter aircraft. The Finnish government's decision to purchase 57 new F18s from the American company McDonnell Douglas instead of the JAS came as a severe shock to Sweden's aircraft makers who had convinced themselves that the Finns were bound to choose their fighter for commercial as well as political reasons. The importance of the JAS for Swedish aerospace was underlined only two days after the Finnish deal with McDonnell Douglas when the Swedish government announced it had decided to take out a second order for 110 JAS aircraft for the Swedish air force, with the first deliveries in 1996. The announcement's timing was significant because it signalled to the outside world the firmness of the Swedish state's commitment to the successful completion of the JAS project. But the government's decision to go ahead came after four years of dither, investigation and argument over whether it made any real sense to continue with JAS in view of the strong opposition to the fighter aircraft project from Sweden's peace movement. However, there remains a clear danger that the aircraft will prove a commercial failure unless it makes a breakthrough into overseas markets. The total cost of the JAS programme to the year 2000 has now reached an estimated SKr63bn, well above its original budget target of SKr24.9bn at 1981 price levels (around SKr54bn). So far, no foreign country has ordered one of the new aircraft. The Swedish consortium manufacturing JAS - made up of Saab-Scania, Volvo-Flygmotor, Ericsson Motor System and the government-owned FFV Aerotech, part of the Celsius industrial group - hopes to find potential buyers among the countries of central and eastern Europe. This spring, the Hungarian government showed interest. There is even a belief in Stockholm that the German government might consider acquiring the JAS fighter for its own air force after recently pulling out of the European Fighter Aircraft project. But for all the optimistic talk, nothing has so far materialised in the form of tangible orders. The JAS is highly regarded by its manufacturers. Its aim is to perform fighter, ground attack and reconnaissance missions. The first of the new generation of light combat aircraft, JAS has a take-off weight of only eight tonnes. It will be able to carry short as well as medium-range air-to-air missiles and the Mauser 27mm cannon. Requiring minimal base facilities, JAS has a flexible versatility that ought to make it look attractive to air forces in the post-Cold War era. It brings together the best technological advances made by the Swedish defence industry. But ever since the Swedish government gave the go-ahead as long ago as 1982 the JAS project has been plagued with difficulties. As a result of technical troubles, particularly with the computer software that controls the aircraft's fly-by-wire flight system, it has fallen two years behind schedule which has added substantially to the development costs and placed a question mark over its ability to generate profits for the consortium. The original contract for the first 30 units between the consortium and the Swedish state was a fixed cost one - much to the chagrin of the aerospace industry. The soaring costs had an adverse impact on Saab-Scania's profitability in its aerospace business. For all its past doubts and complaints, the Swedish government is keen to see the JAS succeed. It is estimated that about 28,000 jobs are dependent on the project and, at a time when registered unemployment is climbing to the 5 per cent mark, any threat to the fighter aircraft would have bleak consequences for the labour market. Moreover, as the MInistry of Defence admitted in its spring policy document on the future of Sweden's armed forces: 'If the JAS project should collapse it would have serious consequences not only for the credibility of our defence policy but also for high technology research and development.' By contrast, Sweden's civil aviation industry looks far more viable with big demand for its products on world markets. The Saab 340 has been a great success with a dominant position among regional airlines. At the end of last year, the order book backlog for them numbered 92. The Saab 2000 regional turboprop 50- to 58-seater airliner was unveiled for the first time last December, and made its successful maiden flight on March 26. Certification of the aircraft is scheduled for the middle of 1993 with first deliveries due by the autumn of that year. The first customer to receive the new aircraft will be Crossair, the Swiss airline. Firm orders now total around 50, while there are options to buy about 150 more. In the US, Express Airlines I (Northwest Airlink) will be the launch customer for the Saab 2000. This spring Saab-Scania streamlined its aircraft operations into three separate business areas in a move designed to increase efficiency and strengthen competitiveness. But until the JAS 39 Gripen begins to win orders outside Sweden, uncertainty will persist about the shape of the country's aerospace industry.</p>

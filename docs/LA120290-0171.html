			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE SERVICES SET FOR COUSINS  </P> <P> A private funeral for author Norman Cousins was to be held at his Beverly Hills  home today, and a second funeral was planned early this week in New Jersey,  where Cousins will be buried in the family plot in Union Hill.  </P> <P> Cousins, the medical guru, diplomat and editor whose recovery from arthritis  helped change the way doctors look at illness and emotions, died Friday of a  heart attack at age 75.  </P> <P> He was stricken at a Westwood hotel where he had gone to meet a pianist friend.  </P> <P> Dr. L.J. West, professor and past director of psychiatry and biobehavioral  sciences at UCLA, where Cousins taught at the School of Medicine, said this  week's services will be closed to the public.  </P> <P> However, West said he was planning a memorial service to be held at UCLA within  the next couple of weeks.  </P> <P> After a career as an editor of the Saturday Review for more than 30 years and  emissary to three presidents, Cousins had found a new calling with the  publication in 1979 of "Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by the Patient." The  bestseller detailed his recovery from a life-threatening form of arthritis  through a self-prescribed regimen of positive thinking and Vitamin C.  </P></p>

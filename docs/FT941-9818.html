			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / A 'shell too far' in Sarajevo: Nato's ultimatum may help to redress the balance, but by itself it will not be enough Why now? Why suddenly, after 2 1/2 years of war in the former Yugoslavia, and nearly two in Bosnia, after so many thousands of deaths, maimings, rapes, mass expulsions and other atrocities, did a single shell landing in a Sarajevo street last Saturday galvanise Nato into issuing what many have judged to be its first credible threat of military intervention? At one level, the explanation is simple and familiar: it was the proverbial last straw; a 'shell too far'. Western leaders have realised that they already bear too heavy a weight of responsibility for what is happening in Bosnia. They cannot get away with remaining passive as the death toll mounts. All of the following are up to their necks in Bosnia: The European Union with its mediation efforts and white-coated observers; Britain with its sponsorship of the London conference in 1992 and provision of two successive mediators; France with the visit of President Francois Mitterrand to Sarajevo in June 1992; Half a dozen Nato countries with soldiers on the ground - soldiers taking such invidious decisions as which starving village gets food from a convoy, or who is allowed to fly out of Sarajevo; Germany and the US with their long record of vocal political support for, respectively, the Croats and the Bosnian Moslems; and Nato itself with its previous, largely ineffective threats of air strikes. None of these national and supranational bodies can escape damage if things continue to get worse. All are obliged to react somehow when an event, even a seemingly random event such as last Saturday's shelling of the Sarajevo market, which killed 68 and injured more than 200, focuses public attention on the utter grimness of the situation and their apparent inability to make it any better. But that situation is not new. In so far as the western reaction has been different this time, it reflects not a pure knee-jerk reflex but a gradual shift in the positions of some of the main governments concerned - France, Germany and the US - that has been going on over a period of months. The central role has been played by France, and more specifically by Alain Juppe, foreign minister in the conservative government that came to power last March. Obliged to 'co-habit' with Mr Mitterrand, and inheriting a complex situation in which France was involved with other countries, notably Britain, in running the United Nations operation on the ground, Mr Juppe could not change policy overnight. To begin with, France seemed to be following the same approach as Britain, treating its military presence as a neutral and purely humanitarian affair and leaving the political initiative entirely to the EU and UN mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorwald Stoltenberg. By autumn, however, Mr Juppe had reached the following conclusions: It was too late for an ideal solution: no one was going to put the old multicultural Bosnia together again by force of arms. There would have to be a compromise peace. But the compromise must give more to the Moslems than the isolated ghetto-state offered by the Serbs and Croats in their joint partition plan. The Serbs, especially, had somehow to be persuaded to concede more land. The EU was supposed to have a common foreign and security policy. This would be meaningless unless it included a plan for bringing peace to Bosnia. That policy, in Bosnia as elsewhere, must be based on a clear Franco-German understanding. In particular, the Germans must use their influence to bring the Croats on board. The US had to be smoked out of its self-righteous isolation and persuaded to throw its weight behind a diplomatic initiative. Otherwise the Moslems would continue to think they could do better by fighting on, believing that, if not the US cavalry, at least US planes and weapons would sooner or later come to their rescue. From this analysis was born the 'Juppe-Kinkel plan' of November 8, which became the 'European Union action plan' of November 22. In its original form, the emphasis was on getting Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic to extract concessions from the Bosnian Serbs, by dangling in front of him the prospect that sanctions on Serbia would be lifted. 'This so-called trade-off has too much carrot and too little stick,' was the predictable comment of Mohammed Sacirbey, Bosnian ambassador to the UN. Events were to prove him right. In December Serbia and Croatia pretended to accept the plan, offering the Moslems one third of Bosnian territory (as the EU plan suggested) but in a shape that could never have made a viable state. The Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia would have been completely isolated, Sarajevo virtually encircled and cut off from its suburbs, and the Moslems would no longer have had the access to the river Drava they were previously offered. Meanwhile, the shelling of Sarajevo intensified and there was further Serb interference with relief supplies. By the time Nato leaders met in Brussels on January 10 the need for stick as well as carrot was widely admitted. President Bill Clinton did not want Bosnia to spoil the summit, but the French insisted that it be addressed. The alliance repeated its threat of last August to use airpower if the 'strangulation' of Sarajevo and other areas continued, and added a specific warning to the Serbs not to obstruct relief of the Canadian garrison in Sreb-renica or the reopening of Tuzla airport. But the US was still reluctant to accept the role in which Mr Juppe had cast it, of talking the Moslems into accepting the bitter fruits of defeat. This led to a very public and embarrassing exchange of accusations between Paris and Washington two weeks ago. Now, however, indignation over the latest Sarajevo atrocity seems to have acted as both catalyst and smokescreen for a tacit deal: Europe, led by France, has agreed to use force or the threat of force to bring the Serbs to reason, while the US has agreed to step up its diplomatic involvement, effectively dirtying its hands with the 'sell-out' it was hitherto determined to repudiate. A division of labour is emerging. Each of the three parties in Bosnia has a 'big brother', who is expected to lean on his respective protege. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has already leant on the Croatian president, procuring the dismissal of the extremist Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban and Croatian acceptance of an outlet to the Adriatic for the rump Bosnian state. President Clinton will now be expected to lean on the Bosnian Moslem leadership; and President Boris Yeltsin is positioning himself, by his outspoken opposition to air strikes, to lean on Serbia. Britain, for its part, has no proteges and no strategy. Mr Douglas Hurd's world-weary neutralism has left him without friends and without influence. But Mr Yeltsin is the weakest of the three protectors, while the Serbs, who have perhaps as much as 50 per cent of their military equipment in reserve for a spring offensive, are the strongest on the ground. Even if the Russian president flies to Belgrade for an eyeball-to-eyeball session with Mr Milosevic, there is no guarantee that the Bosnian Serbs will take any notice. Nato's new ultimatum may help to redress the balance, but by itself it will hardly be enough.</p>

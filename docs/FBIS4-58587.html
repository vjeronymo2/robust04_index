			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 5, IRNA-- A Persian daily here Thursday  blasted the Wednesday's signing of final documents on  Gaza-Jericho compromise deal between Yasir 'Arafat and the  Zionist regime and termed it as complete surrender to the  Zionist enemy. The morning Persian daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI'  said in its editorial that the entire occupied territories  plunged into strike and protest against the treacherous measure.  The agreement is so scandalous that even 'Arafat primarily  refused to sign its map appendix but eventually he was forced to  do so under the U.S. pressures, the daily said.    Although the Zionist enemy and its supporters intend to  suppress and uproot the Palestine Islamic movement through their  bullying methods, they should realize that 'Arafat is not the  representative of the Palestinian nation.    Lashing out at some of the reactionary Arab regimes for  their  collective treachery, it said that such regimes are not the  guardians of the Palestinian nation. The daily added that the  Palestinians have shown through their active presence in the  occupied territories that they will not give in to such bullying  acts. The paper stressed that the intifadah, the all-out  uprising of the Palestinian nation, will have the final word in  the occupied territories, adding that, the final word is the  elimination of the occupying regime of Qods [Jerusalem].    Liberation of the occupied territories and annihilation of  the usurpers is the only option before the Palestinian nation,  concluded the paper.</p>

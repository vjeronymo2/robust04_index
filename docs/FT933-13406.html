			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Community to relax voting rules EC FOREIGN ministers yesterday agreed to draw up rules to allow foreign EC nationals to vote in next June's European Parliament elections in the country where they live. The flexible voting system would comply with the Maastricht treaty's concept of European citizenship. This would expand voting rights to EC citizens in European parliamentary and local elections, provided they register in time. The chief difficulty is how to avoid fraudulent voting or dual candidacies in member states, and how to ensure a common rules system among the 12 without big changes in national legislation. Ministers agreed to try to introduce rules which would not require primary legislation. Several member states argued that the introduction of primary legislation would make it virtually impossible to amend the law in time for next year's European parliamentary vote. One option is to introduce a 'light' Community directive amending national election laws this year, with comprehensive legislation due to be agreed after 1994. Legislation expanding the right of European citizens to vote in foreign member states remains dependent on final ratification of the Maastricht treaty.</p>

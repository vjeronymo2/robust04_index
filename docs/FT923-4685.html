			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: Tom Cobleigh and all for BES MANY sponsors have taken the plunge into the Business Expansion Scheme this week - indeed the list consists of Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all, writes John Authers. Tom Cobleigh Pubs is a BES company sponsored by Wise Speke, which will buy two pubs, probably in Yorkshire and the North Midlands. They will be managed by Tom Cobleigh Ltd, which was set up last year and runs ten pubs of its own in the north and Midlands, and 51 pubs tenanted by national brewers in Humberside. Tom Cobleigh Ltd intends to make an offer for the BES shares once the 5-year tax exemption period has expired. The bibulous BES theme continues with Merlin Associates (Europe) which has exclusive European rights to distribute Bushman's Australian Vodka, Crown Reserve Scotch Whisky, Noble Estate Australian Wines and a range of Italian and Greek liqueurs. The company believes that Bushman's will have unique selling appeal, as it is a cane spirit vodka from Australia. Both of these companies should be firmly labelled 'speculative'. However, other BES companies with covenanted repayment of fixed sums after five years are also on offer. Neill Clerk is sponsoring Oxford Isis Residences, which will buy accommodation for Oxford Polytechnic, recently created a university. For every Pounds 1 paid now, it will repay Pounds 1.28 on October 31, 1997. House the Homeless of London (Greenwich) is the latest BES scheme set up by the Peabody Trust. It is aiming to provide 70 permanent homes for families in Greenwich. Peabody, which has properties with a vacant possession value of Pounds 825m, will pay Pounds 1.26 after five years for every Pounds 1 subscribed now. The most unusual new development for contracted exit schemes comes from Johnson Fry, which has launched the Mortgage Express Flexible Growth Scheme in conjunction with TSB's Mortgage Express. The new wrinkle comes from a loan facility after one year - borrowers can take a loan equivalent to 76 per cent of the gross amount they originally invested. This is repaid automatically from the proceeds of the BES when TSB takes control of the property after five years. The loan does not rely on you proving your income, and it is non-recourse - in other words, according to Johnson Fry, there is no obligation to repay it from anything other than BES shares. Johnson Fry is also launching Sovereign Reversions, which will buy properties from the elderly for a knock-down price in order to provide them with an income. The company will only take over the properties once the occupants have died, and then aim to make a profit. Finally Pathfinder Repossessions II is a more speculative investment. It will buy repossessed property in London.</p>

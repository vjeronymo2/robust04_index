			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with "South Yemeni Prime Minister" Haydar </F> Abu-Bakr al-'Attas by MBC correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit, in Aden;  monitored in progress -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Jazulit] I have just come here from Sanaa. One can  feel that the Yemeni public in Sanaa, and perhaps outside Sanaa  too, support the president of the Yemen Arab Republic in his  efforts to maintain unity by any possible means, because unity  is a popular demand. Therefore, there is a rift between the  Yemenis in connection with this issue. What do you want to tell  the Yemenis in Sanaa and the northern governorates who consider  you separatists? You did secede. What do you want to tell the  people, the ordinary citizens, who maintain that you seceded  from the unified state?    [Al-'Attas] Regrettably, we in Yemen, just like the rest of  the Arab homeland, handled the unity issue emotionally. Facts  and reason had no influence on the formulation of the unity  policies we pursued nor on the manner in which we implemented  them.    [Jazulit] You therefore bear responsibility for the failure  of unity...    [Al-'Attas, interrupting] Certainly everyone is to blame.  The leaders bear the blame, certainly. When we the southern  leaders united with the northern leaders to establish the Yemeni  union, the public responded favorably to this great national  dream. As a consequence, the Republic of Yemen was proclaimed.  However, when the people realized that things were being done  that were different from those they had expected under the aegis  of unity, they began to declare their rejection of these acts  and this form of unity. Perhaps the masses of the people in the  southern and eastern governorates, currently the Democratic  Republic of Yemen, made their feelings known during the  parliamentary elections of 27 April 1993. They declined to give  a single vote to the representatives of the government in the  northern governorates. They gave their entire vote and all the  parliamentary seats in their governorates to the representatives  of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] which formerly represented  the leaders of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The  masses of the people in Sanaa, and indeed all Yemeni people,  support the unity. However...    [Jazulit, interrupting] The masses of the people in Sanaa  regard you as separatists.    [Al-'Attas] I do not believe that is true. The people in  Sanaa know who the separatist really is. Perhaps the  southernmost governorates of northern Yemen, that is the Yemen  Arab Republic, are suffering more than the southern governorates  ever suffered. We embarked on a union with the understanding  that it would be an equal union between partners formed by the  People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Yemen Arab  Republic, which would then integrate the institutions of both  parts of the country. However, the brothers [in the north]  looked on the union as an annexation. Some Sanaa leaders said  that the part had returned to the whole. We found this  reasoning unacceptable. We first expressed our rejection of  this reasoning during meetings held in September 1990 between  the YSP Political Bureau and the General People's Congress'  General Committee.    [Jazulit] Let us again discuss the government that you head.  It is a government without a parliament. Will this government  be an interim government serving merely to explore the reactions  of the Yemeni public here? What does the public expect from you?    [Al-'Attas] First of all, we have formed an interim  parliament and called it the National Assembly.    [Jazulit] Does this parliament actually have a  constitutional  character?    [Al-'Attas] Yes, under the circumstances. This parliament is  composed first of the representatives of the electoral  constituencies who were elected in the southern and eastern  governorates and who formerly made efforts to strengthen Yemeni  unity. Representatives of the political forces in the  Democratic Republic of Yemen were also included in this  parliament. We believe that this National Assembly, which is an  interim one, is sufficiently constitutional to monitor and  supervise affairs of government legally.    [Jazulit] Where do you place public opinion here, in south  Yemen, on your list of priorities, that is, on the list of the  priorities of the government you will chair? You must take what  the Yemeni public wants into account. The YSP must certainly  have made errors for which the Yemenis have paid a price. Now  you have formed a new state and you have a government and an  interim parliament, as you mentioned. Could you tell me what  the masses expect from you?    [Al-'Attas] I believe you were here in Aden when the  Democratic Republic of Yemen was proclaimed, or indeed,  reestablished. This republic has maintained all its  institutions despite the union years as a result of the conduct  of the Sanaa leaders. You have noticed how the masses of the  people were very joyful at this proclamation, here in Aden and  in all the other governorates. Regrettably, our people here in  the southern governorates see themselves as entering a new stage  of independence. Independent of whom? Of our brothers in Sanaa.    [Jazulit] This is a very dangerous sentiment.    [Al-'Attas] Of course, this is a very dangerous sentiment  and  we frequently warned that it might occur.    [Jazulit] Engineer al-'Attas, you are well-known as a  statesman. At the same time, you are one of the YSP's leaders.  I know, and you know too, that before the union between the two  parts of Yemen was proclaimed, there were people in this party  who rejected the union on the grounds that the time was not yet  ripe for it. Apparently a few people in the YSP monopolized the  decisions and did not take into account the general attitude of  the YSP leaders and members. On this basis you embarked on a  union which lasted for four years and then you returned to Aden.  Do you hold yourselves responsible for the union's failure?    [Al-'Attas] Without a doubt, we bear some responsibility for  the failure of the Yemeni union experiment. However, I totally  agree with the view of Shaykh Sulayman Abu-Luhum. When the  president asked him: Why do you criticize me, not the YSP and  the southerners? He answered him: You bear 70 percent of the  responsibility for the failure. The YSP bears 30 percent of the  responsibility.    [Jazulit] Why does the president take 70 percent of the  blame while you represent two basic parties in unified Yemen?    [Al-'Attas] When I speak of the president, I talk about the  executive leadership in Sanaa. This leadership was a primary  cause underlying the failure of this experience. I do not deny  our responsibility. But compared to their responsibility, our  responsibility is very slight.    [Jazulit] You did not reply to the second part of my  question  about your possible withstanding of self-criticism before the  Yemeni people in the southern republic.    [Al-'Attas] We certainly exercise self-criticism all the  time. When we make mistakes, we talk about our mistakes. The  YSP in particular has been one of the parties that exercise  self-criticism after each stage. Before unity, we criticized  the prevailing situation and drew up a program for political and  economic reform. I believe that self-criticism is a source of  power; it makes room for progress and for avoiding mistakes. We  certainly criticize ourselves when we make mistakes. Equally,  when others make mistakes, we have to criticize them  constructively.    [Jazulit] In your new republic, you raise the slogan of  democracy and unity. Can you explain your strategy in the  economic field?    [Al-'Attas] In our new policy in the Democratic Republic of  Yemen, we are committed to developing the economy into a market  economy and are working for economic freedom. This course is in  full harmony with the democratic approach. It gives equal  opportunities for competition, which means providing better  services at lower prices. Therefore, we are working and will  continue to work for establishing economic freedom and paving  the way for private and share-holding companies to run the  various aspects of the national economy within the framework of  the state laws and legislations. In my view, this is an  approach that enables us to develop, just like the approach of  democratic political practice. It is true that this road is hard  and long and involves a certain sacrifice, but it is the safe  and guaranteed road to prosperity and social and economic  development for all the masses.    [Jazulit] As long as we are talking about the economic  approach, I learned that you are seriously contemplating  applying to join the Gulf Cooperation Council. There is a  geographic element involved. Moreover, you state that you are  committed to a free economy. All these factors show that you  are seriously pursuing that goal. Is this true?    [Al-'Attas] I believe that the states of the Arab  archipelago  must maintain the highest level of cooperation and coordination.    [Jazulit] What about joining the Gulf Cooperation Council?    [Al-'Attas] I believe that this is a good step that should  be  taken.    [Jazulit] A question before the end: Where does opposition  stand in the political arena in your new republic? That is, of  course, if there is opposition. During years of unity, the  opposition played a central role in the meetings of the national  dialogue committee. Its role was to reconcile the two major  parties. After fighting broke out, unity disintegrated; some  supported the south and are helping you in your new republic,  while others stayed in and are getting support from Sanaa. The  secession that led to the proclamation of a new republic here  played a negative role at the opposition level and its future.  Where does opposition stand in your new republic?    [Al-'Attas] In fact the opposition played an important role  in phrasing the Pledge and Accord Document, the document because  of which Sanaa launched a war. This is clear in the statements  that started on 18 January and continued until a few days ago,  when Sanaa added yet another condition, saying that it accepts  negotiations, but not on the basis of the document. Why?  Because the document was the right way to refute the divine  authority claim of the executive leadership in Sanaa. That  leadership thought that it had inherited the right to lead and  hence it should continue to control Yemen. The Pledge and  Accord Document would have ended such an era. But the leadership  sensed that it was being threatened and launched war on Yemen.  We are now in a state of war. The national unity that embraces  all political and social powers is being enhanced in the  institutions we established. Accordingly, the task of the  government and the institutions we are building now is to remove  the impact of war.    [Jazulit] Then is it a provisional government?    [Al-'Attas] Yes, a provisional government. As declared in  the proclamation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, we will  prepare for local government and parliamentary elections within  a year, God willing.    [Jazulit] You are coming closer to decisive developments.    [Al-'Attas] Certainly. But we feel safe, because everyone  here will act in a civilized and responsible manner. No one  will carry a machine gun, gun, or bomb. All citizens in the  southern and eastern governorates are marching along the road of  democracy peacefully. Therefore, we expect democracy to  flourish. No citizen will be coerced or subjected to injustice  or oppression in the Democratic Republic of Yemen.    [Jazulit] Engineer al-'Attas; thank you for this meeting.    [Al-'Attas] Thank you very much.</p>

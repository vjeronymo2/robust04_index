The letter  states: Upon the conclusion of the agenda of our sixth congress,  we wish to express the intense commitment this process generated  in our journalists.    Two issues not fully debated in the congress because of time  constraints were discussed in this meeting: Cuba's image abroad  and media finances. The participants were unanimous in stressing  the role of our media in disseminating the true image of Cuba  and in confronting the U.S. blockade as well as the campaigns of  the disinformation multinationals.</p>

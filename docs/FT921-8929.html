			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Abu Dhabi in attack on BCCI auditor ABU DHABI'S ruling Al Nahyan family yesterday disputed suggestions that its members were aware of the fraudulent activities of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), AP reports. The family owns 77 per cent of BCCI, whose operations were shut down last July by banking regulators in the US, Britain and six other countries. BCCI pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges. Price Waterhouse, which had been BCCI's auditor, a reported on its audits of BCCI to Britain's House of Commons on February 5. In a statement issued yesterday in Washington, the Abu Dhabi leaders said Price Waterhouse's report was 'grossly misleading'. It said the Price Waterhouse report was 'an attempt to deflect criticism from themselves and their failure to uncover the frauds earlier'.</p>

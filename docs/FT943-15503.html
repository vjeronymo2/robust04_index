			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru gets oil privatisation drive into gear Privatisation of the core assets of Petroperu, Peru's state oil and gas company, has finally got off the ground with the release this week of a preliminary information memorandum. The strategy, devised by Merrill Lynch after technical studies by Arthur D. Little and other industry experts, is to split the company into 11 business units. For most of these a 60 per cent stake will be offered to private sector operators, with the state retaining 40 per cent. Auctions, by sealed bids, will start in October. Some analysts still question the decision to dismember the integrated company for sell-off. Its assets are very mixed, with the upstream operations more attractive than the elderly refineries. Two major oilfields, known as Blocks 8 and X, have proven reserves of 100m and 45m barrels respectively. Current output from the former, located in the northern jungle's Maranon basin, is 33,000 barrels a day. Block X, in the northern coastal basin of Talara, produces some 15,000 b/d. For sale separately are four refineries: La Pampilla, the largest, which serves Lima and the coast; medium-sized Talara on the north coast; the small refinery and terminal at Iquitos on the Amazon River; and Conchan, just south of the capital, which is the sole asphalt producer for the Lima market. Conchan twice failed to find a buyer when offered at auction in late 1992. Most important of the remaining five business units is the Japanese-built pipeline, the only means of transporting crude from the northern jungle fields to the Talara terminal. It now operates at about 40 per cent of its 200,000 b/d capacity and will be offered as a renewable concession for 10 years at a time. Other Petroperu assets up for sale are a gas gathering system, with storage facilities and pipeline; marine terminals and airport fuel plants; the liquefied petroleum gas storage facility in Lima's port of Callao; a lubricants blending plant; and electric power generating facilities in the Talara region. In line with the government's objective of creating competition in the local market, bidders will be subject to certain restrictions: the future operator of La Pampilla, for example, will be barred from purchasing Talara, Conchan or the Callao terminal. Petroperu was created in 1969 when General Velasco's left-wing military regime nationalised the assets of International Petroleum Corporation (a subsidiary of Exxon), Chevron and Belco. The company was charged with all Peru's oil-related activities, from exploration through refining to sales and distribution. In the early years, the state made big investments and some major finds. The 200,000 b/d northern pipeline was built with Japanese financing and the refineries at Talara and La Pampilla were expanded. Decline set in, however, when the international oil price slumped in the early 1980s. The state proved a poor manager, swelling Petroperu's payroll with political appointees and pursuing incoherent pricing policies that left the company badly decapitalised. Foreign investment flows dwindled, then disappeared altogether in the mid-1980s. Peru's crude oil production slumped from 1982's peak of 195,000 b/d to 115,000 b/d in 1991. From being an oil exporter, the country became a net importer. Exploration came to a virtual standstill and reserves shrank to 360m barrels at the end of 1993. New oil legislation passed in August 1993 was designed to attract foreign investors back and, to a certain extent, is doing so. Perupetro, a small state agency, now promotes, negotiates and administers contracts for exploration and production, while Petroperu must compete on equal terms with the private sector. Since 1993, 11 contracts have been negotiated by private oil companies - including Petrotech and Maple Gas of the US and China's Sapet, a subsidiary of China National Petroleum. Perupetro has a similar number of further contracts in the pipeline with, among others, Arco of the US, Elf Aquitaine of France and Spain's Repsol. Occidental Petroleum, Peru's old-established and biggest producer, has also embarked on new exploration and development ventures. Modest investments by private operators - and by a now financially-viable Petroperu - are starting to have an impact on output. This year's First quarter production, at 130,000 b/d, was 5 per cent higher than 1993's. But the oil trade deficit for the quarter still cost the country almost Dollars 18m. Perupetro's new president Mr Alberto Bruce is upbeat about prospects. 'Investors are flocking in,' he says, attributing fresh interest to increased confidence in Peruvian economic management, the attractive legal framework and the decline of terrorism. 'At this rate, we'll have to buy bits of Brazil and Argentina to satisfy all of them.' But Peruvian production costs are high and, so far, the promising geology has failed to throw up any major strikes comparable with Colombia and Ecuador's. By far Peru's biggest prospect so far is the huge Camisea gas fields, discovered in 1986 by Royal Dutch Shell. The company is currently updating feasibility studies and could sign a development contract, perhaps worth Dollars 2bn, late next year. Peru's immediate future looks to be in the hands of the smaller international and national operator. Nut that is not necessarily a disadvantage, according to Mr Roger Alderson, chief executive of Great Western Resources, a medium-sized company prepared to invest Dollars 80m in Peru over the next five years. 'As in Colombia, we smaller firms come in, take the risks and attract the big fish once we start showing results,' he says. 'Peru continues to be the great unexplored.'</p>

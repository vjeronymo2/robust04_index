			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Books: The passionate power of mother love TIME AND TIDE by Edna O'Brien Viking Pounds 14.99, 326 pages SIN by Josephine Hart Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 11.99, 164 pages Time and Tide is a tale of mother love, that fierce passion. Like so many of Edna O'Brien's heroines, Nell escapes from a narrow, suffocating existence - a bullying family in a rural Irish village - into the arms of an older, sophisticated man, a Rochester to her Jane Eyre. But he does not mellow with age. Years later Nell flees again, this time from her husband's tyrannical rule, and she fights successfully to gain custody of their children. Her sons become an anchor in a precarious life: lovers take advantage of her generosity; her spendthrift ways leave her homeless and her honest notes to authors nearly cost her her job in a publishing house. But Nell's real struggle comes when her sons begin to free themselves of her love. One turns to drugs and a girlfriend hostile to Nell, while the other travels to Turkey. Nell fears she has lost them both but discovers, through her memories of her own loving but censorious mother, the binding power of mother love. This is Nell's story entirely; her husband, sons and lovers seem to exist only in her vivid imagination. Yet, it is difficult to imagine her; we are imprisoned in her fantasies: her guilt over her mother's death, her fears that she is, as her husband says, a bad mother. Rarely does she step back from herself, rarely does she peek in the mirror. This is an impassioned narrative, claustrophobic for the reader. It isn't until we reach the tragedy in her life that we begin to empathise with Nell, for she has been too close to us, too insistent, her life story too impossible to believe. We grow impatient with her; she seems never to follow her instincts and is unbearably impractical, romantic when she should be hard-headed, cruel when she should be indulgent. Yet, by the end of the book O'Brien has won us over, for her writing is fluent with a beauty which is never self-conscious, a passion which never engulfs its wisdom. The heroine of Josephine Hart's Sin has let one dark passion dominate her life: 'Goodness is no longer a respectable aim in life. The hound of hell, envy, has driven it from the House.' Ruth has always felt that her cousin, Elizabeth, usurped her place in the family. Orphaned as a baby and adopted by her aunt and uncle, Elizabeth became the first child, the golden-haired girl whose goodness could never be challenged. Ruth, 'who came wrapped in a caul of darkness and anger into Elizabeth's kingdom,' is the one with nightmares and vengeful thoughts about her surrogate elder sister. She wanted not to destroy her but to take her over. As a child, Ruth steals her dolls; later on, she takes bits of her clothing, seduces her lovers, steals her husband and son and, in desperation and mad ness, wears a blond wig. But her hatred and her self-loathing - for those who envy others can think little of themselves - seem to bring a heavenly punishment down on both Ruth and Elizabeth when their sons drown in a lake on the family estate. In this coldly-written Cain and Abel tale, Hart allows Ruth only two moments of passion - two outbursts, after which she is beaten down for, despite her dark machinations, she becomes the victim of her own obsession. But we cannot feel for Ruth or Elizabeth; the former is too cruel, the latter too dull, and the writing is so restrained and so elliptical that we are held at arm's length from the story. In this short, bare novel, bereft of humour or irony, Hart's characters languish and her ideas fail to germinate. The most interesting question the book asks - does goodness spawn evil? - is hardly explored. Sin is caught between parable and novel, having neither the piquant wisdom of the one nor the humanity, the rich ambivalence, of the other.</p>

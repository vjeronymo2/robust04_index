			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Khamrayev report under the "Reincarnation" rubric: </F> "Democratic Russia's Federal Party To Have Unblemished Members.  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn To Choose New President"]    [Text] The threat of fascism owing to the stepped-up  activity of nationalist forces, the possibility of  totalitarianism because of the communists' revanchist schemes,  and the formalization of "neo-Brezhnev rule" by the monopolism  of the corrupt oligarchy were the trends named at a news  conference by leaders of the Democratic Russia movement, on the  basis of which a federal party of the same name will be set up.    Galina Starovoytova, Lev Ponomarev, Anatoliy Korotich, and  other members of the organizing committee, explaining the need  for setting up a new political organization, told journalists  that the Democratic Russia Federal Party [DRFP] is designed to  defend the foundation of democracy -- civil society aiming at a  socially oriented market economy. According to Ms.  Starovoytova, the party will absorb the middle class:  medium-size and small businessmen, the intelligentsia,  qualified workers, and farmers -- people whose financial  involvement in the party organization the committee lacks so  badly at this stage. As it is embarking on a  non-confrontational path, the party will do its utmost to  overcome the breakup that is currently characteristic of the  democratic movement by cooperating with all who will resist the  threat of fascism and totalitarianism.    Unlike U.S. parties that are activated only during election  campaigns, the new Russian party is called upon to be active all  the time; its ranks are open for anyone wishing to join it after  a procedure of "soft ceremonial purification" that, organizing  committee member Andrey Frolov said, will bar the "old  nomenklatura" and "former KGB agents" from entering the  political organization that is being set up by people "who have  never been CPSU members."    The founders think that their party's federal status will be  bolstered by Democratic Russia local branches: chiefs of 30  regional branches left the meeting that ended 22 May with the  organizing committee's membership cards. The chiefs of the  remaining 15 branches, while voicing no objections in principle,  decided that "the matter should be discussed at home" first.  "Moscow's diktat" in the new party will be ruled out because  the capital organization will get one vote just as any regional  branch.    On the economic side, which was described as "a prolonged  shock," the fledgling party members predicted a social upheaval  at the end of summer or the beginning of fall; to avert it they  suggested that the government resume "economic reform that has  been effectively halted." If political reform is to be resumed  also, the DRFP organizing committee thinks that all democratic  forces should unite into a bloc, something which, according to  Lev Ponomarev's forecast, should take place "sometime near the  fall." The bloc, according to Democratic Russia's plan, should  nominate a single candidate for president in the upcoming  elections. The speakers in the news conference would not  speculate who precisely it may be, but they pinned some hopes on  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who "with his keen feeling...would help  choose a future leader" by formulating "a patriotic Russian idea  in non-chauvinist words and expressions."</p>

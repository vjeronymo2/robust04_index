			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> What to do with a pet while vacationing? It's a sticky question, one that  Dorothy McCorkle of La Crescenta referred to in a letter last Sunday. We've  come up with some additional details. The group of sitters she mentioned will  volunteer to look after your dog/cat while you're away. Or any other animal,  bird or fish that shares your roof. These are sitters who care for pets at the  owner's home. Besides the pets, the sitters pick up mail, water plants and even  house-sit. Fees and services vary. This is an association with dozens of sitter  groups, from Ventura south to San Diego: Page's Pet Patrol, Animalovers,  Connie's Pet Sitting, Pets Luv Us, Pampered Pets &amp; Plants, Cat Home  Companion, Creature Comforts, Allie Cat &amp; Home Care, etc.  </P> <P> For a free brochure, send a self-addressed envelope to the Pet Sitters Assn. of  Southern California, P.O. Box 5432, Whittier, Calif. 90607-5432, or call (714)  670-2878.  </P> <P> California  </P> <P> "Discover the Californias" is the title of a slick 190-page magazine that's  packed with vacation ideas. Features a dozen regions: Orange County, San Diego,  the Inland Empire, Los Angeles, the desert areas, North Coast, Central Coast,  Central Valley, San Francisco, the Gold Country, the High Sierra. A series of  maps pinpoint popular attractions. Capsule summaries make for easy reading.  Destinations range from Angel Island in San Francisco Bay to Balboa Park in San  Diego. Addresses/telephone numbers of chambers of commerce are listed in the  back of the magazine along with a lodging directory.  </P> <P> For a free copy, write to the California Office of Tourism, P.O.

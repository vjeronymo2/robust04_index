			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Private View: Territorial champion - Christian Tyler meets Jacques Blanc, the new president of the European Committee of the Regions Give him an audience, and Jacques Blanc is airborne. Put him in front of a home crowd, and he will stay aloft for an hour. I first witnessed the aerodynamic talents of the mayor of La Canourge (pop. 2,000) at a winegrowers' banquet in Narbonne in the French Midi. Surfeited on oysters and bubbly, 500 guests had listened with indifference to the exertions of a wine-glass percussionist. Politely they had applauded the caped caballero who pranced among the tables on a white stallion. But when Blanc took the stage to tell them what they wanted most to hear - that they could once again become world-beating viticulturists - they responded with intoxicated roars. Wine is serious politics in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of which Blanc is serving his second term as council president. And wine is the theme he often uses to explain his new role as president of the European Committee of the Regions, a Maastricht creation set up this year. One of the pushiest politicians on the French right wing, the 55-year-old Blanc brings the same aerated rhetoric to the committee's proceedings. Yet even political adversaries concede that he is a smart operator. Never still, rarely silent, he has ambition written all over him. There were cries of 'Stitch-up]' when Blanc won the presidency of the committee in March. The Socialists had two candidates, Pasqual Maragall of Barcelona and Charles Gray of Strathclyde; they decided to run Maragall in order not to split the Left vote. According to Blanc, Maragall did a deal with the favourite, the Christian Democrat prime minster of Flanders, Luc van den Brande. 'It was designed to kill me,' he said. 'But I won.' Meanwhile, opponents claimed, Blanc had done a deal with Maragall whereby if they led the ballot, they would swap the two top jobs in 1996. Over a stylish but workmanlike lunch with members of his entourage in Brussels I asked Blanc why he had wanted the job so much. 'You underestimate the importance of the committee,' he replied. 'It is always interesting for a politician to head a brand-new organisation.' The committee of 189 elected politicians, ranging from regional barons to municipal captains, is a diluted version of the body first envisaged. The Germans once talked of it as a second chamber of the European parliament. Blanc says its consultative function is still enough to give it great influence over the life of Europe. 'To establish a new political reality in Europe - there aren't many people who could do that. I consider that next to the President of the Commission, of the Parliament and of the Council of Ministers this is the most interesting job.' But you are still mayor of La Canourge? 'I am the mayor, and I invite you to play golf,' he said with a flash of teeth. What do the villagers of La Canourge think you do in Brussels? 'First, they are quite proud. Second, my region and my town are among the priority development zones and therefore they think Europe has brought them money. Also that it helps them sell their agricultural products. They think I am in Brussels too often. But they forgive me.' He leant back with a satisfied laugh. What do you do every week? 'I am saving Europe from despair.' He laughed again. Jacques Blanc started life as a doctor, like his father, and worked as a general practitioner in La Canourge. His curriculum vitae claims he was also a neuropsychiatrist specialising in the treatment of handicapped children. Why did you take up psychiatry? Blanc gave his usual answer. 'Because it's always interesting to study the reactions of men - and women.' Here he winked. I recalled a fellow committee member saying that one thing Jacques Blanc could not be accused of was paying too close attention to other people's views. Now Blanc smiled and said: 'I think I was a very good generalist and a very bad psychiatrist. I'm not mad enough to be a good psychiatrist.' He went into politics because his Lozere region was turning into a desert. Now it had registered the first population gain in 100 years. 'I am very proud of that result, and Europe has contributed.' From local councillor and mayor, Blanc ascended to the national parliament, was secretary-general of Valery Giscard d'Estaing's Republican Party and briefly Minister of Agriculture. When I asked him whether he thought of himself as a still-rising star, or whether he had reached a plateau, he said: 'I think a pleasant plateau. I'm not a candidate for the presidency of France.' Peaceful for the most part, Blanc's committee was torn apart last month when it chose to give an opinion on reforming the wine market. Spanish and Mediterranean members, who fortify their wine with concentrated grape 'must', almost came to blows with the Germans, who use sucrose. Blanc may have thought he had disarmed north-south tension by announcing, even before his election, that he would appoint Dietrich Pause, a gentle-mannered German, as his chief official (the job the Germans wanted). He would not admit to me that he had made a gaffe, but smoothly declared that although the debate had been fierce there had been 'elements to satisfy both sides'. How can regions agree on anything, I asked, when they are in competition for EU money? 'It's the essence of Europe to try to overcome what separates the different entities and try to agree a common line,' Blanc replied. This had been achieved on such important topics as regional aid (the cohesion fund) and strengthening the devolution of power (subsidiarity). The fact that you have large and small authorities on the committee must be a problem. 'It could have been a blockage and I think most of my success is that I have prevented it. And why? Because I am at the same time - forgive my lack of modesty - a big one and a small one, president of a real region and mayor of a small commune as legitimate as the mayor of Rome or Athens. 'For me there is no big, no small - only the elected representative, anointed by the voters.' The mandate of the committee will be renewed at next year's post-Maastricht negotiation. Blanc hopes to achieve full autonomy from the economic and social committee with which he has to share administration and paper clips. He says he does not want control of EU funds. Don't your electorates think you have money to give them? 'The distribution is conditioned by choices higher up. So if we influence the big decisions, without ourselves opening the sluice we can have a say in the water that flows. It is better to be at the source where the great flood is than at the little pipi end of the tap.' He laughed. Is there a danger the committee will encourage separatism? 'No.' Why do people say they are afraid of it? 'Because they haven't understood what regions are. I believe, on the contrary, that regionalism is the antidote to separatism. 'I, who am from a centralised nation and defend the nation state, am not at all bothered by being also spokesman of a region. I'll do it my way. I think regionalism is the best answer to the complex problems we have in all our countries, simultaneously reconciling respect for the state, the grand European design, and the needs of identity.' Nor, he said, did his committee present any kind of threat to the directly elected Euro-MPs. 'That is not the way to look at it. It's a question of complementarity. Euro-MPs have a European mandate. We are elected to exert territorial influence on policy.' But will regions one day, in the distant future, under a federal government, be more important than nation states? 'No. I don't think so. Whether we like it or not, the way chosen is a Europe of nation states, with, of course, all the different levels that constitute them.' Lunch was not over, and Blanc had about 20 minutes in which to catch a flight to Paris. 'No,' he added, starting up from his chair and taking a last slurp of coffee, 'the problem of our democracies is that the citizens don't feel close to those who take the decisions. We have to rediscover that proximity.' An aide passed him his coat and briefcase. 'And when I see sometimes how some of our friends (he seemed to be referring to the Germans) get stuck over a comma, it shows they have misunderstood the role of the committee. 'When you are a legislator, a word is very important. But when you are being consulted, it is not the word or the comma that matters, it is the spirit which blows through it.' With that, Jacques Blanc stretched out a hand and blew from the room.</p>

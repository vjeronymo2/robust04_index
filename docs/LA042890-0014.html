			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO BOOST 'INTEGRITY' OF MINORITY  PROGRAM OKD  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Friday approved a plan aimed at ensuring the  "integrity" of a program that was designed to aid disadvantaged minorities and  women but has come under fire for benefitting political insiders.  </P> <P> The council's unanimous vote will force all women-run and minority-owned  businesses that want to become involved in the city's affirmative-action  program to first be certified by the Office of Contract Administration, a  branch of the Department of Public Works.  </P> <P> The plan was recommended by two council committees after audits that found  hefty profits were made by political insiders who appeared to have been  recruited chiefly for their connections. The insiders included Bishop H.H.  Brookins, a mentor to Mayor Tom Bradley, Betty Dixon, the wife of U.S. Rep.  Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), John Mack, head of the Los Angeles chapter of  the Urban League, and Board of Public Works Commissioner Mylie Evers.  </P></p>

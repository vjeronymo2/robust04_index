			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: 3i offer is expected to be fully subscribed The Pounds 178m public offer for the flotation of 3i, the venture capital giant, closed yesterday with the sponsors saying they were 'pleased' with the level of applications received by Lloyds, the registrar bank. Because of the number of bulk orders handled by retail stockbrokers, however, the final figures are unlikely to be released until tomorrow. Brokers expect the issue to be fully subscribed, but they said that retail investor response did not appear enthusiastic, despite a non-privatisation record number of private investors registering for the 3i prospectus. However, the Pounds 533m offer of shares to institutions, representing three quarters of the Pounds 711m total share offer, was 1.7 times subscribed. Any shares not taken up by the public will be absorbed by the institutional funds.</p>

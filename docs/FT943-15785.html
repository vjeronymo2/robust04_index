			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Murdoch buys stake in John Fairfax Mr Rupert Murdoch has acquired a small stake in John Fairfax, the publisher of three of Australia's leading daily papers in which Mr Kerry Packer and Mr Conrad Black have substantial interests. The 1.7 per cent stake was acquired last month by News Limited, the Australian arm of New International. News said it had bought 12m ordinary shares in Fairfax 'as a passive investment'. Fairfax shares, which were trading at around ADollars 2.60 in mid-June, closed three cents up at ADollars 2.70 yesterday. News Corp shares ended five cents lower at ADollars 8.30. News' disclosure comes at a delicate time for both Fairfax and the newspaper industry generally. It immediately prompted speculation over Mr Murdoch's motives. Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media magnate, is close to the maximum 25 per cent of Fairfax which he is permitted to hold under Australia's foreign investment rules. Earlier this year, in the course of a parliamentary inquiry into Fairfax and media ownership rules, Mr Black made clear that he found this level frustrating and would like it lifted. Mr Black said that if he were allowed to hold 35 per cent of Fairfax, for example, he would consider this 'an adequate position of security' from which to expand Fairfax's operations into Asia. Mr Packer, the Australian businessman, holds 15 per cent of Fairfax, but is also pegged at this level by media cross-ownership rules. Mr Black, through his ownership of the Telegraph group in London, is currently locked in a newspaper price war in the UK with Mr Murdoch, who publishes The Times and other titles. As a result, various explanations were being put forward yesterday for Mr Murdoch's purchase, ranging from a desire to capitalise on Australia's strong domestic recovery, to a 'squeeze play' on Mr Black.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER 'PHANTOM' MATERIALIZES;  </P> <P> 13 YEARS AGO, KEN HILL, RIGHT, THOUGHT THE LEROUX NOVEL WOULD MAKE A FINE PLAY;  LITTLE DID HE KNOW WHAT A GREAT IDEA IT WAS  </P> <P> There's a new Phantom in town.  </P> <P> On Nov. 28, Ken Hill's "The Phantom of the Opera" arrives at the Wiltern  Theatre, a short jaunt from the Ahmanson where Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Phantom"  has roosted since June. Giant print ads hail the distinctions: "The original  London stage musical" is Hill's motto. "Ours is an out-and-out comedy -- with  the music of Donizetti, Bach and Verdi," says producer Jonathan Reinis.  </P> <P> Most importantly, notes the Hill camp, Lloyd Webber has acknowledged that he  got his inspiration after seeing Hill's "Phantom."  </P> <P> "In 1976, I was asked to do a show for a theater in the north of England, who  wanted something fun," said the British-born Hill, 52. "It was for their summer  season, for people who didn't normally go to the theater. I picked up a copy of  (Gaston Leroux's novel) and read it for the first time. I had no idea it  existed. I'd never even see the old Claude Rains movie. But I knew there was a  great story there.  </P> <P> "It's not so much the story of the Phantom himself," he stressed. "Mostly it's  the effect the Phantom is having on these respectable, boring people who're  trying to run an opera house -- and there's a lunatic hiding out in the  building. I saw the real comic potential in that."  </P> <P> In his original staging, Hill utilized the score of a composer he was working  with then. That has since been replaced with the music of Mozart, Weber and  Offenbach.  </P> <P> "Of course, opera buffs will know all this material," noted Hill. "They usually  quite enjoy the show. You see, we poke a little fun at opera and opera singers  -- because opera, like any art form, can get rather pompous. So we have a  theater manager, a secretary, a fat opera tenor, a diva who throws her weight  around, a pretty little ballerina who's always flitting in and out. . . ." The  accompaniment includes keyboards, percussion, bass, cello, French horn and  oboe. "It's a very nice sound," Hill says. "Rather unobtrusive and gentle."  </P> <P> After "Phantom's" provincial run (Hill reports rave reviews -- "but not by any  of the major critics, because they don't travel"), he revived the work in a  London theater in 1984.  </P> <P> The London production was seen by Lloyd Webber and his producer Cameron  Mackintosh -- who then offered to produce Hill's revised staging in the West  End. A few weeks later, Mackintosh called to notify Hill that Lloyd Webber had  decided to write his own "Phantom."  </P> <P> Said Hill, "In hindsight, I'm very relieved. They wanted it to be a big show.  And mine's a comedy thriller, a small show. Therefore, I still have it exactly  as I feel it should be."  </P> <P> No feelings of encroachment? Hill shook his head wearily. "You have to  understand -- I've said this over and over again -- I really don't feel that  strongly about Andrew's decision to go off and do his own show. I'm not a  friend of Andrew's, but I know him well enough to know the sort of person he  is. I actually quite like Andrew. And Cameron's fine. He doesn't care about  this production. I've gotten letters from him saying good luck and that sort of  thing; there's plenty of room for both our shows."  </P> <P> And how does Lloyd Webber feel?  </P> <P> "Andrew's another matter," he sighed, "because his ego is involved. Obviously,  he doesn't like it to be said that if it wasn't for me, his ("Phantom")  wouldn't exist -- that this is where the idea came from. So he's careful to  avoid any mention of it."  </P> <P> Hill paused. "No, I haven't seen his show. Why should I? He's never sent me a  ticket. I cannot comment on it because I haven't seen it. Perhaps it's better  for me not to have seen it."  </P> <P> Why? "Lots and lots of reasons. For one, I might be tempted to make some  changes in my show, mightn't I? And since I haven't seen it, I also cannot  comment on anything else, like . . . similarities."  </P> <P> He stopped, silently regarding the tape recorder. "I have to be careful what I  say. I cannot afford to say anything inadvertently which would get me sued.  Look, everyone has a private face and a public face. Andrew's public face is  that he doesn't like any kind of criticism.  </P> <P> "He was perfectly entitled to go off and write his own 'Phantom,' " Hill  repeated. "He's not done anything improper or illegal at all." He clears his  throat. Subject closed.  </P> <P> Director Peter Farago staged Hill's work in St. Louis in 1986 and in San  Francisco in 1988, but Hill disassociates himself from those stagings. "This  time I wanted to direct it myself and make it a more classy venture. I wanted  to take out the broadness and campery that had crept into it. You see, it's not  a huge musical. It's small in dimension. Small in the number of people on  stage. Small in force. Fourteen actors, two understudies and six musicians. In  England, it's what we'd call a play with songs.  </P> <P> "I'm reproducing an old production," Hill noted of his current duties.  "Nevertheless, I'm having to do it for America -- and there are differences.  The text changes are small, just odd words that Americans don't use or  understand. My main problem is that it's a comedy, and English comedy doesn't  always travel well. Back home the graveyards are littered with the bones of  English comedians who've died in America. So there are little moments in the  play where the humor still needs work, to make it accessible to American  audiences."  </P> <P> So far, the reception has been warm.  </P> <P> "I purchased the North American rights, mounted it at my Theatre on the Square  in San Francisco in 1988 and it ran for 10 months," said producer Reinis. "Over  200,000 people saw it. It grossed in excess of $3.4 million. Then I licensed  the show to a national touring promoter, Electric Factory Concerts in  Philadelphia." Electric's Allen Spivak has since overseen the play's 35-city  trek. Variety reported last week that the tour recouped its $1 million cost  after only eight weeks on the road. The show will travel to Symphony Hall in  San Diego from Dec. 19-31.  </P> <P> Earlier in the tour, reports surfaced of audience confusion over which  "Phantom" they were seeing. Last June, Spivak and partner Larry Magid filed  federal lawsuits in Georgia and Ohio alleging that local promoters were  impeding their booking efforts. "The (Atlanta) paper ran the wrong ad, which  didn't have the disclaimer where we clearly say who we are," Spivak explained  curtly. "So we did have a little confusion. But there's been no problem since  then, a minor amount of refunds. And there's no current litigation."  </P> <P> Hill himself is visibly uncomfortable at the idea that audiences would attend  his show by mistake. "I'm very anxious that that should not happen," he said  soberly. "Because if they come with the wrong expectations -- expecting a  spectacular, then not getting one -- we're in trouble, no matter how  entertaining the play is. But you know, I don't care about standing up to  Andrew. My work's all right. I know exactly where the play is, how good it is.  It has good standards. It's very well done."  </P> <P> Still, he admitted, the David and Goliath metaphor hasn't been that far off the  mark.  </P> <P> "There was a period when it was very difficult to get dates. People said, 'Yes,  we'll take it,' then changed their minds. A theater manager doesn't know the  history of our show. For all he knows, we're just some cheap-jack merchants  hanging on Andrew's coat-tails and trying to make some quick bucks. So  naturally we've been treated with some suspicion."  </P> <P> Hill's producers flatly deny the charge of riding on anybody's coat-tails. "I  prefer to say it's a case of an author getting his just deserts," Reinis  stated. "If Webber and Mackintosh hadn't changed their minds, my 'Phantom'  would've been their 'Phantom.' So maybe it's a question of the tail wagging the  dog. There's a certain amoung of justice to it."  </P> <P> Added Spivak, "I knew it was going to be a success, and I've been proven right.  Now we're in a 'Phantom'-mania; everybody's jumping on the bandwagon. It's nice  to know we called the shots early on." Spivak is right about one thing: "The  Phantom" is a hot ticket. In addition to the current "Phantom of the Opera"  film (with "Nightmare on Elm Street's" Robert Englund), a TV miniseries version  with Burt Lancaster and Charles Dance is upcoming.  </P> <P> Hill himself is justifiably weary of all the "Phantom" hoopla; after he puts  some finishing touches on the Los Angeles staging, the 30-year theater veteran  heads back to his London base. "I've had eight weeks of hotel rooms," he said  dryly. "I just want to go home." And back to work.  </P> <P> "Either I'm writing or directing -- or both," he said genially. "That's all I  do. Year in and year out. I never get a holiday. Actually, I've been very  lucky. I'm one of the few people in England who earns his living just being a  writer in the theater. Though I've never made it big, I've never been out of  work either -- because my work does tend to be very popular."  </P> <P> And when, on rare occasion, it isn't? Look I've done between 100 to 200 plays,"  he said briskly. "When you have that many first nights, you're going to get  slighted from time to time. The thing is, I have a very thick skin. I have to,  you see. If you write and direct a show and the critics don't like it, they  throw the bricks at me. If they like it, they praise the cast. I'm telling you  I can't win. I'm also telling you I don't care, because it's been going on so  long."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding the operation of Japanese fishing boats  in the waters around the Kuril Islands, the Japanese Government  has started considering working out a bilateral treaty with  Russia that would allow Japanese fishing boats to operate in the  area by paying fishing fees to the Russian Government. Local  authorities of Russia's Southern Kurils regional administration  originally proposed the idea of the "fishing fees system" to the  authorities of Nemuro city in Hokkaido, but the Japanese  Government has so far opposed it, saying that it would lead to  Japan's acknowledging Russia's illegal seizure of the northern  territories. However, Russian authorities, among other  measures, have strengthened a crackdown on violations in the  region. This has seriously affected the livelihood of Japanese  fishermen. For example, the Russian action has decreased their  catch. For this reason, the Japanese Government has changed its  traditional stance, hoping to settle the matter in a practical  way. It intends to conclude an agreement with Russia on the  matter this year by finalizing basic plans hopefully by August  in time for next year's fishing season.    On 3 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a Diet  foreign  affairs committee that the government "wants to encourage  studying the matter," although it must still be "in line with  the government's basic stance on the territorial issue." He  thus indicated for the first time that the government is taking  a positive attitude regarding the matter. He was answering a  question from Muneo Suzuki of the Liberal Democratic Party. In  response to Suzuki's pressing the government to "finalize the  plans by August," Kakizawa said: "We will do our best."    There currently exists a commercial agreement to pay fishing  fees to Russia that is limited exclusively to gathering kelp off  Kaigara Island. Last March, the local head of Russia's Southern  Kurils regional administration, which has jurisdiction over  Kunashir and other islands of the Kurils chain, proposed to  Nemuro Mayor Kaiji Oya to expand the fishing fees agreement to  allow Japanese fishing boats to operate in all of the waters  around the northern territories. Local fishermen of Nemuro and  other cities, who seek safer fishing operations, heartily  welcomed the proposal. At the time, however, the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs rejected the idea, asserting that "since the  agreement on gathering kelp off Kaigara Island is an extremely  special case, expanding the agreement to allow fishing in all of  the waters around the northern territories would have a bearing  on the very roots of our stance regarding the territorial issue."    The government has now changed its stance because  immediately  after the Russian proposal was submitted, Russian authorities  stepped up cracking down on violations by initiating a policy  called "Putina (Fishing Season) `94." This posed a threat to  the livelihood of many Japanese fishermen. For example, it led  to a decreased catch as recorded by the Rausu Fishing  Cooperative in comparison to the previous year. In turn, this  led to mounting complaints against the government among local  fishermen, calling for a change in its policy. The Russian  Government claims there were nearly 8,000 cases of violations by  Japanese fishing boats last year, and Japanese fishing boats  continue to be seized.    However, should Japan agree to adopt the proposed fishing  fees system, it could be taken by the international community  that Japan has made concessions regarding claims of its  sovereignty over the northern territories. On top of that, it  may give rise to the possibility of other forms of illegal  fishing operations. Thus, there still are many hurdles to be  cleared beforehand.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> DE NIRO AND PENN TRY TO WING IT IN 'WE'RE NO ANGELS'  </P> <P> In "We're No Angels" (citywide), Robert De Niro and Sean Penn are cast as  dim-bulb characters, reminiscent of the low-lifes in "Stranger Than Paradise,"  or even of the Dead End Kids. As these slow-witted, would-be streetwise  goofballs try to navigate their way through the movie, their faces screw up  into bizarre contortions or dissolve in empty panic.  </P> <P> De Niro and Penn have played dumb before. De Niro had his punchy moments in  "Raging Bull" and Penn became famous doing the drug-addled surfer Spicoli in  "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." But here, they're dumb on a fuller level: two  guys who don't have a clue and keep miraculously faking their way along anyway.  </P> <P> Their arias of idiocy waiver all the way between shameless over-acting and  inspired foolery. But director Neil Jordan and writer David Mamet's tale of  escaped convicts disguised as priests in a 1930s era Northeast border town has  its charms. It's a comedy about dumb luck, fortuitous grace, about two sinners  redeemed by absurd awe-inspiring flukes. And, though it's a flawed work that  never jells, a comedy that exposes its serious side too readily, it keeps  getting eerie little grace notes.  </P> <P> Mamet obviously wants to suggest a kinship between the escaped cons, De Niro's  Ned and Penn's Jim, and the monks who take them in. Emotionally, they're all  alienated from the outside world. The cons' edginess can also be read as piety,  and their jailhouse demeanor -- watchful, sneaky-sly -- as gravity. So there's  a symbiosis. Ned and Jim grow into their roles, do good despite themselves.  They're like the whiskey priest in Graham Greene's "The Power and the Glory."  The cloth takes them over.  </P> <P> The movie is set during the Depression and the town, created from scratch by  production designer Wolf Kroeger, is a dingy, muddy, wind-swept frontier city  that recalls the locale of Robert Altman's "McCabe and Mrs. Miller." In this  impoverished setting, even the opulent church has a leaky roof. That's why  their "miraculous" Madonna seems to be crying. And, against this desperation,  both the wild license of the escaped killer, Bobby (James Russo) -- who can  sneak a gun into an execution -- and the mad despotism of the warden (the late  Ray McAnally) show the frontier spirit at its scariest extreme.  </P> <P> Ned and Jim are innocents trapped between maniacs. They're caught between an  "evil" and a "good," equally deranged and dangerous, and their only hope is to  con their way across the bridge and border in the annual pilgrimage. When, like  buddy-buddy Alices in a cold Wonderland, they find an epigram on hospitality  from the Bible, in the middle of wintry desolation, it's like the precursor in  a fairy-tale, or parable.  </P> <P> "We're No Angels" is full of interesting things. It's a more intelligent,  daring, textured work than many recent big studio movies. But it's a  disappointment, because of the superb talent involved, not just De Niro and  Penn, but cinematographer Philippe Rousselot, Mamet and Jordan. The film is  less funny than it should be, less hypnotic. It never really establishes an  imaginative equilibrium, and some of the performances are pitched in too broad  a key.  </P> <P> Jordan, whose films are often brilliant on both cinematic and literary levels,  fell badly with farce his last time out -- the ruinously edited "High Spirits"  -- and his temperament may be a little too intense for this material. An  Irishman, from a Catholic country, he obviously responds to the impudence of  the convict-priests notion and, as "Company of Wolves" and "High Spirits" both  show, he has always liked fairy tale forms. But he may be making a mistake in  trying to impose his view -- special, fervid, highly poetic -- in even slightly  formula American movies.  </P> <P> In a way, his sensibility never quite connects with Mamet's. Like the whimsical  Bill Forsyth and the moralistic John Sayles in "Breaking In," they may even  work against each other. Mamet's austerity, the almost emotionless performances  he coaxes from his actors as a director, suggest a different key than the  feverish, volcanic intensity Jordan likes to get. Jordan's characters sweat and  batter at their bars, cry against their fate, while Mamet specializes in dry  maneuvers and measured cynicism. He's more fascinated with the game, Jordan  with the torment of the players.  </P> <P> In the friendly acting contest between De Niro and Penn, Penn makes some canny  scores. De Niro takes the gruff, embittered, knit-eyebrows stance he used for  his bounty hunter in "Midnight Run" and takes it further. He digs himself in,  plants his face like a clenched fist, and works up four or five comic glowers  and variations on wary, disguised hostility. He also has a hilarious confession  scene with Bruno Kirby as a sex-crazed deputy.  </P> <P> But Penn's dazed Jim is a real surprise, particularly after his virulent  machismo turn in "Casualties of War." Despite his rebellious, taciturn image,  Penn plays him incongruously sweet. Jim's spiritual metamorphosis is a joke,  but it's a tender joke infused with some awe and grace. "We're No Angels" (MPAA  rated R for sex, violence, language and nudity) proves that a great ensemble is  no guarantee of a great movie -- but it also proves that the misses of the  brilliant can still give you something extraordinary.  </P></p>

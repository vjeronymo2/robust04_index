			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> KENDALL ENDS DROUGHT WITH WIN  </P> <P> Tom Kendall has been on the fast track since he began racing automobiles at age  18.  </P> <P> But after a year without a victory on the Sports Club Car of America Trans-Am  circuit, Kendall, a La Canada resident, is back in the winner's circle.  </P> <P> Kendall, 23, moved into first place in the series with a victory Saturday at  Cleveland. He averaged 111.96 m.p.h. in his Chevrolet Beretta over the 42-lap,  99-mile circuit at Burke Airport.  </P> <P> Kendall, who also won the Trans-Am event at Detroit a few weeks ago, has 135  Trans-Am points.  </P> <P> All-Star: Lamar Lovett, a wide receiver who helped lead Franklin High to its  second consecutive City Section 3-A Division championship last season, is a  member of the South team for the 39th annual Shrine All-Star Football Game,  July 28 at the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> Lovett (5-foot-10, 170 pounds) caught 88 passes for 1,189 yards and 16  touchdowns. He also rushed for four touchdowns.  </P> <P> Tee it up: Emilee Klein, who plays out of Glendale, defeated Kelly Ann Kemper  of Lewisville, Tex., 5 and 4, Tuesday in first-round match play of the 64th  Women's Western Golf Assn. Junior Invitational at Austin, Tex.  </P> <P> Klein, the California state amateur champion, fired a 6-over-par 78 on Monday,  one shot better than Kemper on the 6,098-yard, par-72 Live Oak course at  Lakeway Country Club. Klein is 16.  </P> <P> Championship-flight match play continues through Friday. First-round losers  fell into the consolation bracket.  </P> <P> Standing upright: The football season does not begin until September, but  Hoover High has already scored.  </P> <P> The Tornadoes received two new goal posts, valued at about $4,000, for lending  their stadium a few weeks ago to the HBO series "1st &amp; Ten," which features  O.J. Simpson.  </P> <P> Bound to be a Badger: Hoover High's Creighton Harris has signed a letter of  intent to run cross-country and track at the University of Wisconsin.  </P> <P> Harris, who chose Wisconsin over Northern Arizona, ran the 1,600 meters in a  personal-best 4 minutes 14.33 seconds at the state meet, although he did not  qualify for the final.  </P> <P> Basketball finale: There may have been a shortage of players, but enthusiasm  was abundant at last week's Camp Fire Stars and Stripes All-Star basketball  games, which featured graduating seniors from 12 Glendale-area high schools.  </P> <P> In the boys' game, five of the West's 12 players failed to show up. The East,  coached by Crescenta Valley's John Goffredo, loaned two players to West Coach  Kirt Kohlmeier. The East still managed to win easily, 97-84.  </P> <P> Steve Finch of Crescenta Valley led the East with 19 points. Glendale's Brian  Porter had 18 points and Brent Overfelt, also of Glendale, added 17.  </P> <P> Guy Nembhard of Glendale Academy, one of the players originally slated to play  for the East, led the West with 23 points.  </P> <P> In the girls' game, Juliana Holmstrom of Hoover scored a game-high 24 points to  lead the West to a 51-49 victory.  </P> <P> Yolanda Davidian of La Canada led the East with 23 points.  </P></p>

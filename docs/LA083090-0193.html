			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> COUNCIL REJECTS MOTEL CONVERSION  </P> <P> The City Council this week ordered owners of a board-and-care facility on  Lincoln Avenue to stop operating because of concerns that the rooms were being  rented illegally as apartments.  </P> <P> The council refused to grant Maria Machado of Cerritos a conditional use permit  to convert the facility into a motel because of fears that guests would  continue to live there on a long-term basis.  </P> <P> Before 1978, the property operated as the Jumbo Inn motel.  </P> <P> Speaking on behalf of Machado, Bob Gilbert told the council that more than half  of the people staying at the facility are long-term residents. The majority of  them are poor and would be out on the streets if the $10-a-night facility were  shut down, he said.  </P> <P> "They have people they just don't want to evict," Gilbert said.  </P> <P> Gilbert asked the council to give Machado six more months to operate. He said  that Machado was trying to sell the property and needed the income from the  rentals.  </P> <P> However, in a unanimous vote, the council decided that without significant  changes to the building that Machado is not prepared to make, the building  would continue to be used as apartments.  </P> <P> "No one in good conscience could approve this as a hotel," Councilman John  Kanel said. "It is not the right place to have this."  </P> <P> Zoning on that portion of Lincoln Avenue does not allow for residential  establishments such as apartments. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

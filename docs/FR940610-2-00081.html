			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The manufacturer must submit an audit workplan describing the audit to the Office of Drug Pricing for review. The workplan will be reviewed for reasonable purpose and scope. Further, a determination will be made that only those records of the covered entity that directly pertain to the potential violation(s) will be accessed including those systems and processes (e.g., purchasing, distribution, dispensing, and billing) that would assist in identifying a violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Duration of Audits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Audits shall be performed in the minimum time necessary with the minimum intrusion on the covered entity's operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Audit Steps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The manufacturer shall notify the covered entity in writing when it believes the covered entity has violated provisions of section 340B. The manufacturer and the covered entity shall have at least 30 days from the date of notification to attempt in good faith to resolve the matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The manufacturer has the option to proceed to the informal dispute resolution process described later in the notice without an audit, if it believes it has sufficient evidence of a violation absent an audit. If the matter is not resolved and the manufacturer desires to perform an audit, the manufacturer must file a request for a covered entity audit with the Office of Drug Pricing. [See section `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> For Further Information <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' for address.] The request must set forth a clear description of the reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 340B(a)(5) (A) or (B) has occurred, along with sufficient facts and evidence in support of the request. In addition, the manufacturer shall provide copies of any documents supporting its claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Office of Drug Pricing will conduct a preliminary review of the documentation submitted to determine if reasonable cause exists. If the Office of Drug Pricing finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 340B(a)(5) (A) or (B) has occurred, the audit will be permitted, and the manufacturer will be notified accordingly. In cases where the Office of Drug Pricing determines that the audit shall be performed by the Government, the Office of Drug Pricing will so advise the manufacturer and the covered entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The filing of a request for an audit does not affect any statutory obligations of the parties as defined in section 340B of the PHS Act. During the audit process, a manufacturer must continue to sell covered outpatient drugs at or below the section 340B ceiling price to the covered entity being audited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Upon approval of the request for a covered entity audit, the manufacturer shall then submit an audit workplan to the Office of Drug Pricing for approval. The Office of Drug Pricing, after consultation with the PHS Office of Cost and Audit Management, will evaluate the manufacturer's workplan, and approval will be based on criteria set forth in the Audit Program section, Field Work Standards for Performance Audits, Government Audit Standards, Current Revision. The audit workplan shall describe in detail the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Audit objectives (what the audit is to accomplish), scope (type of data to be reviewed, systems and procedures to be examined, officials of the covered entity to be interviewed, and expected time frame for the audit), and methodology (processes used to gather and analyze data and to provide evidence to reach conclusions and recommendations);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Skill and knowledge of the audit organization's personnel to staff the assignment, their supervision, and the intended use of consultants, experts, and specialists;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Tests and procedures to be used to assess the covered entity's system of internal controls;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Procedures to be used to determine the amounts to be questioned should violations of section 340B(a)(5) (A) and (B) be discovered; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Procedures to be used to protect patient confidentiality. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) When the audit workplan has been approved, the Office of Drug Pricing shall notify the: (1) Manufacturer of the approval of the audit, and (2) covered entity of a pending manufacturer audit. The covered entity will have at least 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice to prepare for the audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Suggested audit procedures include the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Review the covered entity's policies and procedures regarding the procurement, inventory, distribution, dispensing, and billing for covered outpatient drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Assess internal controls applicable to the policies and procedures identified above ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1) when necessary to satisfy the audit objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Review the covered entity's policies and procedures to prevent the resale or transfer of drugs to a person or persons who are not patients of the covered entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Test compliance with the policies and procedures identified above ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3) when necessary to satisfy the audit objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Review the covered entity's records of drug procurement and distribution and determine whether the covered entity obtained a discount only for those programs authorized to receive discounts by section 340B of the PHS Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If a covered entity does not use an all inclusive billing system (per encounter or visit), but instead bills outpatient drugs using a cost based billing system, determine whether the covered entity has provided its Medicaid provider number to the Office of Drug Pricing and billed Medicaid at the actual acquisition cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

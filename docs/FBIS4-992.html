			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P. Bulgar] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 19 SAPA -- The Multiparty Negotiating  Council [MPNC] will convene at the World Trade Centre on  Wednesday [20 April] to draw up legislative amendments to  include the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in the elections.    Parliament will sit in Cape Town on Monday to pass the  amendments, Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer told  Tuesday's meeting of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC].    The MPNC session follows Tuesday's historic agreement in  Pretoria between President F W de Klerk, African National  Congress President Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party  leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The agreement was hailed as an  "historic breakthrough" by Mr Meyer and ANC Secretary General  Cyril Ramaphosa.    They said it would contribute towards the goal of an  all-inclusive constitutional settlement and would help bring  peace and stability.    The TEC will meet after the MPNC session to ratify the  legislative amendments. The amendments include changes to the  Electoral Act, the Interim Constitution and the 13th  constitutional principle providing for the future position of  Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.    Political leaders struck an upbeat tone at the TEC meeting  which was delayed for several hours because key members were  involved in the talks at the Union Buildings. "This agreement  could make a major contribution to reducing the violence in the  country," Mr Meyer said.    He said it would reduce tension. The parties viewed the  agreement as a "major achievement" which would bring joy to all  South Africans. He said the agreement did not resolve all the  outstanding problems but for the moment it was a major  contribution.    Mr Ramaphosa said it was an agreement of "great and  historical significance" and that it had laid the foundation for  a peaceful transition. He described it as "the mother of all  breakthroughs" and said people could "heave a sigh of relief"  that it had been reached. He urged all parties to accept the  agreement so that it could have a rapid passage through the MPNC.    Mr Meyer said Parliament had to be recalled because it was  not possible to change constitutional principles after the  election.    He said that in terms of Section 74 of the constitution,  changes to constitutional principles could only be made before  the elections.    In terms of the "agreement for reconciliation and peace",  Section 160 of the constitution dealing with the powers and  functions of provinces would be amended to "provide for the  institution, role, authority and status of a traditional monarch  in the province, and shall make such provision for the Zulu  monarch in the case of the province of kwaZulu/Natal".    Constitutional principle 13 will be amended by the addition  of the paragraph: "Provisions in a provincial constitution  relating to the institution, role, authority and status of a  traditional monarch shall be recognised and protected in the  constitution."    The amendments will satisfy the IFP and the Zulu royalists  for the time being until they are further elaborated upon in  international mediation after the elections.    Apart from the constitutional amendments, there are also  amendments to the Electoral Act to allow the IFP to take part in  the election after its provisional registration lapsed when it  failed to submit lists of candidates last month.    Mr Meyer said the IFP's registration would be "reopened" and  that it would be given time to file candidate lists. He added  that this concession was only in respect of the IFP.    He said the negotiators had agreed that the IFP's name, logo  and the picture of its party leader would be printed on adhesive  strips which would be attached to the bottom of ballot papers by  electoral officers. A proposal that it be added to the back of  ballot papers had not been acceptable to the IFP, he said.    He said the Independent Electoral Commission's task of  arranging the election had to be kept in mind and that it would  not be possible for other parties to change their candidate  lists.</p>

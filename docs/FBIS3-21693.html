The  operation took three months.    The police teams established that a certain Atif Baytaz  would  smuggle the tablets into the country. They placed him under  surveillance and established that he met Ali Demir, a truck  driver in his hotel. Demir later picked up the tablets from a  house in Karagumruk and drove his truck to meet with the people  who wished to buy them. A car owned by Mehmet Kasar, a known  drug trafficker, approached his vehicle. The police teams  arrested Demir and Ahmet Gani Bilici, Cengiz Cincih, and Kamil  Goren, who worked for Mehmet Kasar as they were transferring the  Captagon tablets from the truck to Kasar's car. Atif Baytaz and  Mehmet Kasar were also arrested at about the same time.    The teams are reported to have impounded 3.5 million  Captagon  tablets, the estimated market value of which is $5 million.</p>

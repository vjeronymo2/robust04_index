			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Ministers review pension provision: Proposal would encourage personal plans THE GOVERNMENT is considering raising the retirement age for women to 65 and using the cost savings to encourage millions of people to opt out of the state basic pension scheme in favour of their own personal pensions. The plan is still in the early stages of development and has grown out of the government's review of plans to equalise pension ages for men and women. Raising women's retirement age to 65, although politically unpopular, will generate Pounds 3bn in savings, while lowering men's retirement age to 60 will cost about the same amount. Equalising at 63 produces no cost savings. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is expected to recommend raising the retirement age for women to 65 to match that of men in a white paper to be published in late spring. The government's own social security advisory committee recommended equalising at 65, but using the cost savings to help the worst-off among the elderly - mostly women with no occupational pension. But government ministers are said to have reacted unenthusiastically to the proposal and the Treasury has taken the view that any cost savings should be diverted to general revenues. Ministers are said to be aware of several stumbling blocks that could make opting out of the state basic pension scheme difficult. They are aware that a big hurdle to any change would be a sharp increase in costs to the Treasury in the early stages of transition. This would see revenues from national insurance contributions fall without any parallel re-duction in pension payment liabilities. The plan envisages using the Pounds 3bn in cost savings from equalising at 65 to cover the shortfall in national insurance contributions that will result from the opt-out. The UK operates a 'pay-as- you-go' system in which national insurance contributions pay the pensions of those who have already retired. If significant numbers of workers were to opt out of the basic scheme, there would not be enough money to pay present pension liabilities. It is possible that in the early years of an opt-out scheme additional tax revenues would have to be committed to meet basic pension costs. Also, ministers are concerned that if the scheme does not provide for automatic diversion of national insurance contributions to a personal-pension scheme, individuals might be tempted simply to spend the tax break and fail to save for their old age. The scheme is one of a number of radical measures under study by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. It aims to build on the right to opt out of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps), taken up by about 4.5m people since the right was introduced in 1988.</p>

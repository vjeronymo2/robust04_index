			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Management: One small step for Manpower Mitchell Fromstein, head of the world's biggest employment services company, Manpower International, was in Havant, Hampshire, last week to witness a small revolution for the UK labour market. The deal between the UK Manpower subsidiary and IBM that brought Fromstein from Milwaukee involved just 92 employees. But unlike most of Manpower's temporary staffing arrangements, IBM was handing over to it complete responsibility for the staffing and management of a new national centre for service calls. Instead of merely supplying, say, 10 computer operators to a company for three months, Manpower in Havant is itself deciding the staffing and supervising requirements for the service call centre, following performance guidelines laid down by IBM. What Manpower calls 'managed staff contracts' are not entirely new, indeed the first one - involving the manufacture of ice cream - was established four years ago. There are now nearly 30 in the UK - including all non-professional staff at the Department of Social Security in Leeds - and more than 100 in the US. As in normal temporary contracts, staff are directly employed by Manpower but usually stay for much longer periods with a single employer on the longer-term managed contracts. But for Manpower, there are two especially significant points about the Havant deal. First, it has been struck with IBM, a company with a highly-developed human resource management strategy of its own. Second, it involved a brand new unit rather than just taking over responsibility for the human 'software' of an existing plant. The deal is on cost-plus terms for Manpower but IBM manager Mike Coleman says that it will provide significant savings for his company in cash and management time. Manpower says that the request to take over more and more responsibility for units of staff is market led. 'It wasn't our idea but the thing is now starting to mushroom - we've got about 50 projects in the pipeline in the UK,' says Fromstein. The 'managed staff contract' has come of age.</p>

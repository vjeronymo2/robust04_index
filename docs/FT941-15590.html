			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Industrial tribunal research Employers are more likely than employees to consider the outcome of their cases at industrial tribunals to be fair, says research published yesterday, Lisa Wood writes. A random sample of cases covering unfair dismissal, redundancy payments, the wages act, and discrimination in 1990-91 were examined in the research published in the Employment Gazette, the official journal of the Department of Employment. Two-thirds of the participating employers thought the outcomes to be fair, compared with half of the applicants. About 70,000 applications to industrial tribunals are made each year, the majority of them concerning unfair dismissal claims. The study also found that two-thirds of all claims were either settled or withdrawn before reaching a full hearing; of the one third that went to a full hearing just less than half were upheld. The average payment made to those whose cases were upheld was Pounds 1,490.</p>

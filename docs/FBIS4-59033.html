			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Murderer Suddenly Escaped"] </F>   [Text] The head of the cultural center of the Islamic  Republic of Iran in Lahore, Pakistan was killed by members of  the Seoah-e Sahaba Wahhabi group [extremist Sunni group  allegedly supported by Saudi Government] in the month of Azar  [22 November-21 December] in 1367 [year beginning 21 March  1990]. The Pakistani Government arrested eight persons in this  case. The group members were interrogated and the leaders were  sentenced to be executed. However, this sentence was never  carried out due to the pressure of certain influential groups.    A few days ago, Pakistani publications carried a brief  report  on the escape of Rashid Sabra, one of the members of the group,  while he was being escorted to the special tribunal, in what  seemed to be a clearly manipulated scenario.    Sabra's escape may be viewed by the local Pakistani  officials, including the provincial Punjab government, as a  normal incident but in the Iranian public's opinion, this shows  a lack of decisiveness in a bilateral issue. The provincial  government affiliated with the Muslim League, which claims to be  more Islamist than the ruling Pakistan People's Party, can only  mar the friendly relations between the two Muslim countries of  the region with such an attitude. This also raises the question  in the minds of the Shiites about what country is giving orders  to the Muslim League leadership.    The protection of the lives of citizens and diplomats  resident in every country is the responsibility of the central  government, on the basis of international protocols. When Ganji  was martyred, the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran  displayed immense restraint and poise and merely requested that  the culprits be punished. However, it did not receive any firm  or categorical response.    Riaz Sabra is a Pakistani citizen who acted on instructions  from some subservient group and martyred one of the cultural  officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran and who has become  linked to the tarnishing of bilateral relations.    Therefore, if the Pakistani Government does not agree with  the rumors currently circulating about the nature and the modus  operandi of the Sepah-e Sahaba group, it should immediately  issue orders for Sabra's arrest and should execute the sentence  against all the accused persons of the group. Otherwise, the  protests by public opinion will only wound the religious  susceptibilities of the Iranian people and will certainly  motivate the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to  display an official reaction.</p>

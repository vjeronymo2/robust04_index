			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Japan, which not only ranks first in the world in  providing official development assistance (ODA) but also is the  second-largest financial contributor to major international  organizations after the United States, is one of the most  important financial contributors in the world. On the other  hand, however, despite Japan's financial contribution, the  number of Japanese working for international organizations is  far less than that of foreigners. Staff members of  international organizations are required to remain neutral as  international servants. However, there is the expectation that  they will serve as an important diplomatic channel for their  respective countries. In view of this, there is concern that  the lack of Japanese staffers in international organizations  will affect Japan's efforts in forming its future international  strategy.    Since 1991, the World Bank, which finances long-term  development loans with low interest rates to developing nations,  has sent a staff member to its Tokyo office as a manager of  Japanese staff members. The reason the World Bank is seeking  Japanese for staff members is that "since Japan's ODA has  increased, it has increasingly become necessary for us to  promote a dialogue through Japanese staff members with the  Japanese Government on policies for helping developing nations"  (according to the World Bank Tokyo office).    However, at present, the number of Japanese working for the  World Bank headquarters is 100, 2.11 percent of the total staff  members. Those Japanese staff members are all in senior posts,  such as economic analysts. As far as a ratio of appropriation  of funds to the World Bank is concerned, Japan comes second to  the United States (17.4 percent). But when a percentage of  staffers is considered, Japan is not only far behind the United  States (25.62 percent) but also falls behind the UK (7.16  percent), whose funds appropriation ratio is 4.6 percent, which  is lower than Japan's.    Even in other international organizations, including the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the number of  Japanese staff members is far less than other nations. Although  Japan is the second-largest financial contributor to both the  IMF and OECD following the United States among five  industrialized nations (Japan, the United States, Germany, the  UK, and France), the number of staff members working as expert  or senior officials is the smallest.    Yasushi Takase, professor of Tokai University Law Department  who worked for GATT for nearly 30 years and retired in March  1992, said that underlying Japan's falling behind in providing  human resources contribution is the fact that, "besides the lack  of language proficiency, Japanese interest in working for  international organizations is languishing due to a sharp  increase in salaries in Japan."    However, it is strongly requested both at home and abroad  that the Japanese Government increase its staff members so that  Japan will be able to have more diplomatic channels to foreign  nations and Asian nations' policies can be reflected in policies  of the international organizations. It can be said that "it is  time for Japan to send competent personnel from government  organs and the private sector to international organizations  that are strategically important to Japan" (as stated by  Professor Takase).</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> UNEMPLOYED: Stride, the free-lance, drug-sniffing English cocker spaniel, is  back home in Orange after trying out to be Berkeley's first police dog. . . .  The Berkeley City Council wanted a drug hound that was friendly and  unintimidating, but Stride's $10,000 price tag proved intimidating indeed. . .  . "He's worth every penny of it," insists Stride's owner/trainer, Fred  Kjorlien.  </P> <P> "He's a sweetheart. All he does is find dope." . . . But the job went to a  Labrador retriever.

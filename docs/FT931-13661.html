			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Oil sector Like tea, the Opec oil cartel is strongest when it is in hot water. With the price of crude sliding to levels which cause producers real pain, next month's Opec meeting may thus be expected to produce substantial quota reductions. Before that, though, there will be plenty of jockeying for position. Saudi Arabia seems ready to cut output. Others have yet to agree. Yet the weak fiscal position of many Opec members provides a strong imperative to raise oil prices - particularly because most producers cannot expand output much further. Demand is also flat, with Europe and Japan mired in recession and relatively mild weather in the US cutting the need for heating oil. In Europe, the petrochemicals industry also slumped further in the last quarter of 1992, notably in Germany. With refining and petrochemical margins under pressure, and a low crude price, the outlook for oil company revenues is poor. Without a strong worldwide recovery in 1993, the oil majors will have to continue cutting costs. Further rounds of head office redundancies are likely. Capacity cuts in hard-hit areas like petrochemicals may follow. With the industry moving towards a lower cost base, even those with stronger balance sheets such as Shell and Exxon are beginning to follow the lead of hard-pressed BP. Companies may try to earn extra margins where they can - hence Shell's attempt to edge up UK petrol prices this week. Making price rises stick in a poor market is another matter.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Mexico's PRI loosens a 64-year grip MEXICO'S governing party has proposed far-reaching political reforms that go a long way to meeting opposition demands for a more independent electoral system and more equitable competition between political parties. The reforms were unveiled on Wednesday and are to be debated in a special session of Congress. They would set ceilings on party spending, give parties guaranteed access to the media, hand over power to electoral tribunals, and increase opposition presence in Congress by selecting a third of the Senate according to proportional representation. While the proposals are unlikely to threaten the dominance of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), they were immediately hailed by independent observers. Federico Reyes Heroles, editor of the independent magazine Este Pais, said: 'It meets all the central demands of the opposition. This is an abrupt step in the modernisation of Mexico.' The opposition itself was more cautious, describing the still incomplete proposals as a step forward but still insufficient. However the centre-right National Action party is expected to back the reforms. Most of the opposition has come from within the PRI, with many of its congressmen expressing incredulity at the changes. The proposed reforms come as President Carlos Salinas de Gortari enters his last year in power and are intended to defuse opposition charges before next year's presidential vote that Mexican elections are neither free nor fair. PRI has been in power in one form or another for 64 consecutive years, and has long been criticised for rigging elections, grossly outspending opposition parties in campaigns, and ramming legislation through Congress. While such mechanisms have helped the PRI stay in power, electoral irregularities and protests have undermined the legitimacy of the PRI in and out of Mexico and damaged its capacity to govern. With the opposition in some disarray, President Salinas has gambled that his party can easily afford to concede opposition demands without endangering its hold on power. Under the new rules, the government would allow independent companies to audit the voting list and distribution of voting credentials and would accredit independent observers. Electoral tribunals would verify congressional elections, and not, as now, Congress itself. Results would be released immediately. They would limit the maximum contribution by an individual or organisation to a political party, and the amount that a party might spend on campaigns 'to prevent the disparity in resources decisively influencing the electorate'. Contributions could only be given to parties, and not to individuals. The PRI has also proposed that each state be given three rather than two Senate seats, with the third senator coming from a minority party that obtains more than a set percentage of the vote. The law would also scrap the so-called governability clause, which guarantees a majority in the House of Deputies to a party which obtains more than 35 per cent of the vote. No one party will be allowed to have more than 65 per cent of the deputies. The changes should make the electoral process more transparent, and Mexico's Congress more powerful. Even if the reforms make the job of winning elections and passing legislation more difficult for the PRI, Mr Salinas is prohibited from the constitution from running again for president, and will not have to suffer the consequences.</p>

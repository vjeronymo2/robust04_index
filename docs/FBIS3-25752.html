			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Salome Moiane has  said that the Mozambican Government is to react officially to  South Africa's threat to electrify the border with Mozambique  once again. On 20 February, South African Police officials  distributed pamphlets in Ressano Garcia town, in Maputo  Province, saying that the common border would be electrified  once again to reduce border violations by Mozambican citizens.    Deputy Foreign Minister Moiane has told the DOMINGO  newspaper  that some reports say those pamphlets were dropped from a small  aircraft, which may have violated Mozambican air space.    The Mozambican deputy foreign minister is currently in  Windhoek, the Namibian capital, to represent the Mozambican  Government in the ceremony that will see Walvis Bay Harbor  returned to Namibia.</p>

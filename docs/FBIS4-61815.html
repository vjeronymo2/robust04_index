Monday [9 May] at noon, Estonia and Poland concluded an  agreement on avoiding double income and capital taxation.  [passage omitted]    Estonian-Polish cooperation must cover all fields, from  national security to education, President Lennart Meri told an  improvised news conference on Monday    Walesa said Poland had several ideas on how to promote  inter-state cooperation. "I am sure that my current visit will  contribute to promoting bilateral relations and that our  countries will only gain from it, also in the material sense,"  he said.    Commenting on Polish-Russian relations, Walesa said that  civilised and democratic Russia could be a good partner to  Poland in case it respected the same values Poland did. "As  Poland's President I can say that I will not allow to set the  Russian yoke on Poland again," Walesa said.    Both Meri and Walesa agreed Kaliningrad would be a good  economic asset for the Baltic Sea region while it remains a  serious source of problems as a military stronghold.    Laar said Estonia and Poland will in near future sign a free  trade agreement. "Poland's President would have been willing to  sign it at once," Laar said while adding that Estonia would set  up an embassy in Warsaw very soon.    Poland's president also visited Estonia's parliament and met  its speaker, Ulo Nugis. Nugis and Walesa also discussed the  situation of ethnic minorities in Estonia. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Matanzas Province correspondent Candido Dominguez </F> -- live or recorded]    [Text] Approximately 70,000 people here will participate in  the parade commemorating international workers day, which will  take place next Saturday [30 April] at 0900 on the Matanzas Bay  viaduct. The spaciousness of this new avenue that skirts the  bay, along with the care with which the preparations are being  made, portend a special splendor to this massive gesture,  despite the fact that the inevitable austerity of the current  moment prevents our using certain equipment and other material  resources.    Yadira Garcia, a member of the Politburo and first secretary  of the Communist Party of Cuba in Matanzas, said that the people  of Matanzas have the special responsibility this year of  expressing the joy, militancy, and steadfastness not only of the  people of the province, but of all the people throughout the  nation. Making the closing speech today [date not specified] at  a meeting to review preparations for the 1 May activity, Garcia  recalled that this year there will be parades only in Matanzas  and Pinar del Rio. She expressed her confidence that the parade  to be held in the City of Matanzas will be a success, and  announced that over 100 foreign guests will attend.    This meeting, held at the Atenas movie theater, was attended  by administrative and union representatives from all sectors,  the UJC [Union of Young Communists], and the mass organizations,  and was characterized by great enthusiasm, expressed in  exchanges of emulative challenges between unions.</p>

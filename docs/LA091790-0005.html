			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TODDLER 'REAL WELL' AFTER A NIGHT TRAPPED IN HOLE  </P> <P> A toddler trapped for 14 hours in a shaft dug for a construction project busied  himself making mud balls and listening to his mother sing nursery songs before  rescuers reached him at dawn Sunday.  </P> <P> "It was really difficult. I could hear him crying, but I couldn't touch him and  I couldn't help him," Lisa Davis, mother of 20-month-old Kevin, told reporters  as she fought back tears.  </P> <P> The rescue workers cheered when the boy was brought to the surface shortly  after 6 a.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> "When he clinched my fingers, I felt a tingle in my heart," said firefighter  Joe Cipri, who pulled him out. "It's still there."  </P> <P> Kevin was taken to Denver General Hospital, where he was treated for mild  hypothermia, dehydration and scrapes on his elbows.  </P> <P> About eight hours later, he was sent home, wearing a T-shirt and shorts and no  visible bandage or other sign of his ordeal.  </P> <P> Dr. Michael Murray, the emergency room physician who treated Kevin, said the  toddler was given food and fluids to counteract dehydration.  </P> <P> "I don't anticipate any psychological problems down the road. He came through  this real well," Murray said.  </P> <P> It all started at about 4 p.m. Saturday, when Kevin fell into a hole, 18 inches  wide and 12 feet deep, that was dug for a remodeling project.  </P> <P> Firefighters worked through the night to keep the boy warm and dry. They pumped  oxygen into the hole and used lights to keep the temperature at about 70  degrees.  </P> <P> His mother said that Kevin kept himself amused by rolling mud into balls with  his fingers and spinning himself around in the hole.  </P> <P> Rescue workers first dug a vertical shaft, then delicately tunneled through the  five feet of earth to where Kevin was.  </P> <P> Tom Davis, the boy's father, said he did not have a permit to dig.  </P></p>

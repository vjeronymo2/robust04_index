In comparison with  the Russian Ministry of Security, abolished in December, the  number of personnel is being cut by 46 percent. Sergey  Stepashin, first deputy head of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service, reported this in an interview to INTERFAX. According  to him, the new service will not have investigation and  detention centers. It will not be fighting corruption, which is  not characteristic of its functions. Such functions were  formerly carried out by Ministry of Interior organs. The  Lefortovo detention center where organizers of the 3-4 October  events in Moscow are now being held is being transferred to the  Ministry of Internal Affairs. All these changes were approved  in the course of today's meeting in Moscow between the leaders  of the Federal Counterintelligence Service and President Boris  Yeltsin.</p>

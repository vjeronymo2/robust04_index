			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political </F> Department, by 'Abd-al-Ra'uf Arna'ut "following the Arab foreign  ministers meeting" in Cairo on 26 March]    [Text] [Arna'ut] What are the latest developments with  regard to the resumption of the peace talks and the principles  which cannot be ignored regarding this matter in light of recent  events in the occupied territories? And when do you expect the  talks to resume?    [Qaddumi] From the outset we insisted that the talks be  resumed after the Security Council adopts a resolution and after  measures are taken on the ground. In other words, providing  measures for the protection of our people in the occupied  territories, especially in Hebron, in order to create a suitable  climate for the negotiating process. Hence, to date we have  been discussing those measures with the Israelis and the  cosponsors before beginning talks about other issues.    [Arna'ut] Recent Palestinian statements indicate that there  is an emphasis by the Palestinian leadership on the presence of  international protection in Hebron although there are other  areas which require such protection no less than Hebron. Is the  leadership insisting on the presence of this protection in  Hebron only?    [Qaddumi] Security Council Resolution 904 covered all the  occupied territories, but in particular we asked for special  arrangements in Hebron because of the presence of settlers and  students there and because of the ongoing friction in the city,  which regrettably witnessed those repugnant massacres. However,  all the measures that we demanded cover all the occupied  territories. Those include the presence of international  observers and Palestinian security forces and the adoption of  measures aimed at disarming the settlers and preventing them  from wandering around with their weapons. Moreover, other  measures will have to be adopted so that we will have enough  reason to resume the talks.    [Arna'ut] Do you believe that the international presence, on  the basis of the Security Council resolution, will be adequate  in providing protection for the Palestinian people under  occupation?    [Qaddumi] This is one of the measures that must be taken in  accordance with the Security Council resolution, but the  definite guarantee for our people in the occupied territories is  when the Palestinian police assumes this protection. Above all,  there must first be a speedy Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and  the Jericho area.    [Arna'ut] Don't you believe that the presence of police in  the Hebron area, then in other parts of the West Bank, will be a  deviation from the Declaration of Principles? And in light of  Israeli procrastination, will this not mean -- as some observers  have indicated -- that Gaza and Jericho will be first and last?    [Qaddumi] This is neither correct nor accurate. The  withdrawal is supposed to begin on 13 April. Afterward, the  Israeli forces will withdraw from all heavily populated areas  and be deployed along the red line. Thus, there will be an  initial and speedy withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, then before  elections are held in July there will be another withdrawal from  all the Palestinian territories.    [Arna'ut] Do you expect the arrival of the first vanguards  of the Palestinian police to the occupied territories?    [Qaddumi] First of all agreement must be reached on security  measures, then in the talks we will discuss the date for the  entry of these battalions into Gaza and the Jericho area.    [Arna'ut] What is your perception of the nature of  Palestinian action in the period up to the Israeli withdrawal  from the occupied territories? And are there any guarantees  that a massacre, similar to the one in Hebron, will not be  repeated?    [Qaddumi] There are no guarantees that similar incidents  will not occur, but world public opinion, which has denounced  and condemned such deeds, has put Israel in a difficult  position. However, we cannot say for sure that such deeds will  not be repeated. We have absolutely no confidence in the  occupation. As long as there is occupation and as long as  Israeli soldiers suppress the Palestinian people, resistance  must continue by all available means.    Arna'ut] Don't you think there is a contradiction between  the continuation of the talks and the practices by the Israeli  authorities against the sons of our people?    [Qaddumi] First of all, war is another form of policy.  Second, it does not at all prevent talks from taking place.  These sorts of talks were conducted when Vietnam was waging a  war. Vietnam witnessed the most abhorrent kinds of inhuman wars  and the most intensive bombing during the negotiations that were  held between the Americans and the Vietnamese. This is the  nature of aggressive wars waged by occupation forces and  international imperialist forces.    [Arna'ut] Many calls have been made by the Palestinian  street to the Palestinian leadership to halt the talks until a  change occurs in the Israeli position. Meanwhile, the  leadership is going to decide to resume the talks. How could  the leadership be harmonious with the mood of the masses in the  Palestinian street?    [Qaddumi] First of all, undoubtedly leaderships are the ones  representing public opinion. Second, what is the alternative to  negotiations? Will we achieve what we want if we halt the talks  completely or if we walk out of the talks and not insist on  implementation of the Security Council resolutions in terms of  the adoption of measures for the protection of our people?    [Arna'ut] Does continued Israeli settlement activity in  Jerusalem not represent a violation of the Oslo accord and the  bases and principles of the invitation to the Madrid conference?    [Qaddumi] The United States and European countries say that  settlements are an obstacle to peace. European countries stress  in official communiques that settlements are illegal. In  Resolution 465, the Security Council says that these settlements  are illegal and must be dismantled. For all these reasons, we  say that we adhere to international legitimacy and that the  solution should be based on this legitimacy. We cannot make the  slightest concession on these rights.    [Arna'ut] What is the state of Arab coordination regarding  the resumption of talks?    [Qaddumi] We maintain bilateral contacts with our brothers  in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan and consult on these issues.  Although some Arab states believe the Oslo accord to be a  deviation from Arab coordination, they must understand that  there is a transitional stage. This stage does not exist in the  other Arab tracks. We had to take off in order to conclude the  transitional stage so that we would reach the final stage with  the Arabs and so that all of us would negotiate over this stage,  leading ultimately to a comprehensive peace agreement which all  of us will sign at the same time.    [Arna'ut] Did the Arab foreign ministers meeting today yield  positive results for the Palestinian territories and the Arab  arena in terms of reconciliation and joint Arab action, for  example?    [Qaddumi] There were positive indications. All the Arab  foreign ministers agreed to the Palestinian decisions, supported  the intifadah, stressed that Jerusalem was part of the occupied  Palestinian territories, and issued a statement condemning the  Hebron massacre. These are positive measures that have begun to  evolve with time and prove the Arabs' desire to enhance Arab  coordination and solidarity.    [Arna'ut] Do you have a statement for the Palestinian  people?    [Qaddumi] If there is one thing I want to say it is that our  conflict is long but we will triumph. I am not saying this to  encourage our great people who have waited for many years, but  the historical process affirms that we will triumph and regain  all our rights. Patience is a good thing, but action and  resistance should continue. While resisting, we are keen for  the safety of our cadres and are trying to reduce our losses as  much as possible. We will continue in this struggle and will  not become restless. We will act when we see that such action  is beneficial to our cause.</p>

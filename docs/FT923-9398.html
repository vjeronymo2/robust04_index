			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / People: Breuel quits SKB Birgit Breuel, president of the Treuhandanstalt, has resigned as a non-executive director of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group. The company says she has resigned because her extensive duties in Germany prevent from her contributing effectively to the board. When Breuel joined the board in the autumn of 1990, she was deputy head of the agency which has the job of privatising state-owned industry in the former East Germany. She took over as president the following April, after Detlev Rohwedder, her boss, was assassinated. SmithKline is looking for a replacement; she was the only woman on the board. ***** Keith Negal, recently group chief executive of Alpine and formerly a director of Tomkinsons, has been appointed chief executive of GRIPPERRODS. ***** Paul Kilduff has been appointed group finance director of TRANSPORT DEVELOPMENT GROUP in place of Stephen Bodger who recently became directeur general of Ostra, the group's subsidiary in France.</p>

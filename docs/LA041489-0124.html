			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RECORDS  </P> <P> Melodiya, the Soviet Union's only record company and the world's largest record  producer, will soon receive competition from Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, a  small, prestigious U.S. record company that embarked on a joint venture with  Soviet partners to produce recordings of Soviet artists for sale in both  countries. Melodiya, which issues 1,000 titles a year with a total pressing of  100 million copies, has been criticized for its poor quality of recordings and  a lack of daring. Calling its new company Arts and Electronics, the joint  venture has already built a state-of-the-art digital recording studio in the  Moscow Conservatory of Music. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

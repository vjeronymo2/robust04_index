			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ofgas making illogical distinctions Sir, Your leader, 'The cost of saving energy' (May 25), failed to spot the legally dubious reasons of Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, concerning the implications of price rises caused by energy efficiency expenditures. Your discussion about who should bear the 'costs' of saving energy makes the same illogical distinction between the treatment of expenditures on demand-side options (such as energy efficiency) and supply-side options (like building transmission lines) that Ms Spottiswoode has made. She has decided that the former should be seen as 'taxes' or 'levies' which she cannot pass through to consumers under her existing powers in the Gas Act, while the latter are long-term investments properly incurred for the benefit of all customers and thus to be paid for by all customers. This distinction ignores that supply-side expenditure may also benefit only a small number of customers, or particular class of customers, such as big industrial users. Conversely, supplying loft insulation to prevent the need for transmission lines in the first place may benefit all customers - whether or not all receive loft insulation. Providing expenditures confer benefits on all gas customers, there is no justification for your suggestion that the costs of saving energy should be met by taxpayers rather than gas customers. By allowing a 'pass through' element for energy efficiency expenditures, Sir James McKinnon, Ms Spottiswoode's predecessor, was acting within his powers to protect the interests of consumers in respect of price. He also fulfilled his statutory duties to take into account the physical effects on the environment. Ms Spottiswoode, possibly in violation of her legal obligations, appears to be unaware she even has such obligations. In cases of doubt, it is the role of the judiciary, rather than Ms Spottiswoode, her private advisers or members of the House of Commons environment select committee, to define conclusively the nature and extent of her regulatory powers. A judicial review would not only provide her with the guidance she clearly needs, but also clarify for the benefit of present and future directors-general of utilities watchdogs - Ofgas, Offer, Oftel and Ofwat - what their statutory duties are in respect of energy efficiency and the environment.

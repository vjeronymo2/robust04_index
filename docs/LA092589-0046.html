			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX MUDDLE  </P> <P> Washington's growing frenzy for some sort of cut in the capital gains tax is  being driven by politics and not by economic common sense. Democrats and  Republicans in Congress should take a deep breath and back away from their race  to reap political capital by offering the most appealing package of capital  gains rate reductions. Then President Bush should realize that his reelection  prospects in 1992 will not turn on the outcome of his 1988 campaign pledge to  cut the capital gains tax rate from the present maximum 28% (33% in some income  categories) to 15%.  </P> <P> Until Bush ran for President, there was no passion for further tinkering with  the tax system. The reforms of 1986 have only now gone fully into effect.  Congressional tax writers urged that no major changes be considered until they  could see how the reforms were working. But during the 1988 campaign, Candidate  Bush pledged to seek a reduction in the capital gains tax rate. Now President  Bush is pursuing his promise, in part to generate some quick revenue that would  be gleaned from the turnover of stocks, property and other assets that would be  triggered by the lower rate. The revenue bonus, however, would turn into a  deficit of an estimated $11 billion by the sixth year of the program, according  to Treasury Department estimates.  </P> <P> Democratic leaders in Congress originally opposed any capital gains reduction  on the argument that it primarily would benefit the rich. Under the pre-reform  system, taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 or more got three-fourths of the  benefits. But fearful of being outmaneuvered by the President, Democrats have  countered with a package that would include a more modest capital gains  reduction, a tax increase in top income brackets and reinstatement of the  $2,000 deduction for investments in Individual Retirement Accounts.  </P> <P> There is some argument for changing the 1986 law. Doing away with the IRA  deduction was a mistake. And the new tax rates contain a quirk by which a  couple's taxable income of between $77,850 and $177,720 a year is assessed at  33% while all other income above that enjoys a maximum rate of 28%. That should  be fixed. Democrats would raise the maximum tax rate for all the higher  brackets to 33% and use the revenue raised to pay for restoration of the IRA  deduction and to reduce the budget deficit.  </P> <P> But Bush has pledged to veto any tax increase, and the heart of the argument  remains the wisdom of cutting the capital gains rate. Before tax reform, the  increased value of assets held for more than six months were taxed at only 20%  compared with rates of up to 50% on other income. In exchange for greatly  reduced rates, Congress decided to tax gains the same as regular income.  </P> <P> If that is to be changed, there should be some rationale other than politics --  to provide more equity in the system, obtain some desired economic effect or  provide significant new revenue. But the Bush plan would not provide more  equity and ultimately would lose revenue.  </P> <P> A number of economists and businessmen agree with Bush that lowering the gains  rate will encourage new investment and savings. But this opinion is by no means  unanimous. Herbert Stein, who was chief economic adviser to Richard M. Nixon,  argues that evidence of economic benefit is murky. Further, to have the desired  effect of increasing savings and the quality of investment, the lower rate  should apply only to future investments, and not to assets held today.  </P> <P> Those investment decisions already have been made on the basis of existing tax  law. But allowing the lower tax on assets acquired after the law goes into  effect probably would eliminate the chance of picking up any new revenue, Stein  added, along with any real political interest in such a plan.  </P> <P> There may be ways to fashion capital gains legislation that would channel new  investment into specific areas such as research and development, but that runs  the risk of creating a whole new generation of tax shelters. There are other  ways for government to encourage such investment.  </P> <P> Both the President and Congress should reassess just what it is they are trying  to achieve by slapping together an isolated tax plan this year. Together  perhaps they can fashion a program that will do the job that really needs to be  done.  </P></p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar edges downward The dollar eased against the D-Mark and the yen in late trading yesterday after the US Federal Open Markets Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, did not announce an interest rate rise at its monthly meeting, writes Motoko Rich. Against the yen, the dollar closed in London at Y98.1350, down from Y98.70. Against the D-Mark, it finished at DM1.5470 from DM1.5551. In late trading it had dropped below Y98.00 and DM1.54. The US currency ended in New York at Y98.105 and DM1.5435. The D-Mark strengthened slightly on the European crosses, although political uncertainty in advance of the October 16 general election limited the upside of the German currency. The markets bounced the Italian lira around as they focused closely on the progress of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's attempts to pass a suitably tough deficit-cutting budget for 1995. The market had been on tenterhooks throughout the day, in anticipation of an FOMC announcement on interest rates. Most analysts expected that the Fed would not act at this meeting. Still, some corners of the market had priced in as much as a 50 basis-point rise, and the failure of the Fed to produce such a move drove the dollar down. It regained some footing as markets seemed to take the news with equanimity. 'The fact that the Fed has not done anything yet does not mean it will not do anything before the next meeting,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, currency economist at UBS. 'It is bad, but not disastrous, for the dollar, since the Fed will probably maintain a bias towards tightening.' Meanwhile, the markets continued to await the outcome of trade talks between the US and Japan before the September 30 deadline for sanctions. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, arrived in Washington yesterday and indicated that Japan would make an effort to reach a deal on the auto sector, the area which has been the most likely target for sanctions. The dollar moved positively against the yen on the back of these comments and analysts became increasingly optimistic that a reasonable compromise would be reached. Although political concerns kept the market apprehensive about the D-Mark, thin trading helped the German currency maintain, and even strengthen, its position against most other European currencies. Against the French franc it closed unchanged at FFr3.417. Against the Danish krone it finished at DKr3.928, up from DKr3.926, and against the Swiss franc it ended at SFr0.829 from SFr0.828. The D-Mark is unlikely to get any inspiration from tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank council. In recent days the central bank's officials have been making comments which suggest that a cut in rates, which has been anticipated in some quarters, is improbable. Bundesbank council member Mr Reimut Jochimsen said the bank should pursue a cautious monetary policy while a further reduction in inflation may prove difficult because of rising commodity prices. In addition, yesterday's preliminary national cost of living figures for September came in at 2.9 per cent, basically flat against 3 per cent for August. These factors contributed to a market expectation that the Bundesbank will hold its fire tomorrow. But Mr Cunningham said: 'There is still scope for rate reductions if the trend in inflation continues to go down and the money supply shows a deceleration of growth.' The lira slipped against the D-Mark to as low as L1009.50 in early trading as markets responded negatively to the failure of the Italian government to reach an agreement with trade union leaders on a pension reform plan. But hopes that ministers could pass a budget as early as last night raised optimism about the lira. The Italian currency was further bolstered when Mr Berlusconi said the deficit reduction in the 1995 budget could exceed the previously planned L45 trillion. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America, commented: 'If the government stands up to the unions, even if they go on strike, that should be good for the lira in the long term. The markets want to see a government that has the strength of its convictions.' The lira ended in London at L1006 per D-Mark, unchanged from Monday's close. Sterling tracked the dollar down in late trading, but was relatively steady throughout the day. The pound closed in London at Dollars 1.5770, up from Dollars 1.5743, and at DM2.4396, down from DM2.4482. The December short sterling contract saw 16,350 lots traded and finished unchanged at 93.19, allowing for a short-term interest rate of 6.81 per cent. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 155m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 300m. Overnight rates traded between 4 3/8 and 6 1/4 per cent. German call money was quoted between 4.30 and 4.40 per cent.</p>

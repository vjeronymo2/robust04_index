Regarding Indian-Russian relations, Kirichatyy quotes Prime  Minister Rao as saying, "Relations between Russia and India have  always been good, but especially since President Yeltsin's visit  to our country last year. We managed to resolve a number of the  most difficult questions which arose as a result of the changes  taking place in Russia. We have now reached the stage where we  have the opportunity to make faster progress. I hope my visit  and the various agreements to be signed will give new impetus to  the development of Russo-Indian ties. Russia and India need  each other." "They need to work together."</p>

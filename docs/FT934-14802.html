			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as region sets records CONTINUED selling of Nikkei 225 component stocks which failed to be included into the new Nikkei 300, depressed share prices, but the index recouped some of the morning losses on afternoon support from arbitrageurs and investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average fell 98.91 to 20,038.40. The index hit the day's high of 20,167.22 before falling to the day's low of 19,997.90 in the morning session, dropping below the psychological support level of 20,000 for the first time since September 29. Volume totaled 235.3m shares against 225m. Losers led winners by 639 to 349 with 175 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.73 to 1,645.53. while in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.10 to 1,276.95. Profit-taking in stocks which were adopted for the new 300 issue index was also noted. Some traders said index-linked selling was not helping sentiment, already weak from pessimism over the economy. Mr Alan Livsey, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said few investors were willing to take the risk of selling before a possible income tax cut and economic recovery next year. Among Nikkei 225 component stocks, not included in the new index, Hitachi Zosen fell Y4 to Y375, Suzuki Motors lost Y15 to 945 and Keisei Electric Railway declined Y20 to Y1,130. Nikkei 300 component stocks which fell on profit-taking included House Food Industrial, Y40 lower at Y2,710, and Secom, the security company, which lost Y30 to Y7,060. Video game and other entertainment companies fell on reports of poor earnings at Konami. Konami fell by its daily limit of Y500 to Y3,930, while Sega Enterprises plunged Y300 to Y10,100 and Nintendo lost Y180 to Y8,320. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 93.34 to 22,251.21 in volume of 19.7m shares. Roundup Another impressive performance was seen in Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG stumbled briefly early in the day rallying to another record finish, with property stocks again at the forefront. The Hang Seng index rose 39.51 to 8,292.96, overcoming an early loss of 79.4 points. Among property stocks, which have soared on analyst reratings this week, Henderson Land rose 40 cents to HKDollars 27.70 and Cheung Kong added 25 cents to HKDollars 30.75. AUSTRALIA bounced back after Tuesday's losses, the All Ordinaries index rising 10.6 to 2,038.6, led by a bullish gold sector. The gold marker jumped 61.8 to 2,154.3. NEW ZEALAND remained at a 46-month high, and the NZSE-40 index ended 1.34 higher at 2,041.12. TAIWAN moved sharply higher after a wave of late buying in finance issues, encouraged by continued hopes for a cut in the stock transaction tax. The weighted index rose 52.26 or 1.3 per cent to 3,994.51 in active turnover of TDollars 25.48bn. MANILA finished at a third consecutive record high, with the Manila index 18.20 higher at 2,112.03. SINGAPORE posted a third consecutive high reflecting a rally in local blue chips as well as in Malaysian semi-blue chips traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 2.41 at 2.053.88. SEOUL moved ahead for the third straight day, in a buying spree which took the composite index ended 16.82 ahead at 740.39. KUALA LUMPUR regained its composure after a shaky start, fuelled by foreign fund interest in blue-chips. The composite index finished at a sixth consecutive high, up 5.67 at 911.38. BANGKOK advanced 3.53 per cent after Tuesday's decline, amid strong demand for bank stocks and the SET index rose 38.94 to 1,140.90, only 2.88 points off its all-time closing high of 1,143.78 points set on July 25, 1990.</p>

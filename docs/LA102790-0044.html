			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE MAN CHARGED WITH SMUGGLING OSTRICH EGGS  </P> <P> An unemployed Oceanside man was indicted Friday on federal charges of smuggling  more than $300,000 worth of fertile ostrich eggs into the United States from  Mexico, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> The three-count indictment against Roger L. Jacobson, 52, alleges that he  imported 327 eggs through the San Ysidro port of entry, Assistant U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> Michael G. Wheat said.  </P> <P> On Oct. 19, Jacobson reportedly tried to sneak 110 eggs, hidden in his car,  past U.S. Customs inspectors, Wheat said. An inspector found the eggs, however,  and called Customs agents, who retrieved 217 eggs that previously had been  brought into the U.S., Wheat said.  </P> <P> Wildlife and quarantine laws prevent importation of the eggs, according to the  indictment.  </P> <P> The indictment charged Jacobson with one count of smuggling and one count of  importing wildlife. The third count said that Jacobson was convicted in Los  Angeles in 1964 of grand theft and charges him with being a felon in possession  of a firearm, a loaded .44-caliber Magnum revolver.  </P> <P> If convicted on all charges, Jacobson could draw 20 years in federal prison and  up to $750,000 in fines, Wheat said.  </P> <P> Jacobson is to be arraigned Nov. 2, Wheat said.  </P></p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Clinton friend to head White House BY common consensus, the best White House chiefs of staff in the past 20 years have been Richard Cheney in the Ford administration and James Baker, in President Reagan's first term: the worst are considered to have been Hamilton Jordan, who worked for President Carter, and John Sununu under President Bush. The first two were successful because of their native political skills, their understanding of their presidents and administrations and a relative self-effacement on the job. The second pair fared less well because they were combative and were sometimes contemptuous of Washington and its ways, and, in Mr Sununu's case, ferociously ideological. In choosing Thomas F McLarty, the Arkansas businessman whom he has known since kindergarten, President-elect Bill Clinton has made it clear that he wants in this sensitive position somebody he instinctively trusts and who is more interested in pursuing the presidential agenda than any personal crusade or self-publicity. With 11 senior positions now in place, the Clinton administration is shaping up as an interesting combination of the Washington and Wall Street establishment mainstream on the one hand and a new breed of outside activists on the other. More than that, he expects them to work together in ways that the capital has not seen for some time. Ron Brown, named on Saturday to be the next Secretary of Commerce, is the quintessential political insider. The 51-year-old black lawyer's career has moved seamlessly from the civil rights movement through the Urban League, the effective lobby for the cities, and a stint as the Rev Jesse Jackson's right hand to a fabulously successful four years as national Democratic party chairman. His law firm represents any number of corporate and foreign clients, including, at one stage, the Haiti of President Duvalier. These connections may make his confirmation hearings tougher than most but Mr Brown's ability to sail through apparent political and private conflicts of interest is impressive. Mr Clinton said he wanted the commerce department under Mr Brown to be a 'powerhouse' in Washington. Partly because of its amorphous responsibilities and partly because it has been traditionally used for pure political reward, this has not been its reputation for many years. But, in the Clinton administration, it will have a place on the new economic advisory body to be chaired by the president himself and directed by Robert Rubin, now the co-chairman of Goldman Sachs. So will another relative backwater, the labour department, under Robert Reich, the Harvard professor. Mr McLarty's appointment, in the opinion of many political observers, makes more likely the selection of Mr Warren Christopher as secretary of state. In an interview yesterday, Mr Christopher, former deputy secretary of state and now transition team director, brushed off all such speculation, which is based mostly on the fact that he was thought to have had the option of three jobs, two of which have been otherwise earmarked: chief of the White House staff and, though yet to be determined, attorney general. It is also deemed significant that Mr Clinton has chosen his economic and social policy teams first, thus fulfilling an essential promise of his campaign. On Friday, he took issue with a questioner who wondered why he had not first named the four cabinet secretaries traditionally considered the most senior  -state, defence, justice and treasury. He was careful to add, however, that this did not imply a relegation of foreign and security policies, which, he said, should be active and pre-emptive so that his administration would not be 'swamped' by a succession of demanding external crises.

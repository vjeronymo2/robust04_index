			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol, 21 Jun -- Serhiy Tsekov, Supreme Council  of Crimea chairman, has visited Sevastopol. He met there Black  Sea Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin, Sevastopol City Council  Chairman Viktor Semenov, and some Republican Movement of Crimea  activists who are running in the election to the city council of  the next convocation.    Meeting representatives of the mass media, Serhiy Tsekov  stated that "the Supreme Council of Crimea has no problems with  the government." At the same time he spoke against the  president of Crimea being granted directive powers and against  Ilma Umerov, a Crimean Tartar deputy, being appointed to the  post of Crimea's social policy minister.    Serhiy Tsekov added that the city of Sevastopol should be  fully integrated in Crimea and that "if Crimea's authorities  fail to achieve this in a civilized manner, a decision will --  in the worst case -- be taken declaring Sevastopol the capital  of Crimea." Oleksiy Melnikov, Supreme Council of Crimea deputy  chairman, backed that opinion, saying: "If Russia does not need  Sevastopol, Crimea does."</p>

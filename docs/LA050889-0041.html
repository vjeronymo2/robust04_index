			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> OFFICER'S DEED SAVES SUSPECT  </P> <P> Still wearing his shoes and his seven-pound bulletproof vest, Fresno Police  Officer Patrick Farmer swam 75 yards across a pond to save a robbery suspect  from drowning. Police had chased three suspects in a fast-food restaurant  holdup to a ponding basin, where they abandoned a car. Two were captured  quickly and Farmer heard the third, David Mendoza, 19, shout for help from the  water. Farmer, who was trained in rescuing drowning people while serving in the  Navy, took off his duty belt carrying his pistol and handcuffs and jumped into  the water. "I didn't have time to take off my bulletproof vest, and I left on  my shoes because I didn't know what the bottom of the pond was like," Farmer  said. "Looking back, I probably should have taken off the shoes and the vest,  because they really got in the way." Farmer said Mendoza didn't say anything to  him afterward, "but I heard him tell one of the other officers, 'Hey, tell that  cop thanks for me.' "  </P></p>

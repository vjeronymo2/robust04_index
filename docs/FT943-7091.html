			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Arts: Shakespeare in many tongues - The Edinburgh Festival Brush up your Shakespeare, and brush up your languages. Last week the Edinburgh Festival brought us Antony and Cleopatra in German, this week A Winter's Tale in French. Meanwhile, the Fringe includes A Midsummer Night's Dream and Iago (rewrites of the Shakespeare plays) done by the Ukrainian company Theatre on Podol; the latter takes place in a swimming pool. The official festival companies perform with a heavy sprinkling of Shakespeare's lines on surtitles. This adds a peculiar irony to watching the performance: for, while we read the text on high, we watch what directors have made of it onstage below. The Winter's Tale in French stands at the opposite pole to last week's Berliner Antony and Cleopatra. That was prose, its action downscaled and updated, its tone intimate, its texture organic. This is poetry, its action taken out of any realistic context and its content carefully distilled, its tone cultivated, its structure rejigged by shifting floors and scenery. The director is Stephane Braunschweig, the production from the Centre Dramatique National, Orleans-Loiret-Centre, Theatre-Machine; and Braunschweig shows how intelligently he understands the play. Leontes, the King of Sicily so suddenly and violently obsessed by false and jealous convictions about his wife Hermione and best friend Polixenes, is here shown as a man who absurdly over-dramatises his own innermost thoughts, who soliloquises in a manner far more melodramatic than he reveals in private: until this private, ludicrous, histrionic side takes him over in public as well and makes him monstrous. But Braunschweig directs like a pathologist. He lays the workings of the play out on the slab: analysed, organised, labelled, and dead. Leontes's hammy neurosis is played out by Pierre-Alain Chapuis in the most actorly French manner, full of special vocal contrivance; and this is set against the far calmer manners shown by those around him. He clutches at a large red curtain in his early torment of jealousy, and the curtain becomes a symbol of melodramatic distortion. Meanwhile, each area of the stage shifts, so that the scenery itself becomes a symbol of the play's often distorted emotional perspectives. Several scenes are played out on a rake of about 40 degrees. At four hours (with interval), this Winter's Tale feels a great deal longer than the Berliner Antony (three hours 40 minutes without interval): longer because - oh] - slower. As the play develops, every line - every word - becomes an etude. And Paulina, whose reckless courage and moral outrage are the strongest force in the play to counter Leontes's punitive jealousy, is played by Sophie Daull in artificial style, self-consciously playing to the house for precious effect even in the most intense scenes. Braunschweig knows that some parts of the play are comic, others idyllic, others charming, and shows us how and why. I like the use of a female 'cellist in between scenes; she also plays Emilia. And I like the way that Hermione appears, beautifully veiled in white, while Antigonus recounts his fatal dream of her; and how she then remains there, like Patience on a monument, until - lifting her veil - she becomes the role of Time and tells us how 16 years have passed. Charming. But neither here nor elsewhere has the production any naturalness or convincing inner life. Calculation is all too evident. Meanwhile, on the fringe, from 10.15pm till 12.30am, the Ukrainian Theatre on Podol is giving its Iago at the Infirmary Street Swim Centre. Desdemona does a length of breaststroke to elope with Othello, Iago is forever chucking people and props into the water, Othello and other characters go for a swim at regular intervals. This is Othello re-told (though less radically than the same company's Midsummer Night's Dream) and it sounds utterly prosaic to this English ear. But the action is completely fluent. I always wanted to know what would happened next, and/or how it would happen. Othello (white, without make-up) is dignified and yet always outshadowed by the towering, inscrutable, plausible Iago. Desdemona is innocent, spontaneous, unintelligent, a natural victim. At the end, both Iago and Othello are placed under arrest, on the jetty that projects out into the pool, for their crimes; Iago reveals all and handcuffs himself to Othello; and Othello, having learnt how he has been duped, calmly stabs himself. His body falls back into the pool, pulling in Iago after it. The lights fall on Iago trying desperately to keep the dead Othello afloat.</p>

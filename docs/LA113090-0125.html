			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOURASSA PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MURDER CHARGE  </P> <P> Richard H. Bourassa Jr. pleaded not guilty Thursday to a murder charge  involving the shooting death of a 17-year-old classmate, the second friend who  died in his Anaheim Hills home since 1986.  </P> <P> Orange County Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown scheduled Bourassa's trial to  begin Jan. 22.  </P> <P> A Juvenile Court judge has already ruled that, because of the seriousness of  the charge and since Bourassa will be 18 in January, he should be tried as an  adult.  </P> <P> Holding his stepfather's .38-caliber pistol, Bourassa was in his family's den  with friend Christian Wiedepuhl on May 24 when, he told police, the gun  accidentally discharged. Wiedepuhl was wounded once in the forehead and died  early the next morning.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have said that the physical evidence -- gun residue and the  direction from which the bullet struck the victim, for instance -- does not  support Bourassa's story of what happened. They suggest that Bourassa tried to  scare Wiedepuhl by aiming and then firing the gun at him in a reverse form of  Russian roulette. They allege that Bourassa, who is dyslexic, removed one round  but misjudged the direction in which the five-bullet gun chamber would rotate.  </P> <P> On Sept. 12, 1986, in the same room and during the same hour of day, Bourassa  and friend Jeffrey Bush, both 13, were pointing rifles at each other when the  shotgun in Bourassa's arms went off. Bush was struck several times by buckshot.  After he was declared brain-dead the next day, his heart was transplanted into  the body of a Northern California woman. Police ruled the shooting accidental.  </P> <P> Bourassa remained in custody at Orange County Jail, where he was being held in  lieu of $100,000 bail.  </P></p>

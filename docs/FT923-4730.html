			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Excalibur regains its confidence in Ratners EXCALIBUR GROUP, the jewellery manufacturer and engineer, said yesterday that it was now happy to supply Ratners, the jewellery retailer which announced large losses and new banking agreements last month. Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman of Excalibur, was speaking after he announced that he and other members of the management of the company had bought 2.8m Excalibur shares. He said the group was 'much happier' about supplying Ratners 'now that banking support is in place'. Suppliers had been wary of selling to Ratners fearing bad debts, and this could have put a constraint on the retailer in the run up to Christmas. About 13 per cent of Excalibur's jewellery sales go to Ratners, a proportion that had declined from more than 20 per cent. But Mr Griffiths said that he would now consider doing more business with Ratners if asked. He said Ratners was 'paying us superbly'. Mr Griffiths said that in the consumer division generally the group had 'to be mindful of what exposure we have' to retailers. However, business was better in engineering activities. The Excalibur shares were bought at 8p, well below yesterday's market price of 13p. Rowe &amp; Pitman, the broker, organised the sale to the Excalibur management of a large institution's holding. Mr Griffiths bought 1.2m of the shares, taking his stake to 10.9 per cent. Mr Richard Griffiths, his brother and managing director, bought 500,000 shares giving him 1.8 per cent. Mr Andrew Leach, finance director, bought 63,000 shares.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Extra lookalike laws ruled out Brand manufacturers yesterday attacked a government announcement ruling out action on supermarket 'look-alike' products in the trademarks bill, which today starts its line-by-line Commons committee stage scrutiny. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, junior minister responsible for technology, said yesterday the 'overwhelming majority of views' in a consultation exercise were against using the bill to protect brand names against lookalikes. The government said the bill, which will broaden the definition of trademarks, would provide extra protection for brand names and should be given a chance to work. It would consider further legislation if brand owners could show that problems had continued. Mr John Murphy, spokesman for the British Producers and Brand Owners Group, whose members include Coca-Cola, Colgate Palmolive, Gillette, Mars, Nestle and Procter &amp; Gamble, said the government response was 'entirely insufficient. The problem is a very serious and immediate one and strong action is needed now'. The British Retail Consortium and the Consumers Association welcomed the announcement. The association said the opportunity for manufacturers to initiate passing-off actions was a sufficient legal safeguard against unfair competition.</p>

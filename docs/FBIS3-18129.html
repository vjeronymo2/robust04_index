			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "ban": "Agreement on Principle, Dissention on </F> Details"]    [Text] Bonn, 24 Feb -- The Bundestag on Thursday [24  February] held the first hearing on the packages of law proposed  by the coalition and the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] on combating crime. After the debate, the drafts were  sent on to the committees. Speakers of all parliamentary groups  attributed great importance to internal security and announced  that they are looking for agreement on the less controversial  details of the article laws. The deputies concentrated on the  differences between the drafts. Speakers of the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] regretted that  the coalition draft does not envisage the possibility to monitor  conversations in apartments to combat organized crime, but they  called the respective formulations in the SPD draft  impracticable. The coalition said the SPD's demand that assets  be temporarily impounded when there is just well-founded  suspicion that they were acquired by criminal activities is  unconstitutional. The SPD, for its part, accused the coalition  of wanting to blur the borders between the intelligence services  and the police in a constitutionally alarming way by giving the  Federal Intelligence Office (BND) powers of investigation  against organized crime.    Interior Minister Kanther (CDU) said that with its draft law  the coalition proves that it is able to act. Effective policy  for internal security is the "best contribution" against  extremist parties. The opening of the borders in Europe gives  rise to crime in Germany. Kanther explained the coalition's  article law, on which the CDU/CSU and the Free Democratic Party  of Germany [FDP] agreed in January after protracted  negotiations. Criminal proceedings should be accelerated and  the detention law should become "more effective." Penal  provisions about instigating people and using Nazi-like symbols  should be expanded. It should be possible to impose higher  sentences for bodily injury. It should be an "imperative"  provision of the law that adult foreign drug dealers be expelled  from the country. The regulation on turning state's evidence  should be transferred to organized crime. In the case of the  extortion of protection money, higher fines should be imposed.  The BND should be permitted to pass on findings on organized  crime, which are gained through monitoring international  telephone conversations, to the responsible authorities.  Kanther said: "Unfortunately, the electronic monitoring of  conversations in apartments is not included in the package of  laws." He will continue to advocate it.    On behalf of the SPD, Deputy Group Chairwoman Anke Fuchs  said  that the coalition has neglected to hit organized crime at its  "never," namely at its profits and assets. Saying this, Mrs.  Fuchs justified her group's proposal that not a court sentence  but already justified suspicion should be sufficient for  impounding assets, which have perhaps been gained by criminal  activities. Then the suspect should be forced to prove that he  gained the assets legally. Illegal profits must not be  introduced in the legal economic cycle just because  investigations are too slow. Therefore, the SPD proposes and  amendment to Basic Law Article 14 (guarantee of property).  However, her group knows that this would mean stepping on  "juridical virgin soil." Mrs. Fuchs as well as SPD legal expert  De With rejected the coalition's planned extension of the  regulation on turning state's evidence as well as additional  powers for the BND. Other projects of the coalition  (perpetrator-victim compensation, stricter punishment for bodily  injury, ban of neo-Nazi symbols) are supported by the SPD group.    FDP legal expert Kleinert said that everything that the SPD  did not take over from the coalition is "abstruse." With it  proposals for impounding assets, the SPD is crossing the "limits  of a rule-of-law state." Kleinert paid tribute to the coalition  draft. The differences of opinion on monitoring conversations  in apartments did not lead to blockades in other fields. FRG  Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger demanded that the  laender reinforce their police forces. The planned laws must  not give the impression that the state has been defenseless so  far.    Party of Democratic Socialism Deputy Gysi accused the SPD of  using its draft law so as not to expose itself to the coalition  in the election campaign regarding internal security. The  coalition and the SPD want to restrict basic rights. Just as  the coalition, Gysi criticized the SPD's proposals for  impounding assets. Shifting the burden of proof weakens the  citizen. The social reasons of crime must be eliminated, Gysi  said.    Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein (CSU) paid tribute to  the coalition draft as a piece of progress, but he noted that it  does not live up to the threat posed by organized crime. It  must be possible to monitor the apartments of heavy criminals.  Covert investigators must be permitted to commit  "milieu-related" crimes. Beckstein called for life terms for  "gang-like organized drug dealing." The constitutional  protection authorities should be involved in watching organized  crime.</p>

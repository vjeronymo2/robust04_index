			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Norway EC hopes tied to Sweden and Finland THE HEAD of Norway's European Movement, fighting an uphill battle for European Community membership, said yesterday the country's chances of joining hinged on successful EC bids by Sweden and Finland, Reuter reports from Oslo. 'It's extremely unlikely that Norway will join the EC this century if Sweden and Finland stay out,' said Mr Inge Loenning, who is also a professor of theology at Oslo University. The three Nordic nations are holding parallel talks on EC membership with Brussels, hoping to join by what many officials say is an extremely optimistic target of 1995. Opinion polls show Norwegians are the most sceptical of the three Nordic applicants.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Brokers find Scots power promising THE TWO Scottish electricity companies are more attractive to investors than the privatised English generators and regional electricity companies, according to Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker. The Scottish companies are due to be floated on May 30. The comment came in the first brokers' circular to be produced since the government published the pathfinder prospectus for ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric last week. Laing believes the two Scottish companies have good prospects for profits growth in the generating side of their businesses, which accounts for 30 per cent of ScottishPower's profits and 55 per cent of those of Hydro-Electric. The companies will be able to increase their earnings from generation as the transmission interconnector, which links the Scottish grid to the national grid in England and Wales, is expanded by 1994. The analysts point out that the Scottish companies will have an 'enduring advantage' over other generators because the Miller field in the North Sea will start producing cheap gas next year, and the benefits will be shared by both companies. Hydro-Electric also have another advantage only partly shared with ScottishPower because of its low-cost hydro-electric capacity. A further advantage is that after 1994, when customers using between 1MW and 10MW may choose suppliers, tariffs in Scotland are set to move only gradually into line with pool prices rather than instantly, as in England. But the Laing analysts, Mr Robert Giles and Mr Arthur Hepher, point out that the Scottish companies can expect lower real earnings growth in distribution and transmission because the government has set them harsher X-factors. Those require them to increase their tariffs by less than the rise in the retail prices index. The regional electricity companies are allowed to exceed the rise. The analysts believe the market may prefer Hydro-Electric because of its vigorous management and success in winning new business. They believe the two Scottish companies should justify a lower yield than the current average of 5.2 per cent for the English generators. But they expect the government to float them on a 5.2 per cent yield in order to produce a 20p premium on the part-paid price of Pounds 1. With the premium they would yield 4.8 per cent after flotation.</p>

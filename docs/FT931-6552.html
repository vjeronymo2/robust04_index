			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: Architectural free-for-all Earlier this month the government published a report by a Mr John Warne (an assessor appointed by the Department of the Environment) that reviewed the Architects' Registration Acts from 1931 to 1969. This slim, blue and grey document, published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office at Pounds 6.50, is not on the current bestseller lists - which is hardly surprising because it deals with the pretty arcane subject of the legal registration of the title 'architect'. But in some quarters it is seen as a small bombshell that completely changes the nature of professionalism for architects and has wide repercussions for education and practice. The Warne Report's main recommendation is that The Architects' Registration Acts should be repealed and the profession be deregulated. At the moment architecture is a uniquely protected profession. It was a struggle to pass the Architects' Registration Act in 1931, five bills having been previously defeated by parliament, which felt that to hand the official registration and control of the architectural profession to its own Royal Institute would be too monopolistic. The Act of 1931 created an independent council, the Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom, to regulate the membership, conduct and education of the profession. You cannot legally call yourself an architect unless you register with ARCUK. The case for this independent council was declared to be 'the protection of the public from the half-trained, the untrained and the absolute imposter'. The government has accepted Mr Warne's report and when the repealing legislation is passed in two years time, Britain's architects will no longer be a protected species. Architectural services will be offered by builders, designers and consultants, and self-regulation will be the order of the day for the architects who will be able to call themselves 'chartered architects', with institutions like the RIBA and its Scottish and Ulster equivalents becoming the self-regulatory bodies. Mr Warne is the former secretary of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and his report suggests that architects should organise themselves very like accountants. His main recommendations are that the title 'architect' should no longer be protected by statute; that ARCUK and its Board of Architectural Education should be abolished; and that the RIBA should be confirmed as a self-regulatory body operating in the public interest. Sir George Young, the minister at the Department of the Environment responsible for any legislation, said on the report's publication: 'There is no reason why architects, uniquely amongst the construction professions, should be regulated by statute. The established arrangements for self-regulation through the chartered professional institutions provide for satisfactory protection of the public interest and of consumers.' The Royal Institute of British Architects has pondered the report and decided that the abolition of registration 'is a retrograde step, not in the public interest'. This reaction is not surprising, but seems short-sighted as the Warne Report also goes out of its way to suggest that a reformed and improved RIBA has a key role to play in developing a 'client-friendly' profession. Warne recommends that the RIBA should be invited to include lay members on its committees and to examine ways in which users of architectural services and the construction industry could help to develop architectural education. It is tragic that the RIBA has reacted in such a Pavlovian way. It has been made a series of offers in the report that could set it up as the inclusive body for the construction of buildings. The profession is very vulnerable: there are too many architects in too many small firms chasing too few jobs. The RIBA has for years wasted endless time and money on internal political bickering (for which it is justly criticised in the report). Architects have a bad name with the public, which does not see any benefit to them in the statutory protection of a title. The RIBA is invited to have formal annual discussions with government - something it has long wanted - about priorities in design matters. The excellent president of the RIBA, Richard MacCormac, is worried about the arrival on the scene of 'cowboys' calling themselves architects. He should understand that much of the profession has behaved little better than the average cowboy to its clients - all under the umbrella of special statutory protection. Architects are judged by results not by their nomenclature. This freeing up of the profession offers important chances for the reform of education and will encourage new schools. The Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture is already pioneering a more holistic approach to the design of buildings and encouraging the demise of professional divisiveness among the various professions and trades that design buildings. I hope the Prince's institute will promote public discussion of the important questions raised by this report about educational reforms, and make a bid for some of the ARCUK education fund. I suspect that, while the RIBA continues to contemplate its navel, others will step in and take advantage of the spirit of free competition. Architects will have only themselves to blame if they fail, yet again, to get their professional act together.</p>

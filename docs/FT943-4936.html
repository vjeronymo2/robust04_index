			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Standard upgraded The best individual performance in the FT-SE 100 Index came from Standard Chartered, the banking group, whose shares extended last Friday's good showing, finishing 10 higher yesterday at 265p. Dealers said the impetus for the shares' bout of outperformance came from Lehman Bro-thers, one of the leading US investment banks, with UBS also reported to have been recommending the stock. Lehman was said to have been an aggressive buyer of the stock last Friday and throughout yesterday after upgrading its profits forecast for Standard. The US brokerage was thought to have increased its current year estimate from Pounds 480m to Pounds 505m and lifted its forecast for next year from Pounds 525m to Pounds 575m.</p>

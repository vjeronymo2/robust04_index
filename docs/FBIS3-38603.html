			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, Feb 2 (AFP) -- French Minister for  European Affairs Alain Lamassoure denied Wednesday [2 February]  that he wanted to ensure the supremacy of the larger countries  in the European Community.    In an interview with the regional daily OUEST-FRANCE,  Lamassoure defended his idea for coordination on policy among  Germany, France and Spain, which will successively succeed  Greece in the six-month rotating presidency of the EC from June.    "The chances of the calendar mean that the presidency, after  being held by small and medium countries (Denmark, Belgium and  Greece), will be taken by three large ones," he said.    For that reason "it is necessary to organise ourselves to  use  these 18 months in the best way." [passage omitted]    Lamassoure said the current system of a rotating presidency  had the advantage of giving every member an equal share of  responsibility, but it also did not clearly identify the power  which should represent Europe out of the Commission of permanent  officials, the Council of Ministers and the presidency.    The French minister said there would be a proposal to remedy  this in 1996 when EC governments will review the community's  institutions.</p>

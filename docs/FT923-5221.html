			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Looking for smaller worlds to conquer: Michiyo Nakamoto on why Europe's chipmakers are changing course Europe's semiconductor manufacturers are abandoning their long-held ambitions of competing with the industry's leaders to concentrate on more specialised areas, which they believe offer a better chance for success. Faced with rising investment costs and increasing competition in their home market by foreign groups setting up bases within the EC, the big three Europeans, Philips, SGS-Thomson and Siemens, have been reassessing their strategies for the 1990s. They are focusing their portfolios on specific products in which they have recognised strengths, rather than trying to tackle the high-volume standard product areas which are the battlegrounds of the leading US and Japanese manufacturers. 'There was a time when semiconductor companies tried to do almost everything,' says Mr Heinz Hagmeister, chief executive officer of Philips's semiconductor division. 'But that time is gone.' From now on, even the largest semiconductor companies will have to be more selective. That belief has led Philips to leave the highly competitive market for standard products such as memory chips and focus its energies on more specialised items for the consumer, telecommunications, industrial controls and automotive industries. Siemens, which earlier this year decided to reduce involvement in memory chips production, also says it is no longer necessary to be a large participant in the market for standard products such as memories. 'Standard products are led by major players. To compete against them is a silly idea,' says Mr Klaus Knapp, a senior director at Siemens. Siemens will use the technology gained from its involvement in memory chip development to manufacture application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and logic chips, which offer more stable revenue and better margins. SGS-Thomson has also been concentrating on systems and application-specific products for the consumer, telecommunications and automotive industries. Until last summer Europe's semiconductor manufacturers had been talking about forming a 'European champion' to compete with the large US and Japanese groups in an industry expected to be worth as much as Dollars 200bn (Pounds 100bn) by the end of the decade. The idea of merging the operations of Europe's large semiconductor manufacturers was 'a dream of consultants', Mr Hagmeister says. The companies would have to deal with their own problems before there could be any serious co-operation. The driving force behind this change has been the need to generate profits. Europe's semiconductor manufacturers can no longer afford to be in markets where they are clearly behind their US and Japanese competitors. Siemens, for one, has suffered big losses from its involvement in D-Rams. 'For every D-Ram we sell we are making a loss,' the group says. Its semiconductor division lost DM500m (Pounds 180m) on sales of DM2bn in its last financial year. The conventional wisdom that a company had to be in all the main product areas to attain a leadership role is being challenged by the examples of successful companies which have risen to prominence on the strength of one or two leading products. Intel of the US, which has carved a dominant and lucrative position in the microprocessor market, is a key example. European companies are medium-sized operations in an industry increasingly polarised between the large, broadly based companies and the smaller, specialised niche players. Therefore, by focusing on applications-oriented products the Europeans have probably increased their survival chances. Concentrating on core businesses eliminates the enormous risks they would have faced in huge growth markets such as memory chips. Because of the huge investments needed and the characteristic boom-to-bust swings, 'trying to compete in these markets may kill your company', says Mr Mike Glennon at Dataquest, the technology consultancy. At the same time, because these products depend on close collaboration between supplier and user, the Europeans believe they are better placed than their foreign competitors in supplying them to leading European companies in the consumer electronics, telecommunications and automotive industries. Meanwhile, the areas where the Europeans are developing expertise could become more relevant in future as technology drivers, says Mr Matthew Whitcombe of the Computing and Electronics Group at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the management consultants. Consumer electronics itself is not expected to expand its share of about 21 per cent of the entire semiconductor market, which Dataquest forecasts will go to Dollars 88bn by 1995. However, Philips has been working on applications for multimedia, the convergence of consumer electronics and computers, which is expected to be a big growth area within consumer electronics. In the long term multimedia applications are also expected to be the driver for electronic data processing as well. Meanwhile, Siemens has expertise in automotive applications, the fastest growing market sector last year. SGS-Thomson has strengths in communications which Dataquest forecasts will grow from 13.9 per cent to 15.1 per cent of the market in 1995. In spite of these promising signs, unless European semiconductor manufacturers look outside of Europe to the larger markets of the US and Japan, the crucial step beyond survival towards growth may still elude them.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Rank           Revenue        1991 market                                              (dollarsm)            share                Country      1991   1990    1990        1991 NEC              Japan       1      1     4,322       4,774         8.0% Toshiba          Japan       2      2     4,202       4,579         7.7% Intel               US       3      5     3,171       4,019         6.7% Motorola            US       4      3     3,539       3,802         6.4% Hitachi          Japan       5      4     3,516       3,765         6.3% Texas Instruments         US       6      7     2,574       2,738         4.6% Fujitsu          Japan       7      6     2,599       2,705         4.5% Mitsubishi       Japan       8      8     2,108       2,303         3.9% Matsushita       Japan       9     10     1,826       2,037         3.4% Philips    Netherlands      10      9     1,955       2,022         3.4% National Semiconductor       US      11     11     1,653       1,602         2.7% Samsung          Korea      12     13     1,315       1,473         2.5% SGS-Thomson     Italy/      13     12     1,441       1,436         2.4%                 France Sanyo            Japan      14     15     1,196       1,362         2.3% Sharp            Japan      15     16     1,194       1,318         2.2% Siemens        Germany      16     14     1,204       1,263         2.1% Advanced Micro Devices       US      17     17     1,053       1,226         2.1% Sony             Japan      18     18     1,010       1,196         2.0% Oki              Japan      19     19       954         981         1.6% Rohm             Japan      20     21       759         934         1.6%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Dataquest Europe  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

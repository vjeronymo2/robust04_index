Jayakumar at the Foreign Ministry  this morning, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri  said that his new Singapore counterpart came to see him just to  get acquainted and their discussion touched on general issues.    Asked about the Taiwanese president's recent visit to  Thailand, the foreign minister said he had earlier pointed out  that the visit was a personal affair. There was no official  reception held for Li. He does not believe that the visit will  have any impact on relations between Thailand and the PRC.  However, the foreign minister said that Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen will stop in Thailand on 27 February and he  will take this opportunity to explain to him about the Taiwanese  president's visit to Thailand so that China will understand  Thailand's position.    Asked about the report on the extended detention of Burmese  opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the foreign minister said he  knows nothing about this matter, adding that the permission  granted to a U.S. democratic congressman to meet with Aung San  Suu Kyi is a good sign because it indicates that the Burmese  Government has become more open in dealing with all problems.  However, he noted that the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is an  internal affair of Burma. The foreign minister anticipated that  Burma's political situation will improve since the world is  paying much attention to it and the Burmese leaders themselves  are aware of this fact.</p>

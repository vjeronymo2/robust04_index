			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections  scheduled for 8 May 1994.    Ruben Blades, presidential candidate of the Papa Egoro  Movement, has said Panamanian President Guillermo Endara muddied  his hands in partisan politics by presenting a documentary video  on previous regimes in a national television network. (Panama  City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 17 Apr 94 p A1)    Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential candidate for the  Arnulfist Party (PA), warned on 17 April that she will not give  up her candidacy and support Ruben Dario Carles, "who is falling  behind in the polls." Meanwhile, Alfredo Ramirez, president of  the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena), insists  that Carles is the only candidate who can defeat the Democratic  Revolutionary Party (PRD). (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in  Spanish 18 Apr 94 p 1)    The various presidential candidates toured rural areas over  the weekend of 16 April.    Ruben Blades visited various towns in Veraguas Province,  where he met with supporters, discussed their problems, and  offered solutions. "We have not sought an alliance with any  political party, because we know we have an alliance with all of  Panamanian society, with the Panamanian people," Blades  emphasized in his visit.    Meanwhile, Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate  for the PRD and the United People alliance, said he was "looking  to the future and not to the past." Perez Balladares toured  various towns in Chiriqui Province and met fellow party members  and supporters, to whom he stressed that people in rural areas  have been forgotten by the current administration.    Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate for the  Solidarity Party and the Alliance for National Consensus,  visited Los Santos Province, where he called for the unity among  all Panamanians. Lewis Galindo urged the Panamanian people to  avoid all forms of social confrontation.    Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for the Change  '94  ticket, visited Puerto Armuelles, Chiriqui Province, where he  "promised to respect the rights of the Indians and workers."  Carles charged that the PRD has tried to eliminate the workers'  13th month bonus, and he added that the PRD leadership should be  imprisoned on various charges of corruption.    The PA presidential ticket toured Chiriqui and Bocas del  Toro  Provinces, where thousands of supporters greeted Mireya Moscoso  de Gruber. She reiterated the PA will defeat the PRD on 8 May.    When PRD candidate Perez Balladares was asked about other  groups forming an alliance against him, he answered: "They are  trying to repeat what happened in 1989, as if they were trying  to work against Noriega. I reiterate that we will not return to  the past. We will not return to militarism." (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 18 Apr 94)    Perez Balladares has visited the industrial area of Betania  corregimiento, Panama City, where he promised "private  enterprise will generate most of the jobs" during his  administration. He emphasized, "The government cannot generate  the number of jobs needed by the economy."    On 18 April, Moscoso de Gruber said it is necessary to set  aside all special interests to achieve a broad alliance. She  reaffirmed her plans to form such an alliance to confront the  PRD.

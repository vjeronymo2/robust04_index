			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (12): Fiscal restraint needed - The success of deregulation depends on curbing borrowing 'OUR main preoccupation' says Mr Dominic Mulaisho, the new governor of the Bank of Zambia 'is to free the system'. He has been as good as his word. The financial markets have been the target of sweeping reforms culminating in the unification of the official and free market exchange rates a fortnight ago. Before Christmas too, the Bank of Zambia plans to launch a Treasury bill auction system - the final step in interest rate deregulation. The previous administration was forced by the IMF and World Bank to accept financial sector reform in 1989 but after dipping its toe in the water, it beat a hasty retreat. The Kaunda government's final year in office (1991) was a monetary disaster, with money supply increasing 100 per cent and inflation running at 400 per cent. As a result of this and the drought, the mid-1992 public sector wage awards, devaluation and increased export earnings, inflation has remained out of control. Money supply over 1992 is likely to double, while inflation is estimated at 120 per cent. The central bank has done everything possible to regain control over the monetary aggregates, abandoning interest rate capping, retaining control over the Treasury bill rate - a key component - which is pegged at 54 per cent. It raised the statutory reserve and 'inner reserve' ratios to about 67 per cent, which means banks are able to lend only K33 for every K100 of deposits. The paradoxical result is a market with money supply growing at 100 per cent, primarily the result of government borrowing and export receipts, while a banking system strapped for cash is lending to prime customers at 70 to 75 per cent. The explanation is simple. As fast as the government pumps liquidity into the system - in the year to August, government borrowing from the banks, including the Bank of Zambia, rose 300 per cent - the central bank is sterilising it with its high reserve ratios. But sterilisation, especially of the 'excess' earnings of the copper mines - earnings over and above the agreed price - was not effective in the third quarter and this, combined with the budget deficit pushed money supply growth above the IMF target ceilings. Solving the problem will mean stopping government borrowing from the banks, which in turn means eliminating the budget deficit or funding that deficit in a non-inflationary way by borrowing from the non-bank private sector. The central bank's courageous reforms will work only if the 1993 budget bites the bullet of fiscal restraint, opening the door to reduced money supply growth and inflation and relative exchange rate stability. The new auction system for Treasury bills means the authorities will replace control over the cost of government's short-term borrowings with control over the quantity of funds raised. This is likely to mean a further rise in interest rates which are expected to become positive in real terms during 1993 as inflation falls. Money supply growth and inflation should average less than 50 per cent next year, while on a year-on-year basis they should fall below 20 per cent towards the end of 1993. The foreign exchange market has been progressively liberalised with export retentions increased in March from 50 per cent to 100 per cent for 'non-traditional exporters'. From the end of April, individuals were allowed to tap the more favourable rate in the retentions market to convert foreign currency into Kwacha. The two big reforms came more recently. In mid-October, the bureau de change system opened allowing Zambians and foreigners to buy and sell foreign currency on a 'no questions asked' basis. This system has largely replaced the parallel market, although some black market transactions continue. Its importance, according to Mr Mulaisho, is that Zambians themselves, not the government or central bank, now decide at what rate they wish to buy foreign exchange. Two weeks ago, the official rate - at the time K247 to the dollar - was merged with the bureau and retentions market rate of K323. The government is now out of the exchange rate market although it retains influence on the supply of foreign exchange earned by the copper mines. The merging of the two exchange rate markets will spawn another inflationary blip. But if the ministry of finance delivers the promised balanced budget in January, government borrowing will fall, as will the rate of money supply growth and the yield on Treasury bills. As this happens the authorities will be able to reduce the banks' liquidity ratios enabling them to lend more to private enterprise. The banks - while victims of some of these reforms and complaining that policy changes have been implemented too quickly - are delighted with the general thrust of government policy. Their worries include having sufficient resources to finance the agriculture-led recovery which, weather permitting, Zambia hopes to achieve in 1993 as well as being able to provide medium and even longer-term funds in a country which has no capital market infrastructure. This is a gaping hole which urgently needs to be tackled. There are plans to set up a Stock Exchange and some of the banks talk of launching equity funds or venture capital arms to finance private sector investment. The success of monetarism, Zambian-style depends on conquering inflation, which will be a long haul, and on shifting the focus of banking activities away from funding the government to financing the movers and shakers in the private sector on whom the ultimate fate of the economic reform programme depends.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Two well-timed cuts TWO companies, Abtrust and Guinness Flight, this week made well-timed moves to cut charges on their bond unit trusts. Both were planned in advance, but should profit from the interest in bonds and gilts. Abtrust is launching two new funds, Aberdeen Gilt Growth and Aberdeen Gilt Income, neither of which has any front-end charge at all. This makes 'bed and breakfasting' - selling units and re-buying them the following day to establish a fixed gain or loss for capital gains tax purposes - very cost-effective. This facility allows investors to reduce the biggest problem of holding gilts via a unit trust - that CGT is payable on any gain in the unitholding. The tax is not payable when gilts are held directly. However, both funds have annual management charges of 1 per cent, which are slightly above average for this sector. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. Guinness Flight has altered the charges on the existing three bond funds - which make up its monthly income plan - Premium Fixed Interest, EMU and Global High Income. Annual management charges will be 0.5 per cent for Premium Fixed Interest, and 0.75 per cent for the other two. Initial charges will also be reduced for large investments, as follows: sums between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 9,999 pay 3.5 per cent, with charges of 2.5 per cent from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 24,999, 1.5 per cent from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 49,999, and 1.0 per cent for investments greater than this. Guinness Flight's funds all include a mixture of gilts and European bonds. The company is very bullish about the prospects for bonds, saying that the current high rates of interest in force across Europe are likely to come down next year. Arguments about the outlook for inflation and the gilts market will continue, but at least fund managers have taken substantial action to make the products more attractive than before.</p>

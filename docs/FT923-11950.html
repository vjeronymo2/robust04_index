			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cowie letter attacks Henlys' management THE Pounds 25.9m takeover battle between T Cowie and Henlys, both motor traders, intensified yesterday as Cowie wrote to its target's shareholders attacking Henlys' management. The letter quoted Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker acting for Henlys, saying Cowie shares were cheap. It also quoted Mr Robert Wood, chief executive of Henlys, saying he had a 'very high regard' for Sir Tom Cowie, chairman of Cowie. The letter went on to say that Henlys' management team was not new, as Henlys has said; that it achieves a lower return from its motor dealerships than Cowie does and questioned the ability of Henlys' management to turn round the loss-making bus and coach building business. Cowie said Henlys had 'a failed strategy implemented by a weak management'. Cowie's share price fell 2p to 137p, making its all-paper offer worth 68 1/2 p per share. Henlys shares were unchanged at 70p. Mr Wood said that Mr David Matthews, Henlys' former chairman and chief executive, had left the company last November and he had become chief executive then. Two other executive directors had left last year and, including himself, four board appointments made. He said that Henlys' and Cowie's motor dealerships were not comparable as Cowie had a substantial leasing business. It was not known how profits were divided between the two activities. Mr Wood also said that while he respected Sir Tom as a motor dealer, the letter showed that Cowie did not understand manufacturing. He said he was saddened that the battle had focused on personalities but added that 'it suggests their case is not so strong'.</p>

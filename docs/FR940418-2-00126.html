			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Eligibility Standards for the Inclusion and Maintenance of Component Stocks in the Index <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex states that it selects securities comprising the Index based on their market weight, trading liquidity, and representativeness of the business industries reflected on the HKSE. The Amex will require that each Index component security be one issued by an entity with major business interests in Hong Kong, listed for trading on the HKSE, and have its primary trading market located in a country with which the Amex has an effective surveillance sharing agreement. The Amex will remove any Index component security that fails to meet any of the foregoing listing and maintenance criteria within 30 days after such a failure occurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the Index does not consist of a number of thinly-capitalized, low-priced securities with small public floats and low trading volumes, the Amex has established additional listing and maintenance criteria: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) All component securities selected for inclusion in the Index must have, and thereafter maintain, an average daily capitalization, as calculated by the total number of shares outstanding times the latest price per share (in Hong Kong dollars), measured over the prior six month period, of at least HK$3 billion (approximately US$380 million); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All component securities selected for inclusion in the Index must have, and thereafter maintain, a minimum free float value (total freely tradeable outstanding shares less insider holdings), based on a monthly average measured over the prior three month period, of US$238 million, although up to, but no more than, three Index component securities may have a free float value of less than US$238 million but in no event less than US$150 million, measured over the same period; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) All component securities selected for inclusion in the Index must have, and thereafter maintain, an average daily closing price, measured over the prior six month period, not lower than HK$2.50 (approximately US$0.32); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) All component securities selected for inclusion in the Index must have, and thereafter maintain, an average daily trading volume, measured over the prior six month period, of more than one million shares per day, although up to, but no more than, three component securities may have an average daily trading volume, measured over the prior six month period, of less than one million shares per day, but in no event less than 500,000 shares per day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning in 1994, the Amex will review the Index's component securities on a quarterly basis, conducted on the last business day in January, April, July, and October. Any component security failing to meet the above listing and maintenance criteria will be reviewed on the second Friday of the second month following the quarterly review again to determine compliance with the above criteria. Any Index component stock failing this second review will be replaced by a ``qualified'' Index component stock effective upon the close of business on the following Friday, provided, however, that if such Friday is not a business day, the replacement will be effective at the close of business on the first preceding business day. The Amex will notify its membership immediately after it determines to replace an Index component stock. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Listing and maintenance standards for the Index are identical to those originally established for the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33036,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 5. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

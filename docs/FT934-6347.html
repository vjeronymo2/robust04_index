			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Merrett appoints new chief executive Merrett Group yesterday appointed Mr Alan Cleary, the chairman of its loss adjusting arm, as group chief executive in a move which indicated that it may seek to restructure its business around its insurance services - rather than Lloyd's agency - interests. Efforts to salvage Merrett Underwriting Agency Management, whose prospects have been brought into question by the difficulties of two of its largest syndicates, are continuing. Both syndicates 418 and 1067 were hit by the withdrawal last week of a plan by Travelers, the US insurance company, to offer backing which would have helped compensate for a sharp fall in support from members' agents. Neither syndicate may have enough backing to continue underwriting in 1994, leaving their Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - with a potentially expensive 'run-off' (meeting claims on existing policies). Mr Cleary joined Merrett in 1991 as chief executive of the services division, which includes Miller Knight, the loss adjuster, BIS, an insurance investigations business, Merrett Health Risk Management, and a run-off company. He was recently appointed chairman of Miller Knight. As group chief executive he replaces Mr Dennis Purkiss, who recently resigned to join Zurich Re as chief operating officer. Mr Purkiss, who will be joined at Zurich by two leading Merrett underwriters - Mr Stewart Laderman and Mr Ken Barrett, takes over as chief executive officer at Zurich next year. Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman of the Merrett Group, said of Mr Cleary 'nobody is better equipped to see the Merrett Group through these difficult times'.</p>

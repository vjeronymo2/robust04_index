			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / The Property Market: Sporting chance of picking plum prizes  -Inward investment agencies are an essential tool for attracting business to a region At the turn of the last century, according to local legend, a spectacular life-size elephant made of walnuts was the focus of a campaign to attract business to Los Angeles. Some 84 years later, in a similar, but grander, exercise, Los Angeles hosted the Olympic Games, winning unprecedented plaudits for wooing large-scale private sector investment in the city's infrastructure. The Olympic Games are a prime example of how a city can establish momentum for regeneration, through a combination of private and public sector initiatives. The competition surrounding the award last month of the millenium games to Sydney illustrates just how prized the games are  - both for the sporting prestige and, more lasting, the boost they can give to job creation, redevelopment of run-down areas and the wider regional economy of a city. The pressures on cities to compete to attract business have rarely been so intense. A vital carrot for business is the attractiveness, allied to fiscal incentives, of the location and local infrastructure from transport to services. Cities are, accordingly, responding in a variety of ways: Some cities appear to be paralysed by the scale and nature of the changes affecting them and are doing little beyond the discharge of their immediate and historic activities of public service provision and statutory planning; Other cities, while acutely aware of the new environment of competition, have engaged in costly and sometimes unsophisticated attempts at city promotion, such the publication of glossy brochures and videos. The most enterprising cities take a closely regulated business-planning approach to the development of their economies with strategies to promote their strengths and combat their weaknesses. This is designed to attract and sustain companies in the global marketplace and hence the city's long-term competitiveness. A characteristic feature of the last group is the setting up of special agencies charged with the job of attracting such new investment. Lyon's agency, for instance, has been instrumental in 'changing perceptions of the city'. The city's activities have assured its 'second city' status and at the same time persuaded some top companies to relocate from Paris to Lyon. Glasgow's agency secured 4,000 jobs in 1992-93. Milton Keynes, a new town in southern England has had a continuous strategy since its creation in the mid-1960s, and its agency receives four investment inquiries a day. Dusseldorf's agency has helped attract a strong international client-list of companies to the city; its biggest coup was being selected as the location for the first Russian trade centre (370,000 square feet) in Europe. These cities have taken the decision to promote their economies and, with the exception of Glasgow, none are in areas identified by central government  - or regional trading blocs such as the European Community  - as requiring special assistance in terms of priority regional aid. The agencies vary significantly in the numbers of people they employ and their costs. Those with the larger number of staff, such as Berlin, play a more extensive role in providing grants and other financial incentives and services to prospective and existing client-companies. The main role of smaller agencies is to concentrate on attracting inquiries and introducing companies to the appropriate range of local government and professional services. These agencies also vary in terms of the size of their marketing budgets, which can ultimately determine the success of their campaigns to 'sell the city'. The marketing budget is an important demonstration of a city's commitment to its economy and its faith in the agency's ability to attract companies. It is difficult to determine the exact impact of the agencies on job creation and added value. Most agencies keep these numbers under wraps. Performance on these criteria largely depend on the length of time the agency has been running. Without exception agencies are seen as an essential focal point for the promotion of internal and external business in their respective cities. They are also seen as important influences in creating a suitable climate for business. They play the vital role of conduit, feeding back to the city strategists important data and intelligence on how the current and potential business 'consumer' sees the needs and priorities for local and central government investment in infrastructure, training, education, environment and other city services. A well thought-out and widely promoted strategy for a city's long-term growth is also viewed as an important marketing tool for agencies. A city's long-term vision, encompassing the gamut of physical regeneration and the provision of services, can tip the balance in persuading companies to relocate. Hosting high-profile events, such as the Olympic Games, needs to be seen in the context of a city's overall marketing strategy. A 'big bang' marketing event  - such as hosting an Olympic Games  - is widely viewed as a significant short-cut way of generating an instant international profile (ideal for an emerging city keen to attract international clients) besides stimulating infrastructure improvements. In Barcelona, for instance, which hosted the Olympic Games in 1992, the long-term benefits of the games included improvements to the city's international airport, the regeneration of depressed areas and the transformation of the waterfront. In England, KPMG, an accountancy and management consultancy, estimates that had Manchester won the millenium games, the regional economy would have benefited by some Pounds 4bn in extra spending power and in the creation of about 11,000 jobs. The cumulative impact of a successful Manchester bid would have been worth about 10 per cent of north-west England's present annual gross domestic product. The direct capital investment needed to stage the games would have been Pounds 1.5bn; but the legacy would have been world-class sporting and commercial facilities. But though Manchester's bid failed, the process of making it had an important catalytic effect: it has brought together local government and local companies. Such private-public sector alliances are likely to remain a feature of current and future successful city economic development.

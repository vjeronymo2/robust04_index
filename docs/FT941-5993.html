			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Woodside posts ADollars 102m surplus Woodside Petroleum, the Australian offshore gas producer, returned to profits in 1993 but warned that the slump in oil prices late last year would have a significant effect in 1994, writes Nikki Tait. The company announced this week that it is laying off around 430 employees in an attempt to cut annual operating costs by around ADollars 70m (USDollars 50m). The energy group made a net profit of ADollars 102.9m last year, compared with a loss of ADollars 22.6m in 1992. The improvement was partly due to a ADollars 20.6m abnormal surplus in 1993, compared with a charge of ADollars 85.8m in 1992. Operating profit before abnormal items and tax improved from ADollars 111.5m to ADollars 134.8m.</p>

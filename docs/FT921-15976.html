			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Savimbi deplores killings ANGOLAN opposition leader Jonas Savimbi said yesterday his former rebels were not responsible for the deaths of four British travellers killed in an ambush, Reuter reports from Abidjan. However, Mr Savimbi, head of the Unita movement, also said at a press conference in the Ivory Coast that while he deplored the killing of tourists, he did not think it was wise for foreigners to travel in a country which had just ended a civil war. He blamed robbers for the attack, near a base where thousands of former Unita rebels are confined.</p>

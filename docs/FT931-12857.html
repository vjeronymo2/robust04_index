			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Letter: Co-existence Sir, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen has once again spoken out refreshingly on a controversial issue ('Danish speech on Macedonia provokes Greek rage', January 21). Maybe the Greeks could learn from a precedent set in this part of Europe, where the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg happily exists alongside the Belgian province of Luxembourg. The latter provides much-needed staff for the Grand Duchy's financial services industry in the form of cross-border commuters. These 'frontaliers' sleep safely at night knowing that the monetary union between Belgium and the Grand Duchy protects their earnings from any devaluation (sorry, realignment) of the latter's currency.

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOLSA CHICA;  </P> <P> TRAPPING OF RED FOXES TO RESUME TO SAVE BIRDS  </P> <P> The state Department of Fish and Game will resume trapping red foxes at the  Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve later this month in an effort to protect two  endangered species of birds whose eggs and chicks have been devoured by the  predators, agency officials said Monday.  </P> <P> According to Fish and Game reports, eggs or chicks in 75 California least tern  nests were lost last year to predators, including red foxes and other animals.  Belding's savannah sparrow nests also were hard hit, but population figures  were not immediately available, said Earl Laupe, a wildlife management  supervisor for the state agency.  </P> <P> While skunks and kestrel also are predators in the state reserve, the red fox  is believed to be the primary one, Laupe said. Ten foxes were trapped at the  Bolsa Chica reserve last year and a similar number have been seen in the 800 to  900 acres of wetland this year, he said.  </P> <P> But a spokesman for an Orange County-based animal rights organization  threatened Monday to take action to halt the state's trapping program. The  Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn. already has filed a suit aimed at blocking  similar trapping of red foxes at the nearby Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station.  </P> <P> "We would have to take action to prevent unnecessary killing, said Hal Baerg,  president of the Huntington Beach organization. "We'll do what we have to do."  </P> <P> But state officials said killing the foxes is their only alternative.  </P> <P> "We are legally constrained to save the least tern," said Kurt Taucher,  spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> "(The foxes) are too common and too abundant and the zoos don't want them," he  said, referring to problems associated with federal efforts to relocate red  foxes when trapping at the naval weapons station first began in 1986.  </P></p>

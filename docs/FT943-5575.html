			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Climate talks end without accord Representatives from more than 150 nations will today end a two-week meeting on the UN climate change treaty with no agreement on proposals to toughen curbs on emissions of greenhouse gases. This is despite a widespread acceptance by governments that existing curbs are inadequate to prevent a dangerous atmospheric build-up of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause global warming. 'It is clear that (present) commitments are not adequate,' Mr Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the meeting chairman, said yesterday. The 1992 climate change convention, now ratified by 93 nations, requires developed countries to bring carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. But no pledges are required for post-2000, nor do developing countries yet have any obligations to cut emissions. One group, led by Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, has been lobbying for a new protocol to be adopted at the first conference of the parties to the convention in Berlin next spring. Germany's environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, this week proposed a 15-20 per cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions of industrialised nations by 2005. But for a protocol to be adopted in Berlin, drafts must be circulated by September 28, six months ahead. Conference officials said the US, Britain, China, India and the petroleum-exporting countries were among those dragging their heels. Britain and the US are said to be holding out for a satisfactory deal on 'joint implementation', enabling them to meet part of their obligations by financing projects to reduce third world emissions. The Berlin meeting must decide on the permanent home of the convention secretariat, provisionally based in Geneva. Geneva, Bonn and Montevideo have made formal offers to host the secretariat, which will have a staff of 50 and an annual budget of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Breathing space for Control HOLDERS of Control Securities' two Swiss franc bond issues agreed yesterday to defer interest payments until June 1. They also waived the right to declare the bonds in default until the same date by which time further meetings will be held. Control, the property, brewing and leisure group, is in the middle of a financial restructuring which is taking longer to complete than originally hoped. The company recently revealed a deficit on shareholders' funs of Pounds 31.8m. Shareholders have been asked to a meeting on March 17 to authorise continued discussions while the banks have repeatedly renewed a standstill agreement. The group has exchanged contracts for the sale for Pounds 3.44m of a housing estate at Saxmundham, Suffolk.</p>

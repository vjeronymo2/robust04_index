			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Engineer A. Shirokorad: "`Grad' and </F> `Uragan' -- These Are Not Bad Weather Phenomena"]    [Text] The "Grad" 122 mm and "Uragan" 220 mm multiple  rocket launcher systems are the most widely used modern  domestically-produced systems.    The "Grad" system on a BM-21 mount was accepted into the  Soviet Army inventory in 1963 and recommended itself well in  combat operations on Damanskiy Island, in the Middle East and in  Afghanistan.    The "Uragan" Multiple Rocket Launcher System (9K57) was  accepted into the inventory in 1976 and also had combat  employment in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, right now these  systems are being widely utilized in interethnic conflicts on  the territory of the former USSR.    Because the dimensions and weight of the BM-21 mount were  comparatively large, the light BM-21V mount, in which the number  of 122 mm tubes was reduced from 40 to 12, was developed for the  VDV [Airborne Troops].    The basic device of both systems is nearly identical. The  combat vehicle consists of an artillery section and a chassis of  a specially equipped motor vehicle. The artillery section  consists of tube launchers, a cradle, a base, elevating,  traversing and leveling mechanisms, a launcher frame, aiming  devices, an electric drive and auxiliary equipment.    The rocket projectiles of both multiple rocket launcher  systems are also identically constructed. They have tail  assemblies, the fins of which are secured by a ring in the  closed position. When the contacts of the current distributor  close, pulses of current flow to the contact sector of the  projectile which results in the actuation of the squibs and the  ignition of the powder charge. The gases that are formed tear  away the contact lid and powder gases begin to escape through  the nozzle opening. When the engine increases thrust, the  projectile's lead pin comes out of the launcher's stopper-rod  device and slips along its groove, forcing the rocket projectile  to rotate with regard to the longitudinal axis. The tail  assembly's fins unfold when it flies out of the tube and the MRV  or MRV-U fuze is armed at a distance of 150-450 meters from the  combat vehicle. The M-21-OF 122 mm high-explosive-fragmentation  projectile and the 9M27F 220 mm high-explosive projectile are  constructed in the same way.    9M27K 220 mm projectiles are differentiated from  high-explosive projectiles by a cluster portion that consists of  30 1.85 kg fragmentation cluster submunitions. These rocket  projectiles are equipped with a mechanical time fuze (120 second  maximum time of operation). The fuze is set manually by the crew  (using a key). After the projectile leaves the launcher, the  fuze activates after the assigned time. The fuze's fors of fire  ignites the warhead's burster. The fuzes of the cluster  submunitions are armed from the pressure and temperature of the  gases formed, the warhead breaks up, and they are dispersed in  the direction of the projectile's movement. When a submunition  encounters an obstacle, its fuze activates and an explosion  occurs.    During firings at short distances (1.5-5 km), all rocket  projectiles provide a probable error range of 100 meters and the  Firing Table states: "Conduct firing at ranges of less than 5 km  in exceptional situations and only when friendly troops are not  in the line of fire". Therefore, you need to be very careful  when you read about cases of direct laying by rocket projectiles  against tanks with massive destruction of the latter that are  often described in the literature. But 122 mm and 220 mm rocket  projectiles are an adequately modern and effective weapon to  carry out organic missions, all the more so that far from all of  the "Grad" and "Uragan" systems' munitions were cited in the  article and some quite "exotic" projectiles are among those that  were not named.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tactical-Technical Specifications of Multiple Rocket Launcher System Comba-|  |t Vehicles                                                                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Designation       |BM-21             |BM-21V            |BM-22 (9K57)      |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chassis           |Ural-375D         |GAZ-66B           |BAZ-135LM         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Projectile calibe-|122               |122               |122               |  |r, mm             |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Number of tubes (-|40                |12                |16                |  |launchers)        |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight of the com-|13,700            |approximately 6,00|approximately 20,2|  |bat vehicle in th-|                  |0                 |00                |  |e combat configur-|                  |                  |                  |  |ation, kg         |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Time of complete  |20                |6                 |                  |  |salvo, seconds    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum speed alo-|75                |85                |69                |  |ng paved roads, k-|                  |                  |                  |  |ph                |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tactical-Technical Specifications of Rocket Projectiles                    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Model             |M-21-OF           |9M27F             |9M27K             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Caliber, mm       |122               |220               |220               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Projectile length,|2,870/23.5        |4,832/22.0        |5,178/23.5        |  | mm/calibers      |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Projectile weight,|66                |280.4             |271.1             |  | kg               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Warhead weight, kg|18.4              |99.05             |89.5              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum firing ra-|20.1              |35.8              |35.0              |  |nge, km           |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      COPYRIGHT: Izdatelstvo TsS SOSTO SNG "Patriot", "Voyennyye  znaniya", 1993</p>

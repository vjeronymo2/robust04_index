			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Finance Bill covers tax rules THE FINANCE Bill will clarify tax rules for building societies and introduce more quickly a proposed Budget measure on gift aid, the Treasury announced yesterday. The bill is to be published on 20 May and is expected to be through the Commons by the end of June. The measure will first be debated by MPs straight after the Whitsun recess, but the Budget resolutions on which it is based are likely to be debated next Thursday. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, said that the Finance Bill would confirm the composite rate tax (CRT) charge on interest paid to investors for the years 1986-87 to 1989-90 set out in the relevant Treasury orders. The validity of the composite rates within that period was questioned by the Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth-largest building society, which last summer sought judicial review of the rate of CRT from 1986-87. Mr Dorrell said the government was moving to legislate because it was not 'acceptable for the Exchequer's claim to the amounts involved to be in doubt, possibly for a number of years'. Sir John Cope, a Treasury minister, said that the reduction from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400 for the minimum limit on donations qualifying for tax relief under gift aid would be brought forward to apply from yesterday instead of 1 July. The bill will be substantial, comprising some 70 clauses and several schedules. It will include some important aspects of the Budget, such as changes to inheritance tax, extra help for the film industry and abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme. Much, however, will be technical measures on the European single market.</p>

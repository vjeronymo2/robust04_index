			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Radio watchdog warns on sponsors THE RADIO Authority, the industry regulatory body, plans to remind commercial radio stations about the rules on sponsored broadcasts following a controversial programme of Tina Turner's music. The one-hour programme was transmitted by satellite last month all over Europe and was broadcast by 30 independent local stations. The programme, which contained tracks from Ms Turner's latest album, was put together by MCM Networking, one of the largest syndicators of music programmes outside north America. Mr Doug Adamson, managing director of MCM, which has won a Sony award for its work, acknowledged yesterday that his company was paid by EMI, Tina Turner's record company, to make and distribute the programme free to radio stations. Some ILR stations decided not to use the programme as there was no acknowledgment of EMI's role. They included Mr Phil Riley, managing director of Radio Aire, the Leeds commercial radio station. 'There is some cause for concern about this type of behaviour by Thorn EMI,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, May 19 (CNS) -- Shenzhen is now gradually  relaxing restrictions on the issuing of certificates of property  rights for the real estate business. Many regulations  considered obstacles to the real estate development in the past  were recently eliminated in a bid to further invigorate the real  estate market here.    Progress was rather slow in the issuing of the certificates  since the municipality began such practice in 1989. The number  of certificates issued each year was some 15,000 on average. As  conditions set for the certificates were so complicated, a lot  of estate owners found it difficult to have a certificate in any  easy way. It turned out that property rights to real estate  were actually possessed by estate owners but far from being  recognized because they had no valid certificate issued by the  authorities. Real estate under such circumstances was not  allowed for trading nor for mortgage while it was also not  allowed to be given out as a gift nor to be exchanged. The real  estate market therefore received ill effects on further  development. The Shenzhen Bureau of Land made a breakthrough  recently by working out a number of measures which are in line  with the actual needs.    Regulations issued by the bureau stated that owners of  estate  who were not given a real estate certificate mainly because of  due tax unpaid by a particular real estate agency could be  issued with such certificates if they had paid the tax.  Transfer and mortgage are possible for unfinished flat  providing that the real estate certificate has been sealed with  a stamp. A substitute certificate is possible for owners of  estate who are eager to have their estate transferred, mortgaged  or leased but their estate have not yet been registered with the  authorities by the real estate agency. Owners of estate are  qualified for an official real estate certificate if the real  estate agency completed the initial procedure of registration  even though charges on added value of land have not yet been  settled. Owners of estate who lost their documents or relevant  papers can also be given a real estate certificate if they meet  requirements and conduct necessary procedures.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Delegates quit Zaire conference About 200 delegates walked out of Zaire's national conference on political reform yesterday, saying representation was too heavily weighted towards the opposition, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. Last week, hundreds of delegates loyal to authoritarian President Mobutu Sese Seko withdrew from the conference for the same reason. The latest walkout was by delegates from the southern Shaba region. The conference, called to chart a democratic future for Zaire, officially opened in August, but has been suspended much of the time and has accomplished virtually nothing.</p>

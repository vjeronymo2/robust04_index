			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Japan will work out a  planned package aimed at further market opening by early March,  a government source said Monday [21 February].    The source, who did not want to be identified, said, "We  want  to produce a concluded package at the earliest possible date in  March."    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided last week to  formulate a set of measures including deregulation and import  promotion to improve foreign access to the Japanese market.    His decision came in the wake of a U.S. announcement that it  plans to impose sanctions against Japan on cellular phones.    The source said, however, the planned market-opening steps  are not designed to avert threatened U.S. trade retaliation.    "Rather, they are voluntary efforts," the source said.    The source also said the scheduled emergency meeting of  cabinet members on the new package will be held after the third  supplementary budget for the current fiscal 1993 becomes law,  probably on Wednesday.</p>

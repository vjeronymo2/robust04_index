			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GM TO SPLIT STOCK, RAISE DIVIDEND;  </P> <P> MOVES DESIGNED TO SIGNAL CONFIDENCE, ANALYSTS SAY  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. on Monday raised its dividend 20% and declared a  two-for-one stock split in a move analysts said showed the auto maker's  confidence in its near-term profits.  </P> <P> The quarterly dividend per common share will be lifted to $1.50 from $1.25 a  share, making the annual dividend $6 a share. The two-for-one stock split will  take place later, and the dividend payment will be adjusted to reflect the  split.  </P> <P> GM also said it raised the payout on its Class E stock, which is based on the  performances of its Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit, and on its Class H  stock, based on the GM Hughes Electronics subsidiary.  </P> <P> GM disclosed in December that it is holding talks with the Howard Hughes  Medical Institute, which owns 86% of GM's Class H shares, to help meet the  institute's need for additional liquidity. A GM spokesman said Monday that he  did not know whether the increase in the dividend was part of a settlement on  that issue with the medical institute.  </P> <P> GM had paid a $5-a-share common stock dividend on an annual basis since 1984.  The increase in the dividend followed Ford Motor Co.'s decision last month to  increase its payout by 25% to $3 a share on an annual basis.  </P> <P> "I think it's designed to signal confidence," said analyst Joseph Phillippi of  Shearson Lehman Hutton. "This is the board talking, and it's a signal that they  are confident that things are getting better."  </P> <P> He noted that some analysts expected GM to raise its dividend by only 10%.  </P> <P> Analyst Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that while he expected a  dividend increase, he was surprised that GM raised the payout so early in 1989.  </P> <P> "This suggests that investors will be pleased with fourth-quarter earnings,"  Glantz said.  </P> <P> The action means that GM's dividend yield on its common stock is 6.7%, compared  to 5.5% at Ford and 3.6% at Chrysler.  </P> <P> GM Chairman Roger B. Smith has repeatedly said that GM will post record net  earnings for 1988. The auto maker turned in surprising record profit for the  third quarter and is expected to report strong results next week for the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> However, GM began 1989 with soft auto sales that were down 11% in January from  year-ago levels. The auto maker, like its U.S. competitors, has had to offer  incentives, including cut-rate financing programs, to reduce its abnormally  high inventories.  </P> <P> Analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert said GM will have no trouble  paying the additional dividend, which will cost it $300 million a year.  </P> <P> The company increased the dividend on Class E stock, representing the GM  Electronic Data Systems Corp. earnings, by 41% to 24 cents a share. The Class H  dividend, based on the Hughes division earnings, was raised 64% to 18 cents a  share.  </P> <P> GM also reversed one of its most unpopular decisions Monday, saying that it is  restoring vision and hearing benefits to about 190,000 U.S. salaried employees  and their families effective March 1.  </P> <P> The auto maker said its increased profitability allowed it to respond to  employee and retiree concerns and to restore the benefits, which were taken  away last year.  </P> <P> GM's decision to end fully paid vision and hearing coverage sparked protests by  GM workers, some of whom picketed last year's annual shareholders' meeting.  </P> <P> At the time, the auto maker said it could not afford to continue the benefits,  which it said were particularly expensive in the case of older workers and  retirees.  </P></p>

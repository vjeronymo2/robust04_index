			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     Yemeni ulema today held a further meeting at Mu'az  Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad region for a review of our  country's political crisis. They set up five subcommittees [as  heard]: The Constants Committee; one to study and prepare a  response to the president's speech; and one to propose solutions  to the crisis. The subcommittees began their work as soon as  they were named.    The Yemeni news agency, SABA', has learned that contacts  have  been made with the General People's Congress, the Yemeni  Socialist Party, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, the Political  Forces Dialouge Committee, and the Fact-Finding Committee. They  were informed of the ulema's decision that each party and  committee must send a representative to the ulema's meeting in  al-Janad in order for them to air their views on the political  crisis and its underlying causes and to propose solutions. The  ulema are now waiting for the representatives to arrive, now  that agreement of the parties and committees was obtained.  SABA' has also learned that the ulema have promised to remain  in the Mu'az Bin-Jabal Mosque until 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice  chairman of the Presidential Council, shows up there.    At today's ulema's meeting, many of their number voiced  their  opinions and made observations on the crisis.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Mr Tietmeyer TODAY, MR Hans Tietmeyer replaces Mr Helmut Schlesinger at the head of the Bundesbank. It would be wrong to expect this to make much difference. Personalities may change, but the institution will not. Even if Mr Tietmeyer wanted to soften its disinflationary line, he would not be allowed to by other members of his council. Like any great institution, the Bundesbank is far more than any individual. Mr Schlesinger has important achievements to his credit. He took over from Mr Karl Otto Pohl after the latter's bruising fight with the German chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, over the terms of German monetary unification. With German fiscal policy falling into disarray and inflation rising to unacceptable levels, Mr Schlesinger's Bundesbank was determined to restore monetary stability. It is on its way to doing so, even though the consequences of its determination have included deep German and European recessions, disruption of the exchange rate mechanism and, in all probability, postponement of economic and monetary union to the next millennium. Abroad, these policies have been controversial. But the Bundesbank has not acted whimsically. It has been doing precisely what an influential part of the German people continues to want it to do. By preserving the value of the D-Mark and keeping long-term rates of interest low, the Bundesbank is viewed as the chief institutional guarantor of stability in a country still beset by the demons of past catastrophes. This will not change. Mr Tietmeyer argued for a quarter point cut in the discount rate last July, immediately before the crisis that broke the ERM. Yet this was a grace note, rather than a different tune, and might well have made no difference to the outcome. Mr Tietmeyer knows that the Bundesbank's power rests on its reputation. He too will fight whatever might compromise it, be it the threat from Bonn, Paris, Brussels or anywhere else. The aims of the Bundesbank may not change, but its policies will. Interest rates will fall, for example, as inflation comes under control. The D-Mark is also likely to weaken, which should prove helpful to its partners. But the institution's role will remain for some years to come. Given the determination of the Germans to ensure that any replacement will be at least as good, it is possible that there will never be one. The Bundesbank is not above criticism. Its monetary policy has probably been too tight this year. Its emphasis on monetary targets may prove a mistake. Its council discussions are too secretive and should be revealed to the public, as are those of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. Yet whatever its mistakes and failings, the Bundesbank remains a powerful force for good as Germany's and Europe's chief bulwark against the inflationary propensities of politicians. May it remain so.</p>

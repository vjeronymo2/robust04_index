			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Get-rich game nears end in Transylvania ION Popescu is something of an exception in the Transylvanian city of Cluj, home of Caritas, the Romanian money-spinning scheme which has drawn in more than 3m investors and created a new class of Lei millionaires in the town. 'I sincerely hope Caritas collapses and soon. It's a terrible thing. I'm a private businessman and I can't get anyone to work for me. People here have so much money they won't work for normal salaries any more,' he says. Mr Popescu may not have long to wait. The scheme works like a chain-letter game and has become a nationwide craze. However, it has drawn warnings from opposition critics, and even from President Ion Iliescu, that it could spark a financial crisis or riots when the chain breaks down. For two days this week, Caritas, which promises investors a seven-fold return on their money in around 100 days, failed to pay out to depositors for the second time in a month. Caritas blamed the first interruption on a computer problem and this time around 'organisational problems.' The organisers have been quoted as saying the pay-out period has now been extended from three months plus nine days to three months and 24 days. But these days, not even the miners, who earn on average four times as much as other Romanian workers, are sinking much cash in the scheme. Business is already slack in the mining town of Petrosani, some 300 km south of Cluj, where Caritas's owner, Mr Ioan Stoica, last week opened a new branch with the help of Mr Miron Cosma, the miners' leader who led his men on anti-reform riots in Bucharest in 1990 and 1991. In Cluj, a local lawyer says: 'The town is booming. People here are content. They have already made a lot of money out of Caritas because they started playing last year.' Analysts attribute the popularity of the game to Romania's deteriorating economic situation which has caused real incomes to drop by 40 per cent since 1989 and annual inflation to surge to nearly 300 per cent. Others say Caritas is a product of incomplete reforms in a country where conservative politicians have held up the creation of a stockmarket or a modern banking system. Many fear a backlash against reform and market initiatives once the inevitable collapse comes. But opposition politicians say the government, a weak left-wing minority, has not intervened for fear of losing the support of the Romanian National Unity party (RNUP), upon which it relies to stay in power. Mr Gheorghe Funar, the mayor of Cluj, is also RNUP president and one of Caritas's most enthusiastic backers. He has often appeared with Mr Stoica to drum up support for the flagging scheme. However, Mr Funar's opponents hope the scheme's collapse will provide a backlash against the mayor, for through it Mr Funar has claimed he can provide 'solutions' for the people. One critic said: 'People there have already been enriched. It's the laggards in the rest of the country who put their money in later who will suffer.'</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / World Trade News: New small car is unveiled today GENERAL Motors Europe unveils today its new generation small car, the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa pictured below, which has been developed at a cost of around DM1.5bn (Pounds 599m), writes Kevin Done. GM (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) is aiming to increase significantly its share of the market for small cars in west Europe with the launch of the new Corsa against rivals such as the Ford Fiesta, Fiat Uno, Renault Clio and Peugeot 106. GM has reduced the development time for the Corsa to only 36 months, its fastest new model development programme in Europe. Small cars in the Corsa/Fiesta class account for around 28 per cent of all new car sales in west Europe. GM will build the Corsa at its plant at Zaragoza, Spain and at its new DM1bn assembly plant at Eisenach in eastern Germany which was opened last autumn. GM has also developed for the first time in this market segment a purpose-built high-roof van to challenge similar light commercial vehicles such as the Renault Express, the Fiat Fiorino, and the Ford Courier. The Corsa van will be produced at GM's assembly plant at Azambuja in Portugal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 10 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serb fighters this  morning liberated Uhotici Brdo, one of the last Muslim army  strongholds south of Gorazde, the command of the Herzegovina  Corps reported.    Units of the Serb Republic Army are reported to be in  control  of the right bank of the Drina from Vitkovici to Dzindici at a  distance of about 700 meters from the river.    NATO planes are breaking the sound barrier while flying at  low level above the area between Gorazde, Foca and Cajnice --  the scene of heavy fighting over the past 13 days.    The command of the Hercegovina Corps, denying Muslim media  reports, said today that Serb fighters have not engaged in any  military actions in the center of Gorazde.</p>

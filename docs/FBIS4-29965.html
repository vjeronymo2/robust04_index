			<p>BFN     [Text] Omiya, Japan, June 22 KYODO -- Representatives from  16 countries in the Asia-Pacific region ended a two-day  environmental meeting Wednesday [22 June] with a call for the  development of sustainable cities and the protection of island  nations from the effects of global warming.    The call was included in a document adopted at the  environment congress for Asia and the Pacific (Eco Asia `94) in  Omiya, Saitama Prefecture.    Senior officials from 16 governments, including five  ministers, as well as representatives from eight international  organizations attended the congress.    The congress, the third since 1991, reviewed progress in  achieving environmentally sustainable development in the region  since the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development  (UNCED), otherwise known as the earth summit, in Rio de Janeiro  in June 1992.    The document, issued in the name of the conference  chairwoman, Environment Agency Director General Toshiko  Hamayotsu, said the region needs to shift from theoretical  considerations to "concerted political and practical actions,  international cooperation, and sufficient institutional and  capacity building."    Countries represented at the congress are home to more than  half the world's population, with millions of people  concentrated in rapidly growing cities.    The document notes the concern of delegates over pollution  and urban crowding in the region caused by rapid economic  development at the expense of the environment.    It urges, for the first time at an Eco Asia meeting, the  development of the concept of sustainable cities.    It also calls for developed countries to "change their mass  consumption lifestyles, provide support for realization of  sustainable development in developing countries and prevent the  export of pollution."    "Solid waste disposal has become a critical issue in this  region," the document says.    The document also incorporates a call made Tuesday by  Indonesian Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmaja to "tackle  the problems" of small island states.    Indonesia and a number of other Pacific nations incorporate  thousands of small, low-lying islands which could be threatened  if global warming causes a rise in sea levels.    Although many delegates favored establishment of an Eco Asia  secretariat in Japan, opinion was not unanimous and the document  merely calls for "development mechanisms for smooth and  effective implementation of Eco Asia activities."    Malaysian Environment Minister Hieng Ding Law, who served as  congress co-chairman, told a press conference after the congress  that there was "a general feeling that Eco Asia should continue."    "It is high time Japan should play a more significant role  in  implementing UNCED," Law said. "It is important to have a  secretariat and a data bank."</p>

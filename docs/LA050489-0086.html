			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STOLEN TRUCK CARRIED RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS  </P> <P> A Valencia company said a device containing radioactive materials was in a  pickup truck stolen Tuesday in Granada Hills.  </P> <P> The substance was locked in a thick steel cage and does not pose an immediate  danger, said Ross Khiabani, chief engineer for the Valencia office of Leighton  &amp; Associates, an Irvine-based company specializing in geotechnical  consulting. He said the cage could be opened only with a special key owned by  the manufacturer of the device, which is a gauge for testing moisture density  in soil.  </P> <P> The company is offering a $500 reward for information leading to recovery of  the gauge.  </P> <P> The gauge and other testing equipment were in the bed of a red 1988 Mazda  pickup stolen Tuesday afternoon from a parking lot at San Fernando Mission and  Balboa boulevards, said company spokeswoman Jamie Milteer.  </P> <P> The 40-pound gauge is yellow and resembles an upright vacuum cleaner, Milteer  said. It was secured to the truck with a chain and lock.  </P></p>

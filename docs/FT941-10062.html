			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Parents from state schools go private More than half the parents of independent school pupils were educated by the state, a survey showed yesterday. The proportion of private school 'first-time buyers' - those educated in state schools - rose from 41 per cent when a similar survey was carried out in 1989, to 54 per cent by late last year. But while private schools appeared to be less socially exclusive, the report, produced for the Independent Schools Information Service by MORI, the polling organisation, indicated that they are increasingly becoming the preserve of the wealthy. It also revealed that the proportion of parents who 'voted with their feet' because of dissatisfaction with state schools rose from 21 per cent to 25 per cent since 1989. Implementation of the government's education reforms, intended to revitalise the state system in England and Wales, began in 1988. 'League tables' of examination results, which have been introduced since 1989, appear to have had little impact on parental choice, with only 15 per cent of parents citing a school's league ranking as an important factor. The Department for Education said: 'Many state schools perform just as well as independent schools. Performance tables provide parents with an opportunity to compare schools in both sectors and make sensible choices.' School fees have risen by more than retail price inflation each year since the last survey. This appears to have affected schools' social composition. Since 1989, the proportion of families in social class A has risen from 15 per cent to 22 per cent, while representation from the lower classes C, D, and E has dropped from 37 per cent to 30 per cent. The proportion of parents making advance financial plans to pay for school fees increased from 25 per cent to 35 per cent over the same period, although most - 82 per cent - pay for fees out of salary and other personal income. Most parents said they were attracted by independent schools' generally conservative values - the most important factors were good discipline (named by 84 per cent), reputation (77 per cent) and small classes (67 per cent).

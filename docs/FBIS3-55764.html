A Candidate To Be  Expelled From His Own Party "]    [Text] Returning to a discussion of whether its countrymen  should participate in the elections for the Republic of Crimea's  presidency or not for the fourth time in the past two weeks, the  Crimean Tatar People's Assembly rescinded its own 2 January  decision on boycotting the elections. Now the Assembly believes  that the pre-election situation has changed drastically and  there are fears that a person who insists on redrawing the  current borders may come to power. (As a matter of fact, five  out of six candidates, except for Crimean Supreme Soviet  chairman Nikolay Bagrov, call for this to be done.) This is why  the Assembly called on the Crimean Tatars to vote against the  five and thus give their backing to Bagrov. "Our decision,"  Assembly chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA,  "was prompted exclusively by the desire to preserve peace on the  peninsula." The Assembly thinks that the decision it made does  not amount to the recognition of the institution of the  presidency as set forth in the Law on the President, approved by  the Crimean Supreme Soviet. The Assembly will not recognize the  powers of the future president if he takes steps to redraw  borders or make decisions on Crimea's status without taking into  account the Crimean Tatar people's opinions. In all, 17  Assembly members voted for taking part in the presidential  elections, with 10 "No" votes and 2 abstentions.    The Russian Party of Crimea's emergency congress, attended  by  members of Crimea's Russian Society, expelled Sergey  Shuvaynikov, who is running for the Crimean presidency, from the  party he headed. Shuvaynikov was accused of having concealed  from the party the fact that he had been expelled from a  military political school in 1972 and refused to reveal the  sources of financing his electoral campaign. According to  observers, however, the main reason for what occurred was  Shuvaynikov's refusal to withdraw his candidacy and to join the  "Russia" bloc, which fielded Yuriy Meshkov, chairman of the  Republican Party of Crimea, as its only candidate. According to  some members of the Russian Party of Crimea's political council,  however, the congress was not legitimate and Shuvaynikov's  expulsion from the party was illegal. This is what your  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by Andrey Mazyuk,  member of the Russian Party of Crimea's political council.</p>

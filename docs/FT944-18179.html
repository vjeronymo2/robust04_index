			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Police chief flees Haiti Haitian police chief Lt-Col Michel Francois has fled to the neighbouring Dominican Republic in a move that US officials say will go a long way towards reforming the country's dreaded police force. Col Francois was initially detained by Dominican officials, who would not let him cross the border. The officials, later relented and allowed him in on a tourist visa. Intelligence officials later confirmed Col Francois had arrived in Santo Domingo. Haiti's military leaders, scheduled to step down by October 15, did not immediately appoint a new police chief and Mr Stanley Schrager of the US embassy suggested the post may remain vacant until exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide chooses someone to fill it. With Col Francois removed, US officials began to implement their plan for a new police force, selecting a site for a temporary training academy, where eventually 4,000 new officers will be trained. Hopes of a peaceful transition to democratic rule were further boosted yesterday when Mr Emmanuel Constant, head of the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti (Fraph), urged his followers to end the violence and support the return of President Aristide. The leader of the main paramilitary group said Fraph would serve as a 'constructive opposition'. Mr Constant's plea came a day after the US military stormed Fraph headquarters. US troops detained fewer than 100 of the several thousand members of Fraph but military patrols increased. 'It is becoming clear there is a new sheriff in town,' said Mr Schrager, expressing hope that Lt-Gen Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military strongman,would join Col Francois in leaving the country. At the United Nations yesterday President Aristide said he planned to return home after three years in exile by October 15 at the latest.</p>

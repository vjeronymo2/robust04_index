He said there was  no hope of the peace process moving forward until the Downing  Street declaration was clarified in open and direct discussions  -- which could be completed "within a couple of days."    John Major and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Peter Mayhew  have made it clear there will be no talks until there is a  permanent end to IRA violence.    Mr McGuinness said the Government appeared to be in a state  of "paralysis." But he added: "There's every prospect that the  situation could move forward quite dramatically given the  explanations which would be given at any discussions between  Sinn Fein and the British Government."    He claimed the Goverment was trying to defeat republican  resistance. "The ordinary people who have been fighting for  their rights for so many years have no intention of surrendering  to the British Government," he told BBC Northern Ireland.</p>

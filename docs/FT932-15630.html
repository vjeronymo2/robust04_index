			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: An undercover bottle bank - A new company making wabes in wine storage THERE IS a bank open today more than 100 feet beneath the English countryside. It deals in commodities from all over the world and holds, on deposit, products traded by leading brokers. Its currency is not cash or cheques, but bottles. Protected by steel doors and concrete-lined walls, the owners maintain strict security over their liquid assets - wine. There is more than Pounds 144m worth of fine reds, roses and whites in what is thought to be Britain's largest bottle bank, the Corsham stone mine in Wiltshire, southern England. Left dormant by its former owners, including the ministry of defence which used it as an ammunition dump, the mine has been given a new lease of life by a company enjoying a dominant position in the wine storage business. Octavian, a bonded warehousing company, has shaken up the musty ranks of Britain's wine industry through a series of aggressive takeovers, culminating with its 1991 acquisition of Frazers, a competitor whose main asset was the 33-acre mine at Corsham. The company has since spent millions refurbishing the mine with computer-controlled dehumidifiers, a truck terminal and underground offices. That investment is beginning to show a handsome return: Octavian now holds 600,000 cases of wine at Corsham and a further 500,000 cases at its site in Charlton, south east London. Formed only a couple of years ago, Octavian's rapid success has raised questions among traditional vintners about how such a young company could command a large slice of the storage market. The answer lies with the backers who have invested heavily to create ideal conditions for storing wine. They saw a niche market for bulk storage and decided Corsham was the perfect site. The mine had already been converted into a warehouse by the MoD, which dug tunnels large enough for an Underground train and installed its own underground railway, which now carries wine. Corsham's backers are led by Nigel Jagger, a millionaire financier, who says: 'The wine stored here represents an important part of the world's stock of fine wine. It is like a large safety deposit box and we operate like a bank.' Jagger, who lives in Jersey, made part of his fortune as an executive director of Atlantic Computers, the subsidiary of the British and Commonwealth Group, which collapsed in 1990. His competitors in the wine trade say they are wary of an enterprise controlled by an offshore company. Documents filed at Companies House show that most of Octavian's shares are registered with the Reredos Corporation, an offshore holding company with offices in Panama and Zurich. With the backing of Jagger, Octavian has pursued new customers aggressively and now has large commercial wine stocks. Some of the brightest New World wines are lying in the darkness at Corsham, including 70,000 cases imported by Edward Cavendish, the largest dealer in South African vintages. Octavian inherited most of its stock from its sister company Cert, the public warehousing group also registered with the Reredos Corporation and backed by Jagger. Cert's influence over Octavian has left the storage company more closely attuned with stevedores than wine connoisseurs, but that has not deterred large collectors from sending stock to Corsham. The Wiltshire mine has wooed customers from other companies but its rivals claim it is winning new business only by undercutting the market price for storage. Trapps Cellars, the London company where Christie's and Sotheby's keep their stocks, has been one of the main victims. It has lost 20 leading clients to Octavian. Many London companies are thought to be under pressure from British Rail to vacate railway arches which it wants to redevelop. Wine merchants Milton Sandford, for example, is moving its stock into a disused chalk mine near Twyford, Berkshire, which it is converting into a wine store. Richard Sandford, the owner, says: 'London is becoming an expensive place to store wine. I know one merchant who is being charged Pounds 23,000 a year by BR for 30,000ft of space.' Octavian has been the main beneficiary of the migration out of London by some merchants. And the company says it is expanding into an area previously dominated by Trapps - stocks held by private investors. Such a move could change the complexion of the wine storage business, according to John Davis, co-founder of Trapps, who claims: 'There has been a contraction among smaller and middle-size storage companies. We will be left with a few big players and Octavian will be biggest.' But Jagger rejects such fears. Climbing up the main shaft from the Corsham mine, he says: 'We have a perfect wine store. The temperature is ideal, there is no vibration and no natural light. Anyone who cannot provide this sort of service will not survive. The best news for me is that our competitors are giving up.'</p>

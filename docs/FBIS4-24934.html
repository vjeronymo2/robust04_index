			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Youhao (1728 2589 3185)] </F>   [Text] Paris, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- Rene Monory, president of  the French Senate, and Giscard d'Estaing, former French  president and chairman of the French National Assembly's Foreign  Affairs Committee, on 1 June separately met and feted a  delegation from the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC]  Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Vice Chairman Zhou Jue.    During the meeting, Speaker Monory happily recalled his trip  to China in February this year. He said he was very concerned  about China and the development of French-Chinese relations. He  was delighted at the improvement of French-Chinese relations  since the beginning of this year. On human rights issues,  Monory said: Eastern countries are different from Western  nations; they have their own cultural traditions and historical  backgrounds. The West cannot demand identical concepts and  practices from the East.    During his meeting, D'Estaing commended the reform and  opening up polices that China has implemented for many years.  He also expressed admiration for China's achievements in  economic construction.    He considered it very important for France to improve and  develop its relations with China. France should keep working  hard to catch up with other major powers in developing relations  with China. D'Estaing said: France and China seldom hold  different viewpoints on international political issues, and they  have cooperated very well in the UN Security Council. He  expressed the hope that the two countries would further develop  economic cooperation and trade while increasing political  cooperation in the future.    Zhou Jue and his entourage arrived in Paris last night at  the  invitation of the French National Assembly's Foreign Affairs  Committee. During its visit to France, the delegation will also  hold working meetings with the Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>

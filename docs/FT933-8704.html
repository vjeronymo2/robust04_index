			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Australian unemployment AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate slid to 10.7 per cent in July, bringing it back to the level of April and May, the Bureau of Statistics reported yesterday, Reuter reports from Sydney. But analysts said the drop in the seasonally-adjusted rate from 11.1 per cent in June had more to do with people giving up the search for work than a surge in the number of new jobs. Employment was unchanged at 7.74m after rising by a total of 84,000 in May and June.</p>

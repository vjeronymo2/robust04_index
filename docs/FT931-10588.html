			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Keating calls Australianpoll three months early: Labor move seeks to exploit rise in popularity MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, yesterday called a federal election on March 13 after his Labor party lost a state election in Western Australia by a smaller than expected margin. By choosing to go to the electorate three months earlier than he had to, Mr Keating is seeking to capitalise on Labor's rise in popularity since he wrested the premiership from Mr Bob Hawke in December 1991. A Morgan Gallup poll, to be published in Time Australia magazine today, indicated that Labor would win by 5 per cent if the election were held now. The announcement launched a fierce political and personal battle. Mr Keating, 49, was treasurer for eight years as Australia sank into its deepest recession since the 1930s. He is famous for vicious criticism of his opponents. Mr John Hewson, the 47-year-old leader of the coalition of opposition conservative parties, is an economist who loves sports cars. The two men are known to detest each other. In Western Australia, a scandal-ridden Labor state government, expected to lose by a landslide in Saturday's poll, suffered only a 5 per cent swing against it, with the opposition coalition increasing its share of the vote by just 2 per cent. It was the third time in a year that a Labor government had been unseated in a state election. Mr Hewson said he could win the federal election because the Western Australian poll showed middle-class Australians deserting Labor. 'I think with nearly a million Australians unemployed and millions of others genuinely worried about whether or not they'll keep their job, the issue is going to be who is best able to manage this country,' he said. Australia's economy, which has begun to turn upwards, boasts an inflation rate of only 0.3 per cent but unemployment at 11.3 per cent. Mr Keating said he would tomorrow announce a policy package designed to expand business opportunities and accelerate growth. Today he will outline a strategy to take advantage of trade opportunities in Asia. Mr Hewson's economic strategy is centred on a value-added tax on consumption. Although it would be offset by income tax cuts, the VAT proposal has become the main target of government counter-attacks. Mr Keating, whose policy as treasurer was to liberalise the economy by floating the currency and cutting tariffs and taxes, has sought to refocus Australia on its role in Asia and favours moves to lessen traditional ties with Britain. He warned voters that a conservative win would threaten the national health system. Observer, Page 13 Australian bonds, Page 18</p>

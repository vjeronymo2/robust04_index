			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Final communique issued by the multiparty conference in </F> Xai-Xai 25-27 May]    [Text] The first conference of opposition political parties  was held in the city of Xai-Xai, Gaza Province, from 25 to 27  May 1994. The conference had the following agenda:    a) October 1994 elections    b) Electoral guarantees    The meeting amounted to a notable change in the relations  among the various opposition political parties, and it stressed  the will to overcome political and ideological differences with  a view to forming a common platform. Although the meeting was  not designed to make deliberations, important positions have  been agreed upon regarding coalitions that the opposition could  form for the presidential elections.    The participating parties unanimously stated their intention  of rapidly continuing with the negotiations with a view to  forming coalitions because they believe only united can they  constitute a serious alternative to the present government.  Likewise, the participating parties stated the desire to begin  consultations and to reach agreement on the choice of a single  opposition candidate for the presidential elections to prevent  the division of votes and to ensure a greater probability of  victory.    Regarding electoral guarantees, it was noted that there are  objective situations that could endanger the electoral process  -- namely, the impossibility of the opposition political parties  to guarantee the deployment of monitors during the registration  of voters and at polling and counting stations because the lack  material and financial resources. Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance] has been asked to fill this gap.    Another serious cause for concern are the guarantees for the  physical security of voters and candidates in view of the  frequent persecution and intimidation carried out by local  Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] authorities. To fill this  gap it was decided to establish a commission to monitor and  report such undemocratic actions.    A commission was also established to begin contacts with the  National Elections Commission, the UN Operations in Mozambique,  and the international community with a view to facilitating the  release of funds necessary for the electoral process.    The conference unanimously rejected the use of computers for  data processing and opted for a manual system, which is less  susceptible to fraud and not as expensive.</p>

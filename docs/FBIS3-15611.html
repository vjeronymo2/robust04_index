The Constitution's provisions on the parliament and  presidency was passed by 266 legislative votes, exceeding the  required 233 votes, which is two-thirds of the Supreme Soviet.  As members of the Counting Commission reported at the press  conference, election of the first Belarusian president should be  expected not later than 26 June this year.    Curiously, several days before the voting, the Belarusian  Popular Movement [BND] leadership, which has repeatedly said  that it could block any issue, came out against the presidency.  Why did they vote for it then? Observers say that there could  be three reasons for this. First, the NDB altered its position  in the last minute. Second, it has been concealing its true  position until now. Third, the movement's members have failed  to obey decisions made by its leadership. Incidentally, a  leader of an organization that is part of the NDB denounced the  voting by NDB members, especially its communist faction, as  insubordination to the leadership, and suggested applying party  disciplinary measures.    Immediately after the vote, our correspondent met with three  people's deputies and asked them to answer several questions  connected with the introduction of a new power institution in  the Republic.    [RESPUBLIKA] Can one be absolutely positive that Belarus  will  have its president?    [Dmitriy Bulakhov] We have passed the most difficult stage  in  introducing the presidency in the Republic. This does not mean,  however, that it is a foregone conclusion. Ahead lies the  adoption of the constitution as a whole, and debates over  transition provisions on its activation, which are very complex  issues.    [RESPUBLIKA] Are you for the presidency?    [Bulakhov] Absolutely.    [RESPUBLIKA] How would you explain your position?    [Bulakhov] Weakness of the power results in the power of  violence -- uncontrolled and executed not according to laws and  the Constitution, but according to muscle. This means a  language of ultimatum and pressure on any procedure. So, it is  better to have stronger power. This can only be possible when  two conditions are met: legitimacy supported by a popular vote  in general elections, and the lawfulness stemming from laws and  the Constitution.    As a matter of fact, the presidency is not a new thing for  us. Except for the past three years, it has always been present  in Belarus. We had our presidents in the face of first  secretaries of the CPSU Central Committee, only we did not talk  about this. For all its notoriety, the one-party system was  manageable even during the most crucial and difficult stages of  economic and political development.    What we have today is a general lack of responsibility, or,  to put it another way, a mess -- and not the pinnacle of  democracy as some make it out to be. Democracy is not  ochlocracy. Democracy is when everyone abides by the law, and  everyone understands that their rights and freedom are limited  by the rights and freedoms of others. At the same time, an  individual should have priority over any national and  supranational rights and freedoms of a group of individuals.    [RESPUBLIKA] Will you run for the presidency?    [Bulakhov] I am too young now. And, as a matter of fact,  it's not my business. No, I will not run.    [RESPUBLIKA] How realistic is the outcome that a new  president will be elected by the parliament, as an exception,  and not by all the people?    [Valeriy Tikhinya] This outcome should not be ruled out.  However, the candidate who will seek this post and the forces  that he represents will hardly accept it -- because it is so  obvious that it is going to be a puppet president without strong  power. As his legal status will be diminished, he will have to  look to the Supreme Soviet all the time, which gave him its  support. In my opinion, it is not the best way to elect the  first Belarusian president, and I hope it will be rejected.    [RESPUBLIKA] Will you propose yourself as a candidate for  president and, if so, as a candidate of what party?    [Aleksandr Lukashenko] If I will, I will be a candidate of  the left center. Basically, all the candidates are already  known: Lukashenko, Kebich, and perhaps Hryb and Tikhinya -- left  of the center; Shushkevich, Karpenko, Paznyak -- right of the  center. Other candidates also may appear. But I do not think  it's very likely -- political figures do not come out of the  blue. For me, the arrangement of forces is already clear.</p>

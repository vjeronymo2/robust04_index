			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Mr Greenspan helps lift Dow to new heights Wall Street US stocks again surged into record territory yesterday after remarks by the Federal Reserve Board chairman reassured investors wary of inflation, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 32.93 ahead at 3,978.36, a third consecutive all-time high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 2.91 at 481.61, while the American SE composite climbed 2.46 to 485.68 and the Nasdaq composite advanced 3.94 to 800.47, surpassing the 800 mark for the first time. Volume on the New York SE was heavy, with 322.9m shares changing hands. Stocks had several developments working in their favour. The powerful advance staged by the Nikkei index overnight, after passage of a Japanese political reform package, set an upbeat tone for the session's opening. The positive sentiment was reinforced by Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, who told a congressional committee that the central bank was committed to stamping out inflationary pressures in the economy. The vigilant tone of his remarks brought firmer prices to longer-dated US Treasury bonds, which are particularly sensitive to inflation. In the afternoon, however, the 30-year benchmark bond retraced its gains as commodity prices rebounded, and ended the session in negative ground. Higher commodity prices proved to be a favourable development for some stocks. An agreement by the world's leading aluminium-producing countries to cut global production gave a strong lift to the share prices of US suppliers of the basic metal. Alcoa, a component of the Dow Industrial index, surged Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 79 1/8 , a 52-week high. Reynolds climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 53 3/8 , Alcan Aluminum Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 and Phelps Dodge Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 1/4 . The market received at least one piece of unwelcome news. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago revealed a modest downturn in its January index of economic activity, possibly a preview of today's national survey. In spite of the indication of a slowdown, stocks closely linked to broad economic trends continued to gather strength. Investors showed particular interest in automobile issues. General Motors rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 61 3/8 , Ford Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 67 and Chrysler Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 . Xerox impressed the market with better than expected earnings from its core processing activities. The stock jumped Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 98 1/8 , well above its previous 52-week high of Dollars 93 1/2 . Canada Toronto surged in active dealings, in line with large increases on other major world stock markets. The TSE 300 index ended 62.6 up at 4,554.8, some eight points shy of the record high of 4,562.9 set on January 19. Rises led declines by 507 to 339 after volume of 79.6m shares valued at CDollars 1.1bn. Mining and conglomerates led the advance, jumping 2.93 and 2.74 per cent respectively. Golds climbed 2.32 per cent.</p>

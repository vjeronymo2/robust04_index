			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Foreign minister Koji  Kakizawa reiterated hope Wednesday [15 June] that Japan will  become a permanent member with veto power on the UN Security  Council.    "When a question arises and Japan cannot accept it at any  cost, in order to reject it with all its might, it should be no  problem for Japan to be a permanent member with veto," Kakizawa  said in answer to questions at a House of Councillors Budget  Committee session.    The minister said Japan should act to reflect views of the  Asian region and small countries if it wins permanent membership  with veto power.    Japan and Germany are now the only likely candidates for  permanent seats should the Security Council expand the number  from the current five, he said.    The council now groups Britain, China, France, Russia and  the  United States, which have veto power as the major victor nations  of World War II, and 10 nonpermanent members selected from UN  member nations for two-year terms.    Other countries including Brazil, Egypt, India and Nigeria  have been named as candidates, but they have failed to win  majority support among UN members, the minister said.    Earlier this month, Hisashi Owada, Japanese ambassador to  the  UN, asked a UN panel to discuss reorganization of the Security  Council given Japan's bid for a permanent seat, but he did not  mention veto.</p>

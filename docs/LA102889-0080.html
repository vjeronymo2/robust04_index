			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RESUMPTION OF SERIES A MATTER OF MONEY  </P> <P> Let's be realistic. Out of deference to the disaster that struck the Bay Area,  if the World Series hadn't been resumed, baseball probably would have been  required to return something like $75 million to the network. That's a load of  deference.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, each Series game generates about $12 million in profit, as the  network attempts to cover losses accrued with regular-season coverage, so guess  who's praying it goes seven games.  </P> <P> Joe Morgan might have a slight problem picking up a fan following next year  when he becomes one of the main analysts for ESPN.  </P> <P> The ex-second baseman on the relative merits of the contending leagues: "The  National League is definitely the harder league, no question. The teams play  better. How many American League teams do you see manufacture runs like they do  in the National? How many?"  </P> <P> Ho-hum, it's an age-old dodge of National Leaguers. Pay no attention.  </P> <P> Dream Season concludes Sunday night on ESPN with '72 Dolphins taking on '78  Steelers. Steve Sabol, the originator from NFL Films, says no more because old  friends, players and coaches have called up and wept when their teams were  beaten. To paraphrase, it's a kid's game played by kids.  </P> <P> Even by boxing standards, which are all but non-existent, it was bush. There  was promoter Bob Arum on the tube the other night snipping and snapping how  Brit Tom Collins shouldn't get his purse after quitting in a bout against WBC  light-heavyweight champ Jeff Harding. Arum, of course, makes millions promoting  fights, a lot of them stinkers, and he hasn't been hit yet.  </P> <P> Honest now, broadcaster Jon Miller, did you actually say of Bert Blyleven  during the season that "he was originally born in Holland"? If you did, I  accuse you of plagiarism. Curt Gowdy used to make that faux pas all the time.  </P> <P> Herb Brooks did about two periods of an Edmonton hockey game on SportsChannel  referring to Kevin Lowe as Rob Lowe. Hmm, Kevin probably wishes he were Rob.  </P> <P> A guy who analyzes a pro football game as well as anyone is Paul Maguire. Now  if his presentation wasn't so street-cornerish.  </P> <P> Oh, Giff, Giff, Giff. When Webster Slaughter set the Cleveland record with a  97-yard reception the other night, Frank Gifford said he broke the mark of Mike  Moran. Who just so happens to be Milt Morin, a titan at tight end and a Pro  Bowler many times.  </P> <P> This oops from Brent Gushburger, presently making the transition from football  to baseball as CBS moved into to cover the Grand Old Game next season: "... and  Mark McGwire bobbled that grounder out of bounds." Psst, Brent, it's called  foul territory over here.  </P> <P> Runners, triathletes, take note: NBC SportsWorld Saturday has the Western  States 100 from Squaw Valley.  </P> <P> Before the collegians began kicking the ball around this season, ESPN asked the  Ivy League to play some of its games on Thursday night or (get this) Saturday  morning to ease scheduling problems. It extolled the virtue of appearing in the  prime as though the Ivies give a hoot about ratings. Smoooooth.  </P> <P> Latest estimates are that about 22 million people watch wrassling weekly over  300 stations coast-to-coast, so don't go knocking Hulkamania too loudly.  </P> <P> It is believed Southern Cal and Cal-Berkeley set an all-time record for changed  starting times recently when they scheduled 1 p.m., 7:30 and 12:30 before  landing on 3:30.  </P></p>

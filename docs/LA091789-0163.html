			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROHRABACHER AND FUNDING FOR THE ARTS  </P> <P> I am sorry that Rep. Dana Rohrabacher feels that art is "frivolous" and that  he, in all his wisdom, feels compelled to stand in judgment of one's creative  expression. Our country was founded by visionaries, willing to take chances.  </P> <P> After generations of personal repression, our founding fathers (and mothers)  were willing to give their lives for the opportunity of enjoying the basic  freedom of self-expression.  </P> <P> How sad that now our leaders in Congress attack that right as frivolous. Stay  in line. Don't make waves. Our country must continue to progress without  basking in the laurels of its past.  </P> <P> The future is a product of the creative spirit embodied in our artists, our  designers, our teachers and all those with a vision of what could be.  Rohrabacher and Sen. Jesse Helms seem threatened by the power of this creative  spirit and have a wish to bask in all that is comfortable and accountable.  </P> <P> Our culture will stagnate without persons in power with vision, imagination and  creativity! Art is not frivolous. It is the spirit we need as a people to  continue and be great.  </P> <P> RICHARD ALAN HALES  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

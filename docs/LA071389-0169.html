			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'SMOKELESS' DIESEL ENGINE TO BE TESTED IN SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> Thick, black truck exhaust, as much a part of the Southern California  experience as sunshine and sea breezes, could one day become a thing of the  past.  </P> <P> Navistar International Corp., the Chicago conglomerate that builds  International trucks, will begin testing the nation's first "smokeless" diesel  engine in Southern California sometime during the next year, the company said  Wednesday at a trade show in Anaheim.  </P> <P> The new design, called "Smokeless 94," emits almost clear exhaust because it  burns fuel more efficiently than the traditional diesel engines that power most  big trucks, Navistar said.  </P> <P> Although the company had several prototypes on display at the International  Truck Show, the engines will not be released commercially until 1994. The  design must still be tested on the road by truckers, the firm said.  </P> <P> Navistar increased the engine's efficiency by boosting cylinder pressure to  unusually high levels and designing a new type of piston, said James  McCandless, a Navistar vice president who headed research on the engine.  </P> <P> Many of the nation's largest truck makers have been experimenting with more  efficient diesel engines for several years to meet tougher clean air standards  scheduled to take effect in 1991, said Arthur G. Davis, an auto industry  analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, a New York brokerage.  </P> <P> So far, though, most improvements have involved filtering exhaust fumes more  effectively, rather than burning fuel more efficiently, Davis said. Other  companies have designed "particulate traps" that can filter exhausts of engines  now in use.  </P> <P> McCandless said particulate filters are less fuel efficient than an engine with  little black exhaust, and are inconvenient because they must be regularly  cleaned of carbon.  </P> <P> Even so, the Navistar design must be tested before its commercial potential can  be gauged, Davis said.  </P> <P> "Navistar is first with this engine, but there's no magic formula for success,  because higher pressure means more wear," Davis said. "A trucker wants to know  whether the engine is durable before he'll buy it, and that's something they'll  have to test."  </P> <P> Navistar, the nation's leading manufacturer of large and medium-size trucks,  said it has spent $20 million per year on research in the last few years to  develop the engine.  </P> <P> The firm said it chose Southern California for testing because the engine uses  catalytic converters that are damaged by high levels of sulfur contained in  diesel fuel sold in other states. California has required low-sulfur diesel  fuel for the last several years.  </P> <P> The company said its next step is to find a trucking company in Southern  California that will test 25 to 30 trucks equipped with the smokeless engine.  </P></p>

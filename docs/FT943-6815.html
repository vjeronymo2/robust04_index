			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Indian group to tap euromarkets Shriram Industrial Enterprises, a New Delhi-based diversified group producing sugar, air-conditioners, oils, fats and chemicals, is planning to tap the euromarkets next week with a Dollars 75m equity offering. Shriram, which is responding to the liberalisation of the Indian economy with a large reorganisation, plans big expansions of capacity in sugar, air-conditioning and the production of caustic soda. It also intends to build a financial services business and to develop an industrial park with its own power plant in the northern state of Punjab. Mr Siddharth Shriram, the chairman whose family controls the group, said he planned further share issues to fund the investment programme which would cost about Rs10bn (Dollars 318m). Shriram made net profits of Rs209m on sales of Rs6.8bn in the year to the end of March. The company was originally part of DCM, one of Delhi's oldest industrial groupings, which split three years ago following tensions in the Shriram family. Mr Shriram admitted that like many large Indian industrial groupings, Shriram Industrial Enterprises had in the past diversified into too many separate fields. He now intends to focus the group's investments on businesses where it has competitive advantages.</p>

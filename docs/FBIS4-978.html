			<p>BFN     [Text] Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen welcomed the  announcement that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] will  participate in the election. General Viljoen said in Tzaneen he  believed that an election, which included all the parties, was  necessary.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Pieter Theron] Gen. Viljoen  addressed a group of people consisting of community leaders,  businessmen, and farmers in the town. He said the Afrikaner and  the Zulu both believed in self-determination and that an  alliance with the Zulus was a possibility after the election.    [Viljoen] I am very happy that it will now be possible for  us  to join hands in the future when it comes to negotiating on  principles such as self-determination, and also when it comes to  the improvement of the constitution.    [Theron] The Inkatha Freedom Party's decision to participate  in the election will apparently have an effect on right-wing  groups, which up to now did not want to take part in the  election. The signing of an agreement later this week between  the Freedom Front, the ANC, and the government concerning  self-determination will also probably influence certain  right-wing leaders to support participation in the election.

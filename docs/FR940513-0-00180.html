			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government and rebel forces possess a wide range of sophisticated weapons that potentially could be used to attack overflying civil aviation aircraft at cruising altitudes. These weapons include various surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and antiaircraft artillery. Russian made fighter and attack aircraft, armed with cannons and air-to-air missiles, are also being utilized by government and rebel forces. Opposition forces have attacked Kabul with rockets, artillery, and bombs. Government aircraft have countered with air strikes on rebel airfields and other key facilities. According to press reports, some air-to-air encounters have occurred between aircraft from the Afghan factions and SAMs have been used to target aircraft. Segments of Afghanistan continue to be the scene of factional fighting and consequently pose a threat to transiting civilian aircraft. Fluctuations in the level and intensity of combat create an unsafe environment for any aircraft in Afghan airspace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the stepped-up fighting, advisories have been issued by the governments of Russia and the United Kingdom and by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) urging civil air carriers to avoid Afghan airspace. On January 11, 1994, the Russian Civil Aviation Authority issued a notice specifically advising all aircraft crossing Afghanistan airspace to avoid the Termez-Mazare-Sharif-Kabul air corridor. On January 21, a communiqu&eacute;. was issued by the Coordination Council of the Afghan opposition calling on all international airline organizations to restrict passenger-carrying aircraft from flying in Afghan airspace. On February 22, 1994, the British government issued a notice advising that there may be a risk to civilian aircraft flying along certain air routes in northern and southern Afghanistan, and that British and Hong Kong carriers are now avoiding these routes. ICAO also has issued a directive urging air carriers to discontinue flights over Afghanistan. These notices and the communiq&uacute;&eacute; reflect the violent and uncertain nature of the situation and underscore the danger to flights in Afghan airspace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While there are no indications that any faction in Afghanistan intends to deliberately target civil aircraft, both sides have the capability to do so and such a possibility cannot be ruled out in the current environment. At the very least, central Afghan government control over installations critical to navigation and communication cannot be assured. Use of combat aircraft and SAMs by all factions in the conflict calls into question the security of Afghan airspace for civilian aircraft. It is uncertain how long these conditions will last.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Prohibition Against Certain Flights Within the Territory and Airspace of Afghanistan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of the above information, and in furtherance of my responsibilities to promote the safety of flight of civil aircraft in air commerce, I have determined that immediate action by the FAA is required to prevent the injury to or loss of certain U.S.-registered aircraft and U.S. operators conducting flights in the vicinity of Afghanistan. I find that the current civil war in Afghanistan presents an immediate hazard to the operation of civil aircraft in the territory and airspace of Afghanistan. Accordingly, I am ordering a prohibition of flight operations (excluding those operations approved by the U.S. Government and emergency operations) within the territory and airspace of Afghanistan by any United States air carrier and commercial operator, by any person exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, or by an operator using an aircraft registered in the United States unless the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier. This action is necessary to prevent an undue hazard to aircraft and to protect persons on board those aircraft. Because the circumstances described in this notice warrant immediate action by the FAA to maintain the safety of flight, I also find that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Further, I find that good cause exists for making this rule effective immediately upon issuance. I also find that this action is fully consistent with my obligations under section 1102(a) of the Federal Aviation Act to ensure that I exercise my duties consistently with the obligations of the United States under international agreements. The Department of State has been advised of, and has no objection to, the action taken herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule contains an expiration date of May 10, 1995, but may be terminated sooner or extended through the publication of a corresponding notice if circumstances so warrant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation will generate potential benefits in the form of ensuring that the current acceptable level of safety continues for U.S. commercial air carriers and other operators. The potential benefits of this action will accrue only to those air carriers and other operators currently engaging in overflights of Afghanistan's territory. Since this action is proactive rather than reactive, there are no statistics from which a quantitative estimate of benefits can be derived.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SFAR will impose a potential incremental cost of compliance in the form of the circumnavigation (including the additional time for preflight planning) of Afghanistan's territory and airspace. Based on information available to informed FAA personnel, there are no U.S. air carriers or commercial operators currently conducting revenue flights into Afghanistan. Therefore, these operators will not be impacted by this action. However, there are overflights of Afghanistan's territory by U.S. commercial air carriers. Thus, these operators will be the only entities affected by this action. These operators will incur costs for additional fuel and time as the result of diverting from their normal flight routes over Afghanistan between Europe, Africa, and Asia. Since the FAA does not know at this time to what extent the potential cost of compliance will be, the FAA solicits comments from potentially affected operators. Please provide detailed cost information on the extent the action will impose costs in the form of additional preflight planning and circumnavigation of Afghanistan's territory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> International Trade Impact Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule could have an impact on the international flights of U.S. air carriers and commercial operators because it will restrict their ability to overfly the territory of Afghanistan and therefore may impose additional costs relating to the circumnavigation of Afghanistan's territorial airspace. This final rule will not restrict the ability of foreign air carriers to overfly Afghanistan's territory. Given the narrow scope of this rule, it will not eliminate existing or create additional barriers to the sale of foreign aviation products in the United States or to the sale of U.S. aviation products and services in foreign countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SFAR set forth herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), it is determined that this regulation does not have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (10): Rotterdam hotel impresses The Hotel New York, a new hotel which opened last summer in the 19th century headquarters of the Holland-America shipping company on a stunning waterside site in Rotterdam harbour, is the choice of Stefano Marzano, design director of Philips, the Dutch electronics group. 'It's completely different from any other luxury hotel,' he says. 'It's impossible to go there without thinking of the history of the Holland-America line and of all the people who left their homes in Europe from there to go to a new life in America. You can almost hear their voices in the rooms. 'It's also important because it's the centre of the redevelopment of the Kop Van Zuid area, so it's a real link between Rotterdam's past and its future.'</p>

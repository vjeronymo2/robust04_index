			<p>BFN     [Text] Kishinyov [Chisinau] does not agree that the  withdrawal of the Fourteenth Russian Army from Moldova be  synchronized with granting a special juridical status to  Transdniestria. This was stated by Moldovan President Mircea  Snegur at his meeting with Deputy U.S. State Secretary, Chief  Coordinator on the New Independent States James Collins in  Kishinyov today. Snegur said the issue was being discussed with  Russia.    Snegur stressed that no Russian military base could be  established on Moldovan territory. Information on its  establishment was not more than an allegation by the media, he  added.    James Collins stated that the participation of Moldova in  international organizations and its signing of the NATO  Partnership for Peace program proved once again that the  Republic was moving towards democratization of its society. He  highly appraised the general vision of possible ways of  settlement of the problems in Transdniestria and the centers  mostly populated by Gagauz displayed by the Moldovan leadership.</p>

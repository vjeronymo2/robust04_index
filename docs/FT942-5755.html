			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Fighting spirit roused in Denmark The campaign in Denmark for the election to the European Parliament has turned into a verbal punch-up between the prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the Social Democratic party, and the pugnacious Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the Liberal party and the country's foreign minister from 1982 to 1993. The current slanging match is just a rehearsal for a more important confrontation in the autumn, when a general election to the Folketing will be held, and Uffe, as he is widely known, will be trying to unseat his Social Democratic rival. Mr Ellemann-Jensen has gone out on a limb by proposing that the country should drop the 'opt-outs' from the Maastricht treaty, which Denmark obtained by the Edinburgh agreement in December 1992 (they covered participation in the final phase of Emu, the common defence programme, common legal policies, and European citizenship). The opt-outs were the essential element in a compromise which followed the referendum defeat of the Maastricht treaty in the first Danish referendum on June 2, 1992, and they enabled the government to put the treaty to a second referendum on May 18 last year, when the voters finally endorsed the treaty. The opt-out from the common defence programme, which means that Denmark refuses to become a member of Western European Union, places Denmark in an 'absurd situation', argues Mr Ellemann-Jensen. He urges a referendum now to enable Denmark, which is a member of Nato, to join WEU, and accuses the government of a head-in-the-sand policy on European security, reminiscent, he tells his audiences, of the 1930s, when Denmark met the rise of Hitler by pursuing a policy of unarmed neutrality. Mr Ellemann-Jensen's straight talking appears to be paying off. If the opinion polls are any guide, the Liberal party may win 30 per cent or more of the votes cast and four or five of Denmark's 16 seats in the Strasbourg assembly, compared with the three seats they have in the present parliament. A tough fight for second place is taking place between the Social Democrats, who should retain the four seats they have now by winning about a quarter of the votes cast (much less than the 37 per cent they won in the last general election), and the Anti-European Alliance. This consists of two non-party anti-European organisations, the People's Movement Against the EU, represented with four MEPs in the present parliament, which was founded in the aftermath of the 1972 referendum that took Denmark into the EU, and the June Movement, named in memory of the June 2 defeat of the Maastricht treaty in 1992. The anti-Europeans include members and supporters from all parts of the political spectrum, but their leading candidates, law professor Ole Krarup for the People's Movement and Mr Jens Peter Bonde, a current MEP, for the June Movement, are well known left-wingers. The most colourful candidate is, perhaps, Ms Lone Dybkjaer, fighting on behalf of the coalition government's Radical Liberal party. She is a former minister of the environment and present live-in companion of the prime minister.</p>

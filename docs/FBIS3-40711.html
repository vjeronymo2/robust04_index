Narasimha Rao, and  the External Affairs Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, said here on  Tuesday.    India also offered to train para-medical staff from Gaza and  Jericho town, which had been granted self-rule by Israel and  provide scholarships and seats to Palestinian students in its  universities and colleges.    The Prime Minister in his message here on the occasion of  the  observance of the international day of solidarity with the  Palestinian people, said "we hope that all involved in the  middle-east peace process will seize the opportunity of the  peace accord for the advancement of the cause of peace and for  just comprehensive settlement, which restores to the people  their legitimate rights." Speaking at a function here, Mr Dinesh  Singh said India will offer goods worth $1 million to the  Gaza-Jericho self-government authority.    A team of experts will be deputed to these areas to conduct  feasibility studies for setting up a common facilities centre to  impart training in small and medium scale industries and thereby  generate employment.    Mr Dinesh Singh said the world must face the challenge of  terrorism unitedly.    It is the need of the hour to denounce all forms of  destabilising terrorism wherever it exists, "including  cross-border encouragement and subversive activities from  neighbouring countries." He said the signing of the declaration  of principles on interim self-government arrangements was a  notable first step towards ensuring peace and stability in West  Asia.    India will lend its good offices whenever required towards  confidence building measures in the area, he added.    "We hope that these steps would lead to further positive  developments aimed at achieving the legitimate rights of the  Palestinian people."</p>

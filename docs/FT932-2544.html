			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Fears over Braer oil spill allayed THE Braer oil tanker spill in the Shetlands in January has been less damaging than was first feared, according to a group set up by the government to monitor its pollution effects. The scientists, led by Professor William Ritchie of Aberdeen University, yesterday said their initial findings were 'most encouraging'. They warned, however, that further monitoring was needed into the effects of the 85,000 tonnes of light crude oil which spilled into the sea when the Braer crashed on the rocks.</p>

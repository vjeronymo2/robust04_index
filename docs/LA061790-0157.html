			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENDER FACTOR IN NOVEMBER GOVERNOR'S RACE  </P> <P> The key to the election effort of Pete Wilson may be the lack of support by  Republicans for Propositions 118 and 119.  </P> <P> On the one hand, Republicans need Sen. Wilson as governor to veto the  gerrymandered districts to be engineered by Democrats.  </P> <P> On the other hand, is the desire and need of incumbent Republicans to hold onto  their seats. All incumbents prefer the status quo.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan was scheduled to make a commercial and speak on  behalf of Proposition 119. This did not materialize. Neither did any major  effort to have notable Republicans, other than Charlton Heston, make and air  commercials. On the other side, three Hollywood heavyweights made spots against  Proposition 119 which were constantly on the air.  </P> <P> Did conservative Republicans show displeasure with Wilson as a candidate and  sit on their hands? Will they do the same next November?  </P> <P> Feinstein was reminded often during her primary run that she was a Democrat and  should not speak like a Republican.  </P> <P> It may appear that Wilson may have the same problem from now until November.  </P> <P> HARRY WALD  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

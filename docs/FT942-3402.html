			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Hollow ring in cheers for PM It was probably the worst series of electoral setbacks to hit the Conservative party this century. But if Tory MPs were panicking yesterday, they were keeping it to themselves. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given a louder than usual cheer, backed by mass waving of order papers, as he entered the Commons for question time. But it was not clear whether the good humour was prompted by relief at the party's escape from total disaster in the European elections or acknowledgement that Mr Major needs all the help he can get. There was some griping in private from one or two of the more bitterly estranged right-wingers, for whom the prime minister has become a figure to be removed at all costs. One senior rightwing backbencher said that most Tory MPs had been fooled by Conservative Central Office propaganda into regarding the European election result as a victory. He said the effect was similar to the relief that swept the Conservative party after the 1990 local government elections, when Central Office disguised the scale of Tory losses by hailing the retention of Westminster as a triumph. 'It will disappear by the autumn, and Major will be in deep trouble again,' he said. A prominent Eurosceptic MP also said that he would continue to argue against the Maastricht treaty and further European integration in spite of Mr Major's adoption during the campaign of a more sceptical tone on Europe. But most rightwingers said that pressure on the prime minister would ease because he appeared to be the most sceptical of the available candidates. Most Conservative MPs seemed willing to give the prime minister the benefit of the doubt, even those whose seats in the south and south-west of England are vulnerable to Labour or Liberal Democrat challenges. One west country MP said that he was relieved by Labour's good performance, which he believed might help him to retain his seat by splitting the vote at the next general election. 'I would have been much more worried if Labour voters had gone over to the Liberal Democrats. The biggest danger to me is tactical voting, so if voters are going to stick by their own parties, things are looking up for us,' he said. Other southern MPs drew comfort from the high proportion of Conservative supporters who appeared to have abstained in the European elections rather than switching to the opposition parties. 'We have to do three things: stop arguing about Europe, make a clear commitment to get taxes down, and stop sniping at the prime minister. If we can do that, we can still win the next election,' said one.</p>

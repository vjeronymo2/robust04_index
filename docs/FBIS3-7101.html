The government held a public security-related ministers'  meeting on Thursday and decided to tighten overall security so  that the president can conclude his tour successfully without  worrying about the domestic situation.    Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang presided over the meeting,  attended by nine ministers including Home Minister Choe Hyong-u,  Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui and Communications Minister Yun  Tong-yun.    The government will be on guard against possible terrorist  attacks on public office buildings and foreign missions while  taking steps to beef up national security.    It will also strive to prevent large-scale calamities  including forest fires and traffic accidents.    Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yi will preside over a  security-related ministers' meeting on Friday to check movements  by the North Korean forces and discuss ways to ensure security  during President Kim's absence.</p>

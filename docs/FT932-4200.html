			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / SmithKline sells bodycare brands BRYLCREEM, the preparation which slicked back the hair of pre-war England cricketer Denis Compton, of 1950s teddy boys and the youth of today, is being sold. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, yesterday announced sales of a range of brands for about Pounds 260m. But it said there would be a Pounds 100m restructuring charge set off against the profit on the sales in this year's accounts. SB has agreed to sell Brylcreem - which has expanded to a range of men's toiletries - and other bath and bodycare brands, such as Badedas and Body Mist, to Sara Lee, the Chicago-based consumer products group, for Pounds 211m. It is also selling its hair care brands, including Silvikrin, Vosene and Bristows, to Wella, the German hair care group, for an undisclosed sum. Analysts speculated this was between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m. SB said the deals almost completed its programme of disposals since it was formed through a merger four years ago. It would now concentrate on its prescription and over-the-counter drugs, oral care products such as toothpaste and mouthwashes, and drinks such as Ribena and Lucozade. Mr Harry Groome, head of SB's consumer brands division, said: 'Our goal is to become the world leader in consumer healthcare,' although he admitted this was a 10-year aim. It claims to be fourth currently. SB would pursue its goal through alliances and acquisitions, expanding existing brands and converting prescription drugs to over-the-counter medicines. The business being sold to Sara Lee has assets of Pounds 55m, including five plants in continental Europe, and made trading profits of Pounds 36m on sales of Pounds 164m in 1992. Wella is buying a business with assets of Pounds 5m and sales of Pounds 46m. Mr Hugh Collum, chief financial officer of SB, said the sales would be slightly dilutive in the short term but the payback from the restructuring would be rapid. Sara Lee's household and personal care activity is the smallest of its four main divisions. It combines such brands as Kiwi shoe polish, Sanex skin care, Zendium toothpaste and the Zwitsal baby-care lines, all of which sell in continental Europe. The former SB brands will significantly enlarge the division, where sales and operating profits fell to Dollars 1.23bn and Dollars 107m respectively last year following the sale of an over-the-counter drugs business. Sara Lee said the deal would take it into the German personal care market for the first time, and it expected manufacturing and marketing synegries. Wella said the purchase would more than double its UK market share from 5 to 11.3 per cent. The deal also gives it a strong position in the Middle East. Lex, Page 20: London SE, Page 42</p>

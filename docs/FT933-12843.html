			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Building orders increase by 6% CONSTRUCTION orders jumped by 6 per cent during the three months to the end of May compared with the corresponding months last year, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. Orders also rose by 2 per cent compared with the previous three months. Building industry leaders, however, said the figures belied the extent of the downturn rather than pointing to a recovery in the industry, which was still depressed in many parts. Miss Joanne Cutler, economist at the Building Employers Confederation, said that March had been a particularly good month for orders in the public sector as authorities had rushed to spend their budgets before the end of the financial year. This had distorted comparisons with previous quarters. Indeed the depart-ment's figures showed that orders had fallen in the two following months, said Miss Cutler. Contractors were particularly concerned that the government might reduce public investment on construction as part of its effort to reduce a Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. This would compound recent increases in the price of building materials which were squeezing contractors' profit margins. Government figures also revealed a 13 per cent increase in orders for private housing and a 2 per cent increase in private industrial orders compared with the corresponding months last year.</p>

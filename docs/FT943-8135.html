			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Cyanamid's chemicals unit to stay with AHP American Home Products, the US drugs and consumer products group, said yesterday it had no plans to sell the agricultural chemicals business of American Cyanamid, the healthcare and agricultural products company which agreed this week to be bought by AHP for Dollars 9.7bn (Pounds 6.25m). Mr John Stafford, AHP's chairman, said: 'Our plan is to keep the agricultural chemicals business. It's growing, it's technology-based, which is consistent with our approach to the business. It's really an outstanding business, and will become part of our diversified portfolio.' Mr Stafford also said that there was significant unrealised potential in the Cyanamid unit. 'It has a chemical library of some 300,000 compounds; by using today's technology it can be screened for pharmaceutical uses - that can be an extra plus.' The comments followed speculation on Wall Street that AHP would move quickly to sell the agrochemicals unit once it had completed the integration of Cyanamid's drug business.

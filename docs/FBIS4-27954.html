			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles and editorials published in 4 June ROK vernacular  newspapers on moves toward the imposition of sanctions against  North Korea for its failure to allow the International Atomic  Energy Agency, IAEA, to conduct inspections.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 2 a 1,000-word  article by Pak Tu-sik citing the government's position on  applying sanctions against North Korea. Noting that the  government agreed that it is inevitable to apply sanctions  against North Korea, it continues to express worry about China's  reaction. The article reports that the most desirable way to  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue is for North Korea to  eliminate all uncertainties regarding the nuclear issue on its  own, but notes that it will be difficult to expect that North  Korea will take such an action. The article concludes that the  government hopes that sanctions against North Korea will be  carried out gradually and hopes for an opportunity to resume  talks with North Korea.    CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,200-word article by  Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong citing the U.S.  position regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. The article  explains the background of the decision by the UN Security  Council to consider sanctions against North Korea. The article  notes that the United States is also concentrating on finding  effective ways to take sanctions against North Korea. It notes  the firm U.S. position that it will by no means allow North  Korea to possess nuclear weapons. The article continues that the  United States hopes that China will follow the decision made by  the UN Security Council. The article concludes by noting that  the United States opposes the eight-party international meeting  proposal put forth by Russia to resolve the North Korean nuclear  issue.    CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 700-word article by An  Hui-chang noting the National Unification Board's, NUB, analysis  of why North Korea has let the situation move toward sanctions.  It notes that this may be aimed at achieving a last-minute  victory, realizing that there is still a lot of time before  actual sanctions are applied against North Korea. The NUB  believes North Korea is using the sanctions to secure its system.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 2 an 800-word  article by Chong Pyong-chin on the ROK Government's position.  The article reports that the government has three possible  plans in dealing with the sanctions. The article adds that  these plans must be carried out while keeping the door open for  dialogue. The article notes that apart from the UN sanctions,  the ROK, the United States, and Japan are holding a meeting to  deal with the North Korean nuclear issue. It concludes that in  addition to international cooperation, the government is seeking  various measures to deal with this matter in which the first  stage is to examine the ways to suspend trade with North Korea.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 5 a 900-word  article by Ku Pon-yong on the government's measures to deal with  the sanctions. The article reports the result of the 3 June  coordination meeting of reunification and security officials  dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. It reports the  government's position that sanctions against North Korea are  inevitable. The article notes that if the economic sanctions  are to be effective to make North Korea give up its nuclear  development, China, Japan, and Russia must all participate in  the sanctions. The article expresses concern over the fact that  China must be persuaded to take part in the sanctions because it  is a core variable in the success of the sanctions. The article  concludes that if sanctions are taken against North Korea, it  will suffer greater economic difficulties. Thus it is hoped  North Korea will come forward to find a point of compromise  regarding this matter.    SEOUL SINMUN on page 3 carries a 600-word article by Yang  Sung-hyon urging China to join in the sanctions against North  Korea, and on page 3 a 600-word article by Yi Kyong-hyong from  Washington on the U.S. position on sanctions against North Korea.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 2 a 800-word  article entitled "Will China Join in Sanctions Against North  Korea?". The article reports that even though China is  officially opposed to sanctions, the possibility of its changing  its views for the UN Security Council vote cannot be excluded.    The newspaper also carries on page 3 a 1,000-word article by  Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun entitled "U.S. View  on the North Korean Nuclear Issue." The article reports that a  hard-line view prevails in the United States, a situation that  will test the Clinton administration's diplomatic capability.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a  1,000-word  editorial entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue and ROK-Russia  `Security Partnership.'" The editorial first welcomes the  ROK-Russian agreement on the North Korean nuclear issue and  stresses that "it is important for Russia to demonstrate its  pledge and rhetoric through action."    The newspaper also carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by  reporter Chang Yun-yong entitled "Economic Sanctions Would Deal  a Lethal Blow to North Korea."    The article reports that trade sanctions will cause North  Korea the most enormous pain and that if China, a major food and  energy supplier to North Korea, does not join in economic  sanctions, the effect of the economic sanctions will be less  than expected.    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN on page 3 carries an  800-word editorial entitled "Unpredictable Future of the North  Korean Nuclear Issue." The editorial says that even though  economic sanctions will most likely be pursued, military  threats, including a display of military power, will be stepped  up, and tensions will be further aggravated on the Korean  peninsula as a result. The editorial then asks the ROK  Government not to uncritically follow international trends, but  map out its own countermeasure for this difficult task.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word  editorial entitled "Have Domestic Countermeasures Been Mapped  Out?"    The editorial asserts that a firm security posture must be  assumed and stresses the importance of close cooperation between  the ROK and the United States in coping with the crisis. It  then asks the ROK Government to map out measures to cope with  possible economic sanctions because some domestic businesses are  involved in indirect North-South trade. It also asks the ROK  Government to lead people by assuming a prudent and reliable  attitude and making prudent remarks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd: "Towards a </F> Europe Fit for a Free Britain"]    [Text] Europe affects us directly and crucially. That must  be the starting point. Our security and prosperity depend on  what happens on our own continent. Withdrawal from its leading  institution -- the European Union [EU] -- is the stuff of an  entertaining polemic, but unreal. The real question, and a  vital one for Conservatives, is how to achieve the kind of  Europe we can feel at ease with. We want it to deliver tangible  benefits for the citizen, while respecting the identity and  legitimacy of the nation state. Few people in Britain would  dissent from that.    On June 9 there is a choice between two different ideas of  Europe. The Conservative Party believes in closer European  cooperation. We seek it in order to deliver specific benefits  which are beyond the reach of individual nation states. Unlike  our opponents, we believe that the EU already has the  competences it needs. We are saying that the areas of policy  which go to the heart of the nation state -- like taxes, the  currency, immigration, and foreign policy -- must remain  governed by the national veto. We are clear that Europe is  strengthened by bringing the nation states to work together  rather than by fusing them into a federal European state.    We have had a rough argument inside the Conservative Party  over Maastricht. We differed on whether the Treaty, as signed  by Britain with the opt-outs, was a help or a hindrance to our  idea of Europe. That argument is in the past. I have found in  this campaign, from Aberdeen to Surrey, that when we discuss the  future, the overwhelming majority of Conservatives come  together. For months I have been hopefully predicting this --  so it is a relief to find it coming true!    The Labour and Liberal vision of Europe is different. They  see no objection in principle to further transfers of power to  the centre. Their equivocation over the national veto testifies  to that. The Liberals even reject the Maastricht idea of  flexible cooperation between governments outside the scope of  the European Commission and the European Court of Justice.    The divide over economic policy is also clear. Conservatives  are working for budgetary discipline, deregulation, labour  market flexibility and the lightening of costs on business.  Labour and Liberals are committed to a Social Chapter whose  only certain effect would be to destroy British jobs, along with  a raft of extra spending on proposals which would punish  Europe's taxpayers. The arguments here are familiar from our  own domestic politics -- a choice between jobs and enterprise on  the one hand and socialism on the other. That is what we mean  by Europe -- Right or Left?    One of the odd things about politics is the way an argument  suddenly reaches a wide audience some time after it is first  stated. It is good news that the Prime Minister regained the  initiative for Conservatives with his speech last Tuesday [31  May] about a multi-track Europe. It is a thought which he and  others of us have expounded before. It was a main theme of my  speech at the Scottish Party conference on May 11. It is a  statement of reality.    Britain has troops in Bosnia alongside the French, Spaniards  Dutch and some, but not all, other Europeans. We belong to the  Western European Union -- others don't. Britain is among the  pioneers of a common European foreign policy based on unanimity  and cooperation between governments. Where we can agree, it  makes sense to act together. We do not belong to the Schengen  arrangement on frontiers. We do not belong to the Exchange Rate  Mechanism. We are not committed to a single bank or a single  currency. But we are not alone in any of these positions. This  flexibility is already part of the Europe of nations working  together -- and will be even more so as the European Union  slowly expands to the East.    The next question is: Does the European Parliament matter  enough to vote for? The answer is yes. The Parliament has  important powers to amend EC laws, along with a new blocking  power in certain areas. It has new powers to scrutinise EC  spending, to deal with fraud, to call the European Commission to  account, and to approve its appointment. It must also give its  assent to the admission of new members. We need it to work with  us for the next five years -- not against us, as it does now  with its Left-wing majority.    That means that we need more Conservative MEPs [member of  European Parliament] in Strasbourg. To increase the influence  of the Centre-Right, they are allied -- not joined -- to the  Parliamentary group of the European Peoples Party with which we  see eye-to-eye on such issues as free enterprise, budgetary  restraint, law and order, and the Atlantic alliance. The  arrangement makes good practical sense. But Conservative MEPs  are standing exclusively on our British Conservative manifesto  which explicitly rejects the idea of a federal European state.    There are now unmistakable signs of a shift away from the  centralising consensus which has hitherto underpinned the  Community. This change of climate is becoming apparent across  Europe.    There are several reasons. The influence of the Commission  looks set to wane as Jacques Delors steps down and the member  states reclaim the political initiative. In France and Germany  we are seeing a more assertive mood from national politicians in  response to real public concern about Europe. Chancellor Kohl  explains why it is a mistake to follow the American analogy and  talk of a United States of Europe. The new Italian government  brings a different international pedigree to its attitude to  Europe.    We are already seeing some real change in the way the  European Union works. The number of legislative proposals has  been more than halved -- between 1991 and 1993. The Commission  estimates that 25 per cent of all existing law can now be  simplified or scrapped. Meanwhile, Europe's economic script is  being rewritten around our theme of deregulation and  competitiveness, with Germany eager to claim co-authorship.    So we have everything to gain by arguing from centre-stage.  There is plenty of tough argument ahead. The Commission is  still inserting itself into too many of the nooks and crannies.  The old-fashioned notion that the good European is one who  believes in the constant transfer of power to the centre in  Brussels still holds sway in some political establishments -- as  it does with the Liberal Democrat and Labour Parties here. But  we should not underestimate our influence. We did not win the  battles for the Single Market, budgetary discipline,  subsidiarity, intergovernmental co-operation and EU enlargement  by sulking on the sidelines.    For the next intergovernmental conference in 1996 we need to  work out a coherent framework for an enlarged union -- one which  paves the way for a flexible, multi-speed Europe formed around a  solid core of common policies and rules. This is the only model  which will enable us to build the new democracies of Central and  East Europe into our enterprise.    If Conservatives vote Liberal Democrat or abstain on  Thursday. they may find themselves represented at Strasbourg by  someone working hard for the kind of Europe they most dislike.  Little has ever been achieved for Britain by staying at home.  If, as Conservatives and as a country, we take a robust,  positive and distinctive stand on June 9, that will be an  important advance towards the kind of Europe we want.</p>

According to a target worked out by the provincial  government  for export-oriented economy, the province will earn more than  two billion U.S. dollars from exports this year.    It will also approve the establishment of about 1,500 new  foreign-funded enterprises, and the use of foreign investment is  set at over one billion U.S. dollars. Output value and earnings  from sales for existing operational foreign-funded enterprises  in the province are fixed at over four billion yuan each.    At a provincial economic working meeting held recently, Jia  Zhijie, governor of the province, urged local officials from  relevant departments to seize the current opportunity for  developing the economy and to intensify the opening-up drive, in  order to realize the target for the development of  export-oriented economy in the province.    At present, Wuhan, the provincial capital, Huangshi and  Yichang cities, all on the Chang Jiang River, have been approved  by the State Council to be open cities.    An increasing number of international consortiums and  transnational companies are investing in these open cities, as  the implementation of the state's strategy for opening and  developing areas along the Chang Jiang River and the preparatory  work of the world's second largest dam at the Three Gorges  continues.    To meet the set target of this year, the governor also urged  different localities to strengthen the construction of export-  oriented industries and bases and bring the initiatives of all  sides into play in developing export-oriented economy, ensuring  quick and stable increases in exports.    While drawing up regulations and policies to encourage  development of export-oriented economic activities, different  localities should also broaden the rational use of foreign funds  and strive hard to help the local economy adapt to the  international economy, said the governor.    He also called for the establishment of an authorized  leading  group for the work of developing export-oriented economy and  simplifying procedures of approval for overseas investors to set  up businesses.</p>

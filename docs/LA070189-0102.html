			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bond Appeals Panel's Ruling: Lawyers for Australian millionaire Alan Bond  appealed a tribunal's ruling that said he was unfit to run his nationwide media  network. Bond Media, which runs radio and television stations, applied to the  Federal Court to overturn a ruling by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that  Bond is "not fit and proper" to have a broadcasting license. The ruling, due in  part to Alan Bond's negotiation of a large defamation settlement with a leading  politician and his alleged attempts to cover up that payment, could force the  divestment of a network bought for more than $750 million.  </P></p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Airbus scales back output growth rates AIRBUS Industrie is scaling back its output growth rates for the next three years in response to the continued depressed state of the civil airline market. The consortium is expected to delay the launch of a new 125-seater airliner, the A319, a shortened derivative of the 150 seater A320 aircraft, until later next year. Airbus output will grow from 161 airliners this year to 180 aircraft in 1995 against an earlier target of 220 for 1995. Production will average 14.5 airliners a month next year, up from about 16 a month in 1994, with a further increase expected in 1995, but lower than the original plan to build 21-22 aircraft a month then. An Airbus official stressed the latest revision was not a production cut, but a reduction in estimated output growth rate. The latest cuts are the third downward revision in A320 production schedules. Airbus has sought to play down production cuts in an effort not to undermine market confidence. It constantly monitors the market and adapts its production schedules accordingly. Like other manufacturers, Airbus has been forced to modify its schedules to meet demands from financially-pressed customers to postpone some deliveries. Boeing has cut output of its 737 twin-engine aircraft from 21 to 14 a month this autumn and has announced plans to reduce 757 production from seven to 8.5 airliners a month from September 1993. The latest cuts in Airbus production rates were announced on the eve of the roll-out of the consortium's latest widebody, the A330 twin-engine airliner, in Toulouse tomorrow, expected to be a low-key event, reflecting the general state of the airliner market. Airbus, whose partners include Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace of Germany (37.9 per cent), British Aerospace (20 per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent), said the latest plans envisaged a minimum production of A300/A310 widebodies of 30 a year during 1993-95. A300/A310 output this year is expected to total 47 aircraft. Output of A320/A321 narrowbody airliners will average 80-90 a year during 1993-95. Production of the new A330/A340 family is expected to increase gradually from the present two airliners a month to seven a month by the end of 1995. Airbus had planned to launch the A319, the shortened version of the A320 this year, But the programme is unlikely to take shape until next year.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 LOYOLA BASEBALL PLAYERS HURT IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING  </P> <P> Baseball players Tim Williams and Darren Sugiyama of Loyola Marymount were  injured Saturday night in a drive-by shooting incident. The two, along with  teammate Todd Gates, were driving west on Manchester Avenue from the  Westchester campus toward Williams' apartment in Playa del Rey shortly before  midnight.  </P> <P> Williams said a car began tailgating them, and when Sugiyama changed lanes to  let the car pass, it pulled alongside the passenger side and a shotgun blast  was fired into a side window.  </P> <P> None of the players were hit by the pellets. Williams, a senior all-conference  outfielder and one of the team's top pro prospects, was in the back seat and  was struck by glass from an exploding window. He suffered serious injury to his  right eye and needed emergency surgery to remove shattered glass. The right  lens of his eye also was removed, but can be replaced as an implant after some  healing.  </P> <P> Sugiyama, a sophomore infielder from Long Beach, suffered cuts around the neck.  </P> <P> Gates, a sophomore outfielder from Framingham, Mass., was not injured and was  able to get to a phone and call for help quickly. The players were taken to  nearby Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, where Williams had surgery at 3:30 a.m.  </P> <P> The shooting is being investigated by police, but there are few leads. Williams  described the assailants as three white males and a white female in a blue  Blazer or Bronco.  </P> <P> Williams, an Inglewood resident who was a CIF player of the year at Playa del  Rey St. Bernard High School, was released from the hospital Tuesday. A CAT scan  revealed no glass remaining after surgery. He said he hopes to return to  classes next week, but he will probably miss fall baseball practice.  </P> <P> "Things are blurry but clearing up," Williams said Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The France-Korea  Friendship Association issued a bulletin on June 15.    The bulletin carries articles under the titles "Who  threatens  peace in Asia," "Human rights situation in South Korea," "Arms  dealing and swindler," etc.    The bulletin explains the justness of the principled  position  of the DPRK toward the nuclear issue and stresses that the  aggravation of tensions and disturbance of peace on the Korean  peninsula are mainly attributable to the hostile policy of the  United States and its followers intended to stifle the socialist  system of the DPRK under the pretext of the "nuclear issue."</p>

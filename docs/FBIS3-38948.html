			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, Feb 10 (AFP) -- France late Wednesday [9  February] hailed the NATO decision to issue Bosnian Serbs with a  10-day deadline to withdraw their heavy weapons from around  Sarajevo, saying it was based on its own proposals for action  following the marketplace slaughter.    A statement issued by the French foreign ministry called on  the three warring sides -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- "to pull  back to avoid an escalation" of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "France welcomes the firm and clear decision taken by the  Atlantic alliance which was made necessary it following the  drama in Sarajevo.    "As it (France) proposed, the decision makes demands, fixes  a  deadline and sets out sanctions," the statement said. [passage  omitted]    "France, which is the main contributor of (UN) troops in  former Yugoslavia and notably in Sarajevo, notes the gravity of  decisions taken. It also wants the Bosnian government to trust  that a peace settlement will be put into action."    The ministry also welcomed the willingness shown by the  United States to work with Europe in trying to resolve the  conflict.    The statement added: "This start by the international  community has to be followed through. It must now prove that it  has the same determination to put into effect the decisions it  adopted today (Wednesday).    "France and its European and American partners have to  redouble their efforts in liaison with Russia in order to  rapidly bring about a peace agreement based on the European  Union's plan of action.    "France calls on all parties to pull back within the time  limit fixed by NATO to avoid any escalation and to act  responsibly in the search for a negotiated peace settlement."</p>

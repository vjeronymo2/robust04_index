			<p>BFN     [Text] The Public Relations Office of Surin Province  reported that yesterday officials of military unit 2332, of  Infantry Task Force 23 attached to the Suranari force, were  informed that a group of six Cambodian bandits armed with five  AK rifles and one RPG gun illegally crossed the border to  capture four Thai citizens and take them into Cambodia.    The infantry task force then set up a temporary operations  center to coordinate assistance to the hostages and ordered the  local troops of the Suranari force to search for the bandits.  As a result, the bandits released one hostage to procure 20,000  baht in cash as ransom for the release of the remaining  hostages. Further developments will be reported later.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Resolving a corporate mystery  -A law compelling shareholders to reveal any stake of more than 5 per cent in Dutch companies listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange TO THE delight of Dutch daily newspapers, nearly 250 companies listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange are virtually guaranteed to order extra advertising space in the next few weeks. The advertisments will be used to clear up one of the mysteries of the Dutch corporate world - the precise identity of the main shareholders in the country's bourse-quoted companies. Under a law which came into force this week, domestic and foreign investors have 30 days to register any stake of more than 5 per cent in Dutch companies or investment funds listed on the Amsterdam bourse. Now, they must also notify the companies and the Securities Board of the Netherlands, the regulatory agency entrusted with supervising compliance, whenever their shareholdings rise above or fall below the trigger thresholds of 10, 25, 50 and 66 2/3 per cent. The legislation, which brings the Netherlands into line with a 1988 EC directive, will, for the first time, produce a relatively reliable overview of who owns what in the Dutch corporate sector. (Foreign companies with Amsterdam listings are excluded from the legislation, as are a handful of Dutch companies such as Hunter Douglas, the window-dressing group, which is incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles.) In a country where shares generally take the form of bearer securities, the law may also spark brief bursts of bourse activity as investors react to revelations about company ownership. Until now, it has been possible for an investor to build up a significant stake in a company before announcing its purchases, as Hong Kong-based First Pacific did in May 1991 when it stunned the Dutch market by revealing it had amassed a 43 per cent stake in Interatio-Mueller, the Rotterdam industrial conglomerate. Mr Frank Hoogendijk, chief analyst at merchant bank Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson, said many of the share disclosures would not come as a surprise. Institutional investors such as Internationale Nederlanden Groep are widely known to have 5 per cent stakes in most leading Dutch companies. At the same time, shares in many listed companies, such as brewers Heineken and Grolsch or publisher De Telegraaf, remain concentrated in the hands of the founding families, though the exact percentages are not always publicised. The mandatory disclosures may well affect trading in individual companies, such as insurer Stad Rotterdam, which are often the subject of takeover speculation. 'In the long term, greater openness will be good for the Amsterdam bourse,' Mr Hoogendijk said. Analysts also expect the new law to play a role in the continuing debate on whether Dutch companies should give up some of their extensive anti-takeover protection. Until now, one argument against proposals for reining in a comtors has been that Dutch companies are vulnerable to takeover because they do not know who is buying their shares in the market. Mr Bert Canneman, director-secretary of the Securities Board, expects to receive some 1,200 registrations over the next month from investors whose stakes exceed the 5 per cent minimum. Companies must publish the individual disclosures they receive 'forthwith' in a national newspaper. They are barred from saving them up and publishing them in a single advertisement, though an overview of all disclosures is expected to be released, probably next month. At home seminars for bankers, brokers, accountants and lawyers have been organised to explain the disclosure procedures. Abroad, details have been forwarded to stock exchanges and regulatory authorities, but otherwise no publicity campaign has been mounted. 'We're assuming that the big foreign investors have expert contacts in the Netherlands and that Dutch banks or brokers will alert them to the changes,' he said. Belgium, France and the UK are among the EC countries which already operate a system of shareholder disclosure, as required by the EC. Germany has yet to turn the EC directive into national law, but will probably do so as part of planned reforms of German capital markets. In the Netherlands, disclosure procedures are complicated by the fact that some companies restrict the voting rights of their shareholders. In these cases, shareholders must give details not only of their stake in the company's capital but also of their share of the vote. 'Potential' shares resulting from options or short positions must also be disclosed. The law provides for an exemption if disclosure is deemed 'contrary to the public interest.' However, parliament has made clear this exemption will not apply to the Dutch royal family, often rumoured to hold big equity stakes in companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell and ABN Amro. The popular press has speculated that the law change will force Queen Beatrix to divulge details of her wealth, but few professional brokers believe she holds as much as 5 per cent of Shell, a stake which would be worth more than Fl 6bn (Dollars 3.3bn).</p>

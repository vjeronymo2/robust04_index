			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / US rocket scientist sentenced A LOS ANGELES rocket scientist has been sentenced to 30 months in prison and fined Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 143,000) for selling classified US software used in the 'Star Wars' weapons programme to Japanese and South African concerns, Reuter reports from Los Angeles. After sentencing Mr Ronald Hoffman on Monday, a federal judge freed him on Dollars 1m bail pending an appeal. Mr Hoffman, 52, a former employee of Science Applications International Corp of Century City, California, helped develop the software, known as the Contam System, for the US Air Force. Prosecutors said Japanese companies and South African agents paid Mr Hoffman about Dollars 750,000 between 1986 and 1990 for the technology, which Mr Hoffman had claimed was not covered by US arms export restrictions. The software is used to research and develop the US Strategic Defence Initiative, the so-called Star Wars project aimed at creating an anti-missile space shield.</p>

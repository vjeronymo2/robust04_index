			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow January 3 TASS -- The press secretary of the  Russian president, Vyacheslav Kostikov, answered questions in an  interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday.    Question: What are the main principles and tasks of the  Russian president in 1994?    Answer: The domineering prerequisite of stability in 1994 is  the new Russian Constitution. I would like to point out that  the Constitution is reliably protected by the free will of the  people and that the president, as a guarantor of the  Constitution, has a reliable mechanism for its protection. The  main political task of President Boris Yeltsin is the  realisation of the new Constitution both in the Russian state  system and relying on basic democratic provisions of the  Constitution.    Question: What will the president's relations with the  Federal Assembly rely on?    Answer: In its relations with the Federal Assembly the  president will act in alliance with all political forces  interested in the protection of Russia's interests and the  development of its reforms. The character of this interaction  will depend on an extent to which political parties and blocs  represented in the Federal Assembly show respect for Russia's  constitutional will and on what lessons participants in a  political dialogue learned from past experience.    Rejecting the practice of confrontation, the president is  prepared to take advantage of all powers granted to him by the  Constitution to defend democracy, reforms, Russia's integrity  and stability.    Question: What do you believe to be main priorities of  Russia's state policy in 1994?    Answer: In the economic policy, priority will be given to  strengthening factors of financial stability, curbing inflation  rates, strengthening the rouble and giving support to a sound  industrial base.    In the social policy, the emphasis will be laid on the  protection of the population from criminals and the creation of  fair and worthy conditions for honest and peaceful labour.    Undoubtedly, the Russian foreign policy will lay the  emphasis  on the protection of Russia's national interests, the rights of  the Russian and the Russian-speaking population in the framework  of international law and proceeding from the idea of national  solidarity.</p>

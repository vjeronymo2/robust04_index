			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Updating the 'polluter pays' policy: David Lascelles analyses a report suggesting a fresh approach to easing traffic pollution The environmental impact of Britain's traffic has reached unacceptable levels and action is needed by the government to bring it under control, a recent pollution report says. But Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, said the aim of its report was 'not to clobber the car' or limit freedom of choice when it came to travelling. 'We'd like to see the benefits of the car realised, but with environmental factors more fully taken into account,' he said. This will provide some comfort to the government, which expects the commission's report to provoke strong criticism of its laissez faire transport policy and reluctance to take firm measures to deal with traffic. The 300-page report, to be published at the end of the month, is the result of nearly two years' work by the 16-member commission, which consists of scientists and other environmental experts. It will be making more than 100 recommendations on how to deal with Britain's transport problems. The overall thrust of its recommendations should reinforce the government's commitment to push up the price of petrol and curb the harmful gases spewed out by more than 20m road vehicles. The report's starting point is the government's forecast that the number of vehicles on Britain's roads will double by the early part of the next century. The quantified costs of transport pollution already amount to between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 20bn a year, including Pounds 6bn for accidents. Although the government has a policy of making the polluter pay, the commission has concluded that simple application of this principle to transport will not work. For example, jacking up the price of petrol to a level matching the environmental damage caused by traffic would also severely damage the economy and disadvantage large numbers of Britons such as rural dwellers. 'It has got to be done more intelligently than that,' said Sir John. Instead, the commission will urge the government to set targets for reducing accidents, air pollution and noise. The report also reviews a wide range of fiscal, technical and regulatory measures that might be used to achieve them. Sir John declined to describe the recommendations in detail ahead of publication, but it appears that the report will put forward a package of options for dealing with traffic over the long term. Some will increase the cost of driving, others will aim to raise technical standards of vehicles, and others will put the case for expansion of public transport. There will be a strong emphasis on tax measures, with a doubling of the petrol price over 10 years singled out as a desirable aim. But the commission is also keen to raise the efficiency of the transport sector, and its recommendations will go into the area of traffic management, industrial planning and even home working to find ways of bringing down the number of journeys people and businesses have to make. 'Environmental factors need to be much more seriously considered,' says Sir John. 'People are having to accept transport impinging on their lives in a way they don't like, through air pollution, noise and vibration, and land use.' To reach their recommendations, members of the commission travelled widely abroad - to the US, the Continent and Japan. But Sir John said that no country had found the perfect answer. The US approach was heavy-handed, making excessive use of regulation. Japan had curbed pollution and had a good train system, but its road network was poor. One of the strongest impressions members brought back was of Delft in Holland where 40 per cent of journeys are made by bicycle, even in the rain. Although the commission's report is being awaited with some anxiety by the transport industry, Sir John said he doubted that it would reduce the amount of traffic on the roads; at best it would only slow down its growth. 'It would be unrealistic to expect any measures to reverse the rate of growth,' he said. However he said the commission was looking for ways to have 'a substantial impact' on the pace at which Britain's traffic was increasing.</p>

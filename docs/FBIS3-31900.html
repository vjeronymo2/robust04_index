			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Antonin Baudys by Lubos </F> Palata on 20 February; place not given: "I Was Trying To  Specify the Causes of the War, Says Baudys"]    [Text] Ankara--Defense Minister Antonin Baudys feels that  his initiative differs from the previous plans for ending the  war in Bosnia because he was trying to specify the real causes  of the conflict. "In my opinion, they are ethno-religious  ones," he said in an interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES during  yesterday's flight to Ankara, where he was headed on an official  visit.    [Palata] What is the most important point in your proposal?    [Baudys] The essence of my plan is an attempt to find a way  of ending the war that ensures that the fighting does not break  out again. The means that peace must be associated with  disarmament. All of the warring parties must simply be given  unequivocal guarantees that the conflict will be resolved in  such a way that none of them can feel at a disadvantage. The  solution must be acceptable to everyone; this should be  guaranteed by the states allied with the individual sides in the  conflict. It is important that police units and not troops  provide direct protection.    We do not know the solution to the conflict yet, but we want  to stop the war. The aim of my proposal is to seek a solution  and to give the warring sides guarantees that this will proceed  in a just and responsible manner.    [Palata] Did you consult anyone on your initiative?    [Baudys] I did not consult anyone, apart from a group of my  closest friends, who took part in formulating the proposal with  me. I did not consult anyone in the government, parliament, or  other parties for the simple reason that the decision on whether  this initiative is accepted must be made by those authorized to  do so--the UN Security Council and representatives of the NATO  countries. I did not consider a discussion on the domestic  political level to be appropriate.    [Palata] Do you think that the European Union's peace plan  could form the basis for a solution?    [Baudys] It is certainly a good plan, although I do not have  enough information to be able to say responsibly what is better  and what is not. I submitted this initiative in order to  broaden the spectrum of possible solutions.    [Palata] Disarming the warring sides is the first point in  your plan. How do you intend to achieve this?    [Baudys] My proposal does not envisage disarming the warring  sides in the form of a NATO ultimatum; it banks on guarantees  from the Goodwill Committee and on the agreement of the warring  sides.    [Palata] Should the Czech Republic also take part in the  work of the Goodwill Committee?    [Baudys] I think the Security Council must make this  decision. I do not think, however, that it would be feasible for  the Czech Republic to send its units to resolve this conflict.  The situation may develop the other way round. It may turn out  that my initiative will be rejected because it proves to be  unimplementable. I have merely tried to find a way to a  solution.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aroosa Alam; all quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Islamabad, May 30 -- The ISI [Inter-Services  Intelligence] ISPR [Interservice Public Relations] and Foreign  Office have strongly contradicted the story run by WASHINGTON  POST [WP] and THE GUARDIAN about arming of the Kashmiri  guerrillas by Pakistan Army saying that WP's correspondent John  Ward Anderson did not meet either any official of ISI or top  functionaries of the Foreign Office to discuss any aspect of the  story in question.    Talking to THE MUSLIM here on Monday [word indistinct]  officials of the three organisations expressed their serious  reservations about the contents of the malicious story and above  all about the timing of the publication of the story. The story  has been published around the time the Indian Prime Minister was  in the US and two days before the private visit of the Pakistani  President.    Knowledgeable sources said it was pertinent to note that  WASHINGTON POST's correspondent visited Pakistan in the last  week of March and met only an official of the level of Director  General in Islamabad. The Foreign Minister and the Foreign  Secretary had declined to meet him because of their  preoccupations with important matters.    Intriguingly, the WASHINGTON POST correspondent chose to  file  his story a month and half after his visit. That he had to wait  for such a long time to file his story is indicative of mala  fide [as published] intentions.    According to the report reproduced by THE GUARDIAN in its  issue dated May 17, 1994, Pakistan military sources admit they  have resumed arming, training and providing logistical support  to militants fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir less  than a year after convincing the US they had adopted a hands off  policy there.    The report goes on to say: "The Pakistan Army's  Inter-Services Intelligence directorate -- akin to the CIA --  and its field intelligence unit are coordinating the shipment of  arms from Pakistani Kashmir to the Indian side where Muslim  insurgents are waging a protracted war, the sources said. They  said the Pakistani military was also occasionally helping to  train militants and coordinate their fight against India. India  and Pakistan each control a portion of Kashmir, but each claim  the entire region. Pakistani officials denied any active role in  arming or training militants.    The US considers Kashmir a potential flashpoint for a  nuclear  war. India and Pakistan -- both capable of making nuclear bombs  -- have fought three wars since independence 47 years ago -- two  of them being over Kashmir. "The Pakistani military sources --  including two serving and two recently retired army officials  involved in the ISI's Kashmir operations -- said Pakistan had  suspended active support for the insurgency last year when the  US threatened to include it to the list of countries sponsoring  terrorism. This would automatically have served aid and  business ties between the two countries.    Pakistan then `privatised' its Kashmir operations, funneling  support to militants through non-governmental organisations  often run by retired army and ISI officials, the sources said.  They said that when the US failed to include Pakistan to the  terrorist list, the army resumed its active operations early  this year, although at a reduced level.    "In its annual report on terrorism released this month, the  US State Department confirmed `there were credible reports in  1993 of official Pakistani support to Kashmir militants'. `Many  private organisations also continue to arm the insurgents with  the Pakistani help', the sources said.    Giving his comments on the WASHINGTON POST/THE GUARDIAN  report, a spokesman of the Foreign Office said that though the  correspondent who has filed this report, usually carries  objective reports, unfortunately and surprisingly the report in  question is totally baseless and fabricated. The correspondent  he said, has failed to substantiate his report with  circumstantial evidence.    Except for quoting some unidentified sources, the  correspondent has not mentioned any spot or the name of the  camps where the Kashmiri guerrillas are being allegedly trained  and armed, the Foreign Office spokesman said.    The ISI sources while talking to THE MUSLIM said that the  story is fabricated to the extent that we don't even wish to  comment on it. They, however, made it categorically clear that  none of the foreign correspondents or privately with any of the  officers in the ISI in particular and with army officers in  general.    When the top aides of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto were  asked if there was any change in Bhutto government's policy with  regard to hands-off to Kashmiri guerrillas, they said Ms. Bhutto  has time and again made public statements that Pakistan was only  supporting the Kashmiri guerrillas diplomatically and  politically. They said it is unfortunate to misinterpret the  policy statements of the government. A government acts on the  same policy which it professes publicly.    They said it's a well calculated move to malign a  prestigious, sensitive agency which has effectively checked the  infiltration and activities of RAW [Research and Analysis Wing]  and Mosad agents in Pakistan, particularly in Sindh. The  government sources confirmed that this security agency has  nabbed a large number of RAW agents from Azad Kashmir and Sindh.  They said the lists of these agents would be handed over to the  Indian government when and if required.</p>

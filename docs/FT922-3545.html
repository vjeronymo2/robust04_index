			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Indonesian ruling party keeps power INDONESIA'S ruling Golkar party has retained power with a slightly reduced majority from Tuesday's parliamentary election, with provisional figures indicating that its support has fallen 6 per cent from the 1987 result. Golkar has captured 67 per cent of the 91m votes counted so far, compared to the 73 per cent it won five years ago. About 107m people were eligible to vote and the turnout was expected to be more than 90 per cent. The United Development Party (PPP), a loose coalition of Moslem groups, has taken 17.5 per cent of the vote, up from the 16 per cent in 1987. The nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) benefited most from reduced Golkar support, increasing its vote from 11 per cent to just over 15 per cent. Golkar's clean victory in an election free of violence has been welcomed by Jakarta's financial community. One foreign broker noted that 'the market was especially strong, a clear sign of foreign investor confidence'. With Golkar enjoying almost the total support of the country's 4m civil servants and much of the business community, the election was destined to be a one-sided contest. Mr Rachmat Witoelar, secretary-general of Golkar, admitted: 'There is a distinct advantage of having cadres who are well-off', although he denied that Golkar has spent Rp90bn (Pounds 24m) on the campaign. Golkar won in all of Indonesia's 27 provinces, including the disputed territory of East Timor.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Commercial role for Radio 1 studied THE Radio Authority, which regulates the independent radio sector, is to commission research into the economic feasibility of turning BBC Radio 1 into a commercial channel financed entirely by advertising revenue. The authority disclosed this yesterday in a response to the green paper on the future of the BBC. It also demanded that the BBC be required to transfer to commercial radio some of its existing FM frequency capacity and proposed that the present system of separate regulation of commercial and public-service radio and television broadcasting be ended. The authority said that if any present BBC services were permitted to carry advertising or sponsorship, they should not remain within the organisation. It was unsure of the impact on independent national radio operators of turning Radio 1 into a commercial operation and was commissioning independent research, to be completed by the end of the year. However, the authority suggested that if Radio 1 were to be funded entirely by advertising, it should be subjected to temporary restrictions to prevent it draining revenue from the three planned independent national radio broadcasters. The authority estimated that Radio 1 would need, and could expect, to generate annual advertising revenue of at least Pounds 30m to be commercially viable. At present commercial radio generated Pounds 53m annually from national advertisers. That figure excluded the revenues of the two independent national services so far granted licences, Classic FM and Virgin, which needed together to earn between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m annually to break even. The authority said: 'It is reasonable to assume that the entry of a Radio 1 type of service into the commercial sector would expand the advertiser base of radio and that a commercial Radio 1 . . . would break even within two years.' Soon after that happened, the three independent national services should return to profit. It added that the existing distribution of national FM frequencies unfairly favoured the BBC and damaged the ability of independent national radio to compete. It called for frequencies to be reallocated, but recognised that such a change was unlikely to happen during the existing licences of independent national radio broadcasters. The authority also urged that, in the longer term, BBC and commercial broadcasting should be regulated by the same bodies, one for radio and one for television.</p>

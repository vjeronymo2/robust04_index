			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved higher, but activity was low and there was little real attempt to lead the cash market in spite of the development of a comfortable premium during the afternoon session, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract had reached 3,055 at the close of pit trading, up 19 points. The premium to cash equities was around nine points, or a full four points above fair value. The steadiness of the premium over the cash market was no real guide to trading volume, with contract numbers again falling short of 10,000 in a day that could do little more than consolidate ahead of today's Budget statement. There was a small amount of two-way trade during the morning, which pushed the premium to cash equities down to around two points, but this fizzled out around midday. Wall Street opened strongly, but in the thin conditions the December Footsie future could only drift upwards, with most traders deciding to call an early halt to proceedings. At the 4.10pm official close it was 11 points under its best for the day. Traded options volume was also flat, dipping to 17,732 lots, from 21,025 on Friday. Call and put volume was fairly evenly matched, while FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trades accounted for just over 10,000 contracts.</p>

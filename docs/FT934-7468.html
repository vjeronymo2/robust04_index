			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Storehouse surprises City with rebound to Pounds 11.6m STOREHOUSE, the retail group comprising BHS, Mothercare and Blazer, shrugged off City fears that its recovery might be faltering as it unveiled interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.6m compared with a Pounds 27.3m loss. Both figures were distorted by exceptional items. Last year's was hit by a Pounds 30.4m charge to cover losses on the sale of the Habitat and Richards chains and this year's was depressed by a Pounds 6.4m provision from the sale of the US Mothercare business. Stripping out exceptionals, profits rose almost six-fold from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 18m. The shares, which had fallen after rival group Burton announced disappointing results last week, recovered 17p to 200p. Sales in continuing businesses were up 5 per cent in the 28 weeks to October 9, with operating profits up 45 per cent. Storehouse expected a 'significant' increase in year-end profits. But it warned consumer confidence remained 'delicate and easily disturbed'. Mr Keith Edelman, chief executive, said: 'We are very concerned about the possibility of VAT on children's clothing, which accounts for a quarter of turnover.' Gross margins have also fallen slightly, with the margin at BHS down almost one percentage point as a result of a price promotion, and Mothercare's margin down about one point after a repositioning on price. Total group turnover fell from Pounds 617.4m to Pounds 484.9m, as last year's figures included sales from Habitat and Richards. Sales at BHS increased from Pounds 323.4m to Pounds 337.2m, and operating profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 15.4m. Mr Edelman said BHS was under-represented in many parts of the country and would step up its opening programme. Sales at Mothercare increased 6 per cent to Pounds 140.9m, with profits at Pounds 2.1m, from Pounds 1.7m. Sales improved 6 per cent at Blazer, with losses down slightly. Mr Edelman said One-Up, the discount format which has replaced some of BHS's poorly-performing stores, had traded satisfactorily in its first three months. The interim dividend was unchanged at 2.5p, with earnings up to 1.4p, against a 6.9p loss, after exceptionals. Mr Edelman hinted at a possible dividend rise next year.

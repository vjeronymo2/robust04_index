			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Today is Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev's second day in Tallinn. Estonia has been expecting  this visit to lead to a positive outcome: A clear pledge from  Russia to withdraw her troops from here by the end of August.  [passage omitted]    Now that the Russian foreign minister has met President  Lennart Meri, the Russian side, too, has been emphasizing that  it is necessary to change the level of the talks delegations.    The Russian side's current positions were clarified to  Estonian radio by Galina Sidorova, adviser to Andrey Kozyrev.    [Sidorova, in Russian with superimposed Estonian  translation]  The meeting, which lasted as long as two hours, demonstrated in  the Russian side's opinion that ice has begun to shift. We see  this meeting as a kind of favorable political impetus. One  cannot call it a move forward, though. We have formed the  opinion that Estonia is prepared to display an understanding of  our attitude to the issue of the Russian military pensioners who  live in Estonia. The Russian position continues to be the same:  The military pensioners' issue must be resolved together with  the agreement on troop withdrawal. Russia continues to think  that guarantees for social protection must be extended to all  military pensioners; all military pensioners must be able to  live on an equal footing if they so wish.    Much depends now on the next move, which is the meeting of  deputy foreign ministers as representatives of the two  countries' leaders. Concrete documents would then be under  discussion, and it would become clear to what extent Estonia is  prepared to make concessions. If an agreement is reached, it is  possible that the Russian troops will be withdrawn by 31 August.  I repeat, that is only in case an agreement is reached.  [passage omitted]</p>

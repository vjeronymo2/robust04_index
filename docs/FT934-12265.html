			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: SA apparel group climbs 22% EDGARS, the clothing, footwear and textiles group in the South African Breweries stable, overcame a difficult operating environment to increase attributable profit by 22 per cent to R100.3m (Dollars 23.9m) in the six months to September, compared with R82.4m a year ago. With the market growing during this period at an estimated 9 per cent, Edgars gained market share with turnover growing at 18 per cent to reach R1.65bn, compared with R1.41bn last time. Selling prices, however, were deliberately reduced to compensate customers partially for a 40 per cent increase in the rate of value added tax - to 14 per cent from 10 per cent. As a result, operating profit rose by only 5 per cent to R204.2m, from R194.4m a year ago. Lower finance charges and a drop in the effective tax rate helped boost attributable earnings. The dividend was increased by 18 per cent to 45 cents per share, from 38 cents, on a 20 per cent increase in earnings per share to 195 cents, from 162 cents. Mr George Beeton, chief executive, said assuming that there was no major deterioration in the socio-political environment, sales and profit growth for the full year should match the first half. A divisional breakdown of earnings shows that Edgars contributed R86.1m, compared with R68.6m last time, and Sales House R22.9m, compared to R18.1m. Jet made a R3.2m loss, against one of R4.2m.</p>

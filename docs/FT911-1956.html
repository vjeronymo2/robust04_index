			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (26): Protest vote by miners - An analysis of the so-called Tyminski effect NOWHERE was the so-called 'Tyminski effect' more marked than in the voivodship of Walbrzych, where in some areas more than 40 per cent of people voted for him in both rounds of the presidential elections. In the first round, Mr Stan Tyminski beat Lech Walesa in more than a quarter of the 40 constituencies in the region. The president of the city's public relations office carried out an investigation into who voted for him. 'He found that 80 per cent of those who voted for him were people who had only primary education, or only a technical education,' according to Adam Gierak, a journalist with the left-wing newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza who lives in the area. 'He also found that people who voted for Tyminski often did not have the courage to admit it, or could find no reason to justify it.' Mr Gierak says Tyminski voters could be divided into two distinct groups. The first was people in the worst economic situation, especially miners who have been hit hard by the Balcerowicz plan, and who face likely redundancy. He feels this group voted for Mr Tyminski out of desperation, as a protest, rather than making a positive and constructive choice to do so. The second group was more influential - members of the pro-communist trade union OPZZ, as well as members of the old party nomenklatura, and even secret police. Such people were apparently looking to regain some of their former power, Mr Gierak says, and decided to back Mr Tyminski because they felt he stood more chance of winning the election than the Social Democratic (the former Communist Party) candidate Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz. 'Tyminski said he would come here at 4pm,' Mr Gierak says. 'But in fact he came early in the morning for a secret meeting with OPZZ and former party officials.' Mr Gierak found out about this secret meeting and went along. He managed to tape the opening, before he was discovered, thrown bodily out of the meeting, and locked in a room until the meeting was finished. 'Later in the day, Mr Tyminski had dinner at the home of one of the OPZZ trade unionists,' Mr Gierak adds. 'The neighbours heard about the meeting and gathered outside the house, demanding to see Tyminski. When he came out they feted him like a hero.' Mr Tyminski also held an election rally, which followed the same pattern as those held in many cities in Poland. A frail old lady came forward from the audience, complaining about how she could scarcely afford to live on her meagre pension. She pledged her support for Mr Tyminski, kissing his hands and calling him 'saviour'. A friend of Mr Gierak who was at election rallies in both Walbrzych and Wroclaw, 70 km away, said the same old woman came forward at both meetings. In the second round of voting, however, there was a heavy swing to Mr Walesa, who won every constituency. Mr Gierak says this was due to heavy pressure from the church for people to vote for Mr Walesa, as well as what he calls a 'resurgence of patriotism'. When it came to the crunch, the people felt Poland should be run by a native Pole. He doubts whether there could be a repeat of the Tyminski phenomenon. Were it not for the uncertainty about the future of the region, and Solidarity's failure to come up with a programme of restructuring, he says, most people would probably never have voted for him. In the next election, Mr Gierak believes, the alternatives to Solidarity will be better formed, and be able to present more coherent policies. 'Once a credible opposition emerges, no one will vote for someone like Tyminski,' he says.</p>

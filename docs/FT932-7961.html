			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Serbs confident they can end war and keep spoils: Why the world community is being defied BOSNIAN Serb leaders have triumphantly declared peace, presenting the outside world with the fait accompli of their self-styled state and challenging the west to come up with new peace proposals to replace the Vance-Owen plan, acceptable to the Bosnian Serbs. Despite rifts between Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and his Belgrade patrons, Serb leaders on both sides of the frontier appear to believe that the war is over. Their apparent differences are about tactics to achieve their objectives. In the aftermath of the overwhelming rejection by Bosnian Serbs of the Vance-Owen plan in their referendum last week-end, it is significant that Belgrade has toned down its criticisms of Bosnian Serb leaders. Mr Karadzic is now confident that the west will not intervene against Bosnian Serb targets. He is clearly buoyed by the rumblings of the rift between the US and its European allies over how to handle the crisis, and has even said the Clinton administration would soon publicly back Serbian 'rights' and the 'autonomy of our state'. The Bosnian Serb assembly's announcement on Wednesday that Bosnian Serb forces would cease all military operations in Bosnia comes at a time when they already control 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, compared with the 43 per cent allocated to them under the Vance-Owen plan. The remark by a prominent Bosnian Serb intellectual that 'the remaining (Moslem) enclaves will fall like ripe fruit from the trees' is indicative of the widespread feeling of confidence among the Serbs of Bosnia. In their efforts to carve out a Serbian state, Republika Srpska, Bosnian Serbs have expelled or killed hundreds of thousands of Moslems. 'The decision has been made. The Serbian people never again - not under any conditions - will give up Republika Srpska and the whole world must know this,' Mr Karadzic told the Bosnian Serb assembly. Anxious to persuade the UN to ease sanctions against the remnants of Yugoslavia, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, has endorsed the international plan to divide Bosnia into ten provinces. But he is clearly aware that re-invention of multi-ethnic Bosnia will prove elusive for a fractious international community. If Belgrade has backed the step-by-step implementation of the Vance-Owen peace plan, it has done so on the assumption that it would give time for 'necessary corrections' to be made. In practice, this can only mean territorial concessions to the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Karadzic set out his thoughts on the subject with brutal clarity on Wednesday. A Bosnian Serb state would be willing to settle for a confederation with the Croats and Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina, 'if it makes the job of the international community easier, and if they want to preserve Bosnia-Hercegovina in some form.' Serbian power-brokers have echoed Mr Karadzic's call for peace. Even more telling are the similar statements this week by President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. Serb and Croat leaders have long sought to carve up Bosnia at the expense of the Moslems, the republic's biggest ethnic group.</p>

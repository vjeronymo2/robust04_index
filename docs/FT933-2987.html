			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Consumer goods lift index PRICE RISES for a range of goods including clothes, shoes, furniture, eggs and tobacco were behind a larger-than-expected increase in the retail prices index last month. In the 12 months to August the RPI rose 1.7 per cent from 1.4 per cent in the year to July. The year-on-year figure for last month was the highest since March. Between July and August the index rose 0.4 per cent from 140.7 to 141.3. Of the 14 types of goods and services monitored by the Central Statistical Office in calculating the index, 10 showed a higher year-on-year increase in prices in August compared with July. Between July and last month, prices of clothes and footwear rose 1.5 per cent, the biggest August increase for 16 years. That took the year-on-year change for this element of the RPI to 2 per cent, from 0.4 per cent in July. Household goods including furniture and cookers saw price rises of 1.2 per cent in the month to August, the largest increase for this time of the year since 1979. Pressure on the index also came from a 0.2 per cent increase in food prices between July and August. Petrol prices fell slightly during August, though by less than in the same month last year. This was reflected in overall motoring costs showing a 5.3 per cent increase last month from a year previously, compared with 4.9 per cent in the year to July.</p>

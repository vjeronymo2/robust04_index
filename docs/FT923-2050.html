			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Paisley boycotts talks in Dublin THE REV Ian Paisley and his Democratic Unionist party said last night they would not travel to Dublin on Monday for talks with the Irish government. Mr Paisley returned to the talks on Northern Ireland's political future in Belfast yesterday after a week-long boycott. He made clear, however, that he would not follow the pre-agreed process and cross the border next week. Yesterday's discussions were about the Irish government's territorial claim over Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley withdrew from the talks last week because he felt the constitutional claim was not high enough on the agenda. The Ulster Unionist party will attend the Dublin meeting but it is unclear if Mr James Molyneaux, the party leader, will be in the delegation. The party's decision to go to Dublin has caused a rift between the two unionist parties. The Rev William McCrea, the Democratic Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster, yesterday insisted that all unionists should withdraw from Monday's meeting.</p>

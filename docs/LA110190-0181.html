			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER BENGAL STANLEY WILSON ARRESTED ON ROBBERY WARRANT  </P> <P> Stanley Wilson, banned from the NFL for using cocaine the night before the 1989  Super Bowl game, was arrested Wednesday by Los Angeles Police Dept. detectives  on a warrant for robbery.  </P> <P> Sgt. Roy Langheld of Harbor Division said Wilson was apprehended in Wilmington  after officers stopped him in a car that had been identified by witnesses as  one used during an Oct. 10 purse snatching.  </P> <P> Wilson, who was a running back for Banning High, Oklahoma University and the  Cincinnati Bengals, was arrested last January in Gardena for scuffling with  officers and possessing drug paraphernalia.  </P> <P> Wilson, 28, struggled with drug problems during his NFL career. He missed the  1985 and '87 seasons for violating the NFL's drug policy, and was treated at a  Phoenix clinic in 1989.  </P> <P> Wilson's plight made national headlines after he was suspended from the '89  Super Bowl in Miami, where the Bengals lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 20-16.  In last January's Penthouse magazine, Wilson accused two teammates of joining  him in a pre-Super Bowl drug party.  </P> <P> Wilson could be arraigned as early as today in Superior Court in Long Beach,  Langheld said.  </P></p>

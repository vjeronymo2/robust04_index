			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / UN worried over Serbian plans: Ethnic groups will be split apart if division of Sarajevo goes ahead UNITED NATIONS and European Community officials are increasingly concerned that Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serb community, will press ahead with a plan to divide the besieged city of Sarajevo along ethnic lines. The plan, which the UN and EC have consistently opposed, would involve the transfer of residents into ethnically-homogenous sectors. It would be carried out irrespective of any ceasefire. A green line, modelled on the one which divided Beirut for many years, would run north-south through Sarajevo, with Serb irregulars holding the western half of the city. Much of the recent fighting has been concentrated along the north, centre, and west of the city in what western diplomats say is an attempt to drive out the local population. Dividing Sarajevo, which before Serb irregulars laid siege to it nine weeks ago had a population of 525,000, would mean the mixed ethnic communities of Moslems, Serbs and Croats, and those from mixed marriages who have co-existed for centuries, would be forced to choose which part of the divide they would live in. An estimated 200,000 people have already fled the city. Western diplomats said Mr Karadzic has repeatedly tried to link the re-opening of the city's airport - controlled by Serb irregulars so as to prevent food from reaching the starving people of Sarajevo - with the division of the city. Any such linkage has been repeatedly rejected by UN officials. The UN's primary task in securing control of the airport is to facilitate the unhindered supply of food and humanitarian aid into Sarajevo. 'This plan by Karadzic is sheer madness. We are talking about another Beirut. But Karadzic refuses to let go of this idea. Somehow he sees it as his historical mission, on behalf of Serbs, to divide the city, and give it to the Serbs, even if it means completely destroying large parts of Sarajevo in the process,' a western diplomat said. Mr Karadzic originally drew up the plans to divide Sarajevo on the basis that it would merge with Serb-controlled areas in central and eastern Bosnia. Those areas, which would then be linked to Serbia, which borders with Bosnia-Hercegovina, would form Greater Serbia. He has the full backing of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who, despite his attempt to convince the international community that Serbia no longer supports the Bosnian Serbs, continues to send arms, money, and logistical backing to Mr Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, commander of Serbia's proxy army in Bosnia. Western diplomats say Mr Karadzic will continue to bombard Sarajevo to establish his green line, even if Mr Milosevic drops his Greater Serbia plan. 'The point is that if, and when, all this fighting is over, the desire for revenge among all ethnic groups in Sarajevo, and Bosnia, will be intense,' a senior western diplomat said. 'Karadzic realises this. He knows that those Serbs who participated in the siege of Sarajevo will never be safe to walk the streets of that city again. 'Karadzic also wants the green line for his own security, and for those Serbs who choose to live there, even if that means creating a ghetto, or a kind of east Berlin which will never be recognised by the international community.'

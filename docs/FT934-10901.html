			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Pension fund as financier to public sector deficit Europe's pension funds have neglected to cultivate a powerful democratic constituency which might offer protection against the whims of their political lords and masters. Will they now pay the price? A month ago the trade association for Europe's occupational schemes, the European Federation for Retirement Provision, sent up distress signals from Brussels. The new directive on pension fund investment, progressing slowly through the European Commission, had been hijacked. Instead of delivering the promised freedom of investment policy the directive might impose new restrictions on funds in states where no serious constraints at present exist. Now the British funds are getting into their own domestic panic ahead of the Budget on November 30. The UK's schemes in aggregate represent some 60 per cent of the European total (although the Dutch and Danish funds are bigger in relation to GDP). British funds were already hit for Pounds 600m last March in Norman Lamont's Budget, when he cut the tax they could reclaim on UK company dividends. The initial lack of protest last March, when the pension funds at first dismissed the change as an unimportant technicality, has now made them into a soft target for a second raid. If tax relief on dividend income were totally withdrawn, possibly over two or three years, the eventual annual cost would be about Pounds 2.5bn. Right across Europe, not only are governments reluctant to extend tax reliefs but they see pension funds, where they exist, primarily as vehicles to finance public sector deficits. Hence the row over freedom of investment. Even the normally tolerant Dutch government, which allows private sector funds to invest more or less how they please, has cavilled at the prospective loss of the giant civil servants' fund ABP as a captive bond investor. It is easy for governments to dress up self-interested restrictions on the basis, for instance, that they promote prudence, and therefore protect pensioners. Even Norman Lamont was cheeky enough last March to claim that his dividend tax measures were introduced to help corporate cash flow. The underlying rationale for funded schemes (as opposed to pay-as-you-go alternatives) is, however, that they create an extra flow of capital for investment. This will either raise the domestic economic growth rate or, if domestic opportunities are unattractive, will be channelled abroad and finance a pool of overseas assets. Either way, the burden of paying for future pensions will be reduced. But only in the UK, where 57 per cent is invested in domestic equities and 30 per cent in overseas assets, has this been taken to anything like its logical conclusion. The Germans, true, plough large sums back into company balance sheets through the book reserve approach; but where separate funds exist in Germany they can invest no more than 30 per cent in equities and 5 per cent abroad. But if pension funds buy government bonds there is little long-term justification unless the money is invested in physical infrastructure or, just arguably, human capital. The danger now is therefore that governments will view pension schemes as the convenient dumping grounds for otherwise unsaleable debt. Certainly the Pounds 50bn a year now being raised by the British government is almost entirely absorbed by current spending, with very little investment content. Already, however, there is a larger tax break for UK pension funds on government bonds than on equities, and the pensions directive, as currently drafted, would allow the British government to set upper limits on exposures to equities and overseas assets. Some 23m Europeans are beneficiaries of funded pension schemes. Yet few make any connection between size of their pensions and the regime of regulation and taxation that governs the investment of the assets. It has suited the sponsors to design their schemes so that the members are kept ignorant and passive rather than knowledgeable and potentially troublesome. But will half-hearted lobbying through official channels really be effective when the politicians will respond only to the sight of thousands of scheme members angrily on the march?</p>

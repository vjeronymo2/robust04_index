			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The report by the UN High Commission for  Refugees [UNHCR] that the Rwandan Patriotic Army has blocked the  Rwanda border with Tanzania is baseless and absurd. The UNHCR  has reported that thousands of people trying to escape to  Tanzania are stranded on the Rwandan side of the border with  Tanzania because the Rwandan Patriotic Army has closed the  Rwanda-Tanzanian border at Rusomo. The Rwandan Patriotic Army  has not closed the border and contrary to these reports, more  than 500,000 people have crossed into Tanzania through the  border point at Rusomo within the last three days. [passage  omitted]    As for now, there are no people whatsoever at the Rwandan  side of the border trying to cross into Tanzania. On the  contrary, a number of people who had crossed into Tanzania are  now trying to return home, for the massacres have been stopped  since the arrival of the Rwandan Patriotic Army forces in this  area. [passage omitted] The UNHCR could have been fed with  fabricated and false information by people with ulterior  motives. These could be the same people who had earlier blocked  the entry points into Tanzania, blocking the refugees who were  running away from the massacres committed by the Rwandan  Government forces and this made the refugees easy prey for the  Army and the armed government-controlled militia.

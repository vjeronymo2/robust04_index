			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / As they say in Europe: Small crisis, no one hurt IT WAS a week of unhappy marriages, uncaring spouses and old hatreds rekindled. There was the familiar tale of the ignored junior partner making the kind of fuss that sells newspapers. The Slovaks for years have complained about their richer Czech brethren and last weekend voted for separation, at least. Headlines trumpeted the imminent end of the Czechoslovak state, but crises in that country often mean a good deal less than meets the eye. It was, after all, a 'massacre' in which nobody got killed that sparked off the 'velvet revolution' in which nobody got killed that led to the restoration of democracy and the present difficulties. Slovak editorials after the electoral triumph of the separatists did notcelebrate the demise of the federal state. Narodna Obroda had the headline: 'Keep to the constitution.' This stirring call to arms was followed by a typical outburst of frenzied nationalism: 'In the interests of Slovakia, it would be useful if the policy of the (victorious) HZDS party were based on a positive position. Ability to understand the political implications should be the main criterion for party leader Meciar when it comes to the settlement of the key question of relations between Czechs and Slovaks.' Attention to boring minutiae is a key characteristic of Czechoslovakia. When the communists were in control, there was an enormously popular radio show where listeners answered abstruse questions relating to the law in spite of its irrelevance under that political system. My view that the state will hold together, because the negotiations on how to split it up will last forever, is not shared widely. But, in this part of the world, history hangs like a storm cloud over everything. Outside Germany, nobody reported the traditional Whit Monday event there: the Day of the Expellees. Every year, the victims and their descendants gather to mourn the day of expulsion from the Czech Sudetenland in 1945. The Sudeten Germans had welcomed Hitler's incorporation of the territory into the Reich in 1938 which is why, even in Germany, their plight evokes little sympathy. Germany and Czechoslovakia have signed a treaty designed to heal the wounds of the past and maintain the status quo, which is the last thing the expellees want. At their rally, the premier of Bavaria, Max Streibl, said his Land would not support the treaty which accepts the expulsion as legal. It was, in fact, fairly horrible as Czech feelings were running high at the time. Streibl was accompanied by the federal finance minister, Theo Waigel. The expellees believe they deserve compensation, even the return of their old homes. The tone of this year's rally was not enhanced by attempts to improve relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Fifty participants left the hall when one speaker said that not only the expulsion, but also the horrors of the Nazis, had to be recalled. The Suddeutsche Zeitung, of Munich, said: 'The CSU politicians Streibl and Waigel have rendered a disservice in their dismissive statements about the treaty text which they regard as incomplete. They attack the government for having made a mess of it, and accuse Prague of refusing to make a full reassessment of the past. In the same breath, Streibl said he wanted good relations with Czechoslovakia. But how can anybody trust such a statement when relations are damaged by such Whitsun speeches?' Neue Zeit, of Berlin, remarked that it was lucky Streibl had not spoken before the Czechoslovak elections when he would have given the 'left-nationalists a few more votes.' That would be true in the Czech lands; no German harbours resentment of the Slovaks, and vice versa, which could be important one day. All this shows that no matter where it arises in Europe, any problem is automatically a German problem. But all is quiet on the western front. Page one of Le Parisien on Monday carried the headline: 'It's new: The English love us.' The main evidence for what was meant to be a shock-horror story was that The Times was running a promotion offering readers cut-price French holidays and has tried to impress on the British the delights not only of France, but also of the French] By Wednesday, Le Parisien was apologising to the Queen on her official visit  -describing her programme as 'L'ennui distingue.'

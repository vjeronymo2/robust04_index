Both presidents felt that Hungarian-Polish friendship  could stabilise the Visegrad pact (Hungary, Poland, the Czech  Republic, and Slovakia), and European integration efforts.    On Monday at his residence, President Goncz received the  representatives of Podkowa Lesna town, near Warsaw, which was  one of the main centres of Polish opposition in the 1980s.  Parish priest Leon Kantorski figured prominently in this, and  the Hungarian president presented him with the Imre Nagy  Memorial Plaque. President Goncz presented the Pro Cultura  Hungaria Memorial Medal to the Chairman of the Federation of  Polish-Hungarian Friendship Societies. In the afternoon, the  Hungarian president received Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski.    President Goncz also paid a visit to the Polish Parliament.  He met leaders of the parliamentary clubs, the chairman of the  foreign affairs and economic committees of both Houses, and  members of the Polish-Hungarian group of the Interparliamentary  Union. He said Hungary sees closer cooperation with countries in  the region as vital, with Poland as its closest partner in the  region. The president also valued the Visegrad group, and  thought that the earliest possible introduction of the Central  European free trade bloc is a basic condition of a trade boom.  The Hungarian president then met Jozef Oleksy, marshall of the  Sejm, and with Zofia Kuratowska, deputy marshall of the Senate.</p>

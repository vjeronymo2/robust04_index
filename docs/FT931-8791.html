			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Letter: Subcontractors victims of Dutch auctions Sir, Andrew Taylor's story ('Builders 'forced to bid 10 per cent below cost'', February 9) pinpoints exactly the untenable situation that subcontractors in the construction industry have been suffering for many years. The present recessionary times only make the pain more intense. It is the case that construction companies 'Dutch-auction' their offers for tender to specialist engineering contractors such as members of our association, in order to gain work at a sub-economic price. They then use the subcontractors' money to fund their own deficits. From the Dutch auction process they follow up by forcing through onerous contract clauses, including 'pay-when-paid' terms, late overall payment, withholding of retention money and many other abuses. A recent survey of our members showed that just 257 companies are currently owed Pounds 48m in retention money alone. It is certainly time that these issues were more fully presented to a wider audience rather than the situation that has existed hitherto, where the main players have largely been talking to themselves. It is to be hoped that the government's construction industry inquiry, long germinating, will finally begin its work and, in consultation with all parties, put an end to these practices.

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Major's currency strategy supported SUPPORT for government refusal to devalue sterling was offered yesterday by Mr Paddy Ashdown - but the Liberal Democrat leader called for the policy to be buttressed by the announcement of independence for the Bank of England and an extra Pounds 2bn of public spending. The party believes that an independent central bank, together with a move to the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism and a commitment to European economic and monetary union would enable interest rates to be reduced. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, also argues that adoption of the targeted extra public spending on infrastructure projects would increase confidence in sterling. The infrastructure programme would be financed through public borrowing, as the party does not believe that an increase of that scale in the public-sector borrowing requirement would be unsustainable, given the high present level of private savings. Although that approach is likely to be endorsed with little difficulty in this morning's debate, the party's economic team is braced for criticism that its policy is too rightwing in some respects. Ms Sonia Whitaker, party secretary in Beckenham, said yesterday that during the election Liberal Democrat economic policy had appeared 'Thatcherite' in its emphasis on low inflation, and not enough importance had been attached to measures to create jobs. More sustained dissent is in prospect on the party's approach to privatisation, where its emphasis on breaking up monopolies whether public or private-sector and on developing competition is seen by some Liberal Democrats as being too close to that of the Tories. The consultation paper to be discussed on Wednesday morning asserts that the 'debate between nationalisation and privatisation belongs to history', and argues that policy for the utilities should be based on tightening regulation and improving the services offered to the consumer. Unease among some party members at the relatively neutral attitude towards future privatisations is also signalled by the decision to hold separate votes on the motion's welcome for the franchising of rail services and stations and on its support for the gradual reduction of the price at which the Post Office is able to operate the letter monopoly.</p>

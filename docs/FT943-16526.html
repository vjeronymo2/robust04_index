			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Jett joins battle with Kidder Peabody: Multi-millionaire bond trader sees himself as victim of smear campaign As Joseph Jett sees it, it is largely about race. Two and a half months after he was sacked from Kidder Peabody after allegedly mounting a Dollars 350m (Pounds 230.2m) trading scam, the black trader is beginning his fight back - and out to paint himself as the victim of a smear campaign. 'They depicted me as being an urban black criminal,' Mr Jett says now of Kidder and its parent, General Electric. 'That is something I rail against. I have never in my life attempted to use my race as an advantage. I cannot allow it to be used as a weapon against me  -and that is what Kidder and GE's . . . public relations blitz was.' The continuing saga of Joseph Jett is proving baleful for Kidder. The revelation in April that the firm's profits had been overstated in earlier years by Dollars 350m - fictitious profits that the firm claims Mr Jett conjured up through his bond trading - touched off a deeper scepticism on Wall Street about the security firm's health. That resulted at the end of last month in the departure of Kidder's chairman and chief executive, Mr Michael Carpenter. The Joseph Jett affair is unlikely to end there. He will not discuss the specific allegations that Kidder has levelled against him, but it is clear that the former trader will try to implicate other senior executives. Referring to management oversight of his trading strategy, Mr Jett says: 'Kidder is one of the flattest organisations on the street. The management is direct, it's right there. The things that made Kidder strong - the flatness of the organisation - meant that management had to be involved.' The rise and fall of Joseph Jett is a story with a moral - whatever your point of view. According to Mr Jett himself, an articulate, Harvard-educated 36-year-old, it is all about how powerful corporate interests gang up on an outsider when a scapegoat is needed. Kidder was losing money, and needed to blame it on someone, he says. According to many observers on Wall Street, it is about what happens when an ambitious securities firm with lax controls gives too much power to a trader with a chequered past. Mr Jett was made redundant from two previous trading jobs, yet was made head of Kidder's government bond desk after only two years with the firm. In an interview last week, Mr Jett attempted to dispel such notions. Comparing himself with Mr Mike Vranos, the Kidder mortgage bond chief whose bonus last year topped even Mr Jett's own Dollars 9m, he said: 'If you look at Vranos' progress and you look at mine, there is no difference - except that I'm older and better educated.' In Mr Jett's version of events, he also created Wall Street's biggest trading operation in stripped bonds, the specialised part of the fixed income markets in which he operated. 'No matter what Kidder now says about me, besmirching my name, I took that operation from having 3 per cent market share to I believe close to 40 per cent market share. No institution on Wall Street could do a strip trade without coming through Joseph Jett - no one could. We were that big, we were that powerful.' In such comments, there are echoes of another Joseph Jett - the aggressive, take-no-prisoners trader depicted in a number of reports. But Mr Jett now plays down such characteristics. That depiction - and the racial overtones of the attack - he likens to the case of OJ Simpson, the US football hero charged with murdering his wife. Referring to an infamous magazine cover which has sparked accusations of racism aimed at Simpson, Mr Jett says: 'It's like Time magazine darkening OJ Simpson's face. If you allow it to be said and done, perception become reality. You keep repeating it and repeating it, and all of a sudden it's true.'</p>

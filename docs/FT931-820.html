			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Why overdrafts will cost more - Bank charges OVERDRAFT charges on interest-bearing current bank accounts are being increased, mostly at the expense of those who overdraw without permission. National Westminster, Midland, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Yorkshire have all either increased or announced a rise in charges recently. Some are also restructuring charges. To avoid paying more than you should, it is important to know your bank's charging policy. Free overdraft Some banks are still reasonably generous. Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland offer their interest-bearing current account-holders a free overdraft facility of Pounds 100. Girobank's Keyway (an interest-bearing current account) has a Pounds 20 free overdraft, while you can be overdrawn by up to Pounds 250 for three days without incurring interest or fees with the Co-Op Bank's Ultra interest-bearing account. Overdraft fees Many people overlook the 'handling' fees charged by banks, concentrating instead on the annual interest rate. Banks have moved away gradually from transaction fees - a charge made for each cheque or cash withdrawal during a quarter - in favour of flat fees. Those still retaining the former on their non-interest bearing current accounts are Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Yorkshire. But the flat fees now are mostly charged monthly instead of quarterly and NatWest has announced daily charges as well. While the change favours those who are overdrawn briefly within a quarter, it is more expensive for those who overdraw every month. From June 1, NatWest is to drop the Pounds 23 quarterly fee on its current account for an authorised overdraft and replace it with a monthly charge of Pounds 9. But it also has introduced daily charges of Pounds 3.50 for those who stray above their agreed overdraft limit by more then Pounds 50. This makes it the most expensive high street bank for those who have an unauthorised overdraft for a lengthy period. Barclays Bank has increased its unauthorised monthly fee from Pounds 25 to Pounds 30 while Midland customers holding an Orchard account - the interest-bearing current account - will from May 10 be charged Pounds 17 a month instead of Pounds 15. The monthly fee for those with a prior agreement remains Pounds 7. Midland is also substituting monthly charges for quarterly fees on its non-interest bearing current account. From June 5, the quarterly fee of Pounds 15 for an authorised overdraft will be replaced by a monthly charge of Pounds 7 - a 40 per cent increase for those overdrawn for a few days each month. Those who become overdrawn without agreement will be charged Pounds 17 a month instead of Pounds 39 a quarter - a 31 per cent increase. Yorkshire Bank and Girobank are unusual in charging a flat fee regardless of whether you have an agreed overdraft. The fee is Pounds 8.50 a month (up from Pounds 8 a month since March 15) for Yorkshire and Pounds 11 a month at Girobank. Yorkshire says it regards the difference in its interest rates on the two types of overdraft as sufficient penalty (see table). Interest rates on overdrafts. The table shows the annual percentage rates charged now on interest-bearing current accounts. The APR calculation includes the overdraft fee, but some banks quote only an equivalent annual rate which excludes it. Co-op and Bank of Scotland charge a single interest rate. Co-op says this is because considers all overdrafts above its Pounds 250 overdraft facility as unauthorised. Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland leave the authorised interest rate on their non-interest bearing current accounts to the manager's discretion. Other charges. Banks also will charge for sending out an overdraft letter and for rejecting bounced cheques when a customer is overdrawn without authorisation, although NatWest is removing the charge on such letters after June 1 and Barclays also does not charge. TSB does not send out overdraft letters; it notifies customers of charges at least 14 days before making them.  ------------------------------------ BANK OVERDRAFT RATES  ------------------------------------ Interest-bearing current accounts                      Interest rate  ------------------------------------ Bank of Scotland Authorised               22.2 APR Unauthorised             22.2 APR Barclays Authorised               19.2 EAR Unauthorised             29.8 EAR Co-Op Authorised               31.4 EAR Unauthorised             31.4 EAR Girobank Authorised               19.5 EAR Unauthorised             31.3 EAR Lloyds Authorised               19.5 APR Unauthorised             26.8 APR Midland Authorised               17.4 APR Unauthorised             31.8 APR NatWest Authorised               19.2 EAR Unauthorised             32.9 EAR Royal Bank of Scotland Authorised               19.5 APR Unauthorised             29.8 APR TSB Authorised               18.8 EAR Unauthorised             29.8 EAR Yorkshire Authorised               19.9 APR Unauthorised             31.3 APR  ------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "New Rules To Police Foreign-Asset Cheats"] </F>   [Text] Trade investigators will look into foreign  companies that over-value their joint venture assets under new  rules coming in next month.    The aim is to improve government checks on foreign fixed  asset investment, said the State Administration for the  Inspection of Import and Export Commodities.    Many joint venture investors have cheated their Chinese  partners by supplying outdated, overvalued equipment and  technology .    "By overvaluing their assets, some foreign investors have  been claiming a disproportionately large share of profits, which  are nailed down according to each sides' stated investment," the  administration explained.    Some foreigners were taking the advantage of Chinese  businessmen's lack of knowledge of world markets, the  administration said.    The Ministry of Finance and trade investigators will  determine responsibility for any false investments that they  discover, under the new rules.    And the neglect of duty by government inspection officials  will not go unpunished.    The regulations come under five headings.    They cover the activities of government assessors and the  evaluation procedure.    They also provide guidelines on how to assess the real value  of foreign business investments.    The rules aim to build up a legal system that will protect  the interests of both Chinese and foreign investors, the trade  administration said.    The rapid growth of overseas investment in the country in  recent years has necessitated the new rules.    China has more than 170,000 foreign-invested ventures, with  a  gross investment of $60 billion, according to latest statistics.    More and more foreign investors have been using technology  and equipment as part of their investment to joint ventures.</p>

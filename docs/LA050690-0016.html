			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EDGEMOOR GERIATRIC HOSPITAL IN SANTEE OVERCOMES ITS GRIM PAST  </P> <P> By any standard, 1985 was not a good year for Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital.  </P> <P> The aging Santee facility, under-funded and neglected for years by county  officials, came under the intense scrutiny of the state Health Department's  licensing and certification team.  </P> <P> State officials delivered a scathing critique of the county-run hospital and  slapped it with a string of citations for medical improprieties, among them:  giving penicillin to an allergic patient; roughing up a patient for sleeping  during a meeting; leaving a paralyzed patient unattended in a bathtub. The  patient drowned.  </P> <P> The hospital was on the verge of being shut down.  </P> <P> But today, Edgemoor staffers say the haunting memories of those woeful times  are fading fast. The reason: the arrival of a new administrator and the  infusion of long-overdue county funds that officials say have turned around the  323-bed hospital that houses elderly, handicapped and mentally ill patients who  have nowhere else to turn.  </P> <P> Medical records, once left stacked to gather dust in a corner, are now properly  filed and kept confidential in accordance with state guidelines. A limited  hospital menu that at one time soured appetites -- many residents lost weight  -- now offers a wide selection, with each meal receiving a dietitian's stamp of  approval. Residents, previously left to wilt in their beds, are now encouraged  to participate in physical rehabilitation.  </P> <P> Amid the public outcry that followed the release of the 1985 San Diego County  grand jury report that said it "can find no kind words for the county hierarchy  which has permitted the unwanted to be swept under the rug of isolation at  faraway Edgemoor," county officials hired Florence McCarthy.  </P> <P> Since McCarthy became Edgemoor's administrator in March, 1986, the hospital has  consistently received better marks in the state Health Department's annual  evaluation.  </P> <P> According to state records, Edgemoor received a score of 65 in its January,  1987, evaluation. The tally, in essence, counts deficiencies in a hospital. The  higher the number, the worse the facility.  </P> <P> Slightly more than a year later, in February, 1988, Edgemoor scored a 37. And  in January, 1989, the hospital lowered its score again, to 35.  </P> <P> "The care has been dramatically improved since 1985," said Ernest Trujillo,  district administrator of the state Health Department's licensing and  certification division. The licensing division surveys medical facilities and  evaluates health care practices to ensure compliance with standards set by  Medi-Cal and Medicare. Edgemoor's deficiencies in the mid-1980s almost caused  it to lose federal funds, which pay for the bulk of the hospital's operations.  </P> <P> "The county took some necessary measures, and the change in administration has  allowed Edgemoor to come a long way," Trujillo added.  </P> <P> But maybe not far enough.  </P> <P> Although Edgemoor's medical care is vastly improved, a new county grand jury  report notes that the physical condition of the aging facility -- some  buildings were built in 1929 -- is deteriorating "at an alarming rate."  </P> <P> The report states that "tunnels containing steam, hot and cold water and  hydrant lines to the facility are on the brink of collapse. Sewer lines are in  disrepair and portions of roads around the facility had to be closed to prevent  accidents."  </P> <P> If the building continues to deteriorate, hospital and county officials worry  that Edgemoor may once again be threatened with closure. The county has  financed some repairs, but officials agree that the only way to address all the  deficiencies is to rebuild.  </P> <P> Last month the San Diego County Board of Supervisors took the first tentative  steps toward that goal, outlining a general course for the project, which is  expected to cost $55 million. However, they agreed to wait until October before  determining whether the county should spend money on geologic and architectural  consultants.  </P> <P> "The maintenance costs for a facility that is 60 years old are exorbitant,"  said Paul Simms, county deputy director of physical health services. "We're  talking about replacing entire plumbing systems, electrical systems. We don't  have running water in the wards. The care rendered by the staff is second to  none, but the employees are doing that in prehistoric conditions."  </P> <P> Deteriorating physical conditions have already caused one injury. In 1987, a  boiler room mixing valve that controls the release of hot and cold water  failed. When a nursing assistant turned on a faucet, hot steam came out,  scalding the foot and ankle of a patient who was being bathed. The hospital was  slapped with a major citation -- the only one Edgemoor has received under  McCarthy's tenure.  </P> <P> Although the county's current fiscal crisis complicates rebuilding plans,  concerns about other accidents have intensified county efforts to find money  for a new hospital.  </P> <P> "The prospects of rebuilding Edgemoor look better than they have before," Simms  said. "Through a change in (hospital classification), it is conceivable that  additional resources will be made available so that reconstruction could be  pursued without direct cost to local taxpayers or the county."  </P> <P> For now, however, the county plans to fund construction through a bond  offering, but the funding scheme also includes an $8-million shortfall that  must be covered through donations or funds from other government agencies. This  means the project will need community support to succeed.  </P> <P> Previously, Edgemoor was classified as a skilled nursing facility and received  only $55 per patient per day in Medi-Cal reimbursements. But county officials  argued that Edgemoor provides more complex care, and it recently earned an  upgraded designation entitling the county to receive $149 per patient per day.  </P> <P> Although concerned about the hospital's physical condition, McCarthy -- who has  already overcome many obstacles in steering Edgemoor toward respectability --  remains optimistic. For starters, she is eagerly pursuing the idea of a  fund-raiser to help finance rebuilding.  </P> <P> Tackling problems with such a "rolled-up sleeve" approach is typical McCarthy  management style, but McCarthy acknowledges that, soon after taking over, she  found herself questioning her decision to accept the job.  </P> <P> "The very first day I walked in, I had a visit from the state surveyor (health  inspector), who said, 'I'm really sorry to do this to you,' but then proceeded  to slap me with a $25,000 citation," McCarthy said. The $25,000 citation  stemmed from a 1986 incident in which an elderly patient died after a nurse  inserted a feeding tube into her windpipe, instead of its intended target, the  esophagus.  </P> <P> "Reporters were falling out of trees," McCarthy said of those tumultuous years  when it seemed as if new problems were being uncovered every day. "As you can  imagine, that didn't do much for morale."  </P> <P> And boosting morale is where McCarthy may have had the greatest impact.  </P> <P> Although many credit McCarthy with the hospital's turnaround, she attributes  the improvements to money the county poured into the hospital. Criticized by  the county grand jury and fearing the loss of federal funds, the county spent  about $3 million and added 125 new staff positions in 1985.  </P> <P> Clearly, the addition of dietitians, therapists, physical maintenance crews and  medical records staff helped cure many deficiencies.  </P> <P> But county Supervisor George Bailey adds, "Edgemoor was a mess, and we did give  it extra funds, but what the staff did there . . . well, that kind of  leadership, morale . . . that's something money can't buy."  </P> <P> McCarthy's supporters say her enthusiasm and energy is contagious. Although  McCarthy expects a lot from her staff, she hardly seems demanding. Instead,  supporters say, McCarthy delivers constructive criticism in the form of a  gentle nudge toward better performance. McCarthy's eagerness to share credit  for improvements, supporters say, has also infused the staff with pride.  </P> <P> " 'You're doing a great job, but maybe, if you did it this way, you could do it  even better.' Those are the things I hear (McCarthy) saying (to her staff)  while I'm visiting," said a San Carlos man who regularly visits his 49-year-old  brother, suffering from Huntington's disease. He also credits McCarthy with  implementing an employee-of-the-month program that recognizes outstanding work.  </P> <P> "Things like that may seem like no big deal, but it is," the San Carlos man  said. "It makes everybody try just a little bit harder. And I assure you,  that's appreciated."  </P> <P> McCarthy also boosted staff and residents' morale in 1986, when she organized a  "Senior Prom." Hospital staff, volunteers and community supporters spent months  planning what has become an annual event -- residents are dressed in donated  formal attire and treated to a gala event in the hospital's dining  room-turned-ballroom.  </P> <P> Such events have been instrumental in turning around Edgemoor, which Chuck  Thurman, the hospital's executive housekeeper, says was "atrocious" when he was  hired five years ago to work in the medical records department.  </P> <P> "When I accepted the job, I assumed there was a department to join, but, when I  got here, I discovered that I was the department," Thurman said.  </P> <P> Patients' charts were often incomplete, Thurman said, because the understaffed  nursing corps "was too busy running around taking care of the residents."  </P> <P> No one had time to properly fill out charts, Thurman said. "You can imagine  what kind of trouble that got us into, because unless treatment is documented,  it's assumed that it wasn't done."  </P> <P> Although criticism of medical care was often severe, McCarthy and other staff  members say the problems were not the result of negligence but of an overworked  staff.  </P> <P> "You just ran out of steam," said Mary Kendricks, a 25-year Edgemoor veteran,  referring to the workload during Edgemoor's troubled days. Kendricks, who  worked as a certified nursing assistant, is now a hospital administrator. In  the mid-1980s, Kendricks said one nursing assistant was responsible for eight  bed-ridden residents; now, the staffing ratio is one nursing assistant to four  or five residents.  </P> <P> But hardship also produced some benefits, such as strengthening the resolve of  Edgemoor's auxiliary, a band of 135 volunteers who help provide care in a  number of ways, including wheeling and walking patients, organizing bingo and  sing-alongs and writing letters for residents.  </P> <P> Helen Field, 75, a volunteer for 29 years, proudly states that no one deserted  the auxiliary during Edgemoor's darkest days.  </P> <P> "No one left," Field said. "In fact, it glued us together because we felt that  we were needed more than ever before.  </P> <P> "We have to keep Edgemoor going," Field added, "because one day I may need to  come here."  </P></p>

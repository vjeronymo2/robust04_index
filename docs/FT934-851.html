			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Flagship struggles to stay afloat - Rights issue will not solve all Ferfin's problems Once a symbol of Italy's industrial might, the Ferruzzi-Montedison group is on its knees. The company, which includes the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company and Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, is the country's second-biggest stock market listed group but its unchallenged leader in terms of debt and losses. Ferfin lost L1,667bn (Dollars 993m) on sales of L19,900bn last year. Losses in the first half of 1993 reached L783bn, while group net borrowings stood at more than L22,600bn at the end of June. This week, Ferfin and Montedison launched ambitious rights issues to raise more than L8,000bn in the coming weeks, and possibly almost half as much again in the next 18 months. The deals follow a boost earlier this month, when bankers agreed a controversial restructuring, aimed at reducing interest payments, rescheduling borrowings and converting some debt to equity - which should ease the immediate financial burden. Success, though, is not a foregone conclusion. There is opposition from several leading foreign creditors, and trading difficulties at many subsidiaries, notably chemicals. Ferfin's difficulties stem from over-ambition in the mid-1980s. Managers indulged in acquisitions which switched the company from core activities in farm products and trading to chemicals, cement, insurance and television. Most of the takeovers were financed by debt. While strong profits masked the growing financial burden of the acquisitions, the weight of accumulated borrowings became progressively more evident in the recessionary 1990s. As demand for many of the group's industrial products dwindled and profits no longer covered mounting financial charges, Ferfin's problems reached a critical mass. When severe financial irregularities and evidence of political corruption came to light, the situation worsened. This month, bankers representing more than 86 per cent of Ferfin's debts accepted that L16,200bn of group borrowings should be rescheduled. This will provide a breathing space for the company to reorganise, sell some businesses and put others in joint ventures. The banks agreed to forego interest on much of the group's debts this year and to accept interest payments at below market rates for a number of years thereafter. The complex package also contained a bank guarantee to underwrite this week's rights issues, designed to pay back some loans and provide working capital. However, the capital increases are largely book-keeping exercises, as most of the new cash will be used to repay borrowings. Assuming most of Ferfin's shareholders do not take up their rights, the new shares will end up with the creditor banks, which will in effect have swapped part of their Ferruzzi credits for equity. But while the package means Ferfin's management has now plugged most of the biggest holes, it is too soon to say the group is shipshape. For all its financial ingenuity, the rescue scheme leaves a number of problems. Not all Ferfin's bankers are convinced of the merits of the scheme, which was masterminded by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank. Four leading international banks - Credit Suisse, Union Bank of Switzerland, Citibank and Barclays - refused to accept the restructuring plan and are working on a counter-proposal, which they hope to present shortly. Deutsche Bank, another big lender, was also among the dissidents until the original rescue package was amended. The dissident banks say the Mediobanca scheme does not do enough to protect creditors. They have called for additional asset disposals to raise more cash and make the Ferruzzi empire more manageable. They also complain that, in contrast to normal banking practice, where creditors take precedence over shareholders, Mediobanca's scheme is too generous to the latter, including the discredited Ferruzzis. Such a view has limited influence, as enough creditors have now accepted the revised scheme for it to go through. But foreign critics could still be a thorn in the flesh for Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's chairman. Surprisingly, the greatest risk comes from small banks, which are less concerned about upsetting Mediobanca than multinational counterparts. The recession means Ferfin may take longer to recover than forecast. Mr Rossi argues that most of the group's operations are in profit at the operating level, but show a loss because of interest charges on debts. By rescheduling borrowings or converting part of them into equity, the companies should move into the black, he believes. Such optimism cannot mask the fact that parts of the sprawling empire are in trouble. Stiff competition and falling demand account for the expected L1,050bn loss at Montedison's Montecatini chemicals subsidiary for this year. Ferfin's new management is severely stretched. In effect, the group is being run by a handful of executives drafted in under Mr Rossi. Although he has won praise for his energy and resourcefulness, there are clear physical and legal limits on how long he can continue to act as a virtual commissar. Mr Rossi is a respected law professor, who won his business spurs as a former chairman of Italy's Consob companies and stockmarket watchdog. However, he is fighting on many fronts. Somewhere, he must also find time to run the business. Although he is flanked by a few other top executives, some former managers have been discredited, and the newcomers are having to take on a vast range of responsibilities. Mr Rossi and his colleagues must bear in mind the risk of further skeletons falling out of the cupboard. Milan magistrates investigating the country's political corruptions scandal and the new auditors hired by Mr Rossi have uncovered a byzantine web of parallel accounts in which about L435bn in losses - mostly incurred in commodities trading - have been camouflaged since 1989 by shifting money around obscure subsidiaries which were not included in the group's consolidated accounts. With so many imponderables, the priority for Ferfin is to move fast in order to avoid devouring yet more cash. Costs must be cut, businesses sold and an ambitious chemicals joint venture with Shell signed. That project, codenamed 'Sophia', has been under discussion for months but has still not been sealed. This week's rights issues will lift the immediate financial burden. But Mr Rossi must move decisively to restructure the business and show that it can stand alone.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] NEC has used the Czochralski (CZ) technique to pull  single crystals of the non-linear optics element barium boroxide  (BBO), and has begun commercial sales of BBO single crystals  through NEC Environmental Engineering (Minato-ku, Tokyo). BBO is  the only optics material that can convert visible wavelengths to  the short wavelengths in the ultraviolet region. Using the CZ  method to grow crystals of the low temperature or _b_ phase,  which has this non-linear optics effect, had been considered  nearly impossible, but NEC purified CZ starting materials,  controlled the temperature, controlled the crystal orientation,  etc., to obtain crystals with the same or higher quality than  with previous methods but at rates 20-30 times faster. In the  future the price is expected to drop to about one-third the  present price after mass production technology for making larger  crystals is set up.    In the CZ method for pulling BBO crystals, crystallization  begins in the high temperature _a_ phase if the temperature is  merely lowered. NEC developed the basic technology for  crystallization beginning with the low temperature phase in  1989, and NEC engineers made several modifications to achieve  practical application of the CZ method based on their  development. As a result they obtained BBO crystals 50 long and  15-16 in diameter. For the time being they will offer these  crystals at the price of their least expensive line of previous  BBO crystals. In the future, with the establishment of mass  production technology such as larger crucibles, NEC expects to  lower the price to about one-third the present price.    Associated with this crystal pulling technology they are  using, NEC engineers have made inexpensive, high-quality  starting material by sintering _b_ phase powder obtained by  chemical precipitation, established a technique for _b_ phase  seed crystals that do not change phase even when they come in  direct contact with the melt, and established a technique to  control the melt temperature so that the melt crystallizes at  the _b_ phase from the onset. The engineers have also devices a  method to control melt convection so that crystal orientation  remains consistent during the forming process.    BBO was originally developed in China, and currently several  companies in the U.S. and China manufacture it by the flux  method and sell it. Japan depends on imports from China for its  whole supply. The flux method enables crystals to be grown at  the low temperature _b_ phase by introducing a sodium carbide  flux into the melt. However, this method not only introduces  impurities such as sodium, but crystal growth is a slow 1 per  day, which keeps the cost high.    However, BBO crystals produced by the CZ method are high  quality because there is no flux in the melt, and their optical  properties such as loss of absorption and conversion efficiency  are equal to or better than crystals obtained by the flux  method. Moreover, their threshold value for destruction by laser  is about 30% greater than crystals produced by the flux  method,  and they are not easily destroyed even when exposed to  high-output lasers. BBO can convert the wavelengths of YAG and  argon lasers to one-half and one-fourth, and they can be easily  used in compact UV light generators. We can expect that the  capability of growing high-quality BBO single crystals at low  cost will spur the development of laser UV light generators.</p>

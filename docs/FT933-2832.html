			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: UK and US inflation data prompt wave of selling INFLATIONARY fears, fanned by the latest data from the US and the UK, sparked a wave of selling in the world's bond markets, as investors worried that the bull market for bonds could be nearing an end. Any further signs of a revival in inflationary pressures are likely to prompt more selling, since the bullish tone of recent months has been predicated on low inflation and falling real interest rates. UK GILT prices ended 1 1/2 points lower, as poor inflation numbers and a weak US market combined to drag prices down. 'The market fell a point this morning on the UK inflation numbers and then the best part of a point this afternoon, when the US market showed renewed weakness,' said one trader. 'I think we are seeing a correction. Sooner or later the bull market in bonds will come to an end, and possibly a very nasty end, but all we've had so far is a couple of nasty inflation numbers from both sides of the Atlantic.' The 0.4 per cent rise in underlying inflation in August, to produce an annual rate of 3.1 per cent, up from 2.9 per cent in July, prompted concern that some analysts may have been too hasty in writing off inflationary pressures. Dealers said that prices had been marked down, but there was no wholesale dumping of bonds. However, some signs of currency weakness prompted fears of further sales by foreign investors, particularly as the threat of a public sector wage freeze has prompted fears of a 'winter of discontent' in the UK, dealers said. Long gilt futures on Liffe, London's futures exchange, ended at 111 1/2 , down 1 3/4 points, with record volume of 124,000 contracts. GERMANY and other hard-core European markets held up better. Bund futures fell 0.20 points, while cash prices ended only slightly lower, supported by a generous DM24.4bn injection of liquidity at the Bundesbank fixed-rate repo yesterday. Dealers said the market was also supported by the strength of the D-Mark, which rallied against the dollar. However, the market is not immune from the inflationary fears upsetting other sectors and dealers said that there was no large inflow of fresh funds from other markets. 'The big moment will be next week, when preliminary inflation numbers are released,' said one trader. 'We have heard a lot about inflation coming down and the market wants to see some evidence.' The Belgian bond market also held up well, ending little changed after the central bank cut its key central rate from 10 1/4 per cent to 10 per cent. Dutch bond prices were slightly weaker in low volume. EUROPE'S high-yielding bond markets in Spain and Italy suffered sharp reversals yesterday, amid the general nervousness. Spanish government bonds fell nearly two points, as concern over wage negotiations fuelled inflationary fears. Italian bond prices fell less sharply, but still dropped nearly a point, with worries about the budget negotiations resurfacing. FRENCH bonds dropped half a point, with the market divided over whether or not to hope for an interest rate cut today. Some dealers said they felt Mr Jean-Claude Trichet was unlikely to opt for an interest rate cut on his first day as Bank of France governor. However, other traders said that the market was running out of patience in the wait for further cuts. CONTINUED heavy selling in the wake of Tuesday's worrying inflation news sent US Treasury long bond yields sharply higher yesterday morning, but a strong afternoon recovery helped bring long back below 6 per cent. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down only 3/16 at 103 19/32 , yielding 5.985 per cent. Earlier it had been more than a point lower, with the yield above 6 per cent. At the short end the two-year note was up  3/16 at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.841 per cent. There was no new economic news to affect the market but that did not stop investors at the opening from further selling of longer-dated government securities as the sharp correction following the strong summer rally gathered pace. Unlike earlier in the year, when buyers quickly reappeared after brief declines in the market, retail accounts were initially unwilling buy Treasuries big losses. However, prices rallied later in the day, aided by dealer short-covering and strong demand for intermediate-dated securities.</p>

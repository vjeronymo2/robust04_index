			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pierre Lefevre and Andre Riche interview with Belgian </F> Foreign Minister Willy Claes; place and date not given: "Claes:  Measured Firmness"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H3>  If the Worrying Signs Coming  Out of Russia Increase </H3>   [LE SOIR] The countries of Central Europe are expressing  dissatisfaction with NATO's "Partnership for Peace" proposal.  Belgium has always felt close to these countries. Are you  yourself satisfied with the proposal?    [Claes] Yes, because I do not see any alternative to the  U.S.  proposal. We must continue to reject any fatalistic approach to  Moscow. The immediate integration of several Central European  countries would not only mean redrawing the areas of influence  and a dividing line a few hundred kilometers further east, but  would, above all, amount to an acknowledgement that these  countries are in danger and that they must be protected against  a danger coming from Moscow, and that we do not believe that  those who want to complete the democratization of Russia have  any chance of success. While in fact Russia could be one of the  principal partners in a policy for stability in Europe.    Also, the Polish, the Czechs and others should not believe  that it is sufficient to simply enter the antechamber and wait  for the door to open at a certain moment. It is also up to them  to prove that they are ready to make the efforts, to give the  necessary guarantees to enter gradually into the NATO family.  And from a practical point of view, it would be naive to  believe that it is possible to apply overnight the guarantee of  Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty to an additional four or  five countries. To do so, you must take all the required  military precautions and reorganize NATO. For a number of  reasons, I therefore believe the "Partnership for Peace" to be  the right approach. But this does not mean that the Russians  have a right of veto. Quite the contrary. While, just a few  weeks ago, we gave ourselves quite a lot of time to pursue a  step-by-step strategy towards membership without any fixed  deadlines, if present political developments continue in Moscow  and the worrying signs increase, we will no doubt have to speed  up the move towards integration within NATO of those Central  European countries which satisfy the required conditions.    [LE SOIR] What worrying signs?    [Claes] Firstly, the election results. Then the very clear  attitude of the progressives, Gaydar, Fedorov and others, who  have left the government, not to mention the antics of  Zhirinovskiy. There are also doubts at the economic level. I am  referring to the most recent stance taken by the IMF which has  banged its fist on the table saying that we cannot continue to  apply the programs if the other side do not play strictly to the  rules.    [LE SOIR] Is this a position you share?    [Claes] Yes. There are limits to everything. There is no  point in making great efforts, and I support such efforts, if  there are not the basic conditions guaranteeing a minimum of  success. There is a point at which the IMF must show its teeth.  Then there are the statements made by Mr. Kozyrev, who is in  fact a personal friend. When he speaks of Russia's near abroad  it makes you pause for thought. If you then also take account  of what is happening in Byelorussia, and the election results in  Crimea, you see an accumulation of elements which could result  in a more pronounced destabilization which would oblige us to  speed up the move towards integration within NATO.    [LE SOIR] What could Europe's attitude be toward aid to  Russia?    [Claes] We have adopted a very clear and expansive policy. A  few days before leaving for Moscow on 11 November, we gave a  mandate to the Commission, which was soon to lead to the signing  of a partnership agreement providing very substantial aid and  with the ultimate aim of creating a free trade area. It is not  the Commission's fault that this agreement remains unsigned  today. Like the IMF, the European Union must also demand that  certain principles be included in the agreement, such as the  respect for human rights and regulations prohibiting the policy  of dumping.    [LE SOIR] The Americans are asking the Twelve to further  open up their markets to the countries of Central Europe. Is it  not true that at the same time as it proposes association  agreements, the European Union is closing the door to these  countries' principal exports?    [Claes] The European Union imports 80 times more from these  countries than the United States does. It bears the largest  share, virtually gigantic in fact, of aid for Central and  Eastern Europe. The European Union and the Twelve together  provide more than 70 percent of aid for these countries, Germany  making by far the greatest effort. We don't therefore need  lecturing. Admittedly, for economic reasons, combined with the  very serious recession in the EU with more than 17 million  unemployed, we are still obliged to protect some very sensitive  sectors and products. Go and explain to the workers at Boel  that we must open up our borders to iron and steel products from  the East without any conditions and no antidumping guarantees.    [LE SOIR] Do you not fear that Germany will be tempted to  play a more autonomous role in Central Europe?    [Claes] It is genuinely difficult for Germany to do right.  Either it subscribes fully to a policy defined by the European  Union and it is criticized for failing in its duty as a global  economic power with respect to Central Europe, or it tries to do  rather more and it is accused of drawing back from a commitment  to Europe and carving out a role for itself as leader of  Mitteleuropa. I myself have every faith in the intentions of  German politicians, whether in government or in opposition.  They are true Europeans who have understood that it is  preferable, in order to avoid any risk of history repeating  itself, to further integrate Germany in the construction of  Europe. Also being pragmatists, they have understood that the  challenges are so great that even a giant such as Germany is not  able to confront them alone.  <H5>  Zaire -- Putting the Agreement Into Practice </H5>   [LE SOIR] Does the agreement that has just been concluded in  Zaire mean that there has been a true reconciliation?    [Claes] Unfortunately, it is too early to reply in the  affirmative. We have reached an agreement on the merger of the  assemblies and on the principle of a government of  reconciliation led by a member of the opposition. However, we  have already had so many surprises. We must wait for this  agreement to be put into practice. I hope that this will be  done in the coming days or weeks. If the agreement stands up,  the state of decay in which Zaire finds itself is such that an  extraordinary effort will be needed from the international  community to create the conditions needed just to get things off  the ground in a country which is in the process of falling  apart. The World Bank has just closed its office in Zaire and  the IMF has issued a very clear warning.    [LE SOIR] Is it not a paradox that the international  financial institutions are pulling out of the country at the  very time when things are looking promising again?    [Claes] That shows the despair of these institutions and  this  country's lack of credibility. No one believes in miracles any  more, even if we do need one. Having said that, these  institutions will again be ready to cooperate in seeing that the  agreement is implemented once some concrete evidence has been  put on the table. What I am afraid of is that from the start we  will get caught up in a vicious circle. The authorities in  Zaire are going to demand aid to get the ball rolling again  while the international bodies will firstly ask for proof of  good will and that the agreements will be respected. Belgium  will be called upon to play a leading role, together with Paris  and Washington. We have not reached that stage yet, however.    [LE SOIR] For the time being, has there been any change in  Belgium's attitude?    [Claes] No, none.    [LE SOIR] Were you surprised by the reports issued by the  American State Department and Amnesty International on human  rights infringements in Zaire?    [Claes] No. Belgium generally has reasonably reliable and  authentic sources in Zaire. I find it rather hard to believe  the figures that we have received in certain reports but we are  not surprised by the actual facts of the matter. We have known  for some time that the country is on a slippery slope from this  point of view. That is why, in our declarations, we first  talked of the rights of man even before we could speak of  democracy.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STARS REMAKE FAMINE RELIEF HIT  </P> <P> Pop stars finished a new version of the 1984 hit song "Do They Know It's  Christmas?" early today to raise money for African famine victims.  </P> <P> More than a dozen singers ranging from Australian teen idol Kylie Minogue to  U.S. veteran Tina Turner worked into the early hours to remake the Band Aid  song that topped the charts in Christmas, 1984, organizers said.  </P> <P> The single is expected to go on sale Dec. 11.  </P> <P> The original record raised about $10 million for starving Africans and spawned  other projects including the transatlantic Live Aid rock extravaganza on July  13, 1985, which brought in more than $100 million.  </P> <P> Millionaire pop-record producer Peter Waterman, who supervised production of  the new single at his London studios, said he was considering organizing Live  Aid II next year.  </P> <P> Waterman lined up the pop stars and groups, including Cliff Richard, Chris Rea,  Bananarama, Bros, Jason Donovan and Tears for Fears, after being approached by  Irish rock singer Bob Geldof last week. Geldof, who conceived the 1984 single,  said he is keeping a backstage role.  </P> <P> "The problem (in Africa) is the same, the song is the same, and it's the same  time of year," Geldof said. "The only thing that has changed is the faces in  English pop music."  </P></p>

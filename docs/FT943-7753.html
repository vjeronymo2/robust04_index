			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Minister faces US threat on Graces The Getty Museum in Malibu, California, said last night that it had threatened legal action against the British government in the row over 'The Three Graces'. Mr John Walsh, director of the museum, said he had written a 'forceful' letter to Mr Stephen Dorrell, heritage secretary, complaining about his refusal to grant an export licence for the sculpture. Mr Walsh said: 'At every turn in this sorry saga, our efforts to acquire the statue and to exhibit it to the public have been frustrated by the delays in and working of the export licence system in this case.' The National Heritage Department said last night: 'If the matter goes to court we will defend our position vigorously.' 'The Three Graces' was sold in 1989 after the Victoria and Albert museum in London said the Pounds 1m price was too high. Since being bought by the Getty Museum last year the statue has been awaiting an export licence. The museum is seeking to take the sculpture to California but Mr Dorrell deferred the application earlier this month. British museums are battling to raise Pounds 7.6m to keep the statue in this country, assisted by a pledge of Pounds 1m by Mr John Paul Getty, son of the museum's founder. Weekend FT, Page XX</p>

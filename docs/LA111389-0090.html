			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER RECYCLING PROGRAM  </P> <P> The City Council will consider a proposal tonight to join a comprehensive  recycling program sponsored by the South Orange County Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> The program includes a range of suggestions, including curbside pickup of up to  five types of recyclable material and expanded use of drop-off centers.  </P> <P> In a 60-page study of recycling options, the chamber suggests designating days  for residents to set out different materials, including glass, aluminum and  plastics.  </P> <P> Such a program could be started for as little as $10,000, the study said. A  less expensive option would attach newspaper bins to garbage trucks so the  recyclables could be picked up simultaneously with household waste.  </P> <P> A drop-off center could be launched with $5,000 in equipment and staffing needs  of 30 to 40 hours a month.  </P></p>

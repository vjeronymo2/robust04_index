			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Listing for opencast coal company Rackwood, the Derby-based opencast coal company, is coming to the market via a placing of 9.2m shares which will raise Pounds 2.7m and capitalise the group at Pounds 6.4m. Dealings are expected to begin on January 6. The company sees the forthcoming privatisation of British Coal as an opportunity for growth. Like BC's opencast operations, its business is the identification, development and operation of mining sites and the marketing and sale of the coal produced. Also like BC, it subcontracts the operation of its sites to specialist earthmoving and mining contractors. The company says this enables it to obtain fixed unit costs for various site operations and does not expose the group to risks attached to substantial investment in plant. Rackwood also has contracts to supply more than 500,000 tonnes of coal to the electricity supply industry. It has rights at 10 sites. The majority are in the UK with some in France. One site is in operation and Rackwood expects three others to be operating next year. Rackwood has accumulated losses of about Pounds 750,000 for the three years to last July but says this refects efforts to build up its portfolio. It expects pre-tax profits for 1993 to be at least Pounds 10,000. The issue, sponsored by Greig Middleton, the broker, will leave Mr Max Crosland, managing director, and Mr Dennis Bell, chairman, holding 43 per cent of the enlarged capital. The prospectus shows that Mr Bell was fined Pounds 10,000 in connection with a breach of the exchange control act 1947 after exporting Krugerrands to France.</p>

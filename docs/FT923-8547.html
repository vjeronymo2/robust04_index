			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Escom abandons plan for Dollars 150m Eurobond SOUTH Africa's rehabilitation in the international financial markets suffered a setback yesterday, when Escom (South Africa's Electricity Supply Commission) abandoned plans to launch a Dollars 150m Eurobond in September, as investor appetite for the offering has evaporated due to political uncertainty over the country's future. Instead, Escom will raise funds to refinance a maturing bond issue in the domestic market. Less than a year ago, the South African government returned to the international markets after a six-year absence, launching a DM400m five-year bond issue arranged by Deutsche Bank, the first international bond offering by a South African borrower since 1985. In March, the South African electricity utility returned to the market with a DM300m five-year deal, sold mainly to retail investors in continental Europe. The new deal would have been the first of the recent batch by South African borrowers to be denominated in dollars and so would have needed a stronger institutional investor base. Following the African National Congress's suspension of talks on a multi-racial constitution in June, after the Boipatong massacre, millions of its supporters last week took part in a two-day general strike. 'When conditions are right, we will be back in the international market,' said Mr Mick Davis, executive director, finance at Eskom. Bankers said that before the recent setbacks to political process in South Africa, Escom would have expected to pay a premium of 200-250 basis points over the US Treasury yield curve. Meanwhile, activity in the Eurobond market was subdued. The latest variation on the recent flurry of floating-rate notes with minimum and maximum coupon levels was provided by Deutsche Bank Finance, which launched a CDollars 100m issue of floating-rate notes due 2002, arranged by Deutsche Bank.</p>

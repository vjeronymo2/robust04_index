			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> MAKING SENSE OF LIVE CREW FUROR;  </P> <P> CENSORSHIP: A CONTROVERSIAL OBSCENITY RULING NOT ONLY SEEMS MISGUIDED BUT MAKES  STARS OF AN UNDISTINGUISHED RAP GROUP.  </P> <P> The lesson of the 2 Live Crew case, once again, is that censorship doesn't  work.  </P> <P> In declaring the group's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album obscene, U.S.  District Court Judge Jose Gonzalez has turned what was a mostly undistinguished  and relatively underground act into the most famous attraction in rap. And he  did it virtually overnight.  </P> <P> 2 Dull Crew has in the last 10 days become 2 Lucky Crew.  </P> <P> Gonzalez's ruling won't be any more effective in protecting public morals than  moves in the '50s that resulted in hip-swinging Elvis Presley being shown only  from the waist up on the Ed Sullivan television show or the Rolling Stones in  the '60s having to change the words of "Let's Spend the Night Together" to  "Let's Spend Some Time Together" for the Sullivan show.  </P> <P> Both of those measures, which curbed actions or language that now seems almost  quaint, only heightened the appeal of the two acts.  </P> <P> In the case of 2 Live Crew, the courts will undoubtedly overturn the ruling at  some point. In the meantime, 2 Live Crew is certain to sell several hundred  thousand more copies of its "Nasty" album because of the curiosity stirred up  by the judge's decision and subsequent arrests of two group members and a  record store owner.  </P> <P> Even before the Gonzalez ruling, 2 Live Crew -- thanks, in considerable part,  to the notoriety surrounding two earlier albums -- had generated sufficient  interest to sell 1.7 million copies of the "Nasty" album.  </P> <P> While the threat of legal action is keeping the album off the shelves in  hundreds of record shops, there are plenty of copies available. In fact, each  of the dozen record stores questioned this week in the Los Angeles area  reported a dramatic increase in requests for the album -- but most of the  stores were temporarily out of stock.  </P> <P> Imagine the advance orders for the group's cleverly titled and timed follow-up  album. Due July 4 from 2 Live Crew: "Banned in the U.S.A."  </P> <P> What will the curious find in the "Nasty" album?  </P> <P> For one thing, all the "dirty" words that have apparently shocked the judge and  detractors.  </P> <P> But the album, which comes with a warning imprinted on the cover that there is  "explicit language contained," mixes its exaggerated, no-words-spared tales of  sexual fantasies and a contemporary hip-hop music style with a degree of  artistic ambition and imagination -- however shallow -- that lifts it beyond  the typical X-rated adult-bookstore fare.  </P> <P> "Nasty," in fact, combines two pop culture traditions: the suggestiveness of  rock 'n' roll and the bawdy humor of "party" or "stag" comedy albums.  </P> <P> Sex was part of rock culture even before Elvis shook his hips. Some of the most  celebrated of the mid-'50s, R&amp;B novelty hits that led to the birth of rock  featured songs built around sexual innuendo.  </P> <P> If anyone at the time doubted the real meaning of "Work With Me Annie" (a song  recorded by Hank Ballard, who would later write "The Twist"), the mystery was  solved with Ballard's follow-up single, "Annie Had a Baby."  </P> <P> 2 Live Crew, in keeping with the easing of restrictions against sexual images  and activities in film and print since the '50s, offers the sex without the  innuendo, thereby connecting with the X-rated comedy of such personalities as  Redd Foxx and Eddie Murphy.  </P> <P> The showdown that led the judge in Florida to declare the "Nasty" album obscene  -- "an appeal to dirty thoughts and the loins, not to the intellect and the  mind," Gonzalez wrote in his 62-page opinion -- easily could have been handed  down two years ago.  </P> <P> All the crude four- and five-letter words and sound bites of women simulating  sexual ecstasy that are found in "Nasty" were also present in 2 Live Crew's  second album, "Move Somethin'."  </P> <P> Most of the lines in the song, "S &amp; M," contain the usual sexual  expletives, words that are beyond the bounds of what can be printed in a  mass-circulation newspaper such as The Times.  </P> <P> One set of rhymes, which can be printed, raps about a woman who supposedly  wants to be treated like a "sex slave":  </P> <P>  I can see it in your eyes  </P> <P>  The devil's deep inside  </P> <P>  You're a masochistic freak  </P> <P>  In disguise.  </P> <P>  Depending on one's attitudes and sensibilities, the song -- with its satanic  references and brutal images -- can be seen as encouraging unhealthy sexual  activities or it can be seen as mocking sadomasochistic fantasies.  </P> <P> Two other tracks on the album are clearly humorous in design and work off two  classic, mid-'60s rock hits, Manfred Mann's "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" and the Kinks'  "All of the Day and All of the Night."  </P> <P> The words to "One and One," which uses the Kinks melody, is in the playful,  nursery-rhyme style of such Chuck Berry hits as "My Ding-a-Ling" and "Reelin'  &amp; Rockin'."  </P> <P> While some "One and One" lyrics, too, are unprintable, others give a direction  of the song -- and the level of 2 Live Crew's humor:  </P> <P>  One and one  </P> <P>  We're havin' some fun  </P> <P>  In the bedroom  </P> <P>  All day and all of the night.  </P> <P>  Two and two  </P> <P>  I took off my shoes . . .  </P> <P>  Three and three  </P> <P>  She undressed me . . .  </P> <P>  Four and four  </P> <P>  We f----- on the floor  </P> <P>  In the bedroom  </P> <P>  All day and all of the night.  </P> <P>  Most of the songs, however, are more hard-core, language-wise, than "One and  One." "Nasty" continues with more of the same.  </P> <P> Little, if any, of the three 2 Live Crew albums is any more sexually arousing  than a comedy routine. Its value -- however measured -- is in its humor. You  either laugh or you don't.  </P> <P> Gonzalez didn't laugh, presumably, and he doesn't believe anyone else should  even be allowed to hear it.  </P> <P> It's fine if he is trying to save everyone from wasting their money on the  album, but he's dealing with Constitutional rights.  </P> <P> There have been charges of racism in the attack on "Nasty." Why declare obscene  2 Live Crew, whose members are black, and not Andrew Dice Clay, who is white  and whose frequently raunchy albums sit side by side 2 Live Crew in some  stores.  </P> <P> There also have been fears raised in the pop community that the obscenity  decision is a reaction to growing pressures for some type of control over  recordings.  </P> <P> But the whole incident could just be simply a series of freak circumstances --  the right crusader stumbling onto the right sheriff and then the right judge.  </P> <P> Under the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court guidelines of the Miller v. California  obscenity test, something can be declared obscene only if it is patently  offensive to community standards, appeals primarily to prurient interest and  lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.  </P> <P> The 2 Live Crew "Nasty" album clearly has some artistic ambition, which alone  should be enough to keep it from being declared obscene under the Supreme Court  test.  </P> <P> But it's even more remarkable that the issue has gotten this far when one  considers that the judge's decision was handed down in a community where sex  shops carrying hundreds of X-rated videos and magazines rub shoulders with  topless bars and strip joints.  </P> <P> If anything, the album probably would be dismissed as too tame by those who  frequent adult bookstores.  </P> <P> The country can get along without the 2 Live Crew albums, but not at the price  of a compromising the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment.  </P></p>

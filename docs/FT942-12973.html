			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Sears returns to the black with Pounds 138.3m: Group raises dividend by 5%; Shares fall on profit-taking Sears, the retailing group that includes names such as Wallis, Selfridges, Dolcis and Olympus, confirmed its place in the ranks of retail recovery stories yesterday with a return to full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 138.3m after a Pounds 47.8m loss. It said that trading in the first 11 weeks of the current year was 'satisfactory', with like for like sales growth - which excludes store openings and closures - ahead of the 3.6 per cent achieved in the second half. The dividend was raised for the first time in 18 months. The shares, however, closed down 8 1/2 p at 123p. Analysts said brokers had been profit-taking after the shares had risen sharply in recent weeks. 'There is a good story here,' said Mr Nick Hawkins, retail analyst at Kleinwort Benson. 'They are making progress across all the divisions.' Last year's loss was after Pounds 106.8m of exceptional items, while this year's profit was boosted by Pounds 13.9m of profits on the sale of Sears investment in Aspreys, the jewellers, and the realisation of its investment in Satellite Information Services. But underlying trading profits increased 23 per cent from Pounds 100.5m to Pounds 123.6m. Group turnover increased 3.8 per cent from Pounds 1.93bn to Pounds 2.01bn, while the net margin was lifted from 5.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent. Mr Liam Strong, chief executive, said reshaping of the group was largely complete and efforts would be channelled into improving efficiency, boosting sales densities and reducing markdowns to drive net margins higher. The footwear division recovered from a Pounds 14.4m loss to a profit of Pounds 33.7m. Like-for-like sales increased 2.9 per cent, although total sales fell from Pounds 552.2m to Pounds 547.4m after the group closed 88 stores. In the high street fashion division, which includes the childrenswear, sports and leisurewear and womenswear businesses, trading profits improved only slightly from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 30.7m, although sales increased from Pounds 570.2m to Pounds 660.7m. Like-for-like sales fell 3.5 per cent in childrenswear reflecting strong competition, but in the sports and leisurewear business, which includes Milletts, the Olympus high street and Olympus Sportsworld chains, like-for-like sales increased 3.3 per cent. The womenswear business, in- cluding Wallis, Warehouse, Miss Selfridge and Richards, saw like-for-like sales increase 2 per cent. Profits at the home shopping division Freemans increased from Pounds 23.3m to Pounds 30.8m, in spite of a fall in sales from Pounds 539.9m to Pounds 519.5m and a Pounds 5.5m charge - the result of closing Dutch mail order operation ter Meulen Post. The final dividend was lifted 7.2 per cent to 2.68 per share, taking the total to 3.68p - an increase of 5.1 per cent. Earnings were 6.9p per share, after a loss of 4.6p a share last year.

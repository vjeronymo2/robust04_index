			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COUNTY NEED FOR ADDED DEPUTIES  </P> <P> The Orange County Board of Supervisors recently postponed the approval of more  deputies for South Orange County.  </P> <P> This area has had phenomenal growth in the past five years, while the number of  deputies for the area has remained constant.  </P> <P> The supervisors didn't hesitate to approve development in South Orange County,  but now hesitate to allow residents in this area to have equal protection  afforded to the area.  </P> <P> One has to wonder if the county board is not a puppet of developers. Voters  should remember this when the time comes to make changes.  </P> <P> JAMES SOCHA  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

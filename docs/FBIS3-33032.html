The coalition of guerrilla organizations did not provide  details of the alleged military plans but said they are  displaying "the absence of political will at the military staff"  regarding the next round of peace negotiations scheduled for  March.    While accusing the Army of seeking a "military solution" to  the Guatemalan crisis, the URNG reiterated "only through  negotiations can a firm and lasting peace with social justice be  built in Guatemala."</p>

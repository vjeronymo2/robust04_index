			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated  that the UN secretary general's recent Cyprus report shows that  the organization lacks the patience necessary at this time, when  the Turkish Cypriots are making sacrifices toward an agreement.  Cetin said that the report will not help secure an agreement on  the confidence-building measures [CBM] package.    Cetin held a news conference in Moldova, where President  Suleyman Demirel is conducting an official visit, and assessed  the report. TRT correspondent Kemal Gungordu reports from  Kishinev:    [Begin recording] [Gungordu] Cetin stated that it is unfair  and unjust for the United Nations to blame the Turkish Cypriot  side for not having political will. Cetin stressed that in this  way, the United Nations is striving to avoid and rid itself of  the issue. Cetin continued:    [Cetin] It is obvious that such an approach will not  contribute to a positive development regarding the Cyprus issue.  The United Nations, which is in no hurry to reach decisions on  Bosnia-Herzegovina and other places in the world where bloody  incidents are taking place, took a harmful course when it issued  this report without awaiting the conclusion of the CBM talks in  Cyprus, which had embarked on a favorable course, and thereby  failed to exhibit even the patience necessary for a solution.    [Gungordu] Noting that this is his initial assessment of the  report, Cetin added that he will have a more detailed  announcement to make once he reviews the particulars of the  report. In answer to a reporter's question, Cetin noted: I  must admit that the UN secretary general has failed to fulfill  his goodwill mission with this report. In the report, Cetin  noted, the UN secretary general creates the impression, without  actually naming names, that he blames the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus [TRNC] for being the party that is not  interested in conciliation. Pointing out that in his report,  the secretary general mentions the impossibility of making  changes in the CBM's, Cetin added: They, however, are the ones  who made the changes.    Explaining that the CBM's were put forward on 1 July 1993,  Cetin recalled that President Rauf Denktas had announced his  acceptance of the package. Indicating that the package that  emerged on 21 March, when the talks started, differed on five  basic points from the secretary general's initial package. Cetin  continued:    [Cetin] One of these points was related to the map of Maras  [Varosha], the second to arrangements regarding access to Maras,  the third to establishing two separate customs at Lefkosa  [Nicosia] Airport and to the landing of Turkish planes, that is  to say, TRNC planes. All of these points, which were under  consideration were changed in the document they put forward on  21 March, and all of these changes are in the Greek Cypriot  Administration's favor. Actually, they are the ones who made the  changes.    [Gungordu] Cetin reiterated that the TRNC submitted  legitimate requests when confronted with changes that favored  the other party. Pointing out that the TRNC requests were  discussed in the Vienna talks, where certain arrangements were  formulated, Cetin added:    [Cetin] This report was released when the discussions were  continuing. It is clear -- and this is pure speculation and is  not based on anything concrete -- that when it became obvious  that the items agreed on in Vienna would probably be  unacceptable to the Greek Cypriot side and before that point was  reached, it was decided to issue this report, which portrays the  TRNC as the side not interested in conciliation. This is  totally unjust and unacceptable. [end recording]</p>

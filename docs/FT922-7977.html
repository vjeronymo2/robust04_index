			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: BBL advances 5.6% at halfway BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), Belgium's second largest bank, yesterday announced a 5.6 per cent rise in net, unconsolidated profit to BFr2.4bn (Dollars 72m) for the six months to March 31 this year. BBL also said Credit Communal may take a 10 per cent stake in the bank. Credit Communal is one of a half dozen public institutions which the Belgian government has recently attempted to revitalise. Credit Communal has pursued a more aggressive strategy than the others in linking up with private sector banks. BBL said it would explore the 'potential synergy' between the two banks. The operating results at BBL improved by 17.4 per cent over the past six months. At the same time, however, it said it was increasing provisions by 20 per cent to BFr4.9bn, in order to cover higher risks arising from lending to the former Soviet Union.</p>

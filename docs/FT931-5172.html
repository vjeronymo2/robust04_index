			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Labour query on Crescent oil group MR ROBIN Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, intends to ask in parliament this week whether Crescent Petroleum, a private oil company based in Abu Dhabi, has been breaching government sanctions against Iraq, Robert Taylor writes. The Office of Foreign Assets Control in Washington and a number of US senate committees are investigating the activities of Crescent Petroleum in the United States. Mr Cook wants to know whether Mr Michael Heseltine's department is inquiring into the company's affairs in Britain. The owner of Crescent Petroleum, Mr Hamid Jaffar, has a brother, Mr Jaffar Jaffar, who was the head of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme and a deputy minister in the Iraqi defence ministry. Before Iraq's invasion of Gulf Kuwait in 1990 Crescent Petroleum was planning a downstream petroleum venture with the Iraqi government.</p>

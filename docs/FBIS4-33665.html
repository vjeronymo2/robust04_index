			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Caribbean Common  Market (Caricom) spoke out today in favor of stronger sanctions  against Haiti to force the military to step down. It also  stated it would approve an invasion to reestablish  constitutional order.    Grenadian Denneth Modeste, president of the OAS Permanent  Council, said "no course of action against the de facto  government led by General Raoul Cedras can be ruled out." The  possible military operation would have the approval of all  Caricom member countries, Modeste affirmed. Modeste is  participating in the 24th General Assembly, which will continue  until 10 June in Belem, the capital city of the northern  Brazilian state of Para. He recalled the U.S. military invasion  of Grenada in 1983 "helped democracy."    Foreign ministers and representatives of 34 American nations  rejected the Haitian military government's provisional president  and announced a strengthening of economic sanctions against the  Caribbean nation. The assembly approved a resolution presented  by a special commission of OAS foreign ministers on 7 June.    The ministers reaffirmed their decision "not to recognize  the  authority of any acts executed by the de facto regime, including  the illegal appointment of a provisional president on 11 May  1994." The document calls for the organization's member nations  to suspend all commercial flights to Haiti and comes one day  after receiving approval from the United States for the measure.  It also calls for the beginning of radio broadcasts in Creole  beamed at the island.    The sanctions approved by the international organization  include a trade embargo, the freezing of the military regime's  assets, and the end to international financial operations with  Haiti. These measures are a response to a military coup that  occurred on 30 September 1991, led by Gen. Cedras, that toppled  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from power.</p>

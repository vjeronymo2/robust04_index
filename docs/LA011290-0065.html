			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MARRY ME A LITTLE': SONDHEIM TUNES FOR STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT  </P> <P> When this production of Stephen Sondheim's "Marry Me a Little" opened in San  Francisco (to a healthy run at the Zephyr Theatre), the Chronicle's Gerald  Nachman called it "more than a revue and not quite a musical."  </P> <P> It can be one or the other.  </P> <P> "Marry Me" concerns two lonely people in separate but adjacent Brooklyn  apartments, spending a forlorn summer Saturday evening bemoaning their  singularity. They never meet, except in their fantasies. The only plot line is  the intermingling of those fantasies and the realization that they probably  will never say hello to one another even as they pass in the hall.  </P> <P> What makes it almost a musical is the couple's byplay as they hear each other  moving about in their reveries to Sondheim's bright, clever songs, all rejects  from other Sondheim scores. What makes it almost a revue is lack of linear  connection between the songs.  </P> <P> Directorial concept is all in "Marry Me a Little," and Art Manke leans heavily  toward the revue format at the Coronet. His couple (Cynthia Gates and Kevin  McMahon) actually see one another and are constantly aware of each other's  presence. The only time the sense of their never meeting occurs is at the  opening, as they arrive home from shopping, at the generic apartment that  serves them both (Manke also designed the clever setting), and near the end of  the show's 75 minutes, when she hears his shoes drop above and he hears her  anger below as she slaughters roaches in her sink -- an ongoing New York  battle.  </P> <P> Otherwise, they watch each other move around the apartment and, when the songs  dictate, face front like the troupers they are -- Sondheim in revue.  </P> <P> As revuers, Gates and McMahon are charming and handle with enthusiasm the ins  and outs of Sondheim's melodies. Lem Jay Ignacio's keyboard accompaniment is a  little plonky (Barry Lloyd is musical director) and sometimes overpowers the  vocalists, but they manage to hold their own most of the time, particularly in  Gates' bawdy "Can That Boy Foxtrot" and McMahon's "Uptown, Downtown" and a  couple of the more rousing duets.  </P> <P> Without the effect of the Man and Woman never seeing one another, dancing  together without touching and without acknowledging each other's presence, the  sum of this "Marry Me," is less than its parts, those wonderful Sondheim tunes  saved from oblivion by Craig Lucas and Norman Rene (who created the original  production). This staging is for Sondheim fans only, who want to relish the  sound of his genius, even in outtakes.  </P> <P>  At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd.; Wednesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; Sunday  matinees, 3 p.m.; runs indefinitely. Tickets: $17.50-$20; (213) 659-2400.  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading TURNOVER in the derivatives market rose sharply in a volatile session as dealers hedged positions ahead of next week's election, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, trading in the June contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,430, down 43 from the previous session, as dealers reflected on Tuesday's opinion polls indicating a Labour party lead, and on the overnight fall in Tokyo. However, June was soon back in favour following a bout of bear closing and recovered to stand at 2,444 by mid-morning. A poor Wall Street opening caused the contract to once again retreat, before rallying in the final stage of the session on renewed closing of short positions. June finished at 2,446, the high of the day, down 27 from Tuesday's finish and around 12 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 28. Turnover was a hefty 9,197 contracts. On the LTOM, volume was also heavy, reaching 40,111 contracts by the close. The FT-SE option had a total of 23,911 lots transacted, one of the clearest signals of the hedging activity in the market. Trade in the stock options was, however, muted. Lonrho was the day's top stock option with 1,518 lots dealt, followed by BT with 1,024.</p>

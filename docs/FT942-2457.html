			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Devonport dockyard to make 850 redundant Devonport Management, which operates the Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth, said yesterday that 850 workers were to be made redundant. Four hundred of the job losses are to reduce overheads in support operations. The remaining 450 jobs will go because the yard has insufficient work on surface ships to maintain the workforce. Yesterday's announcement followed the loss of 1,000 jobs on Thursday at two other military sites in the south-west - RAF Chivenor in Devon and the Royal Navy Engineering College, also in Plymouth. Mr Peter Whitehouse, Devonport's business development director, said the decision to allocate a large body of surface-ship refit work to Rosyth in Fife had left Devonport short of surface-ship work. He added that the company was dependent on winning the refits of HMS Birmingham and HMS Cornwall next year to maintain the reduced workforce of 3,500. Devonport said it could not rule out compulsory redundancies because it needed to maintain high-tech skills in refitting ships and nuclear submarines. 'We are approaching a critical mass below which we will be unable to retain the capacity for surface refit work,' added Mr Whitehouse. Dr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, condemned the job losses and called on the government to plan defence expenditure so that companies had time to adjust to the reduced work available. 'There is a lack of co-ordination which means that managements cannot plan their businesses,' he said. 'The government has exacerbated a difficult situation by leaving defence cuts to the market.' He said there was worse to come when the defence cost review was completed in July. 'Some 25,000 jobs will go when the Front Line First cuts are completed,' he added. Mr Jack Dromey of the TGWU general union called on the government to support conversion of naval dockyards to civilian work. He added: 'The markets are out there, the only question is whether it goes to Britain or our competitor yards in the US or the Pacific Rim.' Devonport insisted that it had tried to win civil work, including the 12 British Steel Challenge yachts, and that 20 per cent of its work now came from non-naval work. But it added that the markets were very competitive and slow to build up. Mr Dromey said the dockyards were shedding labour while the Ministry of Defence was prepared to pick up the costs before they were privatised in 1996. The MoD said that commercial decisions on the workforce in the dockyards was a matter for the managements involved.</p>

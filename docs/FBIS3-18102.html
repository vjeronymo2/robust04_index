Yeltsin made no more than a passing  reference to the amnesty granted by the people's representatives  to his adversaries who he had ejected by force from the  parliament building last October.    But he was clearly aware of which way the political wind has  been blowing since the elections and referendum on the  Constitution, which he called in December. Yeltsin used some  very strong language in connection with the West and seemed  determined to build on the success he scored in Sarajevo.    Yeltsin believes that the world is going to have to take  account of a strong and self-confident Russia. The sometimes  large numbers of Russians living in the former Soviet republics  -- where they have often become a minority group suffering  discrimination at the hands of the ruling elite -- are to be the  principal initial point of focus for his policy.    The right to intervene, which Yeltsin is loudly claiming is  reminiscent of Leonid Brezhnev's declared right to intervene in  Central and East Europe in order to safeguard orthodox Communist  regimes. Yeltsin is even trying to present his ideas as  humanitarian intervention in aid of the oppressed and victims of  human rights violations.    The danger of Yeltsin's stance is that he apparently  considers that he can unilaterally decide on the need for such  intervention and that other countries must simply accept it.    This reasoning will no doubt cause concern in a number of  the  republics concerned. There are still some 20,000 Russian troops  in the Baltic states. In Ukraine too, there is unease at the  prospect of Russian interference. By contrast, other republics  -- such as Georgia and Tajikistan -- are seeking closer ties  with Russia.    In the West, Yeltsin's statements will lead to an increasing  awareness that the time of a submissive Russia is now past,  especially in the area of defense. Yeltsin also issued the  threat that the expansion of NATO without Russia's agreement  would constitute a threat to world peace. In this respect,  Yeltsin is probably not calling for an express right to  intervene, but rather something which amounts to the right to  veto any proposed NATO enlargement.    If Yeltsin's words are understood to be more than an attempt  to take the wind out of the sails of the ultranationalist  Zhirinovsky, then they represent a degree of danger.    In the economic sphere too, Yeltsin seems to want to set a  more resolute course which is less in line with the West. His  priority is to be the fight against inflation. He confirmed  that he would continue with economic reforms. But in the same  breath, he also stated that the state must play a more active  role in the economy, and that industry must support the reforms  and ensure that they are made more bearable for the people. But  how can he prevent the government from allocating the massive  aid it has promised to state-owned industries and the central  bank from financing the deficit by printing more money?    This first state of the nation address by Yeltsin is not  good  news for the West. Ordinary Russians have long since lost all  faith in the words of politicians. And it is far from certain  that his strong words are strong enough to make the opposition  more cooperative.</p>

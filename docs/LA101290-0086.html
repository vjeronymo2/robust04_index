			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RUSH-HOUR ACCIDENTS SNARL SAN DIEGO FREEWAY;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC: IN ONE OF THE FOUR CRASHES, A CAR WAS CRUSHED BENEATH A GASOLINE  TANKER TRUCK. THE DRIVER ESCAPED WITH ONLY MINOR INJURIES.  </P> <P> Four separate accidents on the San Diego Freeway, including one in which a  tanker truck crushed a car, shut down the southbound lanes for more than an  hour Thursday morning, jamming rush-hour traffic throughout the northern San  Fernando Valley, the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> In the most spectacular accident, a car traveling south near Roscoe Boulevard  veered out of control about 6 a.m. and struck the front wheels of an empty  gasoline tanker truck. The car was dragged under the trailer and was partially  crushed beneath the back wheels.  </P> <P> "It was really remarkable, amazing," CHP Officer Dave Grajeda said. "This car  was pretty much smashed with the truck wheels on top of his car, but this guy  was able to sit in his vehicle while he was being rescued."  </P> <P> The driver, David P. Schmidt, 47, of Muskogee, Okla., was conscious during the  hourlong rescue and at one point offered to try to crawl out of his Dodge Aries  rental car, Sgt. Richard Barton said.  </P> <P> Schmidt received only minor cuts and bruises. He was taken to Valley  Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys and was released after treatment.  </P> <P> The accident, which involved two other cars, shut down the southbound lanes  from 6 a.m. until 7:15 a.m., backing up both the San Diego and Simi Valley  freeways. The drivers in the two other vehicles were not injured.  </P> <P> The three other accidents, all within a mile of the tanker crash, snarled the  freeway during the morning rush hour from Victory Boulevard to beyond Roscoe  Boulevard. Surface streets were also clogged, the CHP reported.  </P> <P> In one collision, a Los Angeles Unified School District trash truck lost  control and overturned when it swerved to avoid slamming into a lane of  slow-moving cars, Barton said. The truck driver was not injured.  </P> <P> The other accidents were minor collisions and the drivers were not injured, the  CHP said.  </P> <P> "When there is one big crash, everyone is in a hurry to get to work and they  are not really paying attention," Grajeda said. "Everything kind of all fell  apart out there this morning. It was a real mess."  </P></p>

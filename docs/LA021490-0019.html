			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING  </P> <P> If the environmental status does not disgust anyone enough to do something  about it, one should think about the world our children (and their children)  will be living in -- if it still exists. Recycling is a step in the right  direction.  </P> <P> The United States throws away enough aluminum to rebuild our entire commercial  air fleet every three months. We also throw away enough paper annually to  construct a 12-foot wall from Los Angeles to New York. Glass is also often  thrown away. The only way to solve these problems is to recycle. This way we  could cut down on waste products and also save money. The opportunity for every  individual to recycle is a bright spot in our ailing environment.  </P> <P> JENNIFER TRACEY  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

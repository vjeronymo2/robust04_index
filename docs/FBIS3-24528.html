The mutant  gene was then introduced into plasmid pLT21, constructed by  recombination of plasmid pLT18 with phage M13LT2. pLT21, with  the lymphotoxin gene controlled by tandem constitutive T7  coliphage promoters, was employed in the transformation of E.  coli SG20050. Ultrasonication of the transformed E. coli cells  and successive chromatography of the supernatant on  DEAE-cellulose DE-52 and hydroxyapatite yielded 5.6 mg of the  recombinant protein per 3 g of wet cells. Cytopathic activity of  the preparation on L-929 murine fibroblasts was on the order of  5 x 10E7 U/mg protein. Figures 3; references 24: 9 Russian, 15  Western.</p>

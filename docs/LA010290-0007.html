			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATORS PROBE SCATTERED EXPLOSIONS  </P> <P> At least five explosions rocked scattered sites in San Diego early New Year's  Day, breaking windows at a neighborhood market, scattering customers at a bar  and destroying a residential mailbox, among other damage.  </P> <P> One person suffered minor injuries in the blasts, the Fire Department said.  </P> <P> Authorities said it was not clear whether there was any link between the  explosions, which varied considerably in intensity and occurred intermittently  during an almost six-hour period.  </P> <P> Police and Fire Department arson experts were investigating.  </P> <P> At least five explosions were confirmed, but authorities said there may have  been additional blasts. Information on some of the incidents was still sketchy  late Monday.  </P> <P> The first explosion occurred at 12:49 a.m. at the Lancer's cocktail lounge on  Park Boulevard in North Park, police said.  </P> <P> According to an employee, someone tossed an explosive device through the side  door of the bar, stunning the 60 or so New Year's revelers present. No one was  injured, said the employee, who added that it took 20 minutes for the smoke to  clear.  </P> <P> At 1:12 a.m., Fire Capt. William Middleton said, a pipe bomb exploded in the  3200 block of Myrtle Avenue in the City Heights section. The powerful blast  blew the glass out of doors and windows at the Park Villa Market.  </P> <P> At 3:38 a.m., Middleton said, explosives destroyed a mailbox in the 1000 block  of 30th Street, scattering mail on the street. U.S. Postal Service officials  were investigating.  </P> <P> Shortly after 6 a.m., a device -- evidently a large firecracker -- was set off  near a downtown bench on C Street where a man was apparently sleeping. The man  received minor injuries, Middleton said.  </P> <P> San Diego police also reported a loud explosion at 1:04 a.m. in the 4000 block  of Alabama Street in North Park, but no other details were available.  </P></p>

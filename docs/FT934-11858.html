			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Ford expects sharp fall in output FORD OF Britain has warned that it expects a sharp fall in vehicle production in the UK. The warning came yesterday as it offered a two-year pay deal - a 1.8 per cent rise from next month and 2.5 per cent next year. The company, which has lost more than Pounds 1m a day since 1990, is seeing a small upturn in UK demand but that is more than cancelled out by a decline from continental Europe. Ford told unions that vehicle production in the UK was expected to fall to 392,000 this year from 447,000 last year, with the percentage for export falling from 34 per cent last year to 19 per cent this year. Ford management rejected the unions' claim for a 'substantial' pay rise and a formal job security package, and hinted that the company's practice of avoiding compulsory redundancy might have to be abandoned. It also said that it wanted to reduce lay-off pay by 20 per cent. At present workers laid off receive full basic pay, which cost the company Pounds 35m in 1991 and last year. Mr Jimmy Airlie, motor industry negotiator for the AEEU craft union, said: 'We're bitterly disappointed that they could not respond to our proposals on job security. If it's good enough for Toyota, Nissan and Rover then it should be good enough for Ford.' The unions said they expect an improved offer when they meet again on November 11. But the company will be reluctant to move further especially as it now feels it paid too much in the two-year deal to next month. Union officials took some consolation from the company's offer of greater employee participation in the company pension fund. Ford estimates that the overcapacity in the European car industry by the late 1990s will reach 7m units. Ford itself is now using only about 70 per cent of its European capacity and market share in the UK is continuing to fall to about 21.7 per cent.</p>

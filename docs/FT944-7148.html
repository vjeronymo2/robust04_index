			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading With Wall Street out of action for Thanksgiving, stock index futures drifted for most of the session, moving modestly higher in low trading volume, writes Jeffrey Brown. Activity dwindled to nominal levels, with just 7,015 contracts contrasting starkly with the near 20,000 notched up in the previous session following Tuesday's big sell-off on Wall Street. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,034 at the close of pit trading, clawing back nine points of the 115 lost in the previous three days. There was a premium to the cash market of around 10 points through most of the session, but in the final hour this shaded dramatically and at the official 4.10pm close December had swung to a two-point discount, or nine points under fair value. Traders were mostly disappointed by the day's performance. Many had expected the future to show more determined recovery given Wall Street's relatively neutral close on Wednesday. Traded options also paused for breath after the previous day's excitement when a major securities house pushed through a record 20,000 January puts. Total volume was 26,574 lots, down from 80,984 on Wednesday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for just over 11,000 lots. Eastern Electricity was the busiest stock option, with 1,600 contracts dealt.</p>

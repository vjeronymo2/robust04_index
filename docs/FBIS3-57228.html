The objectives of  this event were clearly defined by Volodymyr Grinev: first, to  create an organ that would coordinate the activities of regional  structures of the IBR. Second, to draw up program-concept  documents that could be offered to voters. Third, to set a date  for the next conference, which would determine the optimum line  of conduct for candidates for election as people's deputies.    Grinev, who read out a report, clearly defined the IBR's  strategic line -- orientation to the regions because it is they  that come to the fore in the real processes taking place today  in Ukraine, while "the sum of the center's errors has exceeded  the level beyond which these errors constitute a threat to the  state." Grinev defined as one of the IBR's main tasks "to  transfer managerial cadres from the regions to the center."  According to Grinev, the bloc's banner should be order and a  market system in which a market-based economy based on the  inviolability of private property would function in full  measure, and state authority would efficiently control all the  processes in society. Volodymyr Grinev motivated his point of  view by the fact that Ukraine would yet for a long time have  this peculiar dualism: the coexistence of the private and  government sectors of the economy.    Grinev also defined three main principles of the  interregional bloc's activity. First is a market-based economy  which is supposed to pass the three stages: financial  stabilization, privatization, and structural adjustments.  Second, the development in Ukraine of a multinational state  which would realize the interests of the entire population  rather than those of some ethnic groups. Third, Ukraine should  proceed from the fact that it is a strategic and geopolitical  ally of Russia. This strategic alliance, according to Grinev,  consists in the fact that Ukrainian goods would for a long time  find only Russian markets, and Ukraine and Russia can and should  act as stabilizing factors in Eastern Europe and to assist its  speedy integration in European processes.

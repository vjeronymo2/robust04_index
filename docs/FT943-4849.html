			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Watchdog raps anti-nuclear ad The Advertising Standards Authority, the advertising watchdog, today accuses Greenpeace, the environmental group, of 'gross over-simplification' and 'poor taste' in an anti-nuclear power advertisement in some national newspapers earlier this year. The advertisement featured a photograph of a baby with an enlarged head and was captioned 'Kazakhstan nuclear test victim'. The text claimed that radiation-linked diseases in children 'have already been seen near to nuclear installations such as Sellafield' and that '2,000 will die because of the radioactive discharges from Sellafield over the next 10 years'. The ruling published today said there was no proof that the baby was a nuclear test victim, and the figure of 2,000 deaths had not been substantiated. It also ruled that it was 'unfounded' to describe the nuclear industry as 'intent on spreading radiation and the means of mass destruction around the globe'. However, the authority rejected complaints about the linking of the nuclear industry and childhood diseases. It stated: 'The authority sought expert advice and understood that, while there were measurable excesses of childhood leukaemia and related cancers in the vicinity of Sellafield and some other nuclear installations, a causal link with the UK civil nuclear industry had not been established.' 'It considered, however, that this was a matter of public controversy and that readers would therefore recognise, particularly given the advertiser's identity, that this was an expression of the advertiser's opinion based on the available evidence.' The British Nuclear Industry Forum, the trade body, said the advertisement had 'done much harm' as the the government is conducting a review of the industry. Greenpeace said it stood by the advertisement.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S ART, ADULT PRICES;  </P> <P> EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY GALLERY ON LA BREA DISPLAYS AND SELLS ART FROM  CONTEMPORARY CHILDREN'S BOOKS  </P> <P> The originals of world-famous contemporary art -- paintings that have been  reproduced thousands, even hundreds of thousands of times -- are hanging on the  walls of a new gallery on La Brea. Unless you have children, you probably have  never seen them.  </P> <P> The Every Picture Tells A Story gallery deals exclusively in art from  contemporary children's books.  </P> <P> "When kids come in here it's amazing for them to see something like King  Bidgood in the original," said Lois Sarkisian, 32, co-owner of the gallery that  opened Oct. 29. Hanging near her is "Today We Lunch in the Tub," a whimsical  work by painter Don King of jolly King Bidgood enjoying an enormous lunch while  taking a bath.  </P> <P> "The kids are in awe when they see it," she said. "It's like us seeing a van  Gogh for the first time."  </P> <P> "One nice thing about this business," said co-owner Abbie Phillips, 36, with a  laugh, "is that when you go home at night you have no trouble talking to the  kids about work."  </P> <P> As much as children might like Every Picture Tells A Story, the setting is very  adult. The art is hung tastefully on white walls and illuminated by track  lighting. The floor space is open and the furnishings minimal.  </P> <P> It looks like almost every other gallery in the La Brea/Melrose area, except  that the content of the paintings are dancing dogs, frolicking ants, menacing  wizards and idealized scenes from childhood.  </P> <P> "We very much wanted this gallery to be in a fine art area," Sarkisian said,  "because we believe this is fine art. We didn't want it to be cute, we didn't  want it to be childlike in any way."  </P> <P> The gallery exists, however, because three years ago Phillips had a child.  </P> <P> "I was trained as a biologist, but after my first child was born I became more  interested in children's books," she said. "I always loved the books, I loved  to teach about them."  </P> <P> Turning her love of the books into a part-time profession, she began to speak  to groups about children's books. "I gave talks to parents, teachers, divorced  fathers, peace groups, that sort of thing. I would tell them about the ones I  liked and why." After the talk she would sell the books, which she had bought  at wholesale prices. "It was sort of the Tupperware idea," she said.  </P> <P> Her timing was good. Before the 1980s, children's books were a backwater for  the big publishers. The most popular books had longevity in the marketplace,  but the sales figures were comparatively small and they were slow to realize a  profit.  </P> <P> All that changed with the baby boom, the increase in two-income families and  greater attention from publishers on the marketing of children's books. Higher  prices did not  </P> <P> prove to be an obstacle -- Chris Van Allsburg's "The Polar Express" has sold  more than a million copies since it was introduced in 1984, despite its $16.95  price tag.  </P> <P> Phillips noticed that customers were responding as much to the quality of the  books' art as their texts. "People were saying they would love to have an  original piece of art from them in their homes," she said.  </P> <P> She discussed it with Sarkisian, who was an interior designer when they met  through a mutual friend two years ago. They formed a partnership to continue  Phillips' book business while they began to contact children's book  illustrators, usually through publishers, to see if they could represent the  artist.  </P> <P> Most of the artists had never been previously contacted by art dealers about  selling their work. "It was a surprise," said Lambert Davis, a La Jolla painter  who uses water-based acrylics to make warm, realistic images. He has  illustrated "Jolly Mon," a book written by songwriter Jimmy Buffet and "The  Bells of Christmas," a story by Virginia Hamilton about a black family at the  turn of the century. "I had sold a couple of the paintings myself, but when  they called it was the first time I had been approached to sell in a gallery."  </P> <P> Phillips and Sarkisian had their first show in November, 1988, at the Alexander  Gallery in Studio City, which included the paintings of Van Allsburg, the  reigning king of children's book illustrators. "It would be hard to have a show  without Van Allsburg's work in it," Sarkisian said. "When people think about  serious art for children's books, they think of him."  </P> <P> His "Polar Express" was so popular that it gave the field new respect -- his  work was seriously profiled in numerous magazines -- and brought it into new  realms on the financial front. For his most recent book, a version of "Swan  Lake," he and writer Mark Helprin split an advance of $801,000, a previously  unheard of amount for a children's book.  </P> <P> The first show was a success, and Phillips and Sarkisian went on to sponsor  exhibits in several other cities.  </P> <P> "We proved that the response for the artwork was there," Sarkisian said. "We  eventually felt the business had grown to the point where we could have a  gallery of our own."  </P> <P> "The art needed a home," Phillips said.  </P> <P> Every Picture Tells a Story opened with a show of paintings by Barry Moser. "I  think he is a pre-eminent watercolorist," Sarkisian said. "And the subject  matter is familiar." Moser has most recently illustrated several sets of Uncle  Remus stories in books called "Jump," "Jump Again" and "Jump On Over" with  texts by Van Dyke Parks, based on the Joel Chandler Harris originals. He has  also illustrated editions of "Tom Sawyer" and "Alice in Wonderland."  </P> <P> The current show at the gallery centers on Richard Jessie Watson's egg tempera  paintings used in his retelling of "Tom Thumb," set in medieval times. The show  also includes paintings by Davis from "The Bells of Christmas"; black and white  etchings by Arthur Geisart from "The Ark" and "Pigs From A To Z"; classic  storybook-style paintings by Michael Hague from an edition of "The Wizard of  Oz"; watercolors by Ted Rand for Edward Lear's classic nonsense poem "The  Jumblies"; and paintings from Van Allsburg's "Two Bad Ants," in which the  painter shows household scenes from an ant's viewpoint.  </P> <P> The prices for the artwork are anything but childlike. The center-spread  painting from Watson's "Tom Thumb" is $7,000. Van Allsburg's "Two Bad Ants"  paintings range in price from $5,500 to $6,400. Paintings from "Under the  Sunday Tree" by Amos Ferguson, a 90-year-old artist who works in a primitive  style, sell for $6,000.  </P> <P> "We set the prices in consultation with the artist," Sarkisian said. Most of  the paintings in the gallery sell for about $1,000, with etchings and working  drawings generally going for less. The least expensive piece now in the gallery  is a small Geisart etching for $75.  </P> <P> "The price has to do with whether their books have been bestsellers," she said.  "And awards are a factor."  </P> <P> The most prestigious award in children's book illustration is the annual  Caldecott Medal (Van Allsburg has won two.) But others are important. Sarkisian  said that Richard Watson's prices are higher than some partly because his first  book, "Bronwen the Traw and the Shape-Shister," with text by James Dickey, won  the Parents' Choice Award.  </P> <P> "The quality of the work is important too, of course," she said. "There was an  incredible reaction to 'Tom Thumb' as soon as it came out. It is a very popular  book. It's beautiful and has an emotional content."  </P> <P> Buyers seem to agree. As of last week, 11 of the 20 Watson paintings on  display, including the $7,000 center spread from "Tom Thumb," were sold.  </P> <P> Sarkisian said that in the first two months of business they sold about  $220,000 worth of artwork at the gallery, far beyond their expectations.  </P> <P> "We have been surprised a bit by who is buying," Sarkisian said. "We expected  people with a lot of expendable income and people looking for a bargain in art  for investment purposes. But we are also getting a lot of teachers, parents  with children, young single people who just fall in love with the art and are  willing to save their dollars until they can buy a piece.  </P> <P> "We are getting more emotionally based purchases than I would have expected,  and that is just great as far as I am concerned."  </P> <P> She said that people who did buy for investment purposes are already reaping  the rewards, however. "We sold one of the King Bidgood paintings for $3,000.  Now we have a list of people who want to be notified if the buyer is willing to  sell. They are offering double what he paid just a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> "One of the artists called to thank us for starting the gallery. 'Just by  opening your door you raised my prices 50%,' he said. I think that by putting  this art in a gallery setting, it gives them the attention and respect they  deserve."  </P> <P> Every Picture Tells A Story is at 836 N. La Brea Ave. in Los Angeles. Regular  hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays. For information, call  962-5420.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hagen leaves Nedlloyd board and cuts stake NEDLLOYD, the Dutch trans-port group, said yesterday that Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian investor, had resigned his seat on the company's supervisory board and withdrawn his request for an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to discuss radical changes to the way the board is elected. Mr Hagen, who was admitted to the board in October after a long battle, also announced that he had sold a 5 per cent stake in Nedlloyd, reducing his holding to less than 10 per cent. He had promised that he would resign his seat as soon as the shareholding fell below 15 per cent, he said. Mr Hagen angered his fellow board members in December when he called for the board to be elected by shareholders. Supervisory boards in the Netherlands are self-perpetuating and nominate their own members, providing an in-built form of protection from unwanted takeovers. However, in a partial recognition of Mr Hagen's self-styled crusade for shareholder rights, Nedlloyd said that 'when filling the vacancy that has arisen, special attention will be paid to candidates brought forward by shareholders.' It added that 'both parties have expressed the wish for a positive relationship'. Mr Hagen is facing more difficult financial conditions. This was underscored yesterday by a statement from Oslobanken, a small Oslo-based bank, that DNO, a company controlled by Mr Hagen, had pledged 53.8 per cent of its shares as security for a loan which the bank provided for Marine Investment, one of his main investment vehicles. Last month, Mr Hagen was forced to dispose of his DNO subsidiary, DNO Olje, for NKr235m (Dollars 33.7m), far below his original asking price. The assets were acquired by Saga Petroleum.</p>

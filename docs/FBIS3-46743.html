			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sendai, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Miyagi Governor Shuntaro  Honma had kept a covert 10 million yen fund at his disposal  prior to his arrest and indictment last year, according to an  internal probe by the Miyagi prefectural government. Honma  resigned as governor in early October in connection with a  bribery scandal.    Vice Governor Ryoichi Kabaya said the cash was kept in the  prefectural government's secretarial section. The investigation  revealed that Governor Honma allegedly approached Seiki  Sugawara, deputy chief of the commerce, industry and labor  division, in April 1992 and asked for fat expense accounts.    Sugawara promptly started securing a total of 4 million yen  by writing false business travel reports by the time of the  February 1993 gubernatorial election, prefectural government  officials said.    In addition, they said, another 6 million yen was withdrawn  as money gifts and wedding and condolence money from the  governor's annual official expense account of 17 million yen.    Vice Governor Kabaya said the retrieved 10 million yen will  be turned over to the Miyagi government as revenue under its  fiscal 1993 budget.    Incumbent Governor Shiro Asano expressed shock at the  results  of the in-house investigation and vowed to set up a system to  prevent a repeat of such a bogus expense account scheme.    Honma resigned as governor in October last year after his  arrest in late September. He was indicted October 18 on charges  of taking a 20 million yen bribe from Taisei Corp., a major  Japanese construction company, in connection with a prefectural  project to build a cancer center. He was also indicted again on  December 1 on charges of receiving a 100 million yen bribe from  the de facto owner of Japan's No. 3 paper manufacturer, Daishowa  Paper Manufacturing Co.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Skoda completes external refinancing for expansion SKODA Automobilova, the Czech car maker in which Volkswagen is building a 70 per cent stake, has just completed the first significant external financing of its revised 10-year, DM7bn (Dollars 4.6bn) expansion and modernisation programme. The DM1.4bn financing has been structured by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private investment arm of the World Bank, with a group of four commercial banks and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The IFC is responsible for raising DM600m of which it will retain DM200m, with the rest going to commercial banks under the IFC umbrella. The four lead banks, Dresdner, Deutsche Bank, J. P. Morgan and Credit Suisse First Boston, are syndicating a further DM400m parallel loan. The EBRD is expected to provide DM200m and syndicate DM200m to commercial banks, although the EBRD board has not yet approved the operation. Spreads on the current six to 12-year financing operation are said to be the finest for a central European borrower and below the 2.5 per cent over Libor at which Hungary has been able to borrow on international capital markets in recent months.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Higher Taxes?"] </F>   [Text] The leaders of the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group are  considering higher excise and property taxes and the  introduction of a road-use charge. Gasoline tax is not to be  raised any further. This is envisaged by a still secret concept  that CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble intends  to present this summer. In the medium term, payroll and income  tax are to be reduced, investments are to be promoted, and a  capital formation plan could open up additional leeway in wage  policy for working people and trade unions. Schaeuble has  declared the concept "top secret" (according to a CDU deputy).  Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) has not yet been informed.  He is afraid of a discussion about tax increases before the  Bavarian Landtag elections in September.</p>

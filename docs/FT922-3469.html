			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: SA union wants state to help shrink mines industry SOUTH AFRICA'S National Union of Mineworkers has proposed state aid in restructuring the gold mining industry, to assist an orderly scaling down and to protect jobs. Although the union's initiative is at industry level, it arises from the particular circumstances of the Harmony gold mine, by far the largest of the country's marginal gold mines, where 6,000 workers were recently laid off. The initiative comes against the background of some 130,000 lost jobs in the industry since 1989, with about 30,000 workers retrenched or dismissed in the past year. The NUM, which presented its proposals to Mr George Bartlett, minister of mineral and energy affairs, earlier this week, contends that state policy on not aiding marginal mines is seriously flawed. It argues that the 1990 Marais Committee report into the subject is outdated, because it seriously underestimated the speed and extent to which mines would be forced to scale down operations. The government will respond within the next two weeks. The NUM, though accepting that all mines must eventually close, believes the state should assist the industry restructuring process. It suggests this should take the form of a carefully structured aid programme for marginal mines, to slow down the rate of contraction of the industry and thus benefit workers, suppliers and the regional economy. The union proposes the state should seek to maintain employment levels, that underground production should be increased to lengthen mines' lives, and that miners should be retrained in other skills. Further, alternative uses of mining assets should be encouraged, and rural areas should get planned assistance, in view of the serious effects of job losses in mines. The NUM argues that short-term relief can be offered to a mine without any net cost to the national exchequer. Although a mine operating at a loss does not pay tax, its operations benefit the exchequer in five ways: employees' income taxes; direct taxes such as VAT; Regional Service Council levies on wages; mining lease taxes and taxes paid by mine suppliers and their employees. The NUM's calculations for 1990 indicate that the tax generated by a mine making no profit was worth R4,912 (Pounds 951.90) per kilogram of gold produced, and thus a state subsidy of this amount would be justified. In the first quarter of 1992, about 12 per cent of gold was produced at a loss. Analysts reckon that five mines are in immediate jeopardy - Doornfontein, Libanon, Loraine, SA Land and West Rand Consolidated, with another five not far behind. Production coming on stream at some of the richer mines will largely offset any closures. Mr Dave Giese, analyst at stockbrokers Davis, Borkum Hare, estimates that closures over the next two years could cause gold production to fall by 5 per cent, to about 570 tonnes a year by 1994.</p>

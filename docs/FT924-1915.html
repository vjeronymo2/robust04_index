			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Petrofina dividend cut drags Brussels down RSES reflected a mixture of moods and stimuli, writes Our Markets Staff. BRUSSELS concentrated on Petrofina following the oil group's announcement after the market closed on Monday that it would cut its 1992 dividend by 50 per cent. The Bel-20 index lost 11.52 to 1,101.13 as Petrofina closed down BFr500, or 6.2 per cent at BFr7,490 but off the day's low of BFr7,260. The group warned that 1992 profits will be depressed and the forecast came at the lower end of analysts' expectations. Petrofina's major shareholder, Electrafina, fell BFr120 to BFr2,070 and GBL, which controls Electrafina, lost BFr70 at BFr2,620. MILAN fell again. Following the rebuff delivered to ruling parties in local elections on Sunday and Monday, there was news that Mr Bettino Craxi, leader of the Italian socialist party and a former prime minister, had been officially notified by Milan magistrates that he was being investigated as part of a continuing probe into city hall corruption. After a 2.2 per cent fall on Monday the Comit index dropped another 9.27, or 2.2 per cent again, to 404.25. Mediobanca fell L710, or 5.9 per cent to L11,290 and Fiat by L225, or 5.8 per cent to L3,675 although, in line with the market, the carmaker recovered L80 to L3,755 on the kerb. Monday's main losers, the banking privatisation candidates, did not emerge unscathed yesterday. BCI fell L149 to L4,001 and Credito Italiano by L44 to L2,601. Among other privatisation stocks, Finmeccanica was amongst the hardest hit, shedding over 9 per cent to close at L1,070. PARIS was in a positive mood although late profit-taking eroded some of the day's gains. The CAC-40 index closed 6.53 ahead at 1,744.79, having seen an intraday high of 1,752.10. Turnover was estimated at some FFr2bn. Accor improved well after forecasting a 15 per cent increase in group profit in 1993 and the shares rose FFr12 to FFr613. There was also strong activity among financials with some program buying noted. UAP gained FFr9.30 to FFr426.30, Paribas put on FFr9.80 to FFr338.80 and Societe Generale advanced FFr13 to FFr573. Total continued to lose ground following Monday's profits warning, falling a further FFr2.30 to FFr225.00 as Elf recovered FFr2.40 to FFr325.70. Eurotunnel was just 25 centimes down on the day at FFr28.50 after TransManche Link said that talks between the two sides regarding cost overruns had reached a standstill. FRANKFURT reacted after five straight days of losses, the DAX index ending 11.49 higher at 1,481.24, as dealers talked of short covering ahead of Friday's closure of DTB options and futures contracts. Volume stayed low at DM3.7bn, up from DM3.1bn. The insurance company, Allianz, closed DM24 higher at DM1,860, reflecting its attractions to DTB traders. In the car sector BMW rose DM5 to DM470, Daimler DM6.30 to DM513 and Volkswagen DM3.50 to DM244.50. Elsewhere, the steel group Thyssen and Veba, the utility, rose DM2.80 to DM155.50 and DM2.60 to DM348.60 after government sources said that their consortium was expected to win approval to operate the new E-1 mobile phone network. ZURICH continued to assert its independence of the Frankfurt bourse, the SMI index losing 10.2 to to 2,005.1. AMSTERDAM retreated in low turnover as the CBS Tendency index closed 0.5 weaker at 103.5. ING was among the gainers, up 60 cents at Fl 53.00. STOCKHOLM was pulled lower by Astra and Volvo as the Affarsvarlden index lost 9.6 to 879.1 in turnover of some SKr605m. Astra, down SKr9 at SKr732, weakened after an analysts meeting on Monday while Volvo B shares lost SKr3 to SKr332 after Moody's downgraded the group's commercial paper ratings. ISTANBUL gained some 2 per cent on rumours that the government was to approve new tax legislation affecting equity holdings. The 75-share index rose 78.49 to 3,901.94 in turnover of TL258.7bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- December 15                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open      10.30       11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1039.08    1041.15     1041.25     1040.77 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1115.24    1116.14     1117.24     1116.96  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00      14.00       15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1040.41    1038.16     1037.75     1038.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1116.61    1115.02     1114.50     1115.23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 14    Dec 11    Dec 10     Dec 9     Dec 8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1041.18   1044.03   1049.63   1054.06   1051.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1116.33   1117.72   1123.58   1133.46   1135.64  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1041.83; 200 - 1117.79 Low/day: 100 - 1037.25 200 - 1113.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Crazy for - classics] in the West End - Why the London theatregoer has never had it so good THERE HAS been so much complaint of late about the West End being over-run by musicals, and there being very little on to entertain the serious theatregoer, that I thought it might be interesting to see if things had been any better in the 1930s and the 1950s. In the months leading up to the second world war, there were six musicals, four revues and 13 plays. Emlyn Williams was appearing in his own autobiographical The Corn is Green with Sybil Thorndike in the role of the schoolmarm, who helps him win a scholarship to Oxford. Marie Tempest was starring in Dear Octopus, Dodie Smith's tribute to 'that British institution the family'. John Mills was having a big success as George, the migrant labourer, in John Steinbeck's drama of the American Depression, Of Mice end Men, which the Lord Chamberlain banned initially (on account of its bad language) and only relented after it had opened at a club theatre to universally good reviews. There were comedies by Ben Travers, Lesley Storm and NC Hunter. Best of all there was a revival of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Ernest with a definitive cast which included John Gielgud, Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft, Gwen Francgcon-Davies, Jack Hawkins, Margaret Rutherford and Miles Malleson. But this was the only classic revival. The Old Vic was closed, though earlier in the year it had been possible to see A Midsummer Night's Dream, She Stoops to Conquer and Ibsen's An Enemy of the People. In the months leading up to the first night of John Osborne's Look Back in Anger in June 1956, there were seven musicals, three revues, three variety shows, 21 plays - three of them thrillers, two by Agatha Christie. The Mousetrap was in its fifth year. John Clements was running the Saville Theatre as a national theatre, in the middle of a season of classical plays which included The Seagull, The Doctor's Dilemma, The Way of the World and was presenting The Rivals with himself and Laurence Harvey as Sir Anthony and Captain Absolute with Athene Seyler as Mrs Malaprop. Paul Scofield and Peter Brook were reviving TS Eliot's The Family Reunion as part of their season at the Phoenix Theatre, which included Hamlet and an adaptation of Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory. At the Old Vic there was Shakespeare, the company being in the third year of its five year plan to produce all 36 plays. Edith Evans and Peggy Ashcroft were appearing in Enid Bagnold's The Chalk Garden, directed by John Gielgud, hailed by Kenneth Tynan, in a moment of aberration, as the finest artificial comedy that had flowed from an English (as opposed from an Irish) pen since the death of Congreve. Hugh Griffiths was giving a magnificent performance as General St. Pe, a compulsive womaniser dictating his war memoirs, in Jean Anouilh's characteristically cynical and bitter The Waltz of the Toreadors. Eric Portman and Margaret Leighton were playing to full houses in Terence Rattigan's Separate Tables. Alec Guinness, Irene Worth and Martita Hunt were giving London its first taste of Georges Feydeau in English in Hotel Paradiso. Peter Ustinov was enjoying a popular success in his own play, Romanoff and Juliet, the gentlest of political satires at the expense of the Russians and Americans. Peggy Mount had become a star overnight in Philip King and Falkland Carey's Sailor, Beware] Vivien Leigh had turned a minor Noel Coward comedy, South Sea Bubble into a box office hit and Brian Rix was losing his trousers in Dry Rot. So, at first sight, it might seem that things were much 'better' in the 1930s and 1950s than they are today. There were lots of plays and lots of stars. Nevertheless, in recent months it has been possible to see plays by Shakespeare, Jonson, Ford, Heywood, Middleton and Rowley, Lope de Vega, Shadwell, Gay, Farquhar, Moliere, Marivaux, Ostrovsky, Pinero, Chekhov, Shaw, Pirandello, Priestley, Tennessee Williams, Alan Ayckbourn, Alan Bennett, Alan Bleasdale, David Hare, Peter Whelan, Tony Kushner and Tom Stoppard. But, it will be said, all these plays have been produced by either the Royal Shakespeare Company or the Royal National Theatre. So what? The RSC and the RNT did not exist before. Besides, in the West End it has also been possible to see Oscar Wilde's An ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Ernest, Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, Noel Coward's Hay Fever, Harold Pinter's No Man's Land, Peter Shaffer's The Gift of the Gorgon, Arthur Miller's The Last Yankee, Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea, JB Priestley's An inspector Calls, Sean O'Casey's Juno and the Paycock and an adaptation of Graham Greene's Travels with My Aunt. It has even been possible to see Shakespeare on Shaftesbury Avenue. The London theatregoer has never had it so good. Surely, he cannot ask for more? And if he does, he can go to the Fringe and the opera. The Gate and ENO have produced some of the best theatre London has seen in the last few years. It could be argued that the serious theatregoer no longer needs the West End. High production values are guaranteed at the RNT and RSC, the seats are cheaper, the foyers are more spacious and audiences can park their cars. But what then is going to happen to modern authors who do not fit into the RNT and RSC or indeed the Royal Court repertoire? Now that there are few stars who are capable of filling a theatre on their names alone, the chance of a new play attracting investment becomes more and more unlikely. Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa only got into the West End after its critical and box-office success at The National; and this is also true of Shaffer, Miller and the Rattigan, Pinter and Priestley revivals, all having to rely on the subsidised theatre to produce them initially. In order for productions to succeed in the commercial theatre they have to be turned into events and clearly an event now means either a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber or a revival of a famous classic with Maggie Smith, who is the only British actress these days who can ensure massive advance bookings before the play has opened. Actor Timothy West recently suggested to me that one solution would be for some of the smaller theatres (eg The Duchess, The Fortune and The Ambassadors) to be turned into 'off-West End' theatres where actors would not be paid West End prices and straight plays could play to a minority audience for an open-ended run with a top price of Pounds 14 and the bulk of the seats at Pounds 10. This would, of course, involve not only negotiations with theatre unions, but also with the theatre owners who would have to be willing to reduce their rents. It is plain that unless something is done, the present situation will continue.</p>

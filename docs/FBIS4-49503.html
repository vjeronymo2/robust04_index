			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 8 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Muslims and Croats  and the Croatian Republic reached agreement in principle on the  borders of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation here today.    They agreed to use the results of a census conducted in 1991  and give all cities and towns where Croats and Muslims  constitute the majority to the Muslim-Croat Federation, the  Croatian news agency HINA quoted Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir  Zubak as saying.    Bosnian Foreign Minister Ifran Ljubijankic said the  federation will have more than 51 percent of Bosnia's territory.    U.S. Special Envoy Charles Redman said the round of  negotiation was held in a "friendly atmosphere" and made certain  achievement. But he added that Muslims and Croats could reach  final agreement on borders only after the Bosnian issue is  solved comprehensively.    Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign  Minister Mate Granic both showed some optimism about the  negotiation.    The negotiation is being conducted in two separate working  groups, one of which is focusing on the border issue.</p>

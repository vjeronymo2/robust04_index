			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (2): Capital growth matters, too - Investment management / Routes to market exposure Finding the right home for one's money is a difficult enough process for the average individual, but it is doubly nerve-racking for charity trustees who are responsible for the proper management of other people's money. Putting it safely on deposit at the bank may rest easiest on a trustee's mind, but more charities are realising that in fact investments further along the risk scale can be the most responsible choice, to provide some capital growth as well as income. Once a decision has been made that at least some of a charity's funds need to be invested in stocks and shares, the next choice is between collective funds, such as unit trusts or specialised common investment funds (Cifs) for charities, and segregated management, where fund managers construct an individual portfolio of investments to meet a charity's specific needs. The choice may be dictated by the size of funds available. A charity with less than Pounds 50,000 will not be able to afford the personal touch of segregated management, while large national charities with Pounds 10m or more to their names will be welcomed by any segregated fund manager. Between those extremes, either option may be possible, if you research the market thoroughly. The big-name London managers tend to steer any charity with less than Pounds 2m towards collective investment vehicles, as their fee levels make segregated management of smaller amounts uneconomic. But charities with more modest funds to look after do have an alternative. Some of the medium-sized stockbrokers and fund managers, particularly outside London, accept much smaller funds for segregated management at fees comparable with the charges on collective funds. This may be an appropriate choice if a charity has specific investment needs, such as ethical constraints or perhaps a temporary need for higher-than-usual income from its assets. Manchester-based stockbroker Henry Cooke, Lumsden, for example, offers charities a full individual portfolio management service with no minimum investment amount, though the minimum fee of Pounds 1,500 a year would deter any fund with less than about Pounds 100,000. The standard annual charge is an all-inclusive 0.7 per cent. Most managers still use collective funds for part of the portfolio - for example, to provide overseas exposure, as direct investment would be too expensive with small amounts - but the UK portfolio will usually consist of direct shareholdings. If collective funds seem like a more appropriate solution, then charities can choose from a wide range of unit trusts, or a smaller number of common investment funds designed specifically for charities. According to the WM Company, which produces comparative performance statistics for charity funds, there are currently only nine equity-based common investment funds and nine fixed-interest funds on the market. Those not shown in the table are funds launched within the past year by Foreign &amp; Colonial and Kleinwort Benson, which do not yet have a long enough performance record to be included. Shona McLeod, of WM Company, says more management groups would have launched common investment funds by now, if it were not for the considerable bureaucratic obstacles which have to be overcome to set up a fund. But demand for Cifs is growing fast, so managers who can offer them are attracting steady streams of new money. One important factor in the growing demand for Cifs is the steady process of divestment being carried out by the official custodian for charities. Small charities whose assets were managed by the official custodian are gradually having their money returned to them, and are having to find other homes for it. Most have only modest sums to deal with, so the most obvious choice is a Cif, particularly if they are constrained by the Trustee Investment Act. The choice of manager - whether you opt for the collective or segregated route - is wide, from the famous City names to smaller regional or specialist firms. Even among managers of similar size and reputation, there can be considerable differences in investment approach and charging structure. So how should a charity go about finding the right manager for its particular needs? Michael Rimmer, of Schroders, says: 'Historically, a lot of introductions have been effected by word of mouth. The charity world is still comparatively small and self-contained - trustees talk to one another.' This is particularly the case with medium-sized and smaller charities. However, a word-of-mouth recommendation does not necessarily hand the fund manager a new client on a plate. More often, it speeds the manager into a short list, from which the final selection is made on more objective grounds of cost, performance and so on. But there are signs that the informality of that process may be changing. Increasingly, charities - particularly the larger ones - are turning to independent consultants for advice on choosing an investment manager. Some people in the industry see the charity fund management business following the example of pension funds over the past few years. Consultants have become central to the pension fund manager selection process, and an emphasis on performance statistics has concentrated a very high percentage of funds in the hands of a very small number of managers. The charity sector is more diverse, with more very small organisations, than the pension sector, so concentration of funds is unlikely to go quite so far; but trustees' growing awareness of their responsibilities is creating a trend in that direction.</p>

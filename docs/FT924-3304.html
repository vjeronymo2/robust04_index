			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Costly data - Legal Briefs The Confederation of British Industry has warned that the new European Community directive on data protection will cost British businesses millions of pounds in unnecessary compliance costs. The employers' organisation says the level of data protection in the UK under the 1984 Data Protection Act is adequate. The CBI says it would make more sense to impose the UK's tough data protection rules on EC countries which lack such legislation rather than impose the directive's high level of protection, which may actually impede cross-border data flow.</p>

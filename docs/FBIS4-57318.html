			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nelson Barreras and Hilda Prieto] </F>   [Text] In the presence of some 700 tour operators, travel  agents, and foreign and national reporters, the 15th  international tourism convention, Cuba-94, opened today in  Varadero.    Approximately 700 foreign delegates are attending the 15th  tourism convention, which is considered the most important  employment market. During a visit to the convention area,  Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos granted an interview to this  station.    [Begin recording] There is a large group of foreign  reporters  as well as a large group of tour operators, businessmen, and  travel agents who will help establish many of the contracts  being discussed, and establish contacts for the supply of new  products being manufactured. [end recording]    Minister Cienfuegos added that more than 700,000 tourists  are  expected to arrive in the country this year. Referring to  development of the new Tourism Ministry, he said:    [Begin recording] Now the first steps are being taken; the  Tourism Ministry has a small structure. We have decided to work  first within the hotel chain structure, in organizing management  cadres, et cetera. That is, this has almost been concluded, and  all measures have been adopted concerning the organization;  building sites for the chain of hotels, following the same  styles as the Cubanacan and Gaviota enterprises. These are  autonomous and independent organizations that will be given the  same facilities granted to those institutions. Surely there will  be a sound competition among them, which will guarantee that  efficiency and professionalism will prevail in all management  cadres because this is vital for the development of tourism.  [end recording]    Until next Friday [20 May], 88 national and foreign  companies, including 13 airlines, will promote and trade their  products in this 15th conference.</p>

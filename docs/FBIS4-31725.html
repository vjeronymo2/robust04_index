			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] The fierce attacks by the united aggressors  [Serbian army, western Bosnian leader Fikret Abdic's forces]  have continued on the free Bihac region. Yesterday afternoon  [Bosnian Serb leader Radovan] Karadzic's chetniks from their  stronghold in Veliki Radic fired several howitzer shells at a  funeral in Jezersko, and then continued shelling the other free  parts of the Bosanska Krupa municipality. They have been  shelling Buzim from the territory of the so-called Serbian  autonomous region of Krajina, and all night and this morning  they have been shelling the outskirts of Cazin, Krivaja,  (Pljanici), [words indistinct], (Spahici), (Gornje Srbljane),  and [word indistinct]. This is obvious proof of their  collaboration with Abdic's traitorous phalanx, and yet another  open aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina, as they skillfully use  Abdic as a smokescreen for their attacks.    The Kladusa rebels and mercenaries have also continued with  their bestial attacks along the entire front line. Their  artillery and infantry attacks never ceased throughout the  night, and have even intensified this morning.    Another appeal has been sent to the international  organizations to try and save the families that are being  prosecuted in Velika Kladusa.</p>

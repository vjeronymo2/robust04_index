			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Greenspan upbeat on US economy: The Fed is trying to 'promote sustainable economic expansion' The US economy is likely to grow by at least 3 per cent and possibly 4 per cent this year, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, indicated yesterday in his semi-annual monetary report to Congress. In a generally upbeat assessment, he also predicted a further decline in consumer price inflation, perhaps to only 2.5 per cent compared with 3.1 per cent last year. The projections for growth and inflation were both noticeably more optimistic than in the Fed's last statement to Congress in July. Mr Greenspan announced a reduction in the Fed's target range for M2, a broad measure of the money supply, to growth of 2.0-6.0 per cent, against 2.5-6.5 per cent last year. However, he said the reduction reflected changes in the relationship between money and growth, not an attempt to tighten monetary policy. The Fed was 'endeavouring to conduct monetary policy in a way that promotes sustainable economic expansion.' In a hearing before the Senate banking committee, Democratic members of Congress pressed Mr Greenspan to support President Bill Clinton's economic plan if necessary by easing monetary policy to offset any negative impact on growth from measures to reduce the budget deficit. Mr Greenspan signalled strong support for Mr Clinton's plan but said the Fed could not specify in advance how it would respond to fiscal measures. The course of interest rates would depend on a host of forces affecting the economy in coming years. 'Going forward the strategy of monetary policy will be to provide sufficient liquidity to support the economic expansion while containing inflationary pressures. The existing slack implies that the economy can grow more rapidly than potential GDP for a time, permitting further reductions in the unemployment rate even while inflation is contained.' Democratic senators criticised Mr Greenspan for failing to achieve monetary targets in the past. In the year to the fourth quarter of 1992, M2 grew only 1.9 per cent, below the lower limit of the Fed's target. Mr Greenspan's response was to express profound scepticism about the reliability of monetary targets as a guide for policy. The monetary aggregates 'do not appear to be giving reliable indications of economic developments and price pressures,' he said, noting that the sluggish growth of M2 had proved consistent with much faster growth of nominal incomes than had been normal in the past. The most important reason was that savers had shifted funds out of assets included in M2 in search of higher returns, for example in bond and stock mutual funds. Mr Greenspan signalled that the economic outlook had improved noticeably in the past six months. While uncertainties remained, the economy appeared to have entered the year with 'noticeable momentum to spending. In addition inventories are at relatively low levels, and factory orders have been rising. Consumer confidence has recovered, and spending on consumer durables and homes appears to be moving at a brisker pace. Recent surveys suggest an appreciable increase in business investment this year.' The Fed's 'central tendency' projection is for growth this year of 3.0-3.25 per cent, 0.5 percentage points faster than expected last July. The likely range for inflation has been lowered by 0.5 percentage points to 2.5-2.75. Mr Greenspan warned that the near-term outlook was 'uncertain'. A continuing worry concerned access to credit. 'While banking institutions have become much more healthy and are well-positioned to meet an increase in loan demand, very few signals of any easing of terms or standards on business loans have been apparent to date. ' 'But I believe that in many respects the inevitable painful adjustments have laid the foundation for better performance of our economy over the longer term. Financial positions have been strengthened; inflation is low and should remain subdued; labour productivity is increasing; resources are being shifted from national defence to investment and consumption.' Mr Greenspan reiterated his view that reductions in long-term interest rates could potentially provide a significant spur to growth and that progress would depend on success in cutting the structural budget deficit. However, in comments on the Clinton plan, he warned Congress against relying too heavily on tax increases. With many programmes growing faster than the tax base, stabilising the deficit as a percentage of GDP, not to mention a reduction, would require 'ever increasing tax rates.' There was thus no alternative but to 'control future spending impulses.' He said there was no danger that deficit reduction could be overdone and create an unhealthy degree of 'fiscal drag.' In the current political environment excessive cuts in the deficit was 'nothing I would lose sleep over.'</p>

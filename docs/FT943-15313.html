			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Property: A stumbling recovery - Cadogan's Place / The stuttering revival in the UK property market is often at odds with local conditions The Halifax-Nationwide waltz has struck up again. In the May figures for house prices, Nationwide stepped forward and Halifax back. But in June it was about-turn, Nationwide stepping back 0.7 per cent and Halifax forward all of 0.3 per cent. More significant than these monthly variations is that both are more or less in harmony on the annual change - Halifax says 1.5 per cent up and Nationwide 1 per cent. And their indices are not too far adrift. With a base for both of 100 in 1983, Halifax now stands at 201.9 and Nationwide at 195.6. Their figures, and those for sales and mortgages, continue to paint a general picture of a stumbling recovery in the housing market. But local scenes can be very different. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's prime London residential property index shows an average increase of 9.9 per cent, from June 1993 to June 1994, and agents' offices in Kensington report booming business. It does not need many City bonuses to push prices up when the recipients all decide to spend them on the same sort of family house. The rises in central London have spread through to the home counties, notably along the M3 corridor. At present, a decent house in the Pounds 250,000-Pounds 500,000 range in north-east Hampshire, will have several would-be buyers offering the asking price in days, leading to a private auction or best and final offers - while parents are queueing to inspect the local schools. But elsewhere in the country - Worcestershire, for example - I still hear of price cuts. Sterndale has converted the shell of a 17th century property into seven spacious and stylish houses in the first stage of a 21-house development at Lindridge Park, near Teignmouth in Devon. The development will include the old coach house and detached houses in the walled garden. John Baring, of Exeter, whose son, Francis, founded Baring Brothers, the merchant bank, bought the house in 1747 for Pounds 8,000. In the 1960s the property burnt down. The house is in a peaceful valley with views to Dartmoor. Its treat is the garden, laid out in 1913 as a combination of formal, wild and water gardens, which all at Lindridge will share. Sterndale is restoring it, cutting the yew so that it will grow again as topiary, recovering shrubs in the dell and clearing an elaborate (and blocked) system of watercourses. The garden's focus is a round pond with a round temple on a round island. Walls and buttresses of yew enclose the walk around the pond and two low bridges cross to the temple. Prices from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in nearby Exeter (0392-433033) range from Pounds 225,000 to Pounds 275,000. Water is also a feature at Giffords Hall, Wickhambrook, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. This early Tudor timber house, is listed grade I. A moat with plants dipping into the water holds the garden design together. A three-arch bridge crosses it and leads to the unusual oak-timbered, red brick house - many of the bricks laid in a herringbone pattern. The house is superb, with a great hall with linenfold panelling on the ground floor. Above that is a solar (or great chamber) with a Perpendicular-style solid oak ceiling. The fireplace still has names and slogans scratched in English, Greek and Latin from three, four or five centuries ago. The house was rewired four years ago and the double glazing in some rooms is of the highest quality I have seen, with the inner layer encased in oak. The local builder knows the house through and through. Last week the garden was heavy with rose scent. Beyond the moat is a formal trellised garden, with box hedges in a knot pattern and a rose arbour leading to a walled garden. The views are superb. This gem of old England is well placed for Bury St Edmunds, Newmarket and Cambridge. Pounds 1.3m buys the estate of 338 acres. The house and 95 acres, including a wood and a medieval stew pond for keeping fish, are priced at Pounds 850,000 from Savills, Ipswich (0473-226191). A house which belonged to Professor Cyril Parkinson, of Parkinson's Law fame, has just been sold by Kent agents Calcutt McLean for around Pounds 150,000. The three-bedroom home, at 36 Harkness Drive, Canterbury, was sold to buyers from London.</p>

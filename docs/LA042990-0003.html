			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS is to be congratulated for its good soap operas, with the exception of one:  "The Bold and the Beautiful."  </P> <P> This soap plays like a comedy, even though I'm sure it's not supposed to. If  the writers ax Ridge and Caroline, it would be a better show.  </P> <P> Grow up, Forresters . . . and get real!  </P> <P> Mark Fullove, Castaic  </P></p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Royal Bank staff drop overtime ban AN overtime ban by 12,000 clerical workers at Royal Bank of Scotland has been called off and the finance union, Bifu, has 'reluctantly' accepted a pay rise of 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent. Bifu won no improvement on the bank's earlier pay offer but did win an assurance that an existing incremental pay scheme would be expanded.</p>

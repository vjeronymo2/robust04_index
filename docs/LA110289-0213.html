			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BALLET;  </P> <P> NUREYEV TALKS MAY END HOLDOUT  </P> <P> Rudolf Nureyev will meet the head of the Paris Opera Ballet later this month,  raising hopes that the dancer-director's contract dispute with the company  might eventually be settled, an opera spokesman said today.  </P> <P> The 51-year-old Soviet defector, who is insisting on new terms, agreed to meet  French Opera Chairman Pierre Berge at the end of November.  </P> <P> Nureyev has directed the ballet since 1983. But his relations with the Paris  Opera Ballet reached an all-time low last month when the company began its new  season with temporary replacements for its temperamental star, who had refused  to return from the United States.  </P></p>

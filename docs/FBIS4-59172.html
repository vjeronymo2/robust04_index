			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of an "appeal" issued by the Legislative Council of </F> the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, the Executive Council of the  Kurdistan Autonomous region, and the representatives of the  Kurdistan Autonomous Region at the National Assembly; place and  date not given]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  God sets forth a parable: A city enjoying security and quiet,  abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place. Yet was  it ungrateful for the favors of God. So God made it taste of  hunger and terror in extremes closing in on it like a garment  from every side, because of the evil which its people wrought.  [koranic verses]    An appeal to our Kurdish people in the Kurdistan Autonomous  Region following the large-scale armed clashes between the  Barzani and Talabani groups:    O our people who are shackled by the chains of the infidel  coalition and the hegemony of the traitors and lackeys; O our  good Kurdish people in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region: We have  drawn your attention in the past to the fact that those who are  tampering with Kurdistan [words indistinct] and its  developmental structure which was built by the glorious 17-30  Revolution in recognition of our Kurdish people's national and  cultural rights are merely pawns in the hands of international  tyranny, which it moves as it pleases to achieve its goals and  objectives in the easiest way and with the least sacrifices.    Those who chose to follow the infidel foreigner and joined  his aggressive plans, with all this submission and humiliation,  have severed all links with you about which they used to brag.  They have deceived some people and were about to sever all  links to land and history. God, however, has turned their evil  against them. They are now being exposed before the entire  people. Thanks to God's will, one is falling by the fire of the  other in an action financed by the evil coalition. They want to  set Kurdistan ablaze because they do not want it to return to  the motherland, which gave it security, prosperity, and rights.  They are setting it ablaze so that no one will pay attention to  his rights, development, and progress, and so that the sedition  will continue as it continues in Lebanon and Afghanistan.    Our honorable brothers in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region,  disarm the combating warriors of their weapons and then turn the  weapons against their leaders because they, by God, are  implementing the schemes of imperialism, Zionist, and  reactionism and are igniting a fire that will consume everything  in Kurdistan. Turn the fire of God against the traitors of the  homeland and the people. Chase the enemies of God in Kurdistan  and reject their ugly presence because we, by God, are a people  who only accept friends from within themselves. In the name of  God, the merciful, the compassionate: O ye who believe take not  for your friends unbelievers rather than believers; do ye wish  to offer God an open proof against yourselves?    [Signed] The Legislative Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous  Region, the Executive Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous  region, and the representatives of the Kurdistan Autonomous  Region at the National Assembly</p>

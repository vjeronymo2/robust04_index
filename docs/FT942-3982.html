			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / World News in Brief: Footsie rises strongly despite Tory losses London's equity market moved up strongly, shrugging off the news that the Conservative party had suffered defeats in five by-elections, and ahead of expected losses in the European elections. The FT-SE 100 index closed at the day's best level of 3,055.9, up 27 points on the session and up 58.1, or 1.9 per cent, over the week. Much of the impetus for the gain came from better than expected mid-week data on manufacturing output. London stocks, Page 15; Markets, Weekend II</p>

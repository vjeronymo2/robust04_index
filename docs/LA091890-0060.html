			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PROPOSITION 135;  </P> <P> GROWERS PLAY UP PESTICIDE MEASURE'S MEDFLY PROVISION  </P> <P> Backers of Proposition 135, a grower-financed pesticide initiative on the  November ballot, kicked off their campaign Monday by appealing to Southern  Californians frustrated by aerial sprayings of malathion to eradicate the  Mediterranean fruit fly.  </P> <P> Gathered in a wholesale fruit market in Los Angeles, the measure's proponents  made it clear they are out to defeat Proposition 128, a rival initiative known  by its supporters as "Big Green." That measure would ban at least 20 pesticides  that cause cancer or birth defects in humans or laboratory animals.  </P> <P> "Our initiative does something that Proposition 128 does not do," said Bob L.  Vice, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation. "It speaks to the  issue of the Medfly problem."  </P> <P> By calling for doubling the production of sterile Medflies, the growers'  initiative is designed to tap into widespread irritation in Southern California  over aerial spraying. Without banning spraying, Proposition 135 attempts to  ensure a greater supply of sterile Medflies, which could reduce aerial  pesticide application in future eradication campaigns.  </P> <P> Opponents of Proposition 135 denounced the Medfly provision as a "cynical ploy"  to confuse voters about which measure actually does more to remove unsafe  pesticides from the market. Indeed, many of the supporters of Proposition 135  have defended aerial spraying in the past, while some of the architects of  Proposition 128, which does not address Medfly spraying, have been outspoken  against the eradication campaign.  </P> <P> "The Department of Food and Agriculture already has the power to (increase  sterile Medfly production). . . ," said Proposition 128 supporter David Bunn,  research director for Pesticide Watch, an environmental group. "Proposing this  language is like a slap in the face, coming from the most vociferous advocates  of spraying pesticides on people."  </P> <P> Agricultural interests placed Proposition 135 on the ballot in an attempt to  nullify the more stringent pesticide provisions in Proposition 128. If  Proposition 135 gets more votes than its rival, the growers' measure will  become law. While Proposition 128 would create an elected environmental  advocate to enforce environmental laws, the growers' measure would make the  governor-appointed secretary for environmental affairs responsible for  overseeing pesticide laws.  </P> <P> Supporters of Proposition 135 say their measure would double the amount of  testing for pesticide residue on foods. Opponents contend that the measure  actually would reduce pesticide monitoring by transferring the cost of the  program -- now paid for in part by a tax on pesticides -- to the general fund,  which would be vulnerable to cutbacks during budget squeezes.  </P> <P> Proposition 135 also would keep responsibility for pesticide safety largely  within the state Department of Food and Agriculture, which traditionally has  defended pesticide use. The department would distribute $25 million set aside  by the initiative for studies to find alternatives to dangerous pesticides.  </P> <P> Proposition 128, on the other hand, would transfer responsibility for testing  to the Department of Health Services and give the environmental advocate  responsibility for distributing $20 million in competitive grants for research  into alternatives to the pesticides being phased out.  </P> <P> Supporters of Proposition 135 said they have raised $2 million toward a  $5-million goal, with about 80% earmarked for television and radio advertising.  Vice said the campaign has returned donations sent by chemical interests to  ensure that voters will identify the initiative with farmers instead of  pesticide makers.  </P></p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Strong demand for Hungarian offering Hungary's largest initial public offering so far this year opened yesterday, a 29 per cent state-owned tranche in pharmaceuticals producer Egis. Part of the Dollars 44m issue is available on preferential terms in exchange for 'compensation coupons,' special state securities granted to victims of communist expropriation. The issue met strong demand from local investors. Some compensation coupon holders and speculators had begun queueing last Friday and police had to intervene yesterday in Budapest to prevent scuffles and restore order to the queues. Foreign institutional investors, for whom 16 per cent of Egis is earmarked, have also shown keen interest. Although subscriptions for cash payment only begin today, early indications are that the foreign component will be two to three times oversubscribed. Egis shares have been priced at about half the Budapest Stock Exchange average, at just 7.3 times forecast 1994 after-tax earnings of Ft1.87bn (Dollars 18m). The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development bought a 30 per cent stake in Egis in December last year and the purchase price is linked to the flotation value of the pharmaceutical company. The EBRD will therefore pay Dollars 45m for its shareholding, bringing the total raised in the privatisation of Egis to Dollars 89m and making the complete transaction the largest so far in Hungary this year. Egis will also become the second largest company on the Budapest Stock Exchange when it gains a listing in the middle of July. Lead manager for the Egis transaction is CS First Boston, the international investment bank. CSFB and CA Securities, a subsidiary of Austria's Creditanstalt group, have dominated Hungary's new issue market this year. The Egis IPO is one of a series of equity issues by Hungarian drugs groups, a sector in which the country is traditionally strong. Shares in Chinoin and Pharmavit go on sale later this week. Richter Gedeon, Hungary's largest pharmaceuticals company, is expected to follow Egis on to the stock market next month in a transaction of comparable value. Schroders, the UK merchant bank and CA Securities are advising on the sale of about 30 per cent of the company.</p>

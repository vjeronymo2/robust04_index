			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Switzerland shrugs off 'No' vote ZURICH yesterday shrugged off the rejection by Swiss voters in Sunday's referendum to join the European Economic Area (EEA), writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. 'We were all braced for a very bad day. Maybe there will be a bit of a correction tomorrow, but it seems that the Christmas rally is upon us,' said Mr Silvan Trachsler, head of research at Union Bank of Switzerland. But many analysts believe that the value of most Swiss equities will be hurt in the short- to medium-term by the people's decision to remain outside the expanded European single market. 'I cannot see how this is going to make things better for any Swiss shares,' said Mr Stephan Meier, head of Swiss equity investment research at Swiss Bank Corporation. Mr Trachsler agrees: 'In the long term, Switzerland will have problems being outside the EEA. Growth will be lower and unemployment will be higher.' But yesterday, the widely anticipated, negative reaction to the 'No' vote did not mat-erialise. The Swiss franc opened lower against the D-Mark but soon recovered to close at Friday's level of SFr0.896 to the German currency. The Swiss Index of leading shares was up 19.5 at 1,954.5, with advances occurring on a broad front. Among international stocks, Roche PC's rose SFr30 to SFr3,930 and Nestle registered shares put on SFr15 to SFr1,085. The all-share Swiss Performance Index was up 5.4 at 1,164.19, discrediting the view expressed in advance of the vote that there would be an exodus from the vulnerable second-tier, manufacturing shares to blue chips in the event of a 'No' vote. The only immediate victim of the 'No' vote was Swissair, which stands to be the only major airline in Europe that will not participate automat-ically in the planned liberalisation of air traffic within the EEA. Swissair bearers fell SFr35 to SFr445. Some machinery exporters were also hit: Sulzer registered shares fell SFr4 to SFr546, Georg Fisher bearers lost SFr25 to SFr680 and Von Roll bearers lost SFr30 to SFr570. Analysts suggested that there had been a lot of short-selling last week in anticipation of a rejection of the treaty, and these positions had to be covered quickly yesterday morning when it became apparent that the market had fully discounted the result. Mr Pierre Tissot, an analyst with the Geneva bankers Lombard, Odier, said that was a plausible interpretation of the performance of the Union Bank of Switzerland bearer share which opened at SFr810, SFr7 below Friday's close, but finished SFr5 ahead at SFr822. Mr Tissot argued that banks' profits too would be affected if the rejection of the EEA prolonged the recession in the Swiss economy. Analysts' main concern was for export-oriented manufacturers with substantial production bases in Switzerland, companies such as Sulzer Brothers, Georg Fisher, Landis &amp; Gyr and Von Roll. Their Swiss-made products would now have to pass approvals in each European country while all their European competitors would have automatic entry. An analyst at James Capel said that the strength of the rejection would make the boards of manufacturing companies look closely at moving out at least part of their activities. 'The Swiss people may eventually change their minds, but these companies cannot take the risk,' he said. Other Efta stock markets took Switzerland's 'No' to closer ties with the European Community in their stride, writes Our Markets Staff. VIENNA, little changed on the day, saw low volume ahead of today's holiday. Activity was also stunted by a break-down in the electronic trading system of the OTOB futures and options exchange. The ATX index rose 1.44 to 755.75. OSLO closed mostly higher with biggest gains coming in cyclical stocks. The all-share index rose 0.85 to 376.21 in trading worth NKr225.8m. Elkem A shares added NKr2 to NKr25 while Norske Skog's A shares finished NKr5 higher at NKr74. Bergesen A shares added NKr4 to NKr102.5. STOCKHOLM recovered after a weak opening, as the dampening effect of the Swiss 'No' quickly wore off. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 7.0 to 871.4 as turnover dropped sharply to SKr451m from SKr727m. The ball-bearings group SKF, which rose last week on takeover speculation, slipped SKr1.5 to SKr78.50 on profit-taking. HELSINKI closed higher in active trading, as the HEX index closed 13.1 or 1.5 per cent higher at 870.0 in turnover of FM140.1m. FRANKFURT largely ignored the Swiss 'No' vote and was mildly encouraged by some fresh corporate news. The DAX index put on 3.16 to 1,525.32 as turnover shrank to DM3bn from DM4.4bn. Among the banks, Dresdner was the latest to report 10-month results, in line with expections and the shares improved DM1 to DM353.50. The market now awaits Deutsche's figures, due today, which are forecast to be flat to slightly lower. The shares were up DM2 at DM667. Bayerverein, which also reported good 10-month results, rose just 50 pfg to DM418.50. Degussa, up DM7.30 at DM334.50, surprised the market with better-than-expected earnings in fiscal 1991/1992, with the pharmaceuticals division performing well. Other chemical stocks were unmoved by the news, with Hoechst down DM2.50 at DM233.60, BASF 10 pfg weaker at DM207.40 and Bayer down 30 pfg at DM254.50 as the outlook for 1993 remains depressed. PARIS focused on special situations as the CAC-40 index ended 6.93 higher at 1,788.61 in low turnover of FFr1.9bn. Rhone-Poulenc CIs rose FFr14 to FFr506 in response to news late last week that the government had postponed its plans to sell a substantial minority stake in the chemicals group because of poor market conditions. Shares in Club Mediterranee rose FFr6.30 to FFr345 following news that it returned to profit in the year ended October 31. Havas closed at the day's low of FFr421, down FFr1350 or 3.1 per cent, after its chairman Pierre Dauzier told shareholders that he saw no improvement in the media group's markets in 1993 and expects 1993's profit to be around the same as in 1992. Elf was steady at FFr346. After the close, the oil company's chairman said he could not rule out a 35 per cent drop in profit in 1992. MILAN saw some privatisation candidates rise sharply in a largely deserted market due to the semi-holiday in Milan yesterday and today's national holiday. The Comit index rose 7.37 to 430.92 in turnover estimated at L120bn after Friday's L178.5bn. State-controlled stocks were lifted by prime minister Giuliano Amato's statement late on Friday that the treasury minister Piero Barucci was heading the government team on privatisations, thereby taking Mr Barucci's side in a recent dispute with the industry minister on privatisations. Credito Italiano added L180 or 6.5 per cent to L2,950 while Assitalia put on L539 or 7.1 per cent to L8,099. AMSTERDAM lost ground in the afternoon as the dollar weakened, while the lack of corporate news kept interest low. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.2 at 105.8. Unilever advanced Fl 1.60 to Fl 186.30 and Elsevier was Fl 1 firmer at Fl 118.10.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 7  THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Open     10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1053.77   1055.47   1056.80  1057.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1136.92   1137.09   1138.55  1143.43                           13.00     14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1058.58   1058.93   1057.38  1056.02 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1141.03   1139.76   1139.48  1137.52  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Dec 4     Dec 3     Dec 2     Dec 1    Nov 30 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1052.78   1055.11   1052.11   1056.79   1057.75 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1133.53   1136.09   1130.96   1135.62   1132.14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1059.15; 200 - 1145.44 Low/day: 100 - 1053.77  200 - 1135.53  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

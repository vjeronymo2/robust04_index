			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie recaptures 3,000 mark in good volume - Market report The latest official statistics on domestic inflation and employment found a very positive response in the UK stock market yesterday. The FT-SE Index rose by more than 40 points to close convincingly above the 3,000 mark which has proved a barrier since the middle of last month. Reports that continental European funds had been buyers of shares in London were borne out by an increase of around one fifth in trading volume. After breaking though the Footsie 3,000 mark in early trading, the market remained firm behind a positive British government bonds sector. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,005.5 for a net gain on the day of 41.4. The lead came from a powerful recovery in the stock index futures sector, depressed on the previous day by a heavy sell-off by a US fund. After struggling for several sessions, the September contract on the Footsie moved up to a significant premium against the cash market yesterday morning and held solidly above 3,000 until the close. A steadier trend in the US dollar set the stage for market recoveries across Europe. London sloughed off a bout of nervousness in mid-afternoon when rumours circulated in Europe that the Federal Reserve might, after all, be about to raise rates in the US. But the very slight increase in US June consumer prices was in line with expectations, and the bout of nerves appeared to reflect nothing more than the Fed's failure to supply liquidity at its traditional time for intervention. Today brings the latest US retail sales data which will provide the latest focus for caution in European securities markets. Share prices opened higher, in line with firmness in the US dollar and other European bond and stock markets. But the chief boost to UK equities came from the release of the day's batch of domestic economic data at mid-morning. Steady headline inflation of 2.6 per cent for June, with the underlying rate 0.1 per cent easier, steady underlying wage inflation of 3.75 per cent and a fall in unemployment in May, underpinned the market's most optimistic scenario of economic growth and subdued inflation. The influence of the futures market could be seen in the pattern of trading. Of total Seaq volume of 720.8m shares, around 50 per cent was in the Footsie-listed shares, a higher proportion than usual and an indication of substantial activity in the blue chip stocks which make up the Footsie contract. However, the second line stocks were sufficiently active to lift the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 27.8 to 3,493.7. On Tuesday, retail or customer business was worth Pounds 1.19bn, confirming the return to levels of turnover associated with the long-running bull market in London. Increasing reports that international funds may be moving out of dollar-based securities and towards European bonds, with UK gilts in particular favour, gained some credence yesterday from the strong performance of the London market. Late trading saw bond markets ease back from the day's highs, however. Some nervousness was again expressed regarding the powerful influence exerted by the futures markets, but it is now widely recognised that the stock index futures are the conventional route by which international funds seek to change their asset stance in global markets and that the London futures market has established itself as an important stage for these operations.</p>

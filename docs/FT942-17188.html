			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Reorganised IBC improves International Business Communications (Holdings), the newsletter publishing, conference and electronic data services group, reported a solid increase in underlying operating profits in 1993, while pre-tax profits of Pounds 43.1m were swollen by a Pounds 38.2m one-off profit on the redemption of senior loans. As expected, IBC is returning to the dividend list with a 2p payment. The shares closed 21p higher at 207p. The group has undertaken a substantial reorganisation in recent years including a reconstruction of its balance sheet partly through a Pounds 20m placing and open offer successfully competed in July last year. As a result Mr Peter Rigby, chief executive, said that IBC was now 'a normal company'. He said the reduction in the debt burden, which fell from Pounds 76.4m to Pounds 14.5m at end-December, 'means that a very real obstacle to the group's future progress and well being has been removed'. Turnover rose by 9.2 per cent to Pounds 60.5m (Pounds 55.4m) and operating profits were ahead 23 per cent at Pounds 7.51m, reflecting 'considerable progress both in overall terms and in operating margins'. Net continuing interest payments fell to Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 2.54m), producing profits on ordinary activities of Pounds 6.09m (Pounds 3.58m). However, there was non-continuing debenture interest of Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 2.83m) and the exceptional Pounds 38.2m profit, resulting in the inflated full-year pre-tax result against Pounds 752,000 in 1992. Earnings per share increased to 163p (5.3p). However, Mr Rigby suggested that the 49 per cent increase in adjusted headline earnings to 13p (8.7p) represented 'a more relevant performance indicator'. COMMENT IBC's underlying performance was somewhat ahead of market expectations and highlights the group's capacity to generate cash and profits from its two core businesses. The balance sheet reconstruction has resulted in a level of debt which the group can well afford to service and long suffering shareholders have been rewarded with a resumption of dividends. Providing the upturn in evidence in the final quarter is sustained, pre-tax profits of about Pounds 7.3m are likely and, with a tax charge which is likely to remain at about the 18 per cent level, earnings of about 15p per share are expected. The shares have climbed from a low of 45p a year ago, but could still go higher.</p>

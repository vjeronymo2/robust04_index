			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TALKS BEGIN ON TEACHER SALARIES  </P> <P> Representatives of the Los Angeles Unified School District board and its  teachers' union went into negotiations at school district headquarters Sunday  in an effort to end their yearlong labor dispute.  </P> <P> After about four hours, the head of the teachers' union, Wayne Johnson, emerged  to say that he would "pull the plug" on the talks if more rapid progress was  not made quickly.  </P> <P> Johnson said the teachers, who have been seeking a 12% one-year pay increase,  had reduced their demand to 11%. But he said no counter offer had been received  from the school board, which had retired to a closed-door session.  </P> <P> The entire school board and officers of the union were in attendance. A state  mediator was shuttling information between the two sides. The talks had been  billed as face-to-face, around-the-clock negotiations, but as of Sunday  evening, Johnson, school board President Roberta Weintraub and their respective  aides had not sat down together.  </P></p>

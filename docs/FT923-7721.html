			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Police pay board calls for 6.5% rise POLICE OFFICERS' pay is likely to rise by 6.5 per cent this year even though average earnings, which determine police pay, have risen by less than that. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, will shortly consider the recommendations of the Police Negotiating Board for a 6.5 per cent rise amid growing pressure for the government to restrain public-sector earnings. If he wanted to take a hard line he could press for the rise to be restricted to 6.25 per cent - saving about Pounds 10m - without breaking the government's pledge to link police pay to average earnings increases. The Department of Employment last week revised the average earnings figure for the year to May - the period which determines police officers' rises - to 6.25 per cent from the 6.5 per cent reported previously. A decision to make the rise 6.25 per cent would signal the government's determination to tighten its grip on public pay but it would infuriate the 129,000 police officers who already feel insecure because of a government inquiry into their pay and conditions. The negotiating board made its recommendation of a 6.5 per cent rise before last week's revision of the earnings figure. Members said yesterday they would be surprised if their recommendation were overturned.</p>

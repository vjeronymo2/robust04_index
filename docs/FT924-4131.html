			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (5): Tax privileges still on offer - Co-ordination centres have not lost their allure after 10 years BELGIAN 'co-ordination centres' will be 10 years old on December 30. That was the day in 1982, when the government - endowed with special powers to cope with the growing economic crisis - authorised tax-breaks for companies operating certain financial and management services out of Belgium. If there is a birthday party, it could be a particularly crowded one. As of February this year, there were some 295 co-ordination centres in Belgium, employing 6,550 people and total capital of BFr900bn (Pounds 18bn). The corporations involved include Goodyear, General Motors and IBM; while a number of Belgian companies with international interests have also found it worthwhile to spin off some of their activities and form co-ordination centres. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister, smiles at the idea that the concept's allure may have diminished over the past decade. In fact, he has recently made a number of technical amendments to the original legislation, because, 'it was really too attractive,' he says. 'Even after those adjustments, it is still attractive, as you can see from the number of inquiries I get.' The basic attraction of the co-ordination centre is that it allows the multinational to make cost savings, by shielding centralised management activities from income tax. Centres are also exempt from tax on initial capital or capital increases, and from real-estate tax. As the Belgian finance ministry points out, in its brochure on the centres scheme: '(The legislation) allows a broad range of sophisticated intra-group financing operations to be carried out in a virtually tax-free environment.' The co-ordination centre concept is not specifically aimed at encouraging the establishment of international holding companies on Belgian territory. Separate fiscal attractions help Belgium compete with neighbouring Luxembourg and the Netherlands in that area - for example, under general Belgian rules, dividends received are 95 per cent tax-exempt. But the legislation on co-ordination centres stipulates that the centres cannot hold shares in any other company. In addition, the centres' activities are carefully restricted. For example, they cannot sell accounting services outside the group to which they belong, but they can do the accounts for affiliated companies, and charge for it. Leasing, factoring, reinvoicing and financing can be done from the centre, as can insurance, research, publicity and information, data-processing and advertising. The list is not exhaustive: all co-ordination centre proposals have to be vetted by the Belgian authorities, which collaborate with potential investors to tailor a centre to the multinationals' needs. Apart from anything else, the scheme was fortuitously timed, coinciding with the rapid growth in Brussels' political influence. As Mr Julian Oliver, of American Express Europe, which was in the first wave of companies to set up co-ordination centres, points out, tax-breaks alone are not responsible for the idea's success: 'Brussels is geographically close to the industrial heartland of Europe, and obviously it's the political capital of Europe.' According to Mr Remi Troch, of Deloitte &amp; Touche's Antwerp office, the recent legislative changes - which allow existing centres to apply for renewal of their status for a further 10 years - have not reduced the basic financial attractions of the concept. For example, the holding HQ can borrow funds from the co-ordination centre to buy shares: the borrowing charges relating to the purchase of shares are tax-deductible under Belgian law, but the interest income earned by the co-ordination centre is tax-exempt. Some who have benefited from the tax privileges of the scheme are amazed that this apparent 'tilting of the level playing field' can still happen as the single European market is put in place. But as Mr Troch told a recent seminar on European tax: 'Nobody knows how long this government will last and they do need a lot of money, but so far with all the changes they have made, this has not yet been questioned.'</p>

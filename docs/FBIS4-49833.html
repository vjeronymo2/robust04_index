			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Ping (1728 5393): "Implement the Major </F> Instructions Given by Zhu Rongji and the Problems Resolved by  Him During His Inspection Tour of Heilongjiang"]    [Text] On the morning of 27 April, the provincial party  committee and the provincial government held a meeting of  principal responsible persons of pertinent provincial-level  departments to research how to implement the major instructions  given by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and the several major problems  resolved by him during his inspection tour of Heilongjiang with  a view to promoting the province's reform, development, and  stability.    Provincial leaders Tian Fengshan, Ma Guoliang, Cong Fukui,  and Yang Zhihai attended the meeting and made speeches.    Pertinent departments of the provincial party committee and  the provincial government have done a lot of painstaking work as  quickly as possible and assigned, through rapid arrangement and  research, the tasks of implementing the problems resolved by the  state for the province.    Tian Fengshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, pointed out at the meeting: The whole province  should reach a common understanding in regarding Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji's major instructions and the problems resolved by him  during this inspection tour of Heilongjiang as a major  transition and opportunity for the province's reform, opening  up, and economic development. Since the beginning of this year,  leaders of the party and the state have listened to the reports  on the province's reform and development situation delivered by  the provincial party committee and the provincial government.  Entrusted by comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji personally led responsible comrades of pertinent  ministries and commissions of the state Heilongjiang Province to  conduct investigations and help the province tackle a series of  difficulties and problems. From the inspection tour itself and  from the problems resolved by central leaders for the province,  we can catch sight of the great concern over Heilongjiang by the  CPC Central Committee and the State Council, which will produce  great influence on the province's production and development.  Therefore, successfully implementing the important instructions  given by Zhu Rongji and other central leading comrades and the  major problems resolved by them for the province is by no means  an ordinary work, but is really a great event of the province as  a whole. These instructions will provide the province with an  opportunity to accelerate development and will effect a major  transition in our work.    Tian Fengshan said: In implementing the important  instructions given by central leading comrades and the problems  resolved by them, the most important thing is to bring the  province's work into line with the general pattern of the whole  country and to accelerate the development of Heilongjiang in the  course of continuously making contributions to the country. In  doing research for the province's agricultural development,  Comrade Zhu Rongji pointed out: "Heilongjiang is the largest  grain base and a grain reserve base of a strategic significance  in China. To feed Chinese people, we should depend on  Heilongjiang." "There are at least 50 million mu of undeveloped  land that can be reclaimed and 80 million mu of low-yield  farmland that can be transformed." "If we invest 10 billion  yuan in Heilongjiang, we can take 200,000 tonnes of soybean and  several hundred thousand tonnes of corn every year, equal to an  output value of some 10 billion yuan. With this, we can tackle  eating problems for our descendants." All these aspirations and  demands have been set forth from a strategic high plane of  overall interest. Comrade Zhu Rongji also talked about the  issues concerning the development of Daqing, concerning the  rapid renovation of old industrial bases and the invigoration of  large and medium-sized enterprises, concerning the expansion of  opening up, foreign trade, and economic and technological  cooperation, and concerning vigorous development of township and  town enterprises. All these aspirations and demands have been  set forth from the high plane of the overall interest and from  the general economic pattern of the whole country. We should  attend to these issues by proceeding from the overall situation  of the country. In particular, it is a huge project to reclaim  the 50 million mu of undeveloped land and to transform the 80  million mu of low-yield farmland. We should exert great efforts  in this project and conscientiously plan, appraise, and carry it  out. Achieving success in this project, we will not only make  contributions to the state but also develop ourselves through  the contributions. So is the case in other fields.    Tian Fengshan pointed out: The most fundamental work for  implementing the guidelines of the instructions on  Heilongjiang's work given by Zhu Rongji and other central  leading comrades and the important issues they have resolved is  to further clarify our ideas for reform, development, and  stability. On many occasions, Zhu Rongji talked about the  "desire to probe more ideas for addressing the issues on  Heilongjiang's development, reform, and stability." He also  said: "It will not work for us to come here to spend a lot of  money. Spending money cannot solve problems. We should explore  an idea and unify thinking to solve problems." Concluding his  inspection tour, he said that Heilongjiang should unify  understanding of four issues. This actually indicated the  direction of our future work. We should acquire a profound  understanding of it and study and implement it in line with  reality.    Tian Fengshan pointed out: The most crucial point in  implementing the guidelines of the instructions on  Heilongjiang's work given by Zhu Rongji and other central  leading comrades and the important issues they have resolved is  to base ourselves and focus on our specific conditions. The  party Central Committee and the State Council have attached  great importance to Heilongjiang's development, understood our  difficulties, and helped us address specific issues. They  resolved not only extremely urgent issues but also issues on  long-term development; resolved not only the key issues on  industries but also issues on trades; and not only resolved  issues on funds and projects but also provided policies. This  will not only help us overcome the current difficulties and  maintain provincewide economic and social stability but also  help promote Heilongjiang's development. More importantly, it  will play an important role in heightening our spirit and in  helping us overcome difficulties, unify thinking, enhance our  confidence, unite as one, and make Heilongjiang's work  successful. It should be noted that the central authorities  have indeed helped Heilongjiang address many issues, but it is  our own efforts we should rely on to ultimately solve problems  and achieve development. We must enhance the sense of urgency  and responsibility and seize the favorable opportunity provided  by Vice Premier Zhu's inspection in our province to  conscientiously work to promote Heilongjiang's economic and  social development.    Tian Fengshan emphasized: We should establish and institute  the strict responsibility system characterized by division of  work among leaders, pay close attention to implementation of the  responsibilities, and achieve real good results. After several  days of work, we have sorted out our problems and roughly  divided them into three categories. In the first category are  the issues the state have explicitly agreed to resolve totally  or partly or those it has the intention to resolve. Whether  these issues can be resolved is the key to whether we can seize  the opportunity and achieve the greatest results. Particularly  regarding the issues toward which principles and attitude have  been provided but specific and clear guidance is still lacking,  we should exert efforts to make these issued resolved to the  maximum. In the second category are issues that the state  agreed to further study and coordinate efforts to resolve or  those which cannot be resolved for the time being due to lack of  necessary conditions and should be considered in the future.  Regarding these issues, we should submit reports to strive for  their resolution. Our reports should be based on reason and  just grounds and should be accurate, and we should do this work  faster and include these issues in the issues to be resolved by  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji so as to make our work easier. In the  third category are the opinions and demands we put forward which  the various ministries and commissions of the state did not  agree or toward which they have yet to take a stand. If, in  this category, there are issues conducive to Heilongjiang's  development and also not harmful to the overall interests, we  should strive for state assistance to resolve them. In  particular, we must never give up the issues which the  ministries and commissions said would decide depending on the  situation in the second half of this year or in the future.    We should foster confidence, approach from a long-term  point of view, and do solid work to enjoy the support of the  state. Although some of the problems have not been mentioned in  our reports except for the problems of these three categories,  the departments concerned should pay full attention to the  petroleum, coal, grain, war, forest industries' problems in  deepening reform, reducing the staff, improving efficiency, and  developing the tertiary industry as well as the problems  relating to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline  occupation, and fishery, as set forth by Vice Premier Zhu and  the state ministry and committee leaders; and strive to make  achievements in solving these problems through investigations  and study, coordination, and proof.    Tian Fengshan pointed out: It is necessary to persist in the  principle that whoever is in charge should assume  responsibility. The leading cadres at various levels must  personally organize forces to engage in the work assigned to  them, personally "run around to departments," and specifically  and meticulously fulfill their work. On no account must the  activities of not putting the work in place, not assuming  responsibility, shifting responsibility onto others, and even  practicing bureaucracy bring about losses to work. We should  concentrate time and energy and go all out to grasp our work. We  should be sure to create conditions if there are no conditions  and to be good at using conditions if there are any. Work must  not, in the slightest degree, be put off. All fronts should  make concerted efforts and positively work in coordination with  one another. As for the problems relating to two or more  departments , all departments should exchange views with one  another and go into action in a coordinate manner.  Provincial-level leaders and responsible comrades of relevant  departments should take command in solving the problems if the  situation needs. What we should particularly stress is that no  departments are allowed to substitute the departmental interests  for the interests of the whole or to shift responsibilities onto  others. We should carry out the work perseveringly through to  the end; strive to make achievements; ensure that there must be  assured sources, results, and echoes of handling problems; and  not give up halfway.    In regard to the province's tasks in 1994, Tian Fengshan  stressed: Persistently focusing the overall economic work on  increasing economic results is not only an urgent ask at present  but also a long-term strategic task. We must rely on not only  the improvement of the macroeconomic environment but also the  enterprises' efforts to strengthen the microeconomy. Therefore,  persistently on the basis of the existing effective methods, the  province as a whole should adopt all realistic measures to  improve economic results. At the beginning of the year, the  province made arrangements for industrial production. We should  continue to grasp the implementation of the arrangements. So  far, two aspects must be stressed. One is to create external  environments for enterprises and to give them more assistance.  The other is to positively guide the enterprises to turn their  eyes inward, build up their internal strength, and concentrate  more energy on reform, transformation, and management. In  regard to agriculture, we should comprehensively grasp  agriculture and the rural work in line with the idea of large-  scale agriculture and lay particular stress on tightening up  fists to grasp spring sowing. The most realistic measure for  increasing production is to do farm work in the right season.  The most important task at present is to grasp spring sowing.  We will gain the initiative in doing the work of the whole year  when we win a victory in this battle. Therefore, the people  from higher levels downward, particularly relevant departments  and all prefectures, counties, and townships, should concentrate  this period of time to grasp spring sowing and go to the  forefront of spring sowing to conduct investigations and study,  grasp the situation, and solve problems. Of course, the  arrangements and distributions of the leadership forces and work  forces should be scientific and reasonable. In particular, we  should make a unified arrangement for developing town and  township enterprises and the county-level economy and positively  promote their development. Although greater achievements have  been made in the past years, we are still confronted with big  difficulties. We should exert efforts to grasp the study of  countermeasures and explore new cooperation forms and  cooperation spheres.    A prominent issue at present is to  concentrate efforts on making well prepared for the fifth Harbin  border trade and local economic talks. The province as a whole  should regard the talks as a motive force in improving the  foreign economic and trade work to a new level. In commodity  circulation, we should organize the sources of goods in a  down-to-earth manner; ensure goods supply for festive periods;  stabilize the markets; make things convenient for the mass; and  make the economy prosperous. Efforts should be made to  accelerate and push forward the reform in the circulation field.  It is particularly necessary to continuously concentrate  efforts on having state-owned commercial and service  enterprises, enterprises owned by the state but run by  individuals, and wholesale enterprises change their track and  style so as to enable the circulation field to further become  brisk. As for security and fire prevention work, various  localities and departments should attach great importance on  them; strictly enforce the responsibility system; implement the  measures of being on guard; and realistically do a good job in  preventing fires among forest zones, urban areas, and coal mines  as well as in stressing safe production chiefly among  construction and installation enterprises.    Tian Fengshan emphatically pointed out in concluding his  speech: A good job should be further done in the work of keeping  stable. Maintaining the stability represents an important  content of creating a whole situation in the work undertaken by  the entire party this year. Without political stability and  social peace, we are in no position to carry out reform, opening  up, and development. First, we should emphatically do a good job  in dealing with the hot problems for which the masses have shown  concern. In line with the demand set by the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission, we should make unified arrangement in the  anticorruption struggle; continuously and successfully grasp the  struggle; and score marked results in the struggle so as to win  the people's trust. We should adopt an earnest attitude toward  the problems of markets and commodity prices. Relaxing the  restriction on the marketing prices of many commodities does not  mean to cancel the macro control over prices. In particular, we  should resolutely bring under control the prices of the people's  necessities, such as grains, vegetables, and nonstaple  foodstuffs. Efforts should be made to realistically enhance the  comprehensive management of public security and to deal heavy  blows in a timely manner at serious crimes. Second, a good job  should be realistically done in dealing with the problems of  production and livelihood of staff members and workers, which  have encountered by enterprises that are in the state of  production suspension or semi suspension. We should enhance the  work of handling the petition letters from the mass and  receiving the petition visits paid by the people and  realistically assume the responsibility in the work. This  represents the important work of maintaining the stability and  the concrete expression of the party in fulfilling its purpose  of serving the people wholeheartedly. Third, a good job should  be done in stabilizing the work undertaken by higher educational  institutions. While enhancing the positive education, attention  should be paid to adopting multiple forms suitable to the youth  characteristics so as to lead youths to concentrate their  efforts on showing concern for reform, modernizations, and  studies.    Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, delivered a speech at the meeting, in which he  pointed out: Efforts should be made to seize the historical  opportunity and to broaden the opening up. Units from top to  bottom across the province should unify their thinking, heighten  their spirit, and be reliant or become strong independently. To  turn the factors that are restricting the province's development  into strong points, cadres at all levels should train hard in  their professional skills; truly grasp study and do practical  deeds for their work; and carry forward the spirit of making  all-out efforts. They should fulfill the target harbored by  them, turn the concerns shown by the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council into motive forces, and be worthy of the great  trust the 36 million people place in them. In line with the  demand of seizing the opportunity, various departments should  vigorously grasp the implementation of tasks; broaden the  achievements; make a breakthrough in key areas; and achieve  overall progress. Cadres at all levels should improve their  work style, be vigorously willing to go down to grass-roots  level units, and commonly make efforts with these units to  improve the work as soon as possible.    Vice Governor Cong Fukui also delivered a speech at the  meeting, in which he pointed out: Various localities should do  a good job in relaying and implementing the work arrangements  recently made by the provincial party committee and the  provincial people's government. They should actively make  concerted efforts in relaying and implementing the arrangements  and start the implementation of these arrangements as soon as  possible so as to enable every work arrangement to be in place  at an early date.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: London Forfaiting rises by 67% to top Pounds 15m LONDON Forfaiting Company, the specialist trade finance house, yesterday reported a 67 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 15.1m in the 1991 year. The previous year's profit was Pounds 9.05m. Mr Jack Wilson, chief executive, said the improvement stemmed from concentrating on the core forfaiting business while withdrawing from areas such as project finance and Eurobonds. Forfaiting is the provision of trade finance through fixed rate loans which are sold at a discount to investors such as banks. Trading income increased from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 17.3m and net interest received increased to 4.96m (Pounds 3.69m). Earnings per share more than doubled to 11.52p (5.71p). An increased final dividend of 5p is recommended, making a total for the year of 7.625p (7.25p). The company said its Middle East operations, based in Cyprus, increased profits following the ending of the Gulf war. The Hong Kong office and Italian subsidiary performed well. It has also established a representative office in New York.</p>

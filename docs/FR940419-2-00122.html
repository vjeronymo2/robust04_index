This order approves the proposed rule change as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Liability of Governors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Delaware's General Corporation Law permits the adoption of a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation of a Delaware corporation that limits or eliminates the potential monetary liability of directors to the corporation or its shareholders by reason of their conduct as directors under certain circumstances. Such a provision does not apply to acts or omissions of directors occurring prior to the approval of the provision by shareholders and the filing of the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the CHX is a Delaware Corporation, the amendment to Article Eleventh of its Certificate of Incorporation is based on section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware Corporations Code. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Section 102(b)(7) permits corporations to include in their certificates of incorporation a provision limiting or eliminating the personal liability of directors to the corporation and its shareholders for monetary damages for a breach of their fiduciary duty. The statute does not permit the limitation or elimination of director's liability under the following circumstances: (1) A breach of the director's duty of loyalty, (2) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (3) unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or (4) any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  In addition, the statute does not permit the adoption of any provision that would eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or omission occurring prior to the date when such provision becomes effective. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Del. Code Ann. title 8, &sect;102(b)(7) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Delaware statute does not eliminate a director's fiduciary duty, but rather prevents the imposition of monetary damages in the event of a breach of that duty. Other legal remedies for breach of fiduciary duty, such as rescission and injunction, remain available under the Delaware provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendment to the CHX's Certificate of Incorporation limits the liability of Governors to the fullest extent of Delaware Law. The amendment includes the exclusions from limited liability enumerated in Delaware section 207(b)(7) and adds an exclusion where liability arises directly or indirectly as a result of a violation of a federal securities laws. The amendment also eliminates Governor monetary liability for acts occurring after the amendment becomes effective to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by Delaware law, thus automatically incorporating any future statutory revisions limiting Governor liability. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> A similar amendment to the Constitution was approved by the Board, the membership and the Securities and Exchange Commission in late 1989 and early 1990. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27625 (January 16, 1989), 55 FR 2470 (January 24, 1990). However, the requisite number of membership votes was not obtained to amend the Certificate of Incorporation under the then existing voting requirement. The CHX put the 1989 proposal to a vote of its members in 1990. At that time, the Exchange's rules requiring only a majority of the members present at a meeting to approve a change to the Constitution, while requiring a majority of the entire membership to approve changes to the Certificate of Incorporation. The Exchange was able to pass the amendment to the Constitution, but did not have sufficient votes to amend its Certificate of Incorporation. The discrepancy in the number of votes needed to amend the Constitution and the Certificate of Incorporation was removed in the Exchange's corporate restructuring which the Commission approved in 1992. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31633 (December 22, 1992), 57 FR 62402 (December 30, 1992). The standard for amending both the CHX's Constitution and Certificate of Incorporation is now a majority of the members present at a meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

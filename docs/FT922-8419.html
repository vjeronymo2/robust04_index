			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Greece cuts taxes in fiscal reform package THE Greek government yesterday launched a wide-ranging fiscal package intended to boost revenues through broadening the tax base and curbing tax evasion. The new legislation, tabled in parliament, is also expected to promote growth by streamlining corporation tax, at present hemmed in by complex regulations which serve as a disincentive to investors, finance ministry officials said. Reduced income tax rates introduced in the bill will at first cause a sharp drop in revenues, estimated at about Dr50bn (Pounds 144m) for 1992. The top income tax rate will fall from 50 to 40 per cent, while the threshold for paying income tax rises to Dr1m, excluding junior civil servants and other white-collar workers. In 1993, the top income tax rate will drop to 30 per cent. Tax on corporate profits, currently between 42 and 50 per cent, is reduced to a single 35 per cent rate and companies are required to revalue fixed assets every four years. Stricter penalties for tax evasion include lifting of bank confidentiality, confiscation of professional licences and jail sentences for major offenders. Greece's most notorious tax evaders are self-employed professionals such as doctors and lawyers who avoid issuing receipts for their services. Under the new system, doctors must keep registers of their patients and lawyers are to be taxed under a co-efficient worked out with their union.</p>

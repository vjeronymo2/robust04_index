			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Sterling surges on recovery hopes STRONG SUPPORT for sterling from Japanese and German investors and growing hopes of a UK economic recovery yesterday pushed the pound to its highest close against the D-Mark in London for more than seven months. The pound gained 1 1/2 pfennigs against a weaker German currency to close in London at DM2.9325, opening up the possibility that the government could safely cut borrowing rates from their current 10.5 per cent. Sterling's continued strength - it has overtaken both the Danish krone and the French franc in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) since the election - coincided with publication of two surveys pointing to an economic recovery, albeit a slow one. A quarterly survey of 8,000 companies by the British Chambers of Commerce showed that in the first quarter the service sector resumed growth for the first time since mid-1990, while the rate of decline in manufacturing slowed. This message was reinforced in Washington by the International Monetary Fund which said the UK economy was about to move into recovery. It warned that Britain would have the slowest growth rate this year among the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. Indications of brighter prospects for the UK after the recession which started around mid-1990 persuaded more international investors to switch funds into sterling. But there are still no signs that either the Treasury or the Bank of England, through its money market operations, are in a hurry to cut base rates, unchanged since September. Widespread support for the pound, particularly from overseas investors, started after the Conservative election victory on April 9. Another factor behind the more positive sentiment towards the UK by many overseas investors appears to be the clear-cut nature of the win and the prospect of a relatively long period of political stability. Yesterday, sterling climbed to within 2 pfennigs of its central DM2.95 rate in the ERM, while it gained 1.5 cents against the dollar to Dollars 1.7630. Sterling's strength in London - it later eased a touch in New York to DM2.93115 and Dollars 1.7625 - boosted prices in government gilt-edged securities by up to a quarter of a point. The mood of optimism was not shared by investors on the London stock market, where the FT-SE 100 index closed 18 lower at 2,607.8. The feeling that any recovery will be fragile was underlined by the British Chambers of Commerce report which warned that employment prospects remained gloomy. It said the jobless total could climb from 2.65m to 3m by the end of the year. In addition, rapidly falling factory investment during the recession could lead to manufacturers lagging behind their overseas rivals, once the recovery gathered pace. However, export orders continued to grow in both manufacturing and services, although the service sector was unable to sustain recent strong levels of growth. Another reminder of the weak state of demand in the UK in the first three months came from Bank of England figures on the money supply. These showed that banks and building societies last month received a net repayment of Pounds 500m on sterling loans by companies and individuals. This was the first time since records began in 1982 that monthly lending had failed to show a net rise.

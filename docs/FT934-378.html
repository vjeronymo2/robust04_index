			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Russian oil shares up for auction Russia has opened an auction for shares in its biggest oil company, allowing people to swap privatisation vouchers for a stake in oil producer Surgutneftegaz. More than 3.6m shares, each with a face value of Rbs1,000, are on offer in the nationwide auction. Officials said this represented about 18.25 per cent of the company's capital. The auction closes on January 24, when the selling price of shares will be set. Demand on the first day was not particularly strong, officials said. Surgutneftegaz produced 42.5m tonnes of oil (850,000 barrels per day) in 1992, more than 10 per cent of total Russian output. But production is expected to fall sharply this year. Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said yesterday that 'the bulk of privatisation has been completed in the past two years' and that the process was 'irreversible'. President Boris Yeltsin has promised to continue a policy of economic reform despite the nationalist victory at the polls. Last week, he authorised the privatisation agency headed by Mr Chubais to designate insolvent enterprises and open bankruptcy proceedings in arbitration courts. This is not the first time Mr Yeltsin and others have resolved to push ahead with bankruptcies. But, since Russia's bankruptcy law came into force in March, only one small kitchen-knife factory has filed successfully. The presidential decree outlines some practical procedures for the bankruptcy law, but does not set deadlines or require published lists of insolvent enterprises.</p>

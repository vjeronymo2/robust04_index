			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Denver Bronco tackle Gerald Perry was sentenced to 15 days in jail, beginning  Feb. 5, and a $610 fine after he was convicted of soliciting a prostitute.  </P> <P> City Attorney Dave Beard argued for a three-month jail term, calling Perry  untruthful and questioned the football player's character.  </P> <P> "I was a little disappointed. I felt the circumstances . . . called for a  slightly longer real jail term," Beard told reporters after the sentencing.  </P> <P> Perry's lawyer said he had not decided whether to appeal the sentence.  </P> <P> Aurora Municipal Judge Loretta Hoffine suspended 45 days of the 60-day jail  sentence if Perry is not arrested on similar charges for a year and continues  counseling therapy. She also ordered the Perry to serve 100 hours of community  service. The fine includes $110 in court costs.  </P> <P> The maximum sentence for the misdemeanor penalty is 180 days in jail and a $550  fine.  </P> <P> A six-member jury found Perry guilty of soliciting a prostitute stemming from  an incident early Sept. 7. He was acquitted of two other charges, and the jury  failed to reach a verdict on a third charge.  </P></p>

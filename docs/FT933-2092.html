			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): New credit union takes shape - In a Nutshell A new business credit union has been formed by more than 400 small businesses in North London with the assistance of a Pounds 30,000 injection from the North London Training and Enterprise Council, writes Lisa Wood. The companies, many of them micro-businesses, already belong to the North London Enterprise Club. The members believe in self-help and the organisation of their own borrowing requirements is a logical step, said the Tec. The credit union is not for profit, charging interest at 1 per cent per month with loans to be repaid over 24 months. The maximum loan available is Pounds 10,000.</p>

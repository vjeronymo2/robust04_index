			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: BAe looks to eradicate the unpleasant surprises - The rehabilitation that has taken place since the dark days of last September BRITISH Aerospace's rehabilitation has been almost as rapid as its fall from grace. In the latest spurt of corporate spring cleaning, all of BAe's operating companies will be hived down into subsidiaries from July 1 if the company's bankers give their approval. The move will help protect BAe's ability to pay dividends by shielding the holding company's reserves from accidents in subsidiaries. Because the missiles and Jetstream aircraft businesses have been split into separate subsidiaries it should also be easier to find joint venture partners for the businesses. Hiving down also defends BAe's tax position, allowing it to continue to make use of previous tax losses. That extra flexibility and security will build on the success since the dark days of last September. At the low point BAe had to write off Pounds 1bn pounds in the regional jet business and had to apply to the courts for a capital reduction so that it could continue to pay dividends. The shock of the losses was described by Mr Richard Lapthorne, the finance director, as, 'a very expensive education which is still having an impact throughout the company.' Since then the company has met the objectives it set itself getting orders and selling businesses, and that has at least partly restored the company's credibility with the City. Yet while the sales and orders have been crucial in securing BAe's future, the company has also had to put new systems in place to ensure that a disaster on the scale of the regional jet losses does not happen again. A new management information system, based on the BTR model, was introduced by Mr John Cahill, the chairman, last year. It places emphasis on how the monthly figures fit into the annual budget and any deviations are immediately flagged. 'By looking at variances you can spot potential trouble spots and start a dialogue with managers immediately,' explains Mr Lapthorne. 'If there are good reasons for the deviation then at least you know what is going on in the business. If there are problems you can start sorting them out. It also helps managers think about what is happening in their own business and how they can improve it.' There is nothing revolutionary in the approach. Indeed, it is an indictment of BAe's past practice that such systems were not in place before. But Mr Lapthorne says that the objective now is to create a company which does not produce unpleasant financial surprises - either for the operating managers or for the City. Because BAe is involved in very long-term projects, it has several levels of planning. The longest view comes from the 'product life cycle' evaluation. That tries to gauge the profitability of a project from cradle to grave - which in the case of military aircraft can be 40 years. This forms the basis for a rolling 5 year plan which has firmer numbers attached. Both of these were originally developed within BAe. The annual budget owes much to Mr Cahill's BTR background and is used as the basis for the management information system. Board reports are based on a model Mr Lapthorne used when he was at Courtaulds. These tools - particularly the management information system - are expected to form a framework for handling the business which will change the way managers think throughout BAe. The hope is that it will help avoid misunderstandings between senior and junior managers by creating an unambiguous starting point for discussions. It will also be used by line managers as the method for analysing where profits are made in a business and where the risks lie. By applying the lessons, local operations can improve. The system should make BAe finances more transparent and reliable. Mr Lapthorne says that the new structure puts greater emphasis on meeting annual budget targets, which have in the past been subordinated to the long view and high hopes about projects have prevailed. The company is also looking for ways to tidy up its aircraft lease book  - one of the areas which caused most trouble at regional jets. If current plans are implemented, the full costs of providing for the possible early termination of a lease will be taken at the time that the aircraft is sold. Salesmen will thus be fully aware of the real profit on any deal immediately. As with the management system, it will not necessarily prevent loss leading sales to get a new aircraft established, but it will make clear to everyone involved the full cost of the decision. Arguing that not all the good ideas come from new arrivals, Mr Lapthorne points out that the lease provisions scheme was devised by the group treasurer, Mr Tony Rice, who has been with the company for 8 years. BAe is also suggesting the technique to its other Airbus partners. At the heart of the new approach is the teamwork between Mr Cahill, Mr Dick Evans the chief executive who runs the defence business directly, Mr Lapthorne and Mr George Simpson who has responsibility for Rover. 'We are all very different individuals,' says Mr Lapthorne, 'but we mesh together extremely well. None of us really minds losing an argument to one of the others.' There is also a clear desire to steadily transform the culture of the group and secure its position as a profitable defence and aero-structures company. That is a long-term project and, in sharp contrast to last September, the fear is now that the enthusiasm will get out of hand. The company has flattered to deceive before. It seems well aware that it cannot afford to do so again.</p>

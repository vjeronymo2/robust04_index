			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Technology: Debate fuelled by recycled oil - Peter Knight looks at why environmentalists are for re-refining and the big companies against Would you put recycled oil into your car? Some Californians do, providing a business for Evergreen, a company that specialises in collecting and re-refining lubricating oil. Similar oil is available through Wal-Mart, the US retail chain. And UK motorists will soon have the chance to use a re-refined oil, Envirol, produced in the UK by Orcol. But is recycling the best environmental option for dealing with waste oil? The answer depends on your commercial position. The oil business tends to think used oil should be burned as fuel in certain high-temperature processes, such as cement making and roadstone preparation. Environmental campaigners think it should be treated and returned to its original use. Both sides have strong economic and environmental arguments in favour of their opposing positions. There is no disagreement on the problem of used oil. Roughly half the oil sold is 'lost' in use. Some escapes through leaks, some is burnt inside the engine, some is burnt as a heating fuel and the rest is dumped illegally. In the US, it is estimated that more than 1.4m tonnes of used oil is dumped in landfills, on land and down sewers each year. That is equivalent to 35 Exxon Valdez disasters a year. The UK consumes about 800,000 tonnes of lubricating oil a year and roughly half of that disappears. West Germany (before unification) consumed just over 1m tonnes a year with just over half collected after use. The dumped oil is not only a wasted resource but a powerful pollutant which can contaminate land, poison water supplies and destroy wildlife. A gallon of dumped oil can contaminate up to 1m gallons of drinking water with heavy metals, chlorinated solvents and carcinogenic compounds. In Europe, an EU directive makes member states responsible for ensuring the safe collection and disposal of waste oil. The preferred option is to re-generate and re-use it. Failing that, it should be used as a fuel. European countries have used different policies to encourage collection. Taxes and subsidies have been tried by Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Finland. Sellers of motor oil have been obliged to take it back in Germany. Some countries, such as Germany, treat some used oil as hazardous and therefore subject to special handling. Other countries, such as the US, have decided against this classification. No country or state appears to have found the ideal solution, especially to encourage do-it-yourself oil changers to bring back their used oil. A UK survey found that in one city 63 per cent of motorists changed their own oil and 80 per cent of those admitted pouring the old oil down the drain. Re-refining used to be a messy process which used sulphuric acid and clay to extract the impurities. This created by-products that were more hazardous than the original waste oil. Newer technologies now use a combination of distillation, filtration and hydrogenation to finish the oil. This removes the water, most of the contaminants and additives. It produces a base oil which can be blended to make a product that is claimed to be as good as that made from virgin oil. Angela Himus, editor of Industrial Waste Management, says used oil is treated at three levels. 'Although the equipment may vary and companies may use proprietary processes the basic levels are fuel oil, recycling, and re-refining.' To produce fuel oil the waste is dewatered, filtered and then centrifuged. Road stone makers, cement makers and power stations buy this oil, which has a lower sulphur content than virgin fuel oil. Recycled oils are usually those used in hydraulic equipment or other industrial machinery. The oil is returned to its original specification after residues, contaminants and water are taken out. Re-refining produces a number of different fractions: diesel, lubricating oils and asphalt. The lubricating oil fraction is finished to produce a base oil, which is blended with additives to make the final product. Modern re-refining methods create no harmful by-products. Makers of such oil, such as Evergreen in the US and Orcol in the UK, say their products can meet all the engine makers' performance specifications. But the oil majors are sceptical. Nick Wilkinson, a business adviser to BP Oil Marketing, says re-refined oil would not meet his company's standards for health and safety. 'In our estimation most re-refining processes are insufficient to overcome the health and safety aspects because of the presence of PCAs.' PCAs, or polycyclic aromatics, are formed when the oil is circulating in the internal combustion engine. PCAs are harmful if they come into contact with the skin. But according to Jeff Underhill, vice president for business development at Evergreen: 'We do not see this as a problem. Our base oil meets all the standards and passes all the tests for health and safety.' Wilkinson is also sceptical of the energy efficiency of the re-refining process. The EU says preference should be given to re-refining because of the energy savings it can bring, but the oil industry doubts the accuracy of this statement. Underhill is not convinced: 'We think that when you consider all the issues, re-refining is the most energy-efficient option. I don't see burning used oil as a long-term solution anyway, because air purity standards will get tougher.' Re-refining can also be highly profitable if the systems of collection are efficient. 'From a green investment point of view the business of re-refining lubricating oil is very attractive because of the margins that can be achieved,' says Mark Campanale, an analyst for the NPI Global Care Fund. 'By using recycled oil you are also replacing a virgin product with a recycled raw material. It must make both business and environmental sense.' But if these margins are to be realised the collection systems have to be reasonably close to the refineries and well-managed to prevent lubricating oil becoming contaminated with other oils and liquids, such as synthetic cooling oils. The efficiency of collection systems depends largely on government policy - especially its enforcement - as well as the demand from industry for recycled oil. Even in those countries where the law has been strict, such as Austria, enforcement is slack. In the UK, illegal disposal can lead to a fine of Pounds 20,000 or six months in prison. But the collection systems are at best haphazard and there is little demand from industry for re-refined oil. While the crude oil price remains low and margins tight in the oil business, the big oil companies have little interest in promoting collection or recycling. 'The government needs to do more to encourage recycling. The existing collection systems are well established and local governments are providing facilities but we need the government to provide the push for the next step up. The recovery and recycling companies can cope with any increase in the volumes recovered,' says Arthur Rennie, general manager of Lanstar Hydrocarbons, a recoverer and recycler. Orcol, the UK's biggest collector, is trying single-handed to stimulate recovery. It has launched a collection promotion called 'Earth Defender' where service stations will provide facilities for DIY oil changers to deposit their waste oil. This might be sufficient to guarantee a flow of sufficiently high-grade raw material for Orcol's production of Envirol, but it will not make much of a difference to the UK's waste oil problem. While the German system is far from efficient, some used oil is treated and returned to the lubricating oil cycle by using it as a feed alongside virgin oil in some major refineries. 'This is a highly subsidised activity. If you have to install new equipment in oil refineries to use waste oil as a feed it will increase costs and the exercise will not be economic,' says Wilkinson. Without uncontested figures to back re-refining, effective government policy and a change in the motorist's perception of recycled oil, the problem of used oil seems set to grow as fast as the world's expanding car population.</p>

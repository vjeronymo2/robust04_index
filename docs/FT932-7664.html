			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Hopes raised by Japanese money growth MONEY SUPPLY in Japan expanded 0.6 per cent in April, following a revised contraction of 0.4 per cent in March, prompting the Bank of Japan to suggest that signs of economic recovery are emerging. Bank officials said the preliminary year-on-year expansion in M2 plus certificates of deposit reflected the effects of two stimulatory packages announced in recent months by the government, which has pumped extra funds into public works. Money supply has contracted in six of the past seven months, but the bank argues that firm growth will be seen this quarter, partly because of the government packages, but also because lower interest rates have encouraged economic activity. The bank said the broadest measure, which includes postal and agricultural institution savings, grew 2.5 per cent in April, up from a revised 2.0 per cent in March, as money continued to flow into the postal savings system. The preliminary expansion in March had been 2.3 per cent. But bank officials are concerned that consumer demand remains weak and that two-thirds of Japanese companies have announced profit falls during the present profit season, the third year of decline, with many forecasting a fourth year of decline and a reduction in capital spending. Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission yesterday asked for indictment of a property company executive and a former finance company manager for alleged stock price manipulation. Mr Makoto Araya, president of Teishin Fudo, and Mr Hiroshi Kimura, a former managing director at Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, are alleged to have unlawfully ramped Nihon Unisys stock.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Boris Yeltsin, speaking in Madrid, has again  commented on the crisis in Bosnia. He has done so to repeat  that the Western policy of punishing the Serbs is dangerous and  can aggravate the war. Despite Russia's fear, NATO could step  up military pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. [passage omitted]    [Begin Yeltsin recording in Russian with superimposed  translation into Spanish] The only thing that the use of force  in Bosnia will achieve is to turn the war into something  constant, interminable. Should the conflict escalate,  responsibility will fall on those who have decided to use force  in Bosnia. [end recording]</p>

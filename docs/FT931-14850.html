			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Chile to ease curbs on pension funds CHILE plans to relax restrictions on the stock market investments of its fast-growing local pension funds. The proposals are aimed at providing new investment opportunities for the pension funds as well as opening new sources of finance for smaller companies. They would allow the funds to invest in most of the 240 stocks now listed on the Santiago stock exchange - instead of the 40 most tradeable stocks as at present - as well as in start-up projects and to provide venture capital. The pension funds, which together with insurance companies are responsible for about Dollars 17bn of assets, have been growing at about Dollars 300m a month: so rapidly that, under current rules, they have been running out of investment opportunities. The proposals, announced in Santiago by Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister, were received positively by the Chilean stock market, which rallied 0.64 per cent on Wednesday and was 1.7 per cent higher during trading yesterday. This was despite uncertainty surrounding plans to reduce the maximum a pension fund can hold in most companies to 5 per cent of total capitalisation from 7 per cent. This would require many pension funds to sell substantial holdings in many of the larger companies. However, according to James Capel's emerging market researchers in New York: 'Most observers feel that, in the event that such a measure were introduced, the time period in which the disposals would have to take place would be sufficiently long to ensure minimal market disruption.' A new draft law, part of a general reform of Chile's financial markets, will be sent for consideration by Congress in Valparaiso in the next few days, the government said.</p>

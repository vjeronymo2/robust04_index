			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, Dr. Das  Herbst, has denied allegations of a power struggle between the  minister of defense, Mr. Joe Modise, and the chief of the  National Defense Force, General George Meiring. Dr. Herbst was  reacting to a report in the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in which  it  was alleged that General Meiring had asked Mr. Modise to request  and interdict against the newspaper. General Meiring apparently  warned Mr. Modise that the government could be harmed if the  names of spies in the ANC were revealed. The newspaper says it  has forced the army to confirm the names of 47 former and  current employees of the Directorate of Covert Intelligence.</p>

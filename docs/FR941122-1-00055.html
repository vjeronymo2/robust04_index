			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25. The Commission believes that multiple bidding methodologies may be required for licensing of 800 MHz SMR service because the two proposed categories of licenses (MTA-based and local) will vary significantly from one another in terms of expected value and interdependence. In addition, it believes that competitive bidding in the 800 MHz SMR service presents a number of variables that have not been presented in other services for which auction rules have been developed. In particular, the proposed licensing of local SMR channels on a site-specific basis requires examination of how competitive bidding would work in a context where mutually exclusive applicants have applied for overlapping rather than identical authorizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. The Commission tentatively concludes that simultaneous multiple round bidding is most likely to award MTA licenses to bidders who value them most highly. the Further Notice asks commenters whether any other competitive bidding designs might be more appropriate for the MTA-based licensing of 800 MHz SMR spectrum. Assuming simultaneous multiple round auctions are used, the Commission also seeks comment on which blocks should be auctioned together, the intervals between rounds in each auction, and the sequencing of each auction. Its tentative view is that all MTA licenses should be auctioned simultaneously because of the relatively high value and significant interdependence of the licenses. The Further Notice seeks comment on its view and on possible alternatives for grouping of licenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. The Commission tentatively concludes that a simpler and less costly auction method, such as single round sealed bid auctions, should be used for licensing the 80 local SMR channels. The Further Notice also asks commenters to suggest alternative bidding designs. For example, if these channels are licensed on a site-specific basis, one alternative would be to allow mutually exclusive applications to use negotiated settlements or coordination to minimize the number of overlapping applications that would require resolution by competitive bidding. Another alternative would be to divide the local 80 SMR channels into defined geographic areas ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  BTAs) and small blocks of channels ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  five or ten channels) and conduct a series of separate auctions for mutually exclusive applications within each area/block combination. The Commission seeks comment on the practicality of these alternatives, whether these auctions for the local licenses should be conducted separately or simultaneously, and how such licenses should be ordered for auction purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. The Commission also seeks comment on bidding procedures to be used in 800 MHz SMR auctions, including bid increments, duration of bidding rounds, stopping rules, and activity rules. Assuming that simultaneous multiple round auctions are used for MTA-based SMR licenses, the Commission generally proposed to use the same or similar bidding procedures to those used in simultaneous multiple round bidding for MTA-based PCS licenses. In the case of locally licensed 800 MHz SMR channels, the Further Notice seeks comment on bidding procedures that would be appropriate depending on whether single round sealed bid auctions or an alternative auction methodology is used. It generally proposed to follow the procedural, payment, and penalty rules established in Subpart Q of Part 1 of the Commission's Rules, but seeks comment on whether any service-specific modifications of these rules are needed based on the particular characteristics of the 800 MHz SMR service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29. As in the case of other auctionable services, the Commission proposes to require SMR auction participants to tender in advance to the Commission a substantial upfront payment as a condition of bidding. It seeks comment on whether the standard upfront payment formula of $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination of MHz-pops a bidder anticipates bidding on in any single round of bidding is appropriate for 800 MHz SMR services. The Commission also proposes to require that winning bidders for 800 MHz SMR licenses supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to bring their total deposits up to 20 percent of their winning bid(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Unchanged repo THE Bundesbank yesterday announced that there would be an unchanged fixed rate repo in this week's securities repurchase tender, keeping German interest rates on hold, writes James Blitz. The news on the repo was well anticipated by the market and there was little change in German interest rate futures. The September Euromark contract closed unchanged at 93.54 and the December contract was up 1 basis point at 94.03. Attention is now focused on whether the Bundesbank will cut its discount rate at its council meeting tomorrow, the first since the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. There were some reasons for thinking that the Bundesbank would lean towards a cut in the discount rate floor by  1/4 of a percentage point to 6.50 per cent tomorrow. The Bundesbank needs to restore a 40 to 50 basis point gap that traditionally exists between call money and the discount rate floor. Call money was yesterday at around 6.85 per cent, providing a differential of only 10 basis points. But better inflation figures could also make the case for a cut stronger. The cost of living in the western German state of Baden Wurttemberg rose by 0.1 per cent on the month to mid-August and was at 4.3 per cent on the year. This was on the low side of economists' expectations. Moreover, some analysts believe that the Bundesbank could risk driving European currencies further away from the D-Mark if it does not cut rates tomorrow while other European countries do. However, the Bundesbank could be concerned by the huge liquidity that has flowed into the market as a result of its intervention in support of the French franc earlier this month. The central bank could wish to signal again that policy remains tight. France yesterday continued to suspend its window for overnight lending to the French money market. However, this was still seen as a technical move coinciding with the market's high liquidity. Three month money was virtually unchanged at around 7.40 per cent. The September Pibor contract was down 6 basis points at 93.19. Sterling markets were little changed with 3 month money closing at roughly the same level of 5 7/8 per cent. A shortage of Pounds 550m was forecast at the start of the day and there was late assistance of Pounds 155m.</p>

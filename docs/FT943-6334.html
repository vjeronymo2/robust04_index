			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Venturing capital A cornucopia of special incentives exists to encourage savings here and promote investments there. Splendid as job-promoting schemes for tax inspectors, accountants and investment advisors, this host of schemes is impossible to justify. That is true even of the almost universally lauded desire to provide special help to small business. Two justifications can be advanced for offering special incentives to small companies. First, small business finds it difficult to raise money because investors face obstacles in identifying honestly-run companies with good prospects, in monitoring their behaviour and in realising investments. This may justify efforts to subsidise information. But subsidising particular investments mainly increases tax avoidance. A second argument is that high rates of capital gains tax (up to 40 per cent) in the current tax system discriminate against investment in small enterprises. Given corporation tax, CGT entails the double-taxation of retained earnings. Since growth in the value of small enterprises partly depends on rapid accumulation of retained earnings, this may raise an obstacle to investment in such enterprises. Mr Clarke's unfortunate decision to eliminate indexation of capital losses in the 1993 Budget further reduces the attraction of investment in the small business lottery, where investors hope that a few big winners will offset their many losers. Poor measures The first of these arguments is far from overwhelming, while the second concerns capital gains taxation in general, not small business promotion in particular. It is difficult, therefore, to be enthusiastic about the special measures announced by the chancellor of the exchequer last November. At that time, capital gains tax roll-over relief for profits reinvested in private companies was broadened. In addition, the Enterprise Investment Scheme was introduced as an alternative to the Business Expansion Scheme, which had been hi-jacked by property investments. Being less generous and better focused, the new scheme should be less wasteful. Legislation is now being drawn up for a third vehicle, the venture capital investment trusts. The Inland Revenue views these as riskier versions of personal equity plans, with similar tax exemption of dividends and capital gains. Because the trusts will have relatively liquid publicly quoted shares, the Revenue does not appear to favour up-front tax relief, even at the 20 per cent level allowed in the EIS scheme. The Revenue is also proposing to limit venture capital trust investment in any company to Pounds 1m. Since the fewer the special incentives the better, hats go off to the Revenue. Extensive lobbying Inevitably, there has been a cacophony of lobbying for changes. The loudest has come from the Association of Investment Trust Companies, which says its members are unlikely to launch new trusts unless the maximum investment limit is raised. Investing in lumps much smaller than Pounds 3m would be too demanding on management time and render the trusts unviable, it argues. This should be ignored. Venture capital institutions, such as 3i, adequately meet the demand for larger deals. Setting the limit near Pounds 3m would also deny many of the smaller companies the seed capital venture capital trusts are being set up to provide. Investments in smaller companies, those most likely to be curtailed by lack of information, are the ones that most deserve help. One area where something might be done is to extend CGT roll-over relief to capital gains reinvested in venture capital trusts. But this is mere tinkering with the problem. What is needed is to make roll-over relief generally available. By restricting CGT to ultimate disposals, this would limit its effect on people's ability to trade assets and move the system towards expenditure taxation. Greater fiscal generosity would, of course, generate more investment in small enterprises. But that in itself cannot be a sane objective. What matters is to promote economically productive investment. The way to be more confident that this is occurring is to stop producing one clever wheeze after another and develop coherent reform of the taxation of savings and investment.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN TRADING WITH THE SOVIETS, U.S. GOVERNMENT IS BAD FOR BUSINESS  </P> <P> Despite the opening of the Soviet Union as a major new market, despite the  growing participation of major U.S. players in this market, Washington remains  a major obstacle to bilateral progress.  </P> <P> Instead of viewing trade as part of the normalization of the relationship --  one that brings more benefits to Washington than to Moscow, at least in terms  of balance of payments -- the U.S. government acts as though trade is a favor,  a special dispensation to be bestowed only if the Soviets behave as we want  them to, domestically and internationally.  </P> <P> The United States appears to be suffering from the delusion that by attaching  strings to trade, similar to the strings typically attached during the '70s on  federal grants to states and localities, we can influence or direct social and  economic change in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Travel by U.S. business executives to Moscow and by Soviet businessmen to the  United States has increased tenfold over the past two years. Some deals have  been concluded; others are being negotiated in virtually all sectors -- natural  resource development, energy processing, hotels and tourism, medical equipment,  chemicals, retail products, publishing, computers and electronics, even food  processing.  </P> <P> U.S. state and local governments, local chambers of commerce and trade  associations are exploring the newly opened market with enthusiasm. No  surprise. The Soviet Union is the world's second-largest economy; it has a  population of almost 287 million with more rubles than there are products to  buy, and it possesses the world's largest natural-resource base.  </P> <P> Differences between our two economies frequently make it difficult to structure  commercial transactions but those difficulties are not insurmountable -- and  they are not significantly different from difficulties encountered in other  countries where the national government plays a major role in the economy and  hard currency is either not available or in short supply.  </P> <P> In a recent speech to the U.S.-U.S.S.R Trade and Economic Council, Secretary of  Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher carried the conditional U.S. government message on  mutual trade.  </P> <P> He was reiterating the President's position that if the Soviet Union codifies  its laws "in accordance with international standards" (as determined by the  United States) and implements them faithfully (as determined by the United  States), then the Administration will work with Congress for a temporary waiver  of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. That amendment denies a country  non-discriminatory tariff treatment if it restricts emigration. This message,  hardly reassuring to businesses exploring long-term deals, was put forward as a  major concession. Fortunately, a number of congressmen have introduced  legislation supporting such a waiver.  </P> <P> Mosbacher also held out prospects of expanded trade with the Soviets if Mikhail  S. Gorbachev's government proceeds with price reform, devaluation of the ruble,  decentralization of economic decision-making -- and other reforms the Soviets  have already declared as policy objectives to be implemented.  </P> <P> The secretary said, "We welcome the words and the beginning steps. We now look  for deeds," reflecting an apparent unawareness of radical reforms under way and  the intensity of Soviet efforts to achieve the very goals he specified. The  tone of Mosbacher's remarks suggested that the United States was overseeing  these developments as a sort of umpire, in order to determine whether or not  U.S. businesses may participate on the newly opened playground. His tone seemed  condescending and paternalistic.  </P> <P> Mosbacher also went out of the way to encourage Soviet cooperatives, a  promising new form of private business in the Soviet Union. Because of their  modest size and lack of manufacturing experience, however, cooperatives are  often not ideal candidates for partnerships with major U.S. corporations.  </P> <P> The singling out of cooperatives (as opposed to enterprises, amalgamations,  trading companies or other business organizations), is equivalent to the  Soviets saying they favor business deals with American ESOPS -- employee  stock-ownership plans -- because they are owned by the workers.  </P> <P> Finally, Mosbacher said at least five times, compounding a tautology, that  expansion of trade must be on a commercial basis. None of the corporations in  his audience could be accused of being charitable organizations; each ventures  into the Soviet market out of economic imperatives. The major element of  commercial risk in their participation is the United States itself -- with its  penchant to impede with trade sanctions and export control.  </P> <P> This is the time for the U.S. government to recognize the scope of Soviet  economic reform in progress, as well as the significant market opportunities  those reforms present. It is also time to formulate trade policy based on  economic facts rather than a misperception that Washington can dictate Soviet  domestic behavior.  </P> <P> An appropriate agenda might include:  </P> <P>  -- Renegotiation of a bilateral trade and investment protection treaty,  similar to the treaties U.S. allies are signing with the Soviets.  </P> <P>  -- Renegotiation of the bilateral tax treaty (the current tax treaty does not  cover the new business relationships, such as joint ventures, now permitted in  the Soviet Union).  </P> <P>  -- Repeal of legislative amendments that deny non-discriminatory tariff  treatment or that prevent U.S. businesses from access to Export-Import Bank  guarantees and credits to support deals made in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P>  -- Streamlining of export controls to release products and technology  available from other sources and not of direct military application.  </P> <P>  -- Constructive encouragement of Soviet participation in the International  Monetary Fund and World Bank.  </P> <P>  -- Abandonment of the current petulant attitude toward Gorbachev's economic  and political initiatives.  </P> <P> "Commerce," Benjamin Franklin argued, "is the great civilizer. We exchange  ideas when we exchange fabrics." Trade provides a lubricant that can relax  tensions in other fields.  </P> <P> Instead of holding trade hostage to human rights or waiting for the Soviet  Union to emulate capitalism, the United States should recognize the political  and economic revolution occurring in the Soviet Union, to help create a level,  attractive playing field for U.S. companies willing to participate.  </P></p>

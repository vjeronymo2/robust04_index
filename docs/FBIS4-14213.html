			<p>BFN     [Text] The Knesset today rejected the draft bills  presented by NRP [National Religious Party] Knesset Member [MK]  Yitzhaq Levi and Likud MK 'Uzi Landau on the Golan Heights by a  majority of 57 to 47 votes. The draft bills sought to make any  territorial concessions on the Golan Heights conditional on a  parliamentary majority of at least 80 MK's. Our Knesset affairs  correspondent Tamar Asalem reports:    [Begin recording] [Asalem] MK Yitzhaq Levi presented his  draft bill against the background of two remarks by the prime  minister. The first asserted that a national referendum would  be held prior to any withdrawal from the Golan Heights while the  second referred to the evacuation of settlements. Levi said  there was no official government decision on holding a national  referendum and that Rabin could not be counted on to keep his  promises.    [Levi] The prime minister is the greatest retractor in  Israel. No one goes back on his remarks as much as the prime  minister. He immediately retracts every statement he makes.  Every time he speaks he changes his mind. Therefore, I believe  that he is worthy of this title.    [Asalem] MK 'Uzi Landau continued the personal attack on  Rabin. Landau caused a furor in the plenum when he read excerpts  from 'Ezer Weizman's book about Rabin's collapse during his  tenure as chief of staff and about how the collapse was passed  off as a case of nicotine poisoning. The prime minister, Landau  said, could not take pressure.    [Landau] One cannot have confidence in him. He fails to  keep his promises not because he does not want to -- he does --  but because he simply cannot. The prime minister breaks under  pressure and has been suffering from chronic nicotine poisoning  since 23 May 1967.    [Asalem] Against this background, Landau said, the prime  minister's promises could not be counted upon and the issue must  be anchored in law. Minister Moshe Shahal, who replied on  behalf of the government, called the personal attacks on Rabin  ridiculous and said that these were the last-ditch efforts of  pathetic individuals who had lost their political bearings.  Moving on to the issue itself, Shahal said that the Golan  Heights had never been consecrated by politicians, had not been  occupied because it was holy land, and Israel's history had not  begun on its basalt rocks. Shahal taunted opposition MK's, who  have sought on several occasions to pass similar bills, by  saying that in such historic times sitting on the opposition  benches was not only frustrating but even tedious. The  coalition's efforts to muster all possible support proved  itself. SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] also voted against the  bills, which were defeated by a majority of 57 votes. [end  recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 27 April  reports: "The Knesset plenum today passed the preliminary  reading of MK Yehoshu'a Matza's bill limiting the prime minister  to two portfolios, in addition to the premiership portfolio.  The coalition failed to muster a majority and the plenum passed  the bill with a majority of 26 versus 22.    "The Knesset also passed the preliminary hearing of a bill  submitted by David Mena' and Limor Livnat from the Likud to  apply state audit to the Histadrut Labor Union and its  institutions. The bill passed with a majority of 20 versus  one."]</p>

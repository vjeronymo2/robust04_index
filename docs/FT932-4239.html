			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): When the bubbles go flat - France's champagne houses have been forced to reduce prices in an attempt to maintain sales The streets of Epernay in eastern France were last week filled with angry champagne workers protesting against proposed job losses at some of France's finest champagne houses. The redundancies are the culmination of three intensely difficult years which have seen the champagne industry hit by falling sales, rising raw material prices and, since September, by the impact of the strong franc on exports. Stocks have risen to record levels. Some small companies have serious cashflow problems. The champagne houses now face the challenge of trying to regenerate sales without jeopardising the exclusive image of their product. To some degree the industry's difficulties are a hangover of its success in the 1980s. Champagne sales soared from 147m bottles in 1982 to 249m in 1989. The price of champagne, and of the grapes used to make it, rose accordingly. The grape price peaked in 1990 (at FFr32.00 per kilo against FFr19.00 in 1982) the same year that sales started to decline. The producers retaliated by raising their prices just as they had in the 1980s. But the market could no longer absorb the increases. Champagne sales fell to 232m bottles in 1990 and fell again as the recession deepened to 214m in 1991 and 1992. The conventional marketing response to such a decline in demand would be to try to boost sales through advertising. LVMH tried this last Christmas by running a campaign in France for Moet, its flagship brand. Taittinger also advertised in France. But these campaigns failed to stop the decline in sales as the industry's problems are too complex for advertising to offer more than a partial solution. Although the market appeared to stabilise last year, the total of 214m bottles disguises a rapid rise in sales of low-quality petits champagnes dumped by smaller cash-strapped producers and which retail for as little as FFr35.00 (Pounds 4.20) a bottle in France. These petits champagnes have not only eroded the position of higher-quality brands, but also imposed intense pressure on prices and profitability across the market. Some large houses have retaliated by launching their own petits champagnes. Taittinger last year re-introduced Irroy, a product that dates back to the 1860s but has been 'remaindered' for many years. Irroy now sells for 25 per cent less than the Taittinger brand. The relaunch has been so successful that Taittinger has developed a new, cheap champagne, Saint-Evremond, which reaches the shops this month. 'There have always been secondary champagnes, just as there are second and third pressings of Bordeaux,' said Philippe Court, chief executive of Taittinger. 'The secondary brands come out at certain times and then disappear. We decided the time was right to bring them out again.' But the industry's chief response to the crisis has been to cut prices. In past recessions the champagne producers have been able to avoid this because they could shelter behind high inflation. The current downturn, however, has taken place at a time of low inflation in most leading champagne markets. The leading houses have this time held prices for as long as possible, for fear that discounting lower prices would intensify the pressure on their profits and, in the long term, jeopardise their product's prestigious reputation. Some of the grandest houses, notably Bollinger, have held prices. 'Bollinger is at the very top of the market,' says Christian Bizot, chairman. 'We would never do anything that might devalue it.' Others have bowed to market pressure. 'Taittinger has reduced prices along with most of the other houses,' says Court. 'We might not like it, but we had no choice.' Even price cutting has been problematic. The franc's strength against the UK, Spanish and Italian currencies since last autumn's ERM crisis has not only depressed the repatriated profits from the champagne sold in those countries, but raised the risk of parallel imports coming into France and Germany, where currencies are stronger. LVMH, after struggling for months to maintain prices, announced in February it was 'temporarily' cutting the wholesale price of Moet and Mercier by 10 per cent in France, Germany and Switzerland. However it was also forced to raise the price of those brands by 5 per cent in the UK, Italy and Spain to prevent parallel imports. These changes are now filtering through to the shops. LVMH says it is still too soon to assess their effect on sales. But the group faces the additional problem of how its retail customers will react to reductions in wholesale pricing. LVMH might finish in the unenviable position of having reduced its margins through price cutting, without deriving any benefit from higher sales. That said, there are some positive signs for the industry. The petits champagnes may have depressed prices, but the availability of so much cheap product has at least prevented sparkling wines from taking market share from champagne. Meanwhile, sales are starting to improve in the US, as the economy emerges from recession. This augurs well, not only for that market, but also for champagne's prospects in other countries as their economic problems ease. 'It's important to remember that the level of champagne sales last year, at 214m bottles, was significantly higher than the last low of 147m in 1982,' says Sylvain Massot, European drinks analyst at Morgan Stanley. 'This suggests that champagne's success in the 1980s wasn't a temporary phenomenon and that the product has substantial underlying strengths.' Some champagne houses are less optimistic. One issue is that the continuing trend towards low inflation poses serious problems for pricing in the future. They also fear that the proliferation of petits champagnes could cause long-term damage to the industry's image. Bollinger is mooting plans for the grand houses to lobby for greater differentiation (in terms of labelling and product classification) between grands champagnes and cheap bubbly. 'It's ridiculous to expect Bollinger to carry the same name as something selling for FFr36.00,' says Bizot. 'A grand champagne is recognised as one of the world's great products and, whatever happens, we must make sure that it stays that way.'  ------------------------------------------------------                  In need of fizz  ------------------------------------------------------ Worldwide sales of champagne in bottles (million  ------------------------------------------------------ 1983                   159 1984                   188 1985                   195 1986                   205 1987                   218 1988                   237 1989                   249 1990                   232 1991                   214 1992                   214  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Comite Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

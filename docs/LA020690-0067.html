			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHROP LOSES ATTEMPT TO DISMISS FRAUD LAWSUIT;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: EMPLOYEES ARE CHARGING THAT THE FIRM OVERCHARGED THE GOVERNMENT ON THE  B-2 STEALTH BOMBER BY ABOUT $20 BILLION.  </P> <P> A U.S. district court judge Monday rejected Northrop Corp.'s request that she  dismiss a civil fraud case, filed by current and former company employees,  which alleges that Northrop has overcharged the government by about $20 billion  on the B-2 Stealth bomber program.  </P> <P> After lengthy and heated arguments in the increasingly hostile case, U.S.  District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer said she would allow the case to continue.  At one point, she admonished the lawyers: "Excuse me gentlemen. This is my  courtroom. Calm down."  </P> <P> Pfaelzer spurned contentions by Northrop lawyer P. David Richardson that the  plaintiffs had not filed specific enough charges to justify the case going  forward.  </P> <P> The thrust of the complaint in the massive suit is that Northrop's performance  on the B-2 has been riddled with fraud from its initial work and that it has  used a host of methods to overcharge the government.  </P> <P> These allegations include giving the government falsified progress reports on  its production of the B-2, submitting false data on the amount of money spent  to perform work on the B-2, mischarging labor costs, submitting false vouchers  for the purchase and procurement of parts and materials and knowingly  misrepresenting the progress made in the production and engineering status of a  key electronics system.  </P> <P> The original suit was filed in February, 1988, and it has been amended three  times by plaintiff's lawyer Herbert Hafif of Claremont.  </P> <P> The suit was filed under the Federal False Claims Act, which allows private  citizens to file suits on behalf of the government and share in any damages  that the government ultimately recovers. The statute allows the government 60  days to decide whether to intervene in a False Claims action and allows the  government to take over any such suit, though the original plaintiffs are  permitted to retain an active role in the case.  </P> <P> In November, 1988, the Justice Department announced that it had declined to  intervene in this case. However, in November, 1989, after Hafif filed the  latest amendment to the case, it was learned that the Justice Department had  reopened its investigation of the case.  </P> <P> On Monday, Assistant U.S. Atty. Howard F. Daniels requested that the government  be given 90 days to decide whether to intervene in the case. Judge Pfaelzer  granted the request.  </P> <P> Cases filed under the False Claims Act normally are kept secret, under seal, in  an attempt to allow the Justice Department to conduct its investigation  unimpeded. In early November, when Hafif amended the suit, Judge Pfaelzer  unsealed the case after a court hearing.  </P> <P> However, upon Hafif's request, she resealed the case again Monday for at least  90 days. The judge said it had been her clear impression that Hafif's  associate, Philip Benson, had wanted the case unsealed. But Hafif said he felt  that was a misunderstanding and Pfaelzer granted the request.  </P></p>

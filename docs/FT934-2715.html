			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Ill omen from the pitch for Belgians - Summit Diary / FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels There was a shadow cast over yesterday's Brussels summit, but it wasn't the war in former Yugoslavia, the possibility of a last-minute hitch in the Gatt talks, or even the spectre of millions of jobless Europeans: it was the shock defeat of Belgium's top soccer club, Anderlecht, by Werder Bremen of Germany in Wednesday night's European champions' cup-tie. Brussels-based Anderlecht led 3-0 after half an hour - and yet the Germans managed to score five goals in the final 24 minutes to win the match. At the summit, the early play went in favour of the Belgians - captained by premier and football fan Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was chairing the meeting. Fellow summiteers bowed to the probing forward runs of Mr Dehaene and Mr Jacques Delors, another soccer enthusiast, as they deftly outlined plans to promote European growth, competitiveness and employment. The Belgians' fear, of course, is that before the match finishes today, the Germans and British may emulate Bremen's remarkable comeback with some sharp counter-attacks on the growth plans in the meeting's final communique. * * * * After the Lord Mayor's Show comes the muck-cart: ministers, diplomats and journalists are bracing themselves for a nightmare on Monday when the Belgian presidency has committed itself to hold five simultaneous ministerial meetings in the overcrowded Charlemagne building in Brussels, many of them charged with clearing up issues unresolved by EU leaders. Some of the coincidences are fortuitous - with a Gatt deal in the offing, it's as well that foreign, trade and agriculture ministers will be close to one another - but nobody seems to know where finance, health and environment ministers will find room to discuss the state of their particular part of the European Union.</p>

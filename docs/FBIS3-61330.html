			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Voloshchuk, deputy general director of </F> the Federal Clearing Chamber of Gold Trade: "Waiting for a Gold  Rush"]    [Text] Our society still has not quite appreciated  the significance of the date of 27 September 1993. It is since  that day that the state, for the first time in decades, began to  transfer gold into private hands. It may be only the first small  step: what is being put into circulation is not actual gold, but  state obligations--the Gold Certificates of the Ministry of  Finance--but this step already has been made.    With it, Russia and its weakened economy become  full-fledged members of the world financial community. A year  later, on 27 September 1994, citizens of Russia, banks, and  firms will be able to possess the most real values in the world.  Bars of 24K gold will become part of financial circulation, will  help economic recovery, to get a handle on inflation.    Russia is far from the only country in the world where  circulation of gold had been banned. Even in the United States  in 1934 the law on gold bullion forbade ownership of gold bars;  this ban was lifted only on 31 December 1974. A virtual boom in  the gold market ensued. Now an average well-to-do American holds  his assets not only in stocks and real estate, but also  necessarily in gold bars. After all, the only thing that is  safer than gold is gold that belongs to you and sits in an  armored safe. The gold reserves kept in individual safe-deposit  boxes in American banks could compete with the famous depository  of state gold bullion in Fort Knox.    I think that a similar "gold rush" is awaiting us, too,  magnified by the factor that after 70 years, Russia is more  starved for gold than America. The current factors of political  and economic instability also will have an impact. Gold is a  crisis commodity; it tends to do well when in other spheres  times are hard or a trend is developing toward the worsening of  a situation. During the period of political and economic  upheaval and growing inflation, the demand for gold has  practically no "ceiling."    Therefore, we should expect that the Federal Clearing  Chamber  for Gold Trade is facing a heavy workload. And although the gold  market in our country is just beginning to "warm up," judging by  how fast the "temperature" is climbing up, we are not far from  the "boiling point."    Currently the chamber has organized trading in Gold  Certificates of the Ministry of Finance, as well as derivative  rights to gold, which have been put into circulation by the  owners of Gold Certificates. We hope that legislative changes  will enable us to begin selling by the fall of 1994 24K gold  bars and gold coins--this is a classic exchange commodity. The  chamber is currently trading in two modes: the market of  currently available commodities and the market of futures  contracts.    In the current commodities market, there is buying and  selling of deeds of ownership of parts of Gold Certificates,  issued by the banks--the owners of full Gold Certificates. By  its nature, it may be defined as an investor market, that is,  depositors who want to protect their money from inflation--not  only with respect to the ruble but also from inflation of  seemingly hard currencies. It is no secret that over the past  few months we have become witness and, what is even sadder,  victim to a most paradoxical "dollar inflation."    Quantitatively, this is a market of small (from a few  hundred  to a few thousand rubles) to medium-sized (several tens of  millions of rubles) depositors, who do not have the resources to  purchase a whole Gold Certificate, which costs 150 million  rubles [R]. In their composition, it is mostly commercial and  state organizations, as well as individual citizens.    In the futures market, the actors are mainly speculators;  the  state of the market, which actually is not surprising, is set by  "bulls." The trend of rising prices in the gold market is quite  visible. For instance, in April 1993 at the London metals  exchange a Troy ounce of gold cost $326; in November it already  cost $375-$378. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY forecasts (No.  215, 1993), within the next few months gold prices may rise to  $410 or even $450 per Troy ounce. Thus, those who purchased last  December standard futures contracts from the Federal Clearing  Chamber for Gold Trade and sell them, for instance, in April  will make a return up to 60 percent at the annual rate in  foreign currency; keeping in mind that opening a position in the  chamber requires posting an initial margin of 20 percent of the  value of the contract, return on the invested capital may reach  250-300 percent at the annual rate. And this is just for  hedgers--active speculators, albeit with a certain degree of  risk, may earn an even higher return. As to returns in rubles,  this does not lend itself to calculation at all, just like the  rate of inflation in our country.    The effectiveness and attractiveness of investing in a Gold  Certificate may be graphically seen from this example: In  jewelry stores, the price of 14K gold is R28,000 per gram, while  the price of 24K gold in the Gold Certificate is today R18,000;  thus, the gold of identical proof is three times less expensive  in a Gold Certificate than in a jewelry store. Which means that  for those who buy jewelry as a means of protecting their money  from inflation, it is much more profitable to purchase shares in  Gold Certificates.    As is known, the movement of the market is hard to forecast.  For instance, J.P. Morgan, a great authority in the area of  financial and stock exchange operations, when asked his opinion  on the market moves, usually answered: "Expect fluctuations." I,  however, am in a position to make the following forecast for the  gold market: "Expect growth."    We can be reached at the following telephone numbers: (095)  374-69-39; 374-75-43.</p>

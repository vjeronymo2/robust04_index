			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY;  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LA CAGE' COMES OFF DESPITE FLAWS;  </P> <P> THEATER: STARLIGHT'S CHOICE TO END ITS 44TH SEASON IS INSPIRED, BUT HIGHER  STANDARDS ARE IN ORDER AS THE COMPANY MOVES TOWARD NEWER PRODUCTIONS.  </P> <P> "La Cage Aux Folles" has so much heart, humor and pizazz written into it, that  all it needs is a good-faith effort to prove irresistible.  </P> <P> Despite the curious casting of a weak vocalist (Bill Mullikin) as the singing  star Albin/ZaZa, the current Starlight Musical Theatre production at the San  Diego Civic Theatre is proof of the show's indestructibility.  </P> <P> The production, while not top drawer, should draw anyone who likes their  melodies hummable, their lyrics memorable and their messages heartwarming.  </P> <P> Based on the French farce of the same name, "La Cage" tells the story of a  young man, Jean-Michel, who is ashamed of the parents to whom he must introduce  his prospective in-laws. Why? His parents are a gay couple with a 20-year  marriage, Georges and Albin. (Jean-Michel was the offspring of Georges'  one-night fling with a woman who had no interest in the child.)  </P> <P> And the prospective in-laws, the Dindons (meant to rhyme with ding-dongs),  represent an anti-gay political party in France, where the play is set.  </P> <P> Spicing up the comic clashes that ensue from these odd couples in collision is  the setting: a transvestite nightclub, owned by Georges, starring Albin as ZaZa  in an array of glittering dresses and a crew of "Les Cagelles," men in women's  garb, who rip through as many as three flouncy, bouncy sequined costumes in the  course of the opening number. (Give costume designer Theoni V. Aldredge a hand  for making those feathers fly.)  </P> <P> But Harvey Fierstein, who did the book, and Jerry Herman, who wrote the music,  were not content with the obvious sight gags in the original farce. Together,  they worked successfully to inject poignancy to the max in the 1983 hit  musical.  </P> <P> Can Jean-Michel persuade the flagrantly effeminate Albin to absent himself from  the family dinner without fatally wounding the feelings of the man who cooked  and cleaned and cared for him as his mama his whole life?  </P> <P> Can Georges help his son in the one-night deception without betraying the man  he loves? Can Albin rise above the pain of rejection to play the role of the  parent who sacrifices his happiness for the sake of an ungrateful child he  loves so much?  </P> <P> And if all that doesn't elicit even a tiny tear from your eye, wait till you  hear Albin's song about being asked to clear his dresses out of his closets for  the night with the in-laws: "I Am What I Am."  </P> <P>  "I am what I am/And what I am needs no excuses/ ... There's one life and  there's no return and no deposit/One life so it's time to open up your  closet/Life's not worth a damn/Till you can say, Hey world/I am what I am."  </P> <P>  The lyrics are more than a banner to gay pride; when Leslie Uggams sang it in  the Herman revue, "Jerry's Girls," it became a woman's song. Ultimately, it  belongs to anyone struggling with issues of self-esteem and one's place in  society.  </P> <P> The song provides Mullikin's best moment, but it is not the showstopper it was  when George Hearn, who originated the part on Broadway, played it. Mullikin  brings vulnerability and fragility but not emotional intensity or vocal depth  to the role.  </P> <P> Even worse, Mullikin's ZaZa, the supposed singing star, is outclassed at every  turn by the singing of Broadway veteran Steeve Arlen as Georges.  </P> <P> Director Barry Ivan might have done more to disguise the weaknesses and  heighten the dramatic strengths. Still, the show survives, with special kudos  going to Arlen, who raises the company's level of professionalism with his  suave, smooth pacing, and to Eric Davenport, who got his own separate applause  with an opening-night standing ovation for his sassy antics as the feisty  butler, Jacob, who aspires to be a maid.  </P> <P> Other standouts are the Cagelles, featuring Bill Bateman as the catty Mercedes,  Roger Castellano as the high-singing Chantal and Javier Velasco as the  bullwhip-wielding Hannah.  </P> <P> Starlight favorite Patti Goodwin brings a badly needed soprano to the vocal mix  as Mme. Dindon; it's a shame that Jack Ritschel, as the grumpy M. Dindon, is  obliged to shut her up in the restaurant scene where she begins to join in on  ZaZa's song, "The Best of Times Is Now." Mullikin could have used the help.  </P> <P> There isn't much depth for Kevin Schwarz as Jean-Michel and DeAnne Spicer as  his bride-to-be, Anne, to flesh out in their respective parts; Jean-Michel  could have benefited from more writing in Fierstein's book to explain his  changes of heart. But the two actors acquit themselves nicely.  </P> <P> The choreography by David Scala, who plays one of the Cagelles, Phaedra, is  great fun, and well-executed by the leggy male chorus line (nice gams, guys).  The sets by Ken Holamon are thin but move smoothly from club to cafe to beach  scenes, adding to the glittery atmosphere.  </P> <P> "La Cage," a brand new show for Starlight, was an inspired choice to end the  company's 44th season. This one works, despite its flaws, but caution is in  order for next year. The movement toward newer shows, which Starlight is  happily taking in the 1990 season, creates higher standards for execution  because new shows cannot rely upon the magic of nostalgia to blur their faults.  </P> <P> "LA CAGE AUX FOLLES"  </P> <P> Book and lyrics by Harvey Fierstein.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] At approximately 0530, a group of unidentified  individuals opened fire on a military checkpoint located on the  highway from Tuxtla Gutierrez to Chicoasen Dam in Chiapas State.  The attack lasted approximately 50 minutes. As a result, one  Mexican Army communications sergeant was wounded and died a few  hours later at a hospital. This is all that happened in that  isolated incident.    Miguel Angel Godinez Bravo, Seventh Military Region  commander, explained on behalf of the National Defense  Secretariat that there is no relation between this incident and  the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. We must also  point out that at 0600, two Bell combat helicopters and a  Pilatus Air Force airplane overflew La Chacona Mountain,  strafing different areas in an attempt to locate the  perpetrators of the attack. Chiapas Attorney General Arturo  Becerra Martinez ruled out any connection between this morning's  clash in Tuxtla Gutierrez and the EZLN.    [Begin Becerra recording] So far, we do not know the motive  or name of the assailants. Until now nothing indicates the EZLN  is linked to the attack. Should we obtain further information,  the Attorney General's Office will pass it along to you later.  [end recording]</p>

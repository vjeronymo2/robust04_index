			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Ratners shareholders voice discontent as losses deepen MR GERALD Ratner had a rough ride at the UK jewellery company's annual meeting yesterday as several angry shareholders criticised his high pay and demanded his resignation. But the once-voluble Mr Ratner remained silent throughout the proceedings, leaving it to the new chairman, Mr James McAdam, to quell the discontent and defend the chief executive's reputation. Ratners, which claims to be the biggest jewellery group in the world, also released its interim results yesterday which showed a steepening of pre-tax losses from Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 30.6m for the six months to August 1. The result was better than expected - especially considering the 19 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 364.6m. One analyst described the extent of the cost-cutting and margin improvement as 'amazing in the circumstances' although representing an 'appalling indictment of past management practices'. There was an ugly mood at the annual meeting as small shareholders sought the reasons for the collapse of the company's fortunes and share price over the last year. One shareholder suggested - to widespread applause - that Mr Ratner should have waived his 'utterly obscene' pay of Pounds 574,452 last year until profits had improved. Another repeatedly called for Mr Ratner's resignation. Mr McAdam said the directors had indeed waived their pay for one month in January adding that their remuneration had since been cut by about one-third to bring it into line with comparable companies. He blamed the recession for the depth of the company's difficulties. 'The immediate priority of this board is to get the trading line back on course. From that all else will flow,' he said. 'The issue of Gerald Ratner's resignation is not on the table.' The glum-looking Mr Ratner left the meeting surrounded by security guards. The company yesterday refused to comment on its ability or intention to make a Pounds 58.5m bond repayment, due on October 30, but analysts suggested it would be a tight call. The company's borrowings next month are expected to rise to about Pounds 370m as it stocks up for Christmas  - although it can call on borrowing facilities of Pounds 500m.

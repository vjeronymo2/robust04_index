			<p>BFN     [Text] At the opening session of the great Hajj congress of  1994 this afternoon, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed:  Hajj has both a religious as well as a political significance.  If this divine injunction was being properly implemented today,  the Serbs would not have been able to slaughter the people of  Gorazde on the eve of the Hajj ceremonies without any fear and  without paying any attention to this great Islamic gathering at  Hajj.    The president confirmed: The issue of Hajj and the  expression of disavowal of infidels should not become a source  of disunity among the Muslims. We believe in and stress the  issue of carrying out the injunction of disavowal in the same  way that we regard the unity and cohesion of the Muslims of the  world as necessary and essential. These two important issues are  complimentary.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: In view of the critical condition  of the world and numerous difficulties today, Muslims should  defend the rights of the Islamic nations in a united manner by  making use of common means. Hajj ceremonies being performed  next to the house of God provide the best opportunity for  achieving this unity.    Referring to the obstacles that Saudi officials are creating  regarding the number of Iranian pilgrims sent to this year's  Hajj ceremonies, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: We hope that God will  enable them to make appropriate decisions at the very last hours  regarding the quantity and quality of the Hajj ceremonies, so  that they may satisfy our people and other Islamic nations.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani pointed out: We will not do anything  contrary to the interests and security of Saudi Arabia. The  holding of the disavowal ceremonies will not be harmful to  anyone except the infidels and the enemies of Islam. As we  raise this issue, we wish for the well-being of the nation of  Saudi Arabia and its government. As far as the Islamic Republic  of Iran is concerned, there is no difference between the nation  of Saudi Arabia and its government and the wronged people of  other Islamic countries.    Referring to today's remarks by the esteemed leader  [Khamene'i] and the guidelines of the late imam [Khomeyni]  regarding the philosophy behind Hajj ceremonies,  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: With regard to the guidelines and  instructions of the esteemed leader of the Islamic Revolution  [Khamene'i]--which we had also repeatedly heard from the tongue  of his eminence the imam--may God's blessings be upon him, our  people know their duties and, as in the past, they will act  according to their divine responsibilities.    The president expressed his hope that the leaders of the  Islamic countries--realizing the true nature of Hajj and by  making plans and coordinating their activities and adopting an  appropriate procedure during the great annual Hajj  ceremonies--will make proper use of the great Hajj gathering to  solve the problems of the world of Islam.</p>

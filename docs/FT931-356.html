			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Kleinwort sees China openings POWER generation projects for energy-starved China present almost boundless opportunities for creative financing according to Mr Robin Fox, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank. Mr Fox, speaking in Beijing at a Sino-British commercialisation and capital project financing seminar, said 'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) deals would help China overcome a shortfall of financing from traditional sources such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. BOT schemes are infrastructure projects built, operated and paid for by a promoter before transfer to government ownership.</p>

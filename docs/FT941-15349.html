			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment body must be given support Sir, Your leader, 'An end to foot-dragging' (January 12), calling on those who see a positive future for self-regulation in the retail financial services industry to state their views, will find support among building societies. The Building Societies Association has been consistent in its support for the Personal Investment Authority concept and the principles described in the letter ('SIB warning for investment body', January 13) from Securities and Investments Board chairman Andrew Large. The promised change in standards and the predominance of public interest representatives on the board have been regarded as particularly important. To abandon the PIA now, after 18 months of planning, would lead to years of uncertainty as parliament debated and enacted legislation and civil servants faced the task of implementation. Consumers, and the financial services industry, deserve better than this. The PIA is chaired by a former chairman of the Association of British Insurers and chief executive of one of the country's largest insurance companies. It will incorporate nine representatives of the industry (far more than would be members of any statutory board) and draw on a range of expertise from other sectors of the economy. Building societies believe the PIA offers an excellent chance of providing the necessary reassurance to customers that the industry truly has their best interests at heart, while also ensuring that the industry view is heard. A range of significant issues in relation to the PIA remain to be resolved. It is important that all in the industry work together to overcome these difficulties. Geoffrey Lister, chairman, The Building Societies Association, 3 Savile Row, London W1X 1AF</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- An exhibition of 160  photos reviewing the work for drafting the Basic Law of the  Macao Special Administrative Region opened at Beijing University  here this afternoon.    The three-day exhibition recording the partial work of the  drafting and advisory committee members is aimed at  commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of the  Macao Basic Law.    Qian Weichang, vice-chairman of the National Committee of  the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council  will sponsor a series of commemorating activities here.    These will help people understand China's basic policy  toward  Macao, its government's principle of "one country, two systems"  and its unremitting efforts for the implementation of the  Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao, he  said.    He said that young students will witness the return of Macao  to the motherland. Therefore, to run such an exhibition at  Beijing University will be of vital importance to strengthening  their national dignity and historical responsibilities.    Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office under the State Council, said the principle of  "one country, two systems" is China's basic state policy.    China will resume its exercise of the sovereignty over Macao  on December 20, 1999, which he said will be a major event in  China's history.    To enable residents from both the mainland and Macao to  understand thoroughly the Macao Basic Law is an important  long-term task to ensure Macao's stable transition and smooth  transfer of its power, Chen said.    Macao needs for both sides to work hard together to  accomplish this task, he added.    In addition, three documentary films reflecting Macao's  history and economy will be shown and a seminar on the return of  Macao and Hong Kong and prospects for these two regions will  also be held at Beijing University.    Taking part in today's opening ceremony were Qian Weichang  and Ma Mankei, vice-chairmen of the National Committee of the  CPPCC, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office under the State Council, and Guo Dongpo, director of the  Macao branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY.</p>

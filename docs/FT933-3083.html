			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Gloom in London DEALERS in sterling interest rate markets suddenly became a good deal more gloomy about the prospect of another cut in UK base rates this year, in spite of economic data which might have suggested otherwise, writes James Blitz. Yesterday's UK data gave a mixed view of the economic recovery. Manufacturing output rose 0.7 per cent in July for a year-on-year increase of 1.7 per cent. But the figure was not much higher than economists had expected and was still 0.3 per cent below its average in the second quarter of this year. Some dealers were led to think that this would help to bring about another cut in UK base rates, which have been unchanged since January. But, instead, sterling interest rate dealers appeared to be more influenced by the slide in the gilts market yesterday, which was itself triggered by a fall in US bonds. The December sterling contract dropped 7 basis points to close at 94.29 and the March contract was down 13 basis points at 94.44. In the cash market, three-month money was about 1/32 higher at 5 31/32 per cent. Some dealers felt that the futures contracts were extremely cheap at yesterday's closing levels. As one dealer put it: 'There are three months of time value in the December contract, and in that period you have got a budget and a host of economic indicators. Anything can happen over that time.' Others felt that the chances of a base rate cut were diminishing all the time. The cash market was again subject to the uncertainties over the removal of the daily shortage. A Pounds 1.3bn deficit was forecast at the start of the day, but an offer of assistance in the early round was not taken up at all, pushing overnight lending to a high of 7 per cent. Most of the shortage was suddenly removed later in the morning. In Europe, the focus was on a sharp fall in the December French franc contract, which ended 14 basis points down at 93.75. Some dealers continued to be affected by the failure to lower the intervention rate on Monday, suggesting that Ger-man rates were set to remain on hold for some time to come. In the German cash market, call money remained very high at around 7.25 per cent, although there are expect-ations of a large liquidity addition in today's operations. The Bundesbank will deal a fixed rate repo for 16 days at 6.70 per cent.</p>

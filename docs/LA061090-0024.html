			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUSSELS IS A CITY NOT TO BE IGNORED  </P> <P> A savage rain squall had descended suddenly, sweeping the Grand Place, the  city's playfully elegant town center, clear of sightseers, ourselves among  them.  </P> <P> What better excuse for a long and lazy lunch? This, our first morning in  Brussels, should be the day to try what all the Belgian guidebooks say is a  staple of the local diet: beer, mussels and frites.  </P> <P> I don't want to diminish the importance of Brussels's historic attractions,  which are splendid, but the Belgian capital is a city where food really should  dominate your daily itinerary.  </P> <P> One of the "favorite leisure pursuits" of the Belgians, advised the Sabena  magazine in my airline seat pocket, "is eating." Sabena is the Belgian national  airline. I was about to do as the Belgians do.  </P> <P> The quality of food, I found, compares quite favorably to that in Paris, and  generally (though not always) without Paris' high prices. Entire streets in  some neighborhoods are devoted to nothing but cafes, restaurants and ice cream  shops.  </P> <P> It was down one of those streets that we headed, the Petite Rue des Bouchers, a  narrow pedestrian passageway running off the Grand Place. It is one of Europe's  most unusual streets, lined the entire length of the block with one inviting  restaurant after another, offering complete fixed-priced dinner menus for $15  to $25.  </P> <P> The rain poured heavily, but we were sheltered by canopies opened over each  entranceway. Many places had set up elaborate window-front displays of fresh  fish, fruit and vegetables, all on ice, to catch the lunch-crowd eye. We might  have been at a busy outdoor market.  </P> <P> Which to choose? We selected Le Mouton d'Or, mostly because it had a cozy fire  ablaze and we could see heaps of dark mussel shells on many of the tables.  Good, flavorful beer is one of Belgium's treasures, and we were quickly served  two towering glasses.  </P> <P> I ordered mussels with white wine sauce, and my wife a variation with tomatoes,  peppers and onions, neither of us quite sure what we would get.  </P> <P> A lunch of beer, mussels and frites is hardly gourmet fare, but I contend that  the proof of a good restaurant is how well it manages its ordinary dishes. Le  Mouton d'Or did wonderfully.  </P> <P> Our mussels arrived in good time, served in two huge black kettles, each pot  large enough to simmer a week's worth of soup. They must have contained four or  five dozen mussels apiece (I stopped counting the shells after the first three  dozen or so), all floating in a sauce rich with fresh vegetables and herbs.  </P> <P> A platter of frites, the slender French fries on which Belgians pride  themselves, followed immediately, with bread to sop up the sauce. We ate  through the rainstorm and then some, and relaxed a while longer with a cup of  coffee.  </P> <P> The bill for two, tip included, was a reasonable $36. Eating, we decided, was  going to be one of our favorite activities in Brussels.  </P> <P> Despite its culinary expertise, Brussels often is ignored by American tourists,  perhaps because it is viewed as a modern city of commerce. While that is true,  the city is anything but staid.  </P> <P> Most European capitals celebrate their castles and cathedrals. Brussels has its  historic architecture too, but it cherishes the impudent little statue called  "Mannekin Pis" depicting a chubby naked boy urinating into a fountain.  </P> <P> It's a whimsical piece dating back to the 14th Century that reflects an  underlying spirit of good times. When the shops and offices close, Brussels has  fun.  </P> <P> The latest version of the statue, sculpted in bronze in 1619, stands about a  block from the Grand Place, on Rue de l'Etuve.  </P> <P> To my list of the city's special treats, which already includes good food and  beer, should be added another exquisite temptation: chocolates. Belgium is a  world capital of fine, handmade chocolates, and hardly a block in the center of  the city doesn't have one or two chocolatiers ready to sell you a single piece  or a boxful.  </P> <P> To curb the mounting calories, we treated the chocolates as dessert, stopping  in a different shop after each meal to sample just one or two creamy truffles  and maybe a nut cluster. Our favorite shop was Wittamer in the Place du Grand  Sablon, a charming old neighborhood only a short walk south from the Grand  Place.  </P> <P> Wittamer, in fact, is two shops, a few doors from each other. One sells  chocolates and the other is a gleamingly elegant patisserie offering luscious  pastries and amazing ice cream creations. Eat a light lunch before this  dessert.  </P> <P> Between meals we did manage a substantial amount of sightseeing, almost all of  it on foot. Brussels is a good walking city. Every day we began at the Grand  Place, the gorgeous heart of old Brussels.  </P> <P> The city's principal square, it is ringed with sidewalk cafes and rivals the  most beautiful plazas or squares anywhere in Europe. A colorful extravaganza of  fanciful statuary, ornate columns and gold-leaf facades, it is a delicious,  entertaining feast for the eyes.  </P> <P> Wealthy commercial guilds built their palatial headquarters around the square.  Part of its beauty stems from architectural unity.  </P> <P> In 1695, Louis XIV bombarded Brussels, which was then ruled by Spain,  destroying much of the square. City leaders rebuilt it with great care for  aesthetics. Even if you are not a food fancier, the Grand Place is still worth  a special trip to Brussels.  </P> <P> The dominant structures on the square are the Gothic Town Hall with its  slender, soaring belfry, and the similarly Gothic Municipal Museum, which faces  it from the other side of the square.  </P> <P> Much of Brussels is determinedly modern, but inside the square it is easy to  imagine you have stepped back into the 17th Century. Wherever you look, the  view is Gothic or Renaissance or baroque.  </P> <P> I enjoyed sitting in a cafe window sipping a beer and enjoying the square's  architectural curiosities. Some of the decorations are charming. The House of  the Swan, once home of the butchers guild, is adorned with a large swan, but  others are bizarre, depicting unusual methods of torture.  </P> <P> On that first rainy day in Brussels, we did not stray far from the Grand Place.  At mid-morning, after a tour of the Municipal Museum, we snacked on apple and  apricot tarts at La Chaloupe d'Or, once the house of the tailors and now a  bustling coffeehouse and beer pub.  </P> <P> Confirmed sightseers ought to think of Brussels as a reward to themselves.  Exhaust the museums of London, Paris and Amsterdam, then head for Brussels for  a long weekend of good food and pleasant relaxation.  </P> <P> My favorite restaurant in our three-day stay was the charming and inexpensive  Aux Armes de Bruxelles, also on Petite Rue des Bouchers.  </P> <P> It was crowded and noisy, the kind of old-style dining room where the waiters  know most of the patrons and almost everyone sits elbow-to-elbow at communal  tables for eight. The congenial banter between waiters and residents put to the  lie a guidebook warning that the Petite Rue des Bouchers caters only to  tourists.  </P> <P> All through the meal one waiter was kept busy making flaming crepes, each batch  preceded by a fountain of fire that leaped for the ceiling. I expected someone  to be charred momentarily, but the waiter knew what he was doing.  </P> <P> The food was as good as the room was colorful. I ordered a boneless chicken  breast in an orange sauce, a dish that arrived rather fancily arranged in  alternate orange and chicken slices. It was accompanied by potatoes Normandie,  which looked like small crusty marshmallows, and a mixed salad of very fresh  vegetables.  </P> <P> Belgian farmers are noted for the extremely high quality of their fruits and  vegetables, and it is said that the Belgian consumer will accept nothing but  the best. I ended the meal with a delicious praline souffle and coffee. My half  of the dinner, a large beer and tip included, was $32.  </P> <P> The Brussels tourist office in the Town Hall sells an annual guide to the  city's restaurants, rating them both on quality and on value for the money.  From one to five irises are awarded by a committee of Brussels's best-known  food critics.  </P> <P> If you are a stranger to the city, as we were, the guidebook (about 90 cents)  is very helpful. Aux Armes de Bruxelles, good as it was, rated only a single  iris.  </P> <P> One night we tried a three-iris restaurant, Trente Rue de la Paille,  recommended by a friend who had lived recently in the city. Just off the lovely  Place du Grand Sablon, it is a cozy spot with seating for no more than a couple  of dozen diners.  </P> <P> The food was superb, but contrary to the rest of our experience in Brussels, it  also was very expensive. An extra iris or two, it seems, can add considerably  to the bill.  </P> <P> The menu was written on a blackboard, listing at most a handful of choices for  a first and second course and dessert. An appetizer of artichoke hearts and  diced tomatoes was not added to the bill but was included. The price, with wine  and tip, was $90 per person.  </P> <P> Once I sniffed at travelers who returned home talking only of the fine food  they had, but my wife put the matter into perspective.  </P> <P> I am fond of history, she noted, and enjoy pursuing historic paths, an activity  she gladly shares during the day. But her hobby is fine cooking, and she loves  to examine cookbooks. When she travels she wants to sample what the great chefs  of the world are serving. So I follow her lead in the evening, hardly the worse  for it.  </P> <P> My special interest was the small collection of works in the Museum of Ancient  Art by the 16th-Century painter Pieter Brueghel, who lived in and is buried in  Brussels.  </P> <P> With an innovative genius, Brueghel captured the everyday life of his time in  such extraordinary works as "Winter Landscape with Skaters and Bird Trap,"  which depicts young ice skaters on a village pond. It is a haunting painting.  </P> <P> One afternoon we made a pilgrimage to the Horta Museum, a tribute to Belgian  architect Victor Horta, who pioneered art nouveau at the turn of this century.  The style was very popular in Brussels, and the Town Hall tourist office  distributes a list of 60 art nouveau structures still standing. It is at 25 Rue  Americaine, about an hour's brisk walk south from the Grand Place.  </P> <P> "A house should not merely be a reflection of its owner's life style but should  represent a portrait of him," Horta once said.  </P> <P> The museum occupies two adjacent townhouses built by Horta in 1898. He lived in  one and kept his office in the other. They are an artwork of swirling polished  wood, gracefully curving ironwork, rich ballooning cabinetry, mosaic floors and  stained glass of delicate tones.  </P> <P> One of Brussels' finest residential and shopping areas, the Place du Grand  Sablon, is south of the Grand Place in a neighborhood well worth spending some  time.  </P> <P> There you will find Wittamer the chocolatier and some of the more expensive  restaurants, including Trente Rue de la Paille. There are also numerous art  galleries and antique shops, many of the latter lining Rue de Rollebeck -- a  steep, one-block cobblestone street leading to the square.  </P> <P> The focal point of the Grand Sablon is Petit Sablon, a beautiful  Renaissance-style garden filled with statuary. A splendid wrought-iron fence  encircles the garden, its posts topped by 48 bronze statuettes representing  Brussels guilds. I found it fun trying to identify them.  </P> <P> Nearby is the 12th-Century Church of Notre Dame de la Chapelle, which shelters  Breughel's tomb.  </P> <P> Just north of the Grand Place are the three St. Hubert Royal Galleries, the  first glass-covered shopping arcades built in Europe. Dating from 1846, they  are the Gallery of the King, Gallery of the Queen and Gallery of the Princes.  </P> <P> Each is lined with boutiques, a few of them selling the handmade lacework for  which Belgium is famous. Lace handkerchiefs are about $15 each; a box of  Belgian chocolates begins at about $10.  </P> <P> In Brussels, the subject somehow always gets back to food, and I don't want to  omit yet one more edible treat to which I succumbed -- the Belgian waffle.  </P> <P> Just across the street from our hotel entrance was a window-front waffle shop  dispensing fresh-made hot waffle squares, heaped high with whipped cream and  splashed with good Belgian chocolate sauce.  </P> <P> I consider it an act of strong will that I indulged only once -- about an hour  after I flew into town. But then, how else would I have managed the beer, the  frites, the mussels, the apricot tarts and all the other delights awaiting me  here?  </P></p>

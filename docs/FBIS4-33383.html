			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Diplomatic sources have  disclosed that two more Cubans entered the occupied residence of  the Belgian ambassador in Havana at dawn today.    With the new arrivals, the number of occupiers has risen to  124; they have been at the embassy since 28 May demanding  permits to leave the country.    The sources refrained from specifying how the two new  arrivals entered the residence, which is surrounded by dozens of  policemen from the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) and state  security agents dressed in civilian attire.    Today, Willy Verriest, the Belgian Government envoy,  Ambassador Paul Vermiersch, and Foreign Ministry officials  examined the "technical aspects of the measures that will be  adopted to facilitate a final solution" to the problem,  according to the state-owned news agency PRENSA LATINA.</p>

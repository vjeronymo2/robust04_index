			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television If this is to be a slump in front of the box evening you could do worse than switch on BBC2 at 7.40 and stay with the network until midnight. Open Space (7.40) is about lighthouse keepers, those romantic figures who symbolise the qualities of the prince in the fairy tale tower, the religious recluse on his pole, and the man with the lamp. It seems that the number of tower rock lights out at sea manned by Trinity House is now down to only three. Bookmark (8.10) records the passing of an oral storytelling tradition in Rajastan which has survived six centuries but is dying out now that 'The Epic of Pabuji' is being written down for the first time. MASH (9.00) sustains a standard of script writing which, in British comedy, is achieved only during short runs by single writers. Pigeons are coming home to roost in Nice Town (9.25), the dormitory suburb where Joe so altruistically provided the wherewithal for his sister in law to have a baby. This is the last episode. Newsnight remains the most civilised, intelligent wrap-up of the day's events (10.30) and The Late Show is still the only daily culture magazine on British television (11.15).</p>

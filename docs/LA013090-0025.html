			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL CONCERNS AMID THE HEADY TALK;  </P> <P> JAPAN: THE PRIME MINISTER WENT TO EUROPE LOOKING FOR VOTES BACK HOME, BUT IT'S  THE RELATIONSHIP WITH AMERICA THAT WILL SUFFER IF HE DOESN'T GET THEM.  </P> <P> The real campaigning for Japan's Feb. 18 general election began three weeks ago  with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's "typhoon tour" of Europe's capital cities.  </P> <P> Kaifu came to Europe with his Liberal Democrat government in its deepest mess  in 35 years. He wanted not only to appear statesmanlike to the viewers back  home, but also to establish a bridgehead of trust to Eastern Europe. He  succeeded in the first aim, but the heady talk of international cooperation to  revitalize Eastern Europe could come to nothing if his party loses to a  markedly more populist, protectionist and emotional opposition coalition.  </P> <P> Besides, the election will not be fought over Europe. Although the Japanese  enjoyed the news from Berlin and Prague, their priorities at the polls are  three major issues with ramifications for the Japan-U.S. relationship:  </P> <P>  -- The 3% consumption tax introduced last April. Its bungled introduction left  consumers feeling betrayed by broken promises and stung by an unfair and  unnecessary levy. The consumer revolt cost the Liberal Democrats their Upper  House majority in the summer. This election, too, will be something of a  referendum on the issue -- the Liberal Democrats want to keep a revised version  of the tax, the opposition wants it scrapped.  </P> <P> The choice is significant to the United States. Extra tax revenue frees cash to  satisfy military burden-sharing demands. It also allows greater spending on  welfare, which reduces the need for savings, thus leading to more consumer  spending and more imports, according to the U.S. argument at the Structural  Impediments Initiative talks, the American-Japanese forum aimed at opening up  the Japanese economy and improving life for Japanese consumers.  </P> <P>  -- Rice-import liberalization and the "food security" question, which Japan is  promoting before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Japanese farmers  have resisted Liberal Democrat efforts to wean them off subsidies; the  opposition parties back the farmers. Washington has already won large  concessions on the import of oranges and beef. Rice now stands as a final point  of principle before the whole Japanese market is opened.  </P> <P>  -- The territorial dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union. Failure to  decide the sovereignty of four small islands and to sign a peace treaty with  Moscow keep the door closed on Far East detente and deny wholehearted Japanese  backing to Western efforts to shore up Mikhail Gorbachev. Voters, traditionally  hostile to the Soviet Union, see this issue in mainly emotional and patriotic  terms. But Washington will continue to be concerned with what is increasingly  seen as an anachronism.  </P> <P> America's interests in this election are best represented by the Liberal  Democrats. Michael Armacost, the U.S. ambassador, has publicly criticized the  Japan Socialist Party's new defense policy, acknowledging that an outright  opposition victory would lead to a long period of debate about the future of  the U.S.-Japan security treaty and the status of South Korea, whose government  is not recognized by the Socialists.  </P> <P> The next round of negotiations on the Structural Impediments Initiative has  already been postponed by Japan until after the general election, and it is  unlikely that a new Socialist government would give the talks a high priority.  </P> <P> Until recently, speculation about an opposition victory would have been  dismissed by most people in Japan. The mood has now changed, and even senior  Liberal Democrat politicians recognize that the result will be close. Either of  the two most likely results, a slim Liberal Democrat majority or a coalition  government headed by the Socialists, will simply prolong the domestic political  stalemate. Europe, and the widening circle of Japanese aid recipients, would  like to see a strong and stable government in Tokyo. But of Japan's  international relationships, that with the United States will be damaged the  most by indecisiveness.  </P> <P> Europe served Kaifu's purposes well. If he wins the election, he will find more  serious European questions occupying ever more of his time. But in order to  pass the election hurdle, he must first win the argument for more liberal and  internationalist policies at home.  </P> <P> If he fails, the stagnation that threatens to set in after Feb. 18 will hit the  United States the hardest.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BANKRUPTS CAN'T RECOVER TAXES  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today strengthened the government's power to keep the taxes  withheld from businesses about to declare bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Voting 9 to 0, the justices ruled that the trustee of bankrupt American  International Airways is not entitled to recover $700,000 in taxes paid to the  Internal Revenue Service.  </P> <P> The airline had become delinquent by the spring of 1984 in withholding Social  Security and income taxes from employee wages and excise taxes collected from  passengers.  </P> <P> The IRS then ordered the airline to file monthly, instead of quarterly, tax  returns and open a special bank account to handle the tax deposits.  </P> <P> American International filed for bankruptcy in July, 1984, to try to reorganize  the business and pay off some of the money owed creditors. That effort failed,  and three months later a trustee was appointed to liquidate the company.  </P> <P> The trustee sought to recover $1.6 million in taxes paid to the IRS in the  months leading up to the liquidation.  </P> <P> A bankruptcy judge in Pennsylvania permitted the trustee to recover $700,000  from the government and the IRS appealed to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of  Appeals based in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The appeals court said the trustee may not recover the $700,000.  </P></p>

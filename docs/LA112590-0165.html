			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ISRAEL;  </P> <P> PATROL KILLS 5, SAYS SEA RAID WAS FOILED  </P> <P> An Israeli patrol boat sank a vessel off the Lebanese coast, killing five armed  guerrillas who were apparently on the way to attack an Israeli target,  according to radio reports and military sources.  </P> <P> It was not immediately known if there were any survivors from the boat, Israeli  radio reported, and there were no Israeli casualties. Reports variously  identified the suspect vessel as a dinghy or a speedboat. The Israeli military  had no official statement on the incident. The Muslim Voice of the Nation and  the Christian Voice of Lebanon said the craft sank off Saadiyat, about 12 miles  south of Beirut. They did not identify the victims.  </P></p>

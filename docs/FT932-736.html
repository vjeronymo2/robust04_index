			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Drink: Belgian brews with body and soul 'I say Weihenstephan.' 'And I want Pilsener.' SO SAY two of the Prussian wedding guests in Theodor Fontane's 1897 novel Der Stechlin. By this time, Berlin and Prussia had fallen to a two-pronged beer attack from Bavaria and Bohemia. Just like the rest of Europe, Berliners once contented themselves with the reddish-brown beers and ales brewed locally; in this case, those of Bernau and Werder, towns to the east and west of the capital. The first Pilsen beers arrived with the railway in the 1850s; the Bavarians came a little later. As the century went on, Berliners achieved a small compromise by hopping these new, yellow beers a little more to the north German taste. The result was the Berliner Molle. South Germany resisted more manfully, but even Bavaria has lost ground to the Bohemians this century. Bavarian beer originally was a dark brown lager but, in the past 30 years, the taste has gone over to light, bright beers; only the older generation of Muncheners have clung to their traditional Dunkelbier. By the end of the century, Pilsener is likely to have won over an even greater chunk of the Bavarian population. The Bohemian influence has spread to the beers of Alsace, Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Jamaica and the United States: all are, to some extent, inspired by the soft-water, bottom-fermented, golden-hued beers of Pilsen. Since the 1960s, the same process has hit Britain. Bass-Charrington says 'lager' accounts for 80 per cent of its sales - even though the mainstay is Carling Black Label, a rather bitter lager closer to the north German type. Of all the countries to have kept faith with their brewing traditions, Belgium excites the most interest from enthusiasts. This is as it should be, for it has more different styles of beer than anywhere else. Take, for example, the great Trappist beers made only in five Belgian monasteries, and one across the border in Holland; dark, complex brews all. 'Abbey' beers often are made in the same style but they are produced 'under license' by commercial breweries. Lambic and Gueuze both are wheat beers which have undergone spontaneous fermentation and maturation in casks. Gueuze goes a stage further and is fermented once again in bottle, like champagne. Some Lambic is flavoured with cherries or raspberries, the fruit being poured directly into the casks to set off a second fermentation. The result is fruity, certainly, but completely dry. In Brabant, there are white beers which are made mainly from wheat, like a German Weizen. The difference is that the Belgians add aromatics, such as coriander and orange peel, then ferment the beers a second time in bottle. The result is a brew like Hoegaarden: lemony in colour with a slight yeast haze and a tangy, refreshing, citric character. Hoegaarden promises to be more readily available in Britain nowthat the main importer, Whitbread, has decided to release it through a number of up-market pubs. In west Flanders there are 'red' beers, like those of the Rodenbach brewery which spend up to two years maturing in wooden vats; this gives them a strangely vinous quality. Indeed, in many ways Belgium produces the beers which come closest to the wine-lover's ideal. Michael Jackson in his book The Great Beers of Belgium, persists in comparing the beers to wines, perhaps because these are brews designed for long meditation. With the exception of Whitbread, the brewers have been predictably slow in making Belgian bottled beers available to the on-trade. Lured into a pub the other day during the brief heat-wave, I was thwarted completely in my attempts to find a decent, bottle-conditioned brew. In the end, I had to make do with a bottle of Spanish San Miguel: a Pilsener-style beer which proved just one more example of the colonising zeal of the Bohemians. Stockists of Belgian bottled beers include: the Beer Shop, 8 Pitfield Street, London NI (071-739 3701); Grogblossom and branches, 66 Notting Hill Gate, London WII (071-792 3834); the Beer Cellar, Thame, Oxfordshire (0844-260 500); and the York Beer Shop, 28 Sandringham Street, Fishergate, York (0904-647 136). All do mail-order sales. A restaurant called Belgo at 72 Chalk Farm Road, London, NWI (071-267 2179), has a wonderful selection of bottled Belgian beers - and food to go with them.</p>

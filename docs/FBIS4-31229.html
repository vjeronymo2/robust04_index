			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] At this time President of the  Republic Arpad Goncz is giving a news conference in the  parliament house in Budapest to announce the date of the  inaugural session of the new National Assembly. Over now to the  parliament building:    [Correspondent Forro] Good morning. This is Evelin Forro,  reporting from parliament. The president of the Republic has  now taken his seat and you can now hear his announcement:    [Goncz] My dear friends: This meeting will not be very  exciting. I will announce a few things which will obviously not  surprise you.    Today I held discussions with Gyula Horn [chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] and then with the chairmen of  the parliamentary parties. The topic of the discussions was the  preparation of the inaugural session of the National Assembly.  The expected date of the inaugural session is 28 June 1994.  Its task, the task of the inaugural session, will be to examine  the mandates, to elect officials, to determine the order of  sessions, and to elect members of the standing committees.    At the inaugural session I intend to announce my proposal  for  prime minister, Gyula Horn. So what you are hearing now is not  an official announcement, and the reason for this is very  simple: Until the inaugural session the country still has a  government. After the inaugural session the present government  will transform itself into a caretaker government. That is the  natural time when I must announce my recommendation for the post  of prime minister.    I have asked Gyula Horn whether he will accept my nomination  and he has replied in the affirmative.    The issues that must be decided at the inaugural session  require preparation, political and professional coordinating  discussions between the parliamentary parties. These  coordinating discussions will begin on 9 June.    Obviously, the order of importance will be determined --  incidentally, I will not interfere in this -- by the fact that  the decision about the functions is to a certain extent also  contingent on the coalition discussions. Discussion of the  practical issues, of procedural issues, at the level of experts  can, (?in my view), begin even earlier. There is a huge number  of tiny practical tasks that will have to be performed by 28  June.    It was about these things that we conferred with the party  chairmen, and at the same time I asked them to inform me about  the results of their talks at their....[pauses] at our  discussion 20 June 1994.    I would also like to inform you that this week I will  conduct  one-on-one discussions with the chairmen of the parliamentary  parties, taking them nicely one by one so that I might hear  their opinions about the country's economic and political  situation. Perhaps it will interest you to know that we will  begin with the smaller parties and proceed upwards, so  that....[sentence incomplete as heard]    [Forro] [passage omitted] After meeting with Gyula Horn, the  president received the leaders of the parliamentary parties  together. In addition to Gyula Horn there were Ivan Peto,  chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats; Laszlo Surjan,  chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party; and Jozsef  Torgyan, chairman of the Independent Smallholders' Party. Peter  Boross, the outgoing prime minister, represented the Hungarian  Democratic Forum instead of [party Chairman] Lajos Fur. Viktor  Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz],  is in the hospital having a knee operation. Laszlo Kover, head  of Fidesz's parliamentary group, represented him. [passage  omitted]    Arpad Goncz said he wants a stable and balanced government  which is capable of functioning and which is based on a broad  consensus. I asked the president on behalf of Hungarian Radio  how he will be able to cooperate with MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn,  the probable prime minister. Arpad Goncz said: I hope we can  cooperate well since we have known each other for a long time.</p>

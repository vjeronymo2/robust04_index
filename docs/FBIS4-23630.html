			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 12 (AFP) -- Police mounted a checkpoint  on a road leading to a number of foreign missions Sunday [12  June], after alleging that "a certain foreign mission" was  linked with fugitive opposition leader Mashood Abiola.    A small number of armed policemen were posted at the  entrance  to Eleke Crescent after police offered a reward for the arrest  of Abiola, who fled house arrest Saturday.    The Moslem millionaire, the presumed winner of annulled  presidential elections last June, has declared a rival  government of national unity and proclaimed himself president.    The road on which police were posted leads to the diplomatic  missions of the United States, Britain, Italy, Denmark, Germany,  Sweden, Russia, India, Bulgaria and Finland, as well as their  associated residences.    Passengers and drivers were questioned about the missions to  which they were heading.    Earlier a police statement reported on radio said that "it  has been established that the activities have enjoyed the tacit  support and linkages to a certain foreign mission in Lagos."    Officials have offered a 60,000 naira (2,700 dollar) reward  for information leading to Abiola's arrest, national television  earlier reported.    In a nationwide broadcast Sunday, military leader General  Sani Abacha expressed hope that the international community  "will do nothing to encourage the idle dream of some  self-seeking individuals or the parochial interest of a small  opportunistic group within our society who are bent on acts of  destabilisation under various covers."</p>

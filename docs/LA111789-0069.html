			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S. J. DIAMOND: MOST 1-900 NUMBERS DON'T DELIVER WHAT THEY  ADVERTISE  </P> <P> Who wouldn't be curious? The "Success Line," 1-900-USA-CASH, promises tips on  earning additional income, getting jobs, fixing bad credit. D. J. Jazzy Jeff  and the Fresh Prince offer rap sessions on 1-900-909-JEFF. There's even group  conversation, all male, on 1-900-505-JOCK.  </P> <P> Something for everyone. What a kick.  </P> <P> It's more than that. To the entrepreneurs selling such fare, billed to the  caller's phone, 900 service is the "fourth medium," after radio, TV and print,  says Cory Eisner, vice president of New York-based Phone Programs (Jazzy Jeff  and others).  </P> <P> To consumers, it's a potential nightmare. Such numbers, says a California  university professor, fighting the phone company over a child's unauthorized  calls, "in effect turn the telephone into a credit card or blank check, without  the protections that federal and state law provide to credit card or check  users."  </P> <P> What's exciting is the promise of personal access to the information age.  There's talk of financial quotes, legal advice, medical information, of "known  and reputable providers who'd like to use (900 service) as an alternative way  to service their customers," says Howard Levin, vice president of marketing at  Interactive Telemedia, a Los Angeles "telepromotions" agency.  </P> <P> But that's mostly talk. There's more promotion than information broadcast.  "It's sad when you see all the truly fantastic things that can be done with  telephones," says Jeffrey Holtzman, deputy city attorney in Santa Monica, "and  what do we get but P. T. Barnum?"  </P> <P> In a week of calling, the most intellectual fare heard was 1-900-WEATHER (75  cents a minute). Typical financial stuff (1-900-USA-CASH, $2 for the first  minute, $1 each additional) defined cash reserves as "money you don't need to  live on," and suggested using credit cards to buy now and pay when one has  money.  </P> <P> More than 90% of 900 lines are "entertainment," and while it's doubtless  someone's medium, it's no fourth. It's inane chatter from a rock star, a  rapper, a deservedly starving comic ("Her face brought up more food than a  Heimlich maneuver"). More often, it's clips from albums, books, movies about to  be released -- undisguised hypes billed to Barnum's born-every-minute suckers.  </P> <P> Much of the information transmitted comes from the caller, paying to give  personal data to sweepstakes promoters, food companies, opinion polls. It's  party-line conversations with consenting men, women, sports fans, or private  conversations with other callers ("Hi, this is Lisa, 5'7", 125 pounds, I'm bi  (bisexual) but also straight, Voice mail 31644").  </P> <P> Alas, one can't always hear the fourth medium. Telephone wires being rather low  fidelity, Jazzy Jeff seemed to bubble up through water, Motley Crue was all  beat and static. Six celebrity impersonations for a birthday greeting ($3 to  hear them, $11.99 to order one) needed rehearing.  </P> <P> The all-male chat group above (90 cents per minute) was always silent, without  participants. Sports Phone Live (99 cents per minute to talk sports with seven  to 10 fans and celebrities) had only the staff man, twice. Even 1-900-USA-SWING  (67 cents a minute, 15-minute minimum) was all wind whistling through the party  lines and occasional voices calling, pathetically, "Hello? Hello? Who's there?  This is Jim. Hello, who's this? Hello? "  </P> <P> Worse, this fourth medium is being unleashed before the marketplace is ready.  The sales arrangements, or lack of them, are almost anti-consumer: There's  little disclosure and no normal retail procedures. The consumer may not know  what he's buying or its price, and can't cancel the purchase once made.  </P> <P> Nor is it well regulated. The Federal Communications Commission regulates only  the terms of the service that telephone carriers provide to interstate  "information-providers" (the programming entrepreneurs), not the service those  entrepreneurs provide the consumer, or "end user." The few 900 numbers offering  service strictly intrastate come under variable state regulations.  </P> <P> In California, for example, there must be an initial statement of price on such  calls, a $20 price cap, a monitor (in the provider's employ) on party lines to  interrupt "harmful matter." But the rules don't yet cover all telephone  companies, and cover only intrastate calls -- a minute portion of the market,  indistinguishable to consumers, who have no idea where each 1-900 call goes.  </P> <P> The particular carrier (more than 60 provide 900 service to entrepreneurs) may  cancel 900 charges if calls were made without the bill-payer's knowledge or  authorization (by children, perhaps) or if he didn't know the cost. But most do  so only once, and none have provisions for canceling charges if the consumer  got bad service or a disappointing product -- an empty party line, inane  financial advice, inferior porn. "Our basic policy," says Andrea West,  AT&amp;T's national marketing manager for 900 service, "is to sustain the  charges."  </P> <P> So much for the retailer. The manufacturers, or providers of these messages are  often unknown and never identified and in many cases, says AT&amp;T's West,  "did not want to be referred to by anyone." It's not easy, therefore, to  contact the people responsible for a message, even through their carrier (if  one can figure out which it is).  </P> <P> AT&amp;T requires a written inquiry from anyone asking a provider's identity  and provides only name and mailing address. The information line at Telesphere  (the USA prefix, among others) is always busy. And Pacific Bell (505-JOCK,  among others) took 50 minutes to understand the inquiry and find the right  office, right individual and right list providing such information.  </P> <P> Even getting one's lines blocked from all 900 access isn't easy. Individual  states may make total blocking available or just blocking of intrastate calls,  blocking of all 900-code prefixes or blocking of selected prefixes. Some  companies don't even know what they can do: the California professor was told  that GTE California doesn't provide 900 blocking, then that it does but not for  all 900 numbers, then that does but not for all his lines (a GTE California  spokesman says it does, period).  </P> <P> For telephone companies, for consumers, even for regulators, "it's very  difficult to try to sort out this service, jurisdictionally and otherwise,"  says Kathie Kneff, chief of the informal complaints branch of the FCC's common  carrier bureau. Until someone does, consumers would be smart not to use it.  </P></p>

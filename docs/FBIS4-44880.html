			<p>CSO     [Text] MITI will launch its industrial technical assistance  program targeting six ASEAN countries. In order to introduce the  concept of total quality control (TQC). the most representative  of the production control methods associated with Japanese  industries, MITI will draw up a technical cooperation plan,  which will be implemented beginning in April 1995. In addition,  joint two-nation research projects will be undertaken involving  each of the three countries, viz., Indonesia, Malaysia, and  Thailand. By providing assistance to each ASEAN country in its  effort to develop industrial technologies, Japan will establish  a setup enabling regional businesses to help one another in  technical fields.    The standardization and quality management committee to be  organized by MITI and each country's quality control  organization will exchange documents for mutual agreement  concerning the cooperation plans. According to the agreement,  the Japanese Government and the committee will formulate a  program designed to provide each country with the Japanese TQC  technique, which will be implemented beginning April 1995 under  the five-year plan. MITI will invite owners and production-line  managers of each country to Japan to attend seminars  specifically designed for them. In addition, Japanese engineers  and technicians will be sent to the participating countries to  provide instructions in the TQC method.    At present, the countries marked for the participation in  MITI's two-nation joint research project are Indonesia,  Malaysia, and Thailand. MITI will exchange information  concerning its technical policy and will sponsor joint research  involving Japan's national research institutes and research  organizations of participating ASEAN countries.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Appointments: Steely nerve for Europe As senior appointments in Japanese companies tend to go, Kobe Steel Europe's new director and chief financial officer is highly unusual in that he is neither old nor is he Japanese. Reg Clark, 33, joined Kobe from Oxford with a degree in modern history and no particular connection with Japan. 'It was regarded as a very bizarre option at the time (the late 1970s).' After a 'very tough' three years in Japan on the international side of the heavy machinery operations, he decided that Kobe could not teach him what he wanted to know about finance, and that anyway he wanted a career in the Euromarkets. So he returned to the UK, to work in turn for Yamaichi International, Swiss Bank Corporation and J P Morgan. 'Once Kobe understood I had no plans to rejoin, they were very friendly,' even putting some of their Eurobond business his way. But unspec-ified 'family circumstances' dictated that he left the punishingly long hours of the City in 1988, at which point he took up with Kobe again. Speaking Japanese 'well enough to get by but not remotely fluently', he professes he is surprised he has got as far as he has; he is probably the most senior foreigner at Kobe. Now he has to help make a go of Europe - with expansion so far largely frustrated as a series of acquisitions have fallen through at the eleventh hour.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, member of the SPD </F> Executive Committee, by Ursula Knapp; place and date not given:  "The Parliament Must Decide"]    [Text] [Knapp] The daily pictures from Gorazde are cruel.  In view of such a dramatic development, is the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] still able to maintain its position --  that is, to reject an armed intervention, including Bundeswehr  soldiers?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] The situation is horrible. However, it is  correct that so far, no party in Germany has demanded that  German pilots fly air raids in the former Yugoslavia. God knows  that military restraint in this region is appropriate for us.  Any armed intervention would only exacerbate the situation even  more.    As a last consequence, the question arises for the United  States and NATO whether they should enter a ground war that  cannot be won or whether they should try -- with military  pressure and ultimatums as well -- to finally achieve political  solutions, for example, at an international conference, as  suggested by Yeltsin and Clinton.    However, I also want to point out one thing. NATO does not  need to intervene in Turkey because it is already there.  Nevertheless, it has been watching thousands of Kurds being  massacred in eastern Anatolia over the years. In Rwanda, the  United Nations need not intervene either because it is already  there with blue helmets. It is now withdrawing them and leaving  25,000 people who fled to its refuge to their fate. There are  terrible double standards here. I feel that the discussion on  the former Yugoslavia is often only used as a pretext in the  domestic policy discussion in Germany to prepare completely  different employment opportunities for the Bundeswehr.    [Knapp] One can also point out that the UN Security Council,  not the Federal Government, resolved the missions in what  remains of Yugoslavia.    [Wieczorek-Zeul] The UN Security Council adopted the  resolutions, but the question of how and by whom they are to be  implemented is the sovereign decision of each member country --  that is, also the FRG. The resolutions authorize the countries  to become active, but they do not commit countries to war  missions.    The constitutional side is a completely different business:  Before the Federal Constitutional Court, we are above all  interested in putting an end to the creeping development where  it is tried to dissolve the limits set by the Basic Law. The  Federal Constitutional Court took our complaints very seriously,  as was shown by the hearing. The Bundeswehr can only be used  for its own defense and the defense of the alliance partners --  that is, the NATO states. Those who want other employment  opportunities must change the Constitution. The SPD has also  made it clear how far it is prepared to change the Constitution.    [Knapp] How far?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] We are explicitly saying: the possibility  of blue helmet missions and participation in blockades, which  are definitely also an instrument of military constraint.  However, it has to be ensured that the German Parliament  decides on every individual mission. Things must not develop in  the direction of soldiers and young draftees being dispatched  all over the world. After all, German soldiers, young draftees,  have to be able to serve on a safe constitutional basis.    [Knapp] What if NATO resolves further bombardments in  Bosnia-Herzegovina on the basis of the UN resolution?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] Germany's participation in bombardments in  the former Yugoslavia would be politically wrong and not covered  by constitutional law.    [Knapp] Even after an amendment to the constitution that  would be supported by the SPD?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] The Bundeswehr should not be involved in  warfare.    [Knapp] It is rumored that, with your opinion, you no longer  represent the majority within the SPD Executive Committee, at  any rate not Rudolf Scharping.    [Wieczorek-Zeul] I am presenting the position that the SPD  formulated in its party congress decisions. On this basis, we  also presented the draft of a government program, which also  reflects my position. Rudolf Scharping also made it repeatedly  clear that the Bundeswehr will not participate in worldwide  combat missions under a government led by the SPD. If someone  wanted to change the SPD line, he would have to be open about  his dealings.    As for the rest: Everyone who demands that German soldiers  should go to war has to ask himself: Is he prepared to go  himself or only prepared to send others? I am personally not  prepared to send young German draftees and soldiers to war.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Gambler eyes his crowning glory: Francois Mitterrand is determined that Maastricht will be ratified Among the ornate objects lining the presidential chamber in the Elysee, a sculpture of Time's Winged Chariot would not now be completely out of place. For at 76, and not in the best of health, Francois Mitterrand knows he does not have much time if he is to save what he regards as his final and crowning European achievement - the Maastricht treaty on European union. The next few days will be crucial. When he takes his place as the senior statesman at the Edinburgh summit on Friday, the French president will be fighting for Maastricht's survival in the face of monetary disorder, political disarray and doubts as to whether two countries - Denmark and Britain - will ever ratify the European pact. If there are any doubts that salvaging the treaty is at the heart of this weekend's deliberations, Mr Mitterrand is determined to lay them to rest. Looking pale but resolute, he says Maastricht remains the only route-map to European integration, and he will brook no alternative. It can be neither renegotiated for the 12 nor watered down for individual members, he insists. By the end of this year, 10 EC states will have ratified it, and if Denmark and/or Britain fail to do so, the others will proceed regardless. 'We cannot make an agreement minus a single currency, minus the central bank, minus a common foreign policy. . . . Rejection (of Maastricht) by the countries in question (Denmark and Britain) would not stop the construction of Europe,' he insists. Maastricht, he claims, could be legally adapted to a smaller number of countries. Mr Mitterrand's summit partners will find him at Edinburgh returning to the tough line he took in the immediate after-shock of the Danish referendum which rejected the treaty last June. In effect, he is staking all on European union - looking to the European stage for success that, with his Socialist party almost certain to be defeated in next March's parliamentary elections, he can no longer hope for at home. A passion for European integration is the one consistent theme in the president's long and tortuous political career, stretching back to his experience as a German prisoner in the second world war. The likely advent of a centre-right government in France next spring will mean he will be less involved in domestic affairs. But he will still be able to determine the overall thrust of policy by helping lock France, and others, into Maastricht. He has recently proposed a series of constitutional reforms; but they are mainly designed to strengthen the parliament at the expense of the government, and nothing in them would diminish his presidential prerogative in foreign policy. Is Mr Mitterrand bluffing in warning that the rest of Europe could leave Britain and Denmark? Certainly, he is a gambler who has shown himself to play for high political stakes against uncertain odds. He refuses to admit any tactical error in putting Maastricht to a referendum in his own country. He brushes aside observations that the very strong showing of Maastricht's opponents in the French referendum campaign helped destabilise the European Monetary System. It was, he says, 'a very fine campaign' because Maastricht jolted Frenchmen and women out of their indifference to referenda of recent years, providing a turnout of more than 70 per cent. Just how much of a chance he consciously took, he is only now prepared to spell out. 'Ask my staff and they will tell you that I never expected more than 52 per cent (approval).' His EC counterparts would have trembled had they known how fine his calculation was. In the end, it was a 51.4 per cent approval for Maastricht. And the margin of victory was bigger than that by which John Kennedy beat Richard Nixon, says the president, as though 1960 was yesterday. More to the immediate point, he notes that it was a bigger margin than that by which Maastricht failed in the Danish referendum. Yet, Mr Mitterrand, whose own rating has touched all-time lows for Fifth Republic presidents, knows better than anyone the fickleness of public opinion. That seems to be why he appears so anxious to avoid the impact on a still-undecided Britain of a second, and possibly again negative, referendum in Denmark. There is a clear distinction in the way the president talks about Denmark and Britain. He is readier to discuss a European Union without Denmark. 'There would be no reason to displace it (Denmark), though once Maastricht enters into force, there will be a disparate situation which will require some changes.' But, beyond general warnings that laggards get left behind in European integration, he is deeply reluctant to enter into the specifics of Maastricht-without-Britain. 'I do not despair at all that Britain will adhere to the treaty which the head of its government has signed.' He refuses to join in the widespread criticism of the UK presidency. Indeed, he says Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, his trade minister, 'went too far' in describing Britain's handling of EC business as calamitous. But the president is implacable on one point: John Major would be making a serious mistake if he delayed completing UK ratification until after a second Danish referendum. This is precisely what Mr Major promised potential backbench rebels in order to win his Maastricht vote in the House of Commons last month. 'British policy should not be put in tow to Danish policy,' Mr Mitterrand says, adding with ill-concealed disdain: 'I don't see how Great Britain can allow its decision to be made in another country.' There are many who now argue that the Community's present disarray stems not from bad faith of individual governments, but from inherent flaws in the Maastricht treaty. Mr Mitterrand will have none of this. 'Europe has not broken down,' he flatly asserts. The treaty flowed logically, he argues, from the Single European Act, negotiated in 1985, which set in place the single market. 'Maastricht is designed precisely to ensure that this free market is not simply anarchy.' For example, he sees Maastricht as an overdue treaty of protection in that it provides for police co-operation in a frontier-free Europe. Without such provisions, he said, you would have a Europe 'open to all winds'. But surely the treaty's core provisions on economic and monetary union (Emu) now seem too ambitious and too rushed? Nonsense, the French president says. 'We needed a fairly rigorous convention (on Emu), and I repeat that 10 out of 12 countries have imposed this discipline on themselves. . . . The more it would have been delayed, the less it would have worked.' Mr Mitterrand has had sharp reminders in recent weeks of how true this is, as market doubts about the feasibility of Emu have even shaken, though not broken, the parity link between the franc and the D-Mark within the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. But the president grandly dismisses the views of the money-changers. 'Speculation (against the franc) does not exploit doubts, it creates doubts.' The president affirms, with some justice, that 'the French economy is the best in Europe at the moment', and says that 'devaluation is never considered a good policy'. He is open to, though not yet convinced of, the idea of narrowing further the limits within which the franc can fluctuate against the D-Mark. It is 'for discussion', he says. In this area, too, all other considerations are subordinate to Maastricht's economic disciplines. France's persistently high unemployment rate - itself partly a side-effect of the franc fort policy - is 'quite dramatic', the president concedes. But it is a 'social problem', he says, and, by implication, a problem of second order. He points out that joblessness has risen faster in Germany and Britain over the past year than in France. If there are particular doubts about France's strong exchange rate policy and commitment to continuing disinflation, it is because its Socialist government faces the voters in March. But Mr Mitterrand insists that this fact, too, will not stampede it into changing course. 'This government will maintain exactly the same economic attitude which it has had since the start.' No one is better placed than the French president to persuade Bonn of Europe's need for lower German interests. Mr Mitterrand says he raises the issue constantly in his talks with Chancellor Kohl. 'But I respect their policy because I know they have pressing (budgetary) obligations which are very heavy.' Mr Mitterrand's sense of urgency concerning the need for Europe to progress is nowhere more evident than in his new-found openness to new EC members. France used to be very insistent on the Community getting its house in order before admitting new members. Earlier this year, it was still demanding that formal enlargement negotiations with the countries of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) could not begin until Maastricht was universally ratified and future EC financing decided. Mr Mitterrand now blurs these pre-conditions, and has no difficulty in joining Germany and Britain in calling for accelerated talks with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway - but not now Switzerland - to be wrapped up by the end of 1993. The desire of the first three of these countries to marry EC membership with their long-standing neutrality will be the main negotiating issue. 'That (neutrality) is a problem for them, not for us,' says Mr Mitterrand. Neutral countries should not be allowed to thwart the Community's efforts to project a more forceful role in the world, though the president concedes that existing EC states have done just that in the case of the former Yugoslavia. As with Efta, so with the lengthening queue of would-be EC members in eastern Europe. Once a proponent of deepening - as opposed to widening  - the Community, Mr Mitterrand has now come around to a very broad view of Europe potentially encompassing any democratic state on the continent with a sufficiently strong economy. The Balkans and the Baltic states? Russia and the Ukraine? 'Why not?,' he asks. Here, his vision of a future Europe stretches even further than that of Mr Kohl. How could such a diverse membership be accommodated in a Community based on the Maastricht treaty? That is a long term question that Mr Mitterrand is happy to leave to his successors. For the moment, the job in hand is ratifying Maastricht, and Mr Mitterrand insists he is fit for the task.</p>

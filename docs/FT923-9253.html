			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: How decathletes sell shoes - A look at the all-rounders at the start of their ordeal WHEN the decathletes came out to start their two-day ordeal at 9am yesterday, the temperature was already in the 80s and the humidity was nearly 80 per cent. At track level the air was so heavy with moisture it seemed about to liquefy. Dave Johnson, the favourite from the US, might have been better trying the front crawl in the first heat of the decathlon's 100 metres. He finished eighth in 11.16 seconds, nearly 0.5sec behind the winner, Christian Plaziat of France. But then, as one veteran athletics correspondent remarked, Johnson's sprinting is 'chronic'. The time left Johnson 21st equal. The sprinting weakness also hampers Johnson in the second event, the long jump. But his poor first-day scoring was one of the inspirations behind the decision by Reebok, the US sports equipment manufacturer, to build its pre-Olympic advertising round Johnson and his US rival Dan O'Brien. O'Brien starts fast. He would build a big lead on the first day and then, with excitement mounting, Johnson would claw his way back on Day 2, creating, with a little luck, a dramatic show-down in the 1,500m. But O'Brien failed to make the Olympics, so it is up to others to act as hare to Johnson's hound. Yesterday, Robert Zmelik of Czechoslovakia burst from the blocks and into an early lead. He ran the second fastest 100m in 10.78sec and then jumped the furthest: 7.87m. This put him on 1,937 points. The barrel-chested Johnson bulled down the ramp for a jump of 7.33m - a running total of 1,718 points and 13th position. Running is the most natural of athletic disciplines. Everyone knows the technique. The best decathletes generally run between 10 and 20 per cent slower than the Olympic finalists in equivalent events. But as the events become more technical the gap widens. Decathletes jump 20 to 30 per cent less high or long, and their throws are anything up to 40 per cent shorter. While specialist athletes can concentrate on perfecting their technique and developing only the right muscles for their discipline, the decathletes, with 10 disciplines, have to be jacks-of-all-events and develop all muscles. That is why they are such spectacular specimens. Once a sprinter has run 100m he can head for the changing room. The decathlon crowd trudges to the long jump pits and from there to the shot put. At each stop the athletes spread their gaudy array of shoes and clothes under a canvas lean-to. They are trapped for the morning. They can only escape the arena for brief trips to attend to their most basic needs, and they cannot go alone. An official scurries alongside them like a Panama-hatted sheep dog. Between jumps or throws they keep themselves amused in various ways. They exercise. At the long jump some do hand stands, others bunny-jumps, some hop or skip. They ceaselessly change clothes and shoes, clambering in and out of tracksuits, shorts, tights, T-shirts, cycle shorts, spikes and trainers. In the more technical events, most decathletes merit scant comparison with specialists. Aric Long, for example, galloped down the long-jump runway in the prescribed manner - then, with an almost audible grinding of gears, shortened but did not quicken his stride. Somehow he could not produce the explosion of lift that will carry the long-jump gold medallist close to 9m. His best jump of 7.21m was decent by any standard except that of Olympic long jumpers. In the shot everything was going more or less as expected until the Spaniard, Antonio Penalvar, suddenly hurled 16.50m, a throw which would have left him more than 5.20m behind Michael Stulce in last Friday's shot put final but which made all the others seem tentative and imprecise. Johnson was the last to throw in each round. He fouled his first two attempts, and as the shot dragged into the afternoon any watchers from Reebok must have felt an awful chill of deja vu when Johnson was called for a foul on his third and last throw. He argued, the judges argued. Finally the referee ruled that Johnson should throw again. Grabbing the life-line, he threw a personal best of 15.28m. After five events, the German Paul Meier led with 4,510 points, 75 ahead of Zmelik. Penalvar on 4,357 was third, with Johnson ninth on 4,154. This evening, Johnson is capable of picking up 300 points on his main rivals in the javelin, the ninth event. The eighth, the pole vault, can also bring huge point swings. 'Everything went well, but not extremely well,' said Johnson. 'I'd say I've had an average first day.' His problem now is that a lot of his opponents had better than average first days.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] France says the controls imposed by the Serbs on the  evacuation by helicopter of wounded people from Gorazde are  unacceptable. Paris ordered the crews of French helicopters  involved in these missions to refuse to submit to these  controls. This was stressed by the French Foreign Ministry  yesterday evening. These Serb controls are reported to have  quadrupled travelling times for the evacuations.</p>

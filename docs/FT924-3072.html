			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (15): Decade of achievement NEXT year Dino Abbrescia will celebrate 10 years at Monte Titoli, Italy's centralised securities custody organisation. He joined soon after operations began, and has enjoyed a busy decade, helping Monte Titoli settle down into a smooth routine. Mr Abbrescia, a 57 year-old Milanese, had filled a knapsack full of experience in securities trading and treasury operations at Monte dei Paschi di Siena and the Istituto Centrale Banche e Banchieri before taking up the challenge at Monte Titoli, where he is general manager. 'There were real headaches at the beginning. Serious giuridical (legal) issues had to be resolved and enormous user resistance overcome,' says Mr Abbrescia. 'Eventually, legislation enacted in 1986 settled interpretive differences about Monte Titoli's corporate nature. It is a service operation not a fiduciary company.' While unpicking the knots of Monte Titoli's legal status, Mr Abbrescia was also trying to encourage participation by securities issuers and dealers. 'It needed an exhaustive and exhausting propaganda campaign of seminars, conferences, debates and meetings to convince potential users to switch to this unknown service.' Mr Abbrescia notes that when he started at Monte Titoli only 40 securities issuers used the service. Now there are nearly 300. 'A lot of credit should be given to Fiat and Pirelli who were early, strong supporters,' he says. Equally important in the struggle to win acceptance for Monte Titoli was the Bank of Italy, an institution well-known for its powers of moral persuasion. It firmly encouraged Italy's banks to transfer their securities custody activities to Monte Titoli. 'Fewer than 50 banks were users of Monte Titoli 10 years ago; today there are nearly 200. Their reluctance was understandable. Not only were our services unknown, but banks also faced the need to review their internal procedures and modify their data processing in order to switch to us,' explains Mr Abbrescia. Concern about costs also played a part in deterring brokers and banks from using Monte Titoli. 'Small brokerage firms particularly were worried that the costs would weigh excessively on their operations, and affect relations with clients. But the charges made by Monte Titoli have been much lower than the costs that users would otherwise have incurred,' claims Mr Abbrescia. Monte Titoli's general manager says that, while all the principal problems of centralised securities custody in Italy have been resolved, new factors will always appear and changes in markets will call for modifications to the service. For some changes, Monte Titoli is already prepared. 'If cash settlement were to be introduced today we could handle it tomorrow.' This raises memories of the mid-1980s, when settlement of Italian securities transactions seemed an unreachable goal for many foreign investors. 'Such complaints are not made today,' says Mr Abbrescia, noting that cross-border transactions are an issue under study. Maintaining regular contact with counterparts abroad, he would quickly be aware if matters were going wrong.</p>

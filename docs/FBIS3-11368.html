			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A serious hope for disentangling the situation  in Haiti has yet to emerge. After the series of congresses and  conferences and the plan of the parliamentarians, political  parties and groups are multiplying proposals aimed at lifting  the country out of deadlock. The following is a report by Wilker  Fecond:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Fecond] While the parliament  is  divided, plans are coming from everywhere. Proposals are being  made to get Haiti out of the difficult deadlock it is  experiencing today. Reactions continue to come from political  parties and people's organizations, each perceiving the  situation differently.    Reynold Georges, leader of Alliance for the Liberation and  Progress of Haiti [ALAH], has reacted against the statement of  the National Coalition [CN]. We remind you that the CN asked the  Army to assume power so as to end the suffering and misery of  the people. This statement has greatly shaken ALAH because it  maintains its stance asking for the resignation of the head of  the Army, which it considers the only way to resolve the crisis.  [passage omitted]    In the same vein, Saint-Martin People's Movement [Mouvman  Popile Senmaten, MPSM] says in a statement to Signal FM that the  country's problem is not the matter of a plan, but rather is  compliance with what was contained in the Governors Island  agreement to facilitate the return of President Aristide to  power. [passage omitted]    For its part, the Association of Young Haitian People's  Power  [Asosyasyon Jen Pouvwa Popile Ayisyen, AJEPOPOA] takes another  stand, asking both President Aristide and General Cedras to step  down. At the same time, the coordinator of this organization,  Jude L. Jean-Jacques, has asked the Army to give the people a  little leeway to go into the streets to demonstrate their  discontent with all that is happening in the country.    [Jean-Jacques] Without doing anything wrong, in order and  discipline, without disorder or looting, we will go into the  streets as early as next week carrying our placards of demands  to say no to Gen. Cedras, no to Father Aristide, yes to  democracy, yes to a national solution, and yes to a responsible  power working in the interests of the Haitian people.    [Fecond] This is how the situation is and many observers are  wondering how long it will take Haiti to find a way to peace and  reconciliation [and out of] the critical situation it is  experiencing today.

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Fund urged for closing reactors An independently managed fund, paid for by the nuclear power industry, should be set up to meet the cost of scrapping reactors, says a report published today by a government-commissioned advisory committee, Bronwen Maddox writes. Taxpayers may still have to pay up to Pounds 2.9bn to enable Britain's ageing Magnox reactors to be taken out of service, the 100-page report, by the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, says. The study was commissioned by the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, which advises it on the methods and costs of dealing with civil nuclear waste. The high and unpredictable costs of decommissioning nuclear sites have been one of the nuclear industry's greatest headaches. The uncertainty was the main reason for the withdrawal of the nuclear industry from the 1989 electricity privatisation. The National Audit Office has estimated that future decommissioning could eventually cost Pounds 18bn and that the taxpayer might have to foot the bill as well as the nuclear industry. The research unit report says that annual provisions of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 5m for new plants could be sufficient to pay for their eventual decommissioning. It points out that this is a small proportion of the income of Pounds 200m a year which a typical plant generating 1100MW might earn. Accurate estimates, however, are hard to make until 'real progress is made' towards the construction of a store for nuclear waste. The fund would not solve the problem of decommissioning the Magnox reactors, the report says. 'Over a decade's worth of provisions were effectively 'lost' at privatisation of the electricity industry and expected decommissioning costs have risen rapidly in real terms over the last decade.' In a separate report the advisory committee says: 'Government could be the guardian of the fund but public confidence might be enhanced if the fund was truly independent and retained for the sole purpose of decommissioning plant.'

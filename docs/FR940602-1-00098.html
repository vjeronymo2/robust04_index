			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In cases where physical space to house the documents is limited, a potential solution for the facility, where resources allow and capability is available at the location, is to copy documents onto microfiche or CD&hyph;ROM. Either of these possible options requires little space and would discourage document theft or vandalism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;124.33(d), the Director will specify requirements that the applicant must satisfy in informing the public of the existence of the information repository. At a minimum, the Director will require the facility owner/operator to notify individuals on the mailing list when the facility establishes the repository. The Director may also require the facility to provide public notice in a local newspaper. As a practical matter, the facility may, in some cases, choose to provide the relevant information to the permitting authority so that it may include the information in other required notices. The facility owner/operator would identify the EPA or State office contact and a facility contact person to answer questions related to the repository. EPA suggests that the permitting authority designate a community affairs specialist as the appropriate contact person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information repository EPA is proposing today closely resembles the repository proposed under Subpart S of the Corrective Action Rule (see 30798 FR, July 27, 1990) and is similar to the repositories established at Superfund sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). EPA's CERCLA experience has demonstrated that the public's interest in nearby hazardous waste activities is served effectively by a repository. Without a local repository, the burden falls on citizens to locate and contact the appropriate officials who are knowledgeable about the site in Regional EPA or State offices, which could be located far from the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are three major differences between the information repositories in today's proposal and the repositories included in the CERCLA program. First, Superfund requires information repositories at all sites on the National Priorities List (NPL), whereas, under today's proposal, the Director would use his or her discretion on a case-by-case basis. All communities may not desire or request every option available for public involvement. In most situations, an information repository may not be necessary and could become an unnecessary resource drain for the local community hosting the repository. Providing discretion to the Director will allow the facility and community to use their resources in the most efficient manner. In making such a determination, the Director would consider the degree of public interest (which could, for example, be demonstrated through written requests from the public to set up a repository), as well as the proposed location of the facility, the proposed types and volumes of wastes to be managed, and the type of facility. Furthermore, the Director may consider requiring information repositories at certain Class 3 modifications or at other stages within a permit where there is a high level of public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second major difference between the CERCLA and proposed RCRA repositories is that CERCLA repositories for NPL sites generally house the administrative record for CERCLA actions. Under the RCRA permitting program, and as described in proposed Subpart S, EPA Regional offices, or authorized States, maintain administrative records, which provide documentation of the basis of EPA's decisions and other parts of the record, at Regional office location. Because the RCRA permitting record is already available for public inspection at a separate location, the Agency does not believe that it is necessary to duplicate the entire administrative record for RCRA facilities at information repositories. The administrative record developed during the permitting process is often large, and could become burdensome to the Agency and the facility if it were duplicated in its entirety in an information repository. In addition, the space required to house an information repository, if it were required to be a duplicate of the administrative record, may severely limit prospective repository locations in a community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third major difference between the CERCLA and proposed RCRA provisions relates to the point in the waste management process when an information repository is established and maintained. Information repositories are established at NPL sites to give the public the opportunity to keep informed during the cleanup process. On the other hand, the repository proposed for certain RCRA facilities could be established by the facility at any time during the RCRA permitting process or during the life of the facility. In either case, the facility will set up the information repository to provide information to the community about the specific issues at hand. Therefore, the Director may require the facility to operate the information repository during the permit application process only or the active life of a facility, whichever best applies to the facility and the community. For new facilities, this provision means that the Director might instruct the facility to establish an information repository before construction of the facility. EPA is concerned that the information repository for a RCRA facility could become cumbersome if the Agency prescribes specific content and duration requirements in a regulation. Therefore, EPA believes that the Director should designate timeframes and details for the contents of the information repository on a case-by-case basis, in keeping with the goal of enhancing public participation in the permitting process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency chose what it believes to be the most flexible approach, that is, one that allows permitting authorities to readily respond to community demands. However, the Agency recognizes that questions may exist regarding this approach and requests comment on several aspects of the information repository. First, the Agency seeks comments on making the information repository an optional, as opposed to mandatory, tool within the permitting process. Second, EPA solicits comments on making the repository mandatory for some types of units; for example, the Agency could require all commercial facilities or facilities managing certain types of waste to establish information repositories. Third, EPA requests comments on the location of the repository and the point in the permitting process when it might be appropriate for the Director to require certain facilities to establish or terminate a repository. Fourth, the Agency seeks comments on what documents the facility should include within the repository as a minimum, and the process by which those documents are selected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Permit Modification Procedures in &sect;270.42 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The main purpose of this section of the rule is to clarify the combustion modification provisions found in Appendix I of &sect;270.42. EPA is aware that there has been some confusion over the description of modifications listed under section L.7 of Appendix I, which covers the shakedown and trial burn phases of operation for combustion units. Through today's changes, EPA intends to make these modification classifications easier to understand and implement. Today's proposal clarifies and describes the phases of shakedown and trial burn in more detail, thus, making it easier for the facility to distinguish between modification classifications. By making it easier for a facility to select the appropriate classification for each modification activity, the proposed rule will make compliance with the modification process easier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

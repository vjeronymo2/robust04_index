			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, </F> Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku 16 May TASS -- Azeri President Geydar Aliyev  met with Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group Yan Eliasson on Monday  [16 May]. During the meeting Aliyev said that the Azeri side  comes out for the solution of the Karabakh conflict by means of  international organisations and welcomes the presence of  international forces.    Aliyev pointed out that "once Baku realised the importance  of  reconciliation, one can say that we have approached a final  solution of this problem." Aliyev pointed out the importance of  the realisation of the closeness of positions on concrete  matters which recently appeared, taking into account the  complexity of the situation for each side concerned.    The Azeri president expressed satisfaction at close  interaction between Russia and the CSCE.    For his part, Eliasson said that they are as close to the  settlement of the Azeri-Armenian conflict as never before. It  is important not to miss the chance, he said.    In his opinion, there are a number of factors offering a  real  chance for the settlement of the conflict: There is a good  alliance of leaders capable of taking bold decisions; CSCE  streamlines cooperation with Russia in the negotiating process,  in particular, as far as the deployment of observers in the zone  of the conflict is concerned; the activities of the Minsk Group  are supported by CSCE countries.    Eliasson believes it is important to strengthen the regime  of  the ceasefire by means of a mechanism of monitoring with the  CSCE participation, to work out joint measures for the  comprehensive implementation of given tasks. All this was  reflected in the document worked out by the Minsk Group, which  was submitted to the Azeri and Armenian sides, taking into  account Azerbaijan's proposals.</p>

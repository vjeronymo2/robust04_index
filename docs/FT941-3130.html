			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Broadcastle Broadcastle, the USM-quoted financial services group, nearly doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 276,000 to Pounds 507,000 in 1993. The improvement was because of a fall in interest payable to Pounds 781,000 (Pounds 1.08m), lower administrative expenses of Pounds 787,000 (Pounds 1.03m) and a reduction in the provision for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 383,000 (Pounds 436,000). Net income amounted to Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.76m). Earnings per share rose from 1.17p to 2.2p and the group, which returned to the dividend list at the interim stage, is proposing a final of 0.75p for a 1p total.</p>

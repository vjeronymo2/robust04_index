			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) held a second official  working-level contact Monday [10 January] but failed to make any  progress on arranging IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear  facilities.    Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at the North Korean Embassy in  Vienna, represented his country at the two-hour talks, in which  the IAEA explained technical details of the need to maintain  continuity in surveillance materials in response to the North  Korean position conveyed at the first meeting Friday [7 January].    The IAEA presented its explanation and demands to the North  Korean side on paper.    ``The North Korean representative and the IAEA had a  working-level contact to discuss problems of inspection on North  Korea's reported nuclear facilities on Monday,'' IAEA Spokesman  Hans Meyer said.    ``At the meeting, the IAEA has conveyed technical  requirements (for the inspection) to the North Korean side.''    Meyer declined to disclose further information.    One IAEA source said, however, the IAEA action means that  there are differences of opinion on the scope of the inspection  on North Korea's seven reported nuclear facilities.    Practical problems such as dispatch of the inspection team  could be discussed only after the two sides agree on the scope  of the inspection, the source said, requesting anonymity.    At Friday's meeting, North Korea told the IAEA that it would  not accept inspection of two sites, a radiochemical laboratory  that is in effect a nuclear reprocessing facility and a  5-megawatt reactor, another IAEA source said.    As a result, the two sides are standing far apart as the  IAEA  demands opening of those two facilities as well, the source said.    Spokesman David Kyd, meanwhile, said that the IAEA does not  expect immediate progress in the problem of inspection on two  unreported sites believed to be nuclear waste storage facilities.    The two sides are expected to resume their talks this week.</p>

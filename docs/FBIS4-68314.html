			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Ostroumov, deputy director of the Russian </F> Space Agency: "...Not Assistants, But Partners"]    [Text] We're fighting for survival. This year, despite all  the ukases and decrees signed, we've received only one percent  of the money promised from the budget. Had we not found  additional financing from abroad, we would have ceased our  operations long ago. That is why the draft of the agreement is,  in fact, beneficial to us. Yes, the amount of money allocated to  us by NASA seems insignificant. But that's all the American  space agency could afford from its budget. And yet, that's  certainly not the only source for attracting hard currency. All  the rest of the revenues will be decided on at the level of the  manufacturers themselves. That means direct ties and agreements  between, say, the Boeing firm and NPO Energiya, or between  Rockwell and the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau. Each individual  assembly, rescue craft, spacesuit, and so forth -- for all that  there are tenders, income, contracts. With that, we agreed from  the very beginning that the price of an item would be based on  the value of a norm-hour of work of the engineer and the  manufacturer in American terms. And there are already three such  contracts.    Yes, we are conducting negotiations that are not very  simple.  The complexity of our position stems from the fact that we  entered that stage when the initial draft of the agreement was  already worked out.    What is fundamental is the station's name itself. We are  insisting that the station have international status. The  Americans prefer to call it an American station, with  participation by foreign partners. We haven't forgotten for a  minute that the most crucial work has fallen our way -- the  creation of a space infrastructure. That represents a solid  contribution in terms of power engineering, life-support-system  work, and the organization of freight flow. All that, based on  the totals for each period of operation of the station, should  be assessed by a joint council. And each contribution is  evaluated in money terms, and the jointly acquired information  divided up on the basis of that.    Moreover, we will work to see to it that Russia gets the  right not only to work independently on its autonomous module,  but also to use all the station's equipment for its work. We  have signed an intellectual property agreement that stipulates  that information acquired jointly also belongs to all the  countries that have taken part in acquiring it.    And the fears of the loss of the Flight Control Center and  the Cosmonaut Training Center are unfounded. As we know, not  only have Russian cosmonauts gone through training in the United  States, but vice-versa. And it would also be impossible to close  the Flight Control Center: it's a huge science center that's  linked to more than just a station.    The alternative of creating a station with ESA is also  unrealistic. The Europeans, no less than the Americans, operate  on the principle of "money up front." Russia can't enter ESA,  because we don't have the money for the entry share.    The orbit chosen for the station is based on the technical  capabilities of the shuttles, but that doesn't mean that the  United States is in a more advantageous position than we are,  because they prefer to perform studies of the ground with  satellites.    It's my hope that the agreement draft under discussion,  after  being signed by the President of Russia, will attach particular  significance to the fulfillment of the obligations made in  connection with it.</p>

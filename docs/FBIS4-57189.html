			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Juan Molinar Horcasitas, researcher at </F> National Autonomous University of Mexico's Social Research  Institute: "A Hard Test"]    [Text] The criminal charges that the National Action Party  (PAN) has filed against Professor Carlos Hank Gonzalez represent  a tough test for the government as the elections approach. If  the government succeeds in passing it rather handily, it will be  very instrumental in creating the appropriate conditions so that  the 1994 elections do not wind up surrounded by suspicion and  recrimination. But if the government fails this exam, it will do  severe damage to the elections and cast a dark shadow over their  integrity and impartiality. PAN's charge is that Carlos Hank  Gonzalez and his private secretary violated Article 407 of the  Federal Penal Code. This article prohibits public servants from  using whatever funds, assets, or services they have at their  disposal to support a political party or candidate.    According to the official PAN charge, which carries on  through legal channels what the national press began in the  media, Carlos Hank used resources from his secretariat to place  a full-page insert in all national newspapers in support of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] presidential candidate.  The evidence that PAN has submitted to back up its charge  apparently includes copies of documents that were issued by the  office of Mr. Hank's private secretary and that mention  conversations which the agriculture secretary had with several  well-known figures to drum up support for the PRI candidate. I  have no way of knowing whether these documents constitute  sufficient evidence to bring the accused before a criminal  court, but what is clear is that broad segments of public  opinion have enough evidence to believe that Mr. Hank is indeed  guilty of the charge.    Naturally I do not claim that what counts in the press will  also count before the public prosecutor, much less before a  judge. But I do not find it acceptable either that the Attorney  General's Office should dispense with the matter by simply  shelving it, inasmuch as there are sound legal and political  reasons why this matter ought to be treated seriously.    Legally speaking, the Attorney General's Office ought to  take  up the matter and rule whether there are sufficient grounds to  bring criminal action against the accused individuals or against  whoever may turn out to be responsible. In that case, the  consequences would not be at all minor, because the law  describes the crime quite clearly and provides for a fine of  between "200 and 400 days pay and one to nine years in prison."    This harsh law puts all of the people involved to a severe  test. I am sure that Carlos Hank is not at all afraid of the  fine, but I do think that the prospect of a year in jail bothers  him. And in this instance the judge cannot opt for the easy way  out because the law says that the penalty consists of a fine and  jail time. To make things worse, the final section of Article  407 of the Penal Code itself says that "release on bail shall  not apply in the case of this crime."    The political pressure will be mostly on Attorney General  Diego Valades, of course, but it could extend to electoral  authorities as well, especially the Federal Electoral Institute  (IFE), because although it does not have specific authority to  conduct the corresponding criminal investigation, it does have a  political and legal interest in the case. Article 82 (Section  "v") of the current election law says that the General Council  of the IFE has the power "to ask the General Executive Board to  investigate, with the means at its disposal, incidents that  significantly affect the rights of political parties or the  electoral process." The case at hand obviously affects the  electoral process because a high-level official of the federal  government has been implicated in the commission of an electoral  crime. As a result of this law, we can expect a loud debate on  the matter during the next session of the General Council of the  IFE; this could well be the last session of the current council  or it could mark the debut of the new one, which has already  been constituted by its new members, who will apparently take  charge of the final stages of the electoral process.    Moreover, the crime of which Carlos Hank is accused also  affects the delicate political negotiations that have been  taking place over the past few months. If the authorities do not  offer a convincing response to the charges that have been filed  and if they do not proceed fairly, they will be proving right  those who accuse the government of being unwilling to organize a  clean election.    The opposition's reaction is understandable, since the crime  involved is not a minor one. The offense does not consist of the  improper use of a few faxes or of a few hours of the highly  valuable time of senior officials and civil servants to whom  taxpayers pay splendid salaries. The offense does not even  consist of the huge cost of inserting the document of support in  the press, if it was in fact paid for with public funds.    The offense, if it is proved to exist, would consist of the  violation of a criminal law by a senior government official. It  would also consist of a flagrant violation of the government's  repeated promises to hold clean elections. In this regard, it  jeopardizes the country's political stability. So then, it is an  offense against the opposition parties in particular and against  society in general, especially at a time like this when a failed  election would be a disaster of enormous consequences for the  country.    It would be even worse if these already severe offenses were  compounded by impunity. The potential political advantage of  appeasing a justifiably annoyed opposition should not prompt us  to convict the defendants before a serious investigation and, if  appropriate, a fair trial. It is very wrong to use scapegoats.  Likewise, however, we must not acquit the defendants without  conducting the investigation that justice demands and without  proceeding to the appropriate trial, inasmuch as the privileges  of powerful, untouchable officials and authoritarian impunity  are also very wrong. Therefore, the attorney general must take  legal action in response to a serious charge. Therefore, Carlos  Hank Gonzalez and his private secretary must answer this serious  charge legally and politically.</p>

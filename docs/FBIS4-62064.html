			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 10 May at a meeting of the Interregional  Deputies Group (MDF-Tsentr), more than 20 of its members agreed  on a joint position with regard to presidential and local  elections on 26 June. "We are convinced that the presidential  elections must be held without fail within the time limit  specified by the law, stressed people's deputy and co-chairman  of MBR [interregional bloc of reforms] Volodymyr Hrynyov. The  president's arguments on the political situation concerning the  elections today do not stand up to criticism and the attempt to  postpone the elections with the help of the newly elected  Supreme Council, and by doing so to place all the responsibility  for this step on it is, in my opinion, destined to fail."  Leonid Kuchma, co-chairman of the MBR and people's deputy  stressed that groups of the MBR-Tsentr and other centrist forces  in the parliament will come up against strong pressure on the  part of the "party of power" to postpone the elections, but the  position of the MBR-Tsentr should be firm. "I am convinced,  said Kuchma, that every day the presidential elections are  postponed will be destructively reflected not only on the  economic infrastructure but will also lead to the impoverishment  of the wider strata of the population.    Members of the MBR-Tsentr group had different views on the  local elections. While not rejecting a renewal of the power  structures in the localities as a whole, they however, expressed  concern with the fact the election in 25 oblasts of "little  presidents" could seriously destabilize the executive vertical  of power. The group will define its definitive position on the  election to local bodies of self-government in the course of  consultations and meetings.</p>

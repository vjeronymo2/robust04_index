			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> PHILHARMONIC INSTITUTE ORCHESTRA OPENS SEASON  </P> <P> They've done it again. As in previous years, the pool of young instrumental  talent gathered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute has quickly coalesced  into a remarkably fine-sounding orchestra.  </P> <P> On the evidence of its first concert, Sunday evening in friendly, flattering  Royce Hall, the 1990 edition of the Institute Orchestra has all the eager  energy of its predecessors, plus an already developed idiosyncratic sonic  sheen.  </P> <P> As conducted by Heiichiro Ohyama, the big piece for the orchestra -- Brahms'  First Symphony -- proved big indeed. Powerful, highly contrasted and almost  exaggeratedly outsize, Ohyama's Brahms exerted a strong, often ponderous  presence. Within the context of this monumental approach, fussy detailing and  tempo fluctuations sometimes sapped momentum, but in cumulative impact seemed  Mahlerian, both for better and for worse.  </P> <P> The players met Brahms' -- and Ohyama's -- demands honorably. Their sound was  never strident, and generally evenly balanced, although the strings could be  easily submerged in the climaxes. There were moments of unsettled intonation in  the woodwinds, and Ohyama's finicky tailoring could challenge brass  articulation, but the overwhelming impression was one of controlled ardor.  </P> <P> Equal poise and greater ensemble refinement were apparent in the orchestra's  efforts on Elgar's Cello Concerto. Led by Stefan Sanderling, son of frequent  Philharmonic guest Kurt Sanderling, the accompaniment proved worthy of the  soloist.  </P> <P> Which was no small achievement. Lynn Harrell, artistic director of the  institute, may well be the most eloquent and expressive of instrumentalists in  music of haunted and sublime lyricism. He brought an operatic concern for  nuance of phrase and timbral variety to the concerto, effortlessly delivering  the full measure of bravura while wringing all the yearning pathos from it.  </P> <P> The evening began with a shimmering account of Mendelssohn's "Ruy Blas"  Overture, deftly delineated by institute fellow Lan Shui, although at speeds  that left some of the winds inarticulate.

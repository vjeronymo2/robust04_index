It discussed the UN  Security Council resolution passed at dawn today on the massacre  in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque.    During the session, Dr. al-Majali submitted a report on the  contacts His Majesty King Husayn had with his brothers, the Arab  leaders, to stress the need for the UN Security Council  resolution to contain a clear stipulation on Jerusalem. This is  because omitting the paragraph on Jerusalem, as some pressures  sought, would have negatively affected the position and status  of the holy city.    Following the session, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of  state  and information minister, answered questions posed by reporters.  He said:    [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] The government, represented  by the Council of Ministers, today studied the Security Council  resolution passed yesterday in the wake of the bloody massacre  which occurred in Hebron in Ramadan, corresponding to 25  February, this year.    The government found out that this resolution contained  positive points, the most important of which are, first,  condemning the massacre; second, providing protection and  security to the Palestinian people; and third, focusing on the  need to protect citizens in accordance with the Fourth Geneva  Convention, issued in 1949, including occupied Jerusalem. The  resolution also contained a call for resuming the peace  negotiations and stressed the need to continue this process and  immediately implement the Gaza-Jericho First agreement without  delay.    These are the main points which the Council of Ministers  studied. Moreover, his excellency the prime minister submitted  to the Council of Ministers a report on the contacts His Majesty  King Husayn had with his brothers, the Arab leaders, to stress  the need for this resolution to contain a clear provision on  Jerusalem. This is because omitting this sentence from the  resolution, in compliance with some pressures in this direction,  would have negatively affected the status of this holy city  which occupies a prominent position among the Arabs and Muslims.    Therefore, and following a lengthy discussion of this point,  the Council of Ministers agreed that the resolution, in general,  contains positive points that deserve appreciation.    [Unidentified reporter] Your Excellency the Minister: In  light of the vote on the Jerusalem issue, how do you view the  need for Jordanian and Arab moves on this issue?    [Al-'Anani] It is very clear that the declared Israeli  position on Jerusalem and maintaining that Jerusalem will remain  Israel's unified capital, according to some statements made by  Israeli officials, is something which we reject in part and  parcel. We also regard Jerusalem as an occupied city that has a  sacred status which no party, such as Israel, should undermine,  or should threaten through any challenge, occupation, or  acceptance of the status quo. In our assessment, therefore, the  U.S. position was taken because the United States had either to  reject and veto the resolution or abstain. The Americans  preferred to abstain.    However, from now on, we should work together to confront  the  Israeli schemes in Jerusalem, especially since there are some  reports which say that evacuating the settlements in the places  from which the Israeli Army may withdraw could entail the  transfer of some settlers to Jerusalem. Hence, action is  greatly desired on all levels, as are contacts with various  bodies and states. The Jordanian Government supports, backs,  and is ready to make, every required effort to explain  Jerusalem's status and importance and the fact that Jerusalem is  an occupied land.    [Reporter] Your Excellency: Do you view the Security  Council resolution as sufficient to resume Arab-Israeli  negotiations?    [Al-'Anani] Yes, I believe that the resolution is sufficient  to resume Arab-Israeli negotiations. Such a decision, however,  should be made as a result of Arab agreement and coordination  because the decision to halt or freeze the negotiations  immediately after the terrible Hebron massacre was made through  an Arab decision of this kind. [end recording]    The Council of Ministers also listened to a report by Talal  Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, on His  Highness Crown Prince Hasan's visit to Croatia and Bosnia-  Herzegovina. He stressed that the visit was very successful and  that Jordan seeks a just and comprehensive peace in that region.  Jordan also supports the agreement reached by the Bosnian  Muslims and Croats to establish a federation, which the Serbs  may join, in order to safeguard the aspired peace in that  region, al-Hasan added.    In his report, the minister of state for foreign affairs  stressed that His Highness Crown Prince Hasan found during his  meetings with the leaders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and  UN officials appreciation for Jordan's role and humanitarian  aid, and also for the effective and fine contribution by the  Jordanian Armed Forces as part of the UN troops.</p>

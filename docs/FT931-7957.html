			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Management: A rollercoaster out of control - Christina Lamb describes the ups and downs of doing business amid skyrocketing prices in Brazil So persistently high is Brazilian inflation, that the Central Bank has run out of famous Brazilians to put on its banknotes and resorted to Amazonian fish (there are more than 2,000 varieties). A good lunch costs more than Cr1m (Pounds 39), shops have to ring up large items in parts to fit on the tills and calculators can only be used by dropping three zeroes, despite two changes of currency in the last five years. This is irritating enough for the average person who has lost all sense of what something should cost and must spend hours each day calculating how best to protect his or her money, consulting the 13 indexes for monetary correction published daily for everything from tax bills to savings accounts. Imagine running a business in such a climate. Luis Junqueira, financial director of Alpargatas, Brazil's leading footwear and garment company, describes keeping up with inflation which has been above 20 per cent a month for the last 15 months and in four figures for five of the last six years, as: 'Feeling like the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, always late.' He adds: 'I have all the textbooks on financial management but may as well throw them down the drain for all the use they are here.' With inflation at 1.25 per cent a day and interest rates considerably higher, a company can be made or broken on its cash management and it is crucial to keep a constant track of money and have a strong credit control department. Milton de Carvalho Cabral, financial director of Souza Cruz, the Brazilian subsidiary of BAT Industries, says: 'Our main challenge is to ensure that money earned from sales all round the country reaches headquarters in Rio as rapidly as possible in order to invest it. An hour lost can be an opportunity gone.' Terms of payment become an important factor. Cabral attributes the financial health of Souza Cruz to the fact that it gives stockists only three to five days to pay. The aim is to have a long lead time in paying suppliers, but fast collection of receivables. Thus retailers often sell products for less than they pay suppliers. If they can sell within 15 days but have 30 days to pay, the cash can be invested for 15 days in the moneymarkets where the real profit is to be made. As a result, financial divisions tend to carry far more importance than the production or marketing departments. Most leading manufacturers estimate their financial department is at least 40 per cent larger than would be necessary in a low inflationary climate. Autolatina, the holding company for Ford and Volkswagen, has a larger financial department than Ford Europe. Inflation is nothing new in Brazil - it has been more than 400 per cent a year since 1987 - and companies have developed many mechanisms to survive and prosper. In many cases the core activity has become simply a means of generating cash for financial operations on which the real profits are made. Eduardo Giannetti da Fonseca, an economist from Sao Paulo University, explains: 'Inflation breaks the connection between what you sow and what you reap. It's a school of opportunism where what matters is financial wizardry rather than supply and demand.' Rather than putting money into the company, cash goes into financial operations. This has had negative repercussions on areas such as marketing, quality, productivity and product development, which could be devastating once Brazil opens up wider to foreign trade. William Cosgrove, the financial director of Autolatina, complains: 'Everyone's working on the constant battle to recover last month's inflation rather than concentrating on competing with Korea.' The effects permeate throughout the company. Jeffrey Brantly, finance director of the Monteiro Aranha group, says: 'Everyone becomes a financial person. The marketing person cannot simply sell a product - he must obtain the best terms of payment. The production guy cannot just install a new machine to increase efficiency but must study whether it is better to buy now, later or spread over several payments.' The greatest loser is the consumer. Emerson Kapaz, owner of a toy company, says: 'There's this constant race against time so when costs go up 30 per cent prices are automatically adjusted by at least that, thus feeding inflation. It's like a fever.' A study by consultants KPMG found that 81.6 per cent of companies listed government measures and inflationary expectations as the most important factors in pricing. Production costs were way down the list. Moreover, periodic government price freezes (five in the last six years) mean companies fear being caught with prices too low. The longest price validity is 30 days, and companies such as ICI and Autolatina have full-scale price negotiations with unions and suppliers at least monthly - an activity that would occur perhaps annually in other countries. This is a particular nightmare for the retail sector. Carlos Rocca, president of the leading department store group Mappins, points out the store sells 80,000 different items and must negotiate with 6,000 suppliers on a case-by-case basis. High inflation also militates against companies retaining stocks because of rapid depreciation. The retail sector is a constant battle between wanting a rapid turnover and wanting to keep prices up, without losing out to competitors. Winners of this situation are oligopolies and cartels given the continuing high import tariffs enabling them to price arbitrarily. According to Fipe, one of the inflation monitoring agencies, oligopolies were responsible for 45 per cent of last year's 1,149 per cent inflation. The instability generated by a highly inflationary economy means information is at a premium, whether on likely government policy, inflationary trends or the best financial instruments of the moment. There are 13 leading agencies monitoring inflation and former economy ministers make fortunes running consultancies. The hardest situation is for those running subsidiaries of multinationals, having to calculate in trillions and explain to the parent company the confusing Brazilian accounting system where inflation and monetary correction are often divergent and the impossibility of planning more than three months ahead. But high inflation also presents an opportunity, particularly with real interest rates often topping 5 per cent a month. Though reluctant to admit it, some companies generate 80 per cent of their profits from financial gains. There are many businessmen in Brazil who would be sorry to see high inflation end. Eugenio Staub, president of electronics company Gradiente, says: 'Brazil offers the best financial profits in the world,' though adding that his company always focuses on the core business. Most large Brazilian companies have turned into banks with large operating tables where dealers are in electronic contact with the money markets. Autolatina is involved in a network of consortia, providing financing to dealers through capitalisation funds to which both manufacturer and dealer contribute. Particular beneficiaries are those who, through export credits, can raise money overseas at low rates to invest locally. Last year Certificates of Deposit offered a 27 per cent return over international rates. The financial sector is an obvious winner and makes up 15 per cent of GDP - far more than in most countries. With everything from school fees to gas bills payable through banks, holding the float for a few days can be highly profitable. According to the economy ministry there is Dollars 110bn invested in short-term instruments. So sophisticated is the Brazilian banking system that account holders can invest the money for a day at a time and cheques are cleared within one day. While Brazilian bankers cheerfully admit inflation is good for business, manufacturers say financial operations simply preserve the value of profits and mask the hidden costs of inflation, not least the erosion of consumer spending power which over the last three years has dropped 10 per cent. Cosgrove says: 'So-called financial profits are accounting gains which do not show the long-term costs. No capital-intensive business likes this climate. We need a three- to five-year lead time but here we can't even forecast six months.' There are compensations. Many directors of multinationals in Brazil have returned to their parent companies in top positions and some such as Citibank are sending their high-fliers to Brazil on the basis: 'If you can survive here you can survive anywhere,' says Kapaz.</p>

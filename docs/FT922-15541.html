			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Pretoria agrees to continue VAT exemption on basic foods: Du Plessis bows to business and church pressure The South African government yesterday agreed to continue exempting certain basic foodstuffs from value added tax, giving in to pressure from trade unions, business and church groupings. When VAT was introduced last September, at a rate of 10 per cent, nine food items were exempted for a six month period, which ended last night. The introduction of the tax was accompanied by a general strike opposing the method in which it was introduced, and further mass action had been promised if the exemptions were lifted. Mr Barend du Plessis, finance minister, who made yesterday's announcement, continues to stress that exemptions mitigate against maximum efficiency of the tax, which requires the broadest possible base. Business and church leaders argued that the exemption should continue given the current high unemployment and recession. Mr du Plessis might not otherwise have heeded the similar protests by Cosatu, the dominant union grouping, with whose leadership there exists a well established antipathy. The temporary zero rating on milk and rice will be lifted as planned. But it will stay in place for the time being for samp, mealie (maize) rice, dried whole mealies, dried beans, soya beans, lentils, tinned pilchards, milk powder and dairy powder mixture. Brown bread and mealie meal were granted a long-term zero rating from the outset. Mr du Plessis pointed out that the exemption of mealie meal and brown bread cost the state R1bn (Pounds 200m) a year. Maintaining the exemption on the other foodstuffs will cost the state R136m this year, but it will receive R244m from the tax on rice and milk. The government's case for not zero rating foods initially rested on the fact that it planned to offer nutritional assistance schemes to the most needy. Last year R220m was voted in the budget towards this cause with a further R440m provided for in the 1992-93 budget tabled last month. However, only half the R220m was spent in the last financial year, much of it on setting up delivery structures.</p>

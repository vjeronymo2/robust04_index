			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Thyssen steps in to save Three Graces for Britain An eleventh-hour intervention by Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Dutch-born industrialist and art collector, has saved the Three Graces sculpture for Britain. Speaking from his summer house on the Spanish coast, the 73-year-old baron pledged the final Pounds 800,000 needed to save Antonio Canova's marble sculpture of Jove's daughters from export to the Getty Museum in Malibu. 'I thought it was idiotic to let this thing go to California for a little amount of money so I decided to help,' the baron said. 'It's an important neoclassical piece and it would be a big shame for all of Europe if it was lost to America.' Mr Tim Clifford, director of the National Gallery of Scotland, which will share the sculpture with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, described the offer as 'wonderfully generous'. It will conclude a saga that stretches back to the early 1980s when the Marquess of Tavistock first put the Three Graces - originally commissioned for Woburn Abbey in 1815 - up for sale. The Getty Museum subsequently bought it for Pounds 7.6m, but successive arts and heritage ministers have delayed the granting of an export licence in the hope that UK museums and galleries could match the sum. Mr John Walsh, director of the California museum, said last night that, regardless of the new developments, he planned to press ahead with legal action against the British government over the delays. Three weeks ago Mr John Paul Getty II, the reclusive anglophile billionaire, made a surprise donation of Pounds 1m to the fund to keep the sculpture in the UK and, in effect, out of his late father's museum. Mr Clifford was forced to apologise publicly after stating that Mr Getty Jr's offer had been prompted by a grudge against his father. The campaigners had until November 5 to raise the remaining money before an export licence was due to be granted to the Getty Museum. 'The deadline was looming,' Mr Clifford said. 'We were going to have to raise Pounds 100,000 a week. I didn't think we were going to make it.' After the embarrassment of his apology, the Thyssen-Bornemisza donation represents a vindication for Mr Clifford, who will be announcing full details of the offer today. It is unlikely that he will choose this occasion to speculate about the baron's relationship with his father. Patience, passion and the baron, Weekend XVII</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AUTO AEROBICS;  </P> <P> GYM MEMBERS DON'T WANT EXERCISE IN THE PARKING LOTS  </P> <P> Cesar Galvez gets an eight-hour workout at his gym without lifting a barbell or  setting foot on a treadmill.  </P> <P> He gets his exercise at a West Los Angeles physical fitness center by doing the  running for others who have come to use the health spa's exercise machines.  </P> <P> Galvez, 22, sprints up to seven miles a day parking and retrieving cars for  athletic club members so they do not have to walk to or from one of the gym's  parking lots.  </P> <P> The sight of the club members standing around in sweats, gym shorts and  training shoes while the shirt-and-tie clad valets run back and forth for their  cars is amusing to many who travel past the Sepulveda Boulevard workout center.  </P> <P> "I just have to chuckle when I see them," said lawyer Lisa Volpe, a New York  transplant who lives in Reseda and passes the area on her way to visit friends.  "It so silly. It's ludicrous. It's as if walking isn't exercise."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Up to 17 Hours a Day  </P> <P> Twenty valet parking attendants tend an unending line of Porsches and sporty  Mercedes-Benz convertibles that pull up carrying doctors, lawyers,  entertainment executives and others eager to tone up muscles and sweat off flab  at the Sports Club/LA.  </P> <P> Valets are on duty up to 17 hours a day. They race to four parking lots outside  the gym while club members inside are using such equipment as electronically  controlled exercise bikes and a special jogging track.  </P> <P> Gym members who spend up to $1,900 to join and $135 a month to use the club say  the valet idea is not as bizarre as it looks.  </P> <P> "Time is money," said Reja Sabet, a Century City stockbroker. "If you only have  an hour and a half to work out, you don't want to spend 15 minutes walking to  and from your car."  </P> <P> Nanette James, of Bel-Air, agreed.  </P> <P> "If you're late for a private training session and are paying the guy 50 bucks  an hour, a dollar or so for valet parking is not much," James said.  </P> <P> Gym members who sweat through such professionally planned exercise routines do  not want to deal afterward with the regimen of hunting for their cars in a  six-level self-parking garage that is available for club members, said David  Limor, a real estate investment company owner from Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> "After an hour and a half of cardiovascular work, weights and stretching  exercises, you feel good. But you're thinking about getting home, and that's  all," Limor said, climbing into his white Porsche. "If all you want is  exercise, you could run around your house."  </P> <P> The members' garage requires tight turns, added Brentwood lawyer Pat Delchop  with a grin as he waited for his black BMW. "If someone else dings it getting  it out of the lot, I can sue them. If I do it, I can't."  </P> <P> Even club members who park their own cars say they appreciate the valets, who  are paid $5 per hour and split all tips among themselves at the end of the day.  </P> <P> "I think, for the people who use the valet parking, their time is a little more  valuable than mine at the moment," said Alyson Stover, a television network  film acquisition assistant who lives in Century City. She said she parks on the  street during her five-times-a-week gym visits.  </P> <P> Not all visitors walk away enthusiastic about all the pampering, however. Not  even those who use the valet service and do not have to actually walk away.  </P> <P> "This wouldn't go over in San Diego where we live, I'll tell you," said Susan  Lapidus, who visited the club as a perk that came with her stay at a Bel-Air  hotel. Lapidus found the valets and other club amenities a bit excessive.  </P> <P> "It's L.A., I guess," added her husband, attorney Robert Lapidus.  </P></p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Moorgate Smaller Cos launch could raise Pounds 50m MOORGATE Smaller Companies Income Trust yesterday became the second investment trust to be launched this week, with an offer which could raise as much as Pounds 50m. A total of Pounds 37.5m has already been committed, and there is an offer-for-subscription of a further Pounds 12.5m, of which half is underwritten. This is an increase on the original target of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 30m. The trust will be investing only in listed UK smaller companies, with market capitalisations up to Pounds 200m, and avoiding the USM and unquoted stocks. The same fund management group also manages the Moorgate Investment Trust, which was the top performing smaller companies trust over 10 years to March 31, according to Micropal. The ordinary shares are priced at 100p and are aiming for a gross dividend yield of 5 1/2 per cent. Warrants are being sold separately at 35p, giving the right to subscribe for a new share at 100p between 1992 and 2001. Applications for the new trust must be for a minimum of 1,000 shares and must be made by May 21.</p>

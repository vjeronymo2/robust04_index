			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Technology: Costs climb through the roof Disaster recovery is not a cheap option. CDRS's John Ratliff quotes rates of between Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 15,000 a year to obtain access to a 'cold site' - a computer room without computers - whenever disaster strikes, with an additional amount payable depending on the time the site is occupied. 'Hot sites' - which are computer rooms with computers in place, tested and ready to use - are more expensive, with costs ranging from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 200,000 a year. Again an additional amount is payable on occupancy. CDRS quotes a maximum 'hot site' occupancy fee of Pounds 25,000 with an additional Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000 for each day the site is occupied. Occupancy of 'hot sites' is restricted by CDRS to an eight-week period, although the company ensures clients can maintain the continuity of their business through other services if a disaster victim is unable to return to its own facilities. Safetynet quotes average fees of Pounds 14,500 per year for access to its hot sites, which are typically smaller. From this relatively basic levels the industry is developing in two inter-related directions. Companies such as Failsafe Roc and Safetynet are also offering more comprehensive contingency planning. Large corporations could pay up to Pounds 150,000 for such a plan - with additional amounts payable for an annual review. In addition, disaster recovery services are offering more sophisticated products designed to reduce the time taken in making back-up computer tapes. Typically, a large bank or insurance company will make duplicate tapes at least once a day which it will store in security archives. A range of techniques such as 'electronic vaulting', 'remote journaling' and 'database shadowing' allows companies to minimise the recovery time caused by periodic back-ups. According to Ratliff, these methods allow companies to survive computer disasters with minimal disruption. Ensuring 'business continuity' is likely to dominate developments in the sector.</p>

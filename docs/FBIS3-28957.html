The schedule lays down concrete ways  to open Korean markets in such areas as farm products,  industrial goods and services.    The final schedule will be sent to the Secretariat of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) soon after being  passed by the cabinet, rendering useless Korean farmers  organizations' demand to re-open the Uruguay Round negotiations.    Member countries will submit their schedules to GATT by the  end of March, with the final agreement on the UR talks to be  signed in Morocco on April 12-15. The legislatures of GATT  member countries must then ratify the agreement, which is to  take effect on Jan. 1 or on July 1 of next year.    The schedule calls for industrial products' and fishery  goods' range of tariff concessions to be expanded to 90 percent  in number of items and to 87.5 percent in import amounts. The  average tariff concession rate will be reduced to 8.1 percent  from 17.9 percent in 1996.    As for the service sector, 78 items will fall under tariff  concessions: In the previous schedule, which was submitted in  October last year, such items numbered 80.    Also in the schedule, the Computerized Reservation System  (CRS) and a future financial liberalization plan are offered as  items subject to exemption of most favored nation (MFN) status.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Russian rouble at new low The rouble tumbled by 5 per cent in Moscow yesterday to a new low of 2,460 to the US dollar, as the Central Bank refrained from intervention and interest rates were pushed up sharply. Finance Ministry officials explained the fall by reference to a call over the weekend by Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, the International Monetary Fund's executive director for Russia, for stabilisation of the rouble early next year - noting that currencies generally fell on the expectation of a currency stabilisation. At the same time the bank is seeking to build up its reserves of hard currency and has been reluctant to intervene in a major way in the market. The steady fall in the rouble is not greatly worrying the government, in spite of its possible effect on inflation, largely because it believes that a low rate will assist in a stabilisation effort which may be attempted next year. At the same time, its fall effectively reduces the government's commitments to unpaid salaries and to cover the budget deficit.</p>

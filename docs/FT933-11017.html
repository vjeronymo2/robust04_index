			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: John Lusty losses grow to Pounds 2.25m JOHN LUSTY Group, the USM-quoted food manufacturer formerly known as Dumas Group, reported pre-tax losses up from Pounds 970,000 to Pounds 2.25m for the year to January 31. Turnover for the year rose slightly, from Pounds 8.62m to Pounds 8.68m. Of this, continuing operations were responsible for Pounds 7.94m (Pounds 7.7m). Losses per share were 19.38p (15.34p). Mr David Hamp-Adams, who took over as chairman after the company's restructuring and name change in February this year, said discussions were under way regarding the sale of Bender and Cassel, which no longer fitted with the group's core activities. The restructuring of the group had already begun to pay off, he said, and despite poor trading conditions, its future now looked more secure than it had for some time.</p>

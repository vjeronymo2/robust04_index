			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OUT AND ABOUT: MONTHLY PROGRAMS FOR THE STARRY-EYED  </P> <P> Hal Jandorf sometimes worries that Southern California is drowning in a sea of  lights. Once a month, he and a group go up to the Charles Temple Observatory at  Moorpark College to take a look at the evening skies. They don't always get  that far.  </P> <P> "The light pollution," he lamented. "It's horrible."  </P> <P> Jandorf, 41, who has been teaching astronomy at Moorpark College since 1984,  organizes the Sunday Night Astronomy Program put on by the college's community  services department. The series gives serious and novice astronomers a close  encounter with the heavens via the observatory's powerful telescope.  </P> <P> Jandorf and Moorpark College astronomy lab instructor Dennis Leatart lecture on  a different astronomical subject each month and show slides. A recent slide  show about Jupiter included photographs taken by the Voyager space probe.  </P> <P> The observatory sits atop a hill on campus, strategically placed to take  advantage of an area considerably less polluted by light. But the electric  evidence of city life is not far off.  </P> <P> "See that?" Jandorf said, pointing eastward toward a bank of rolling hills  silhouetted against a glow. "That's Simi Valley, and farther down, Chatsworth.  </P> <P> "I have a switch to shut 'em both off when we get ready to use the telescopes,"  Jandorf said.  </P> <P> Since October, 1987, an average of 150 people have congregated each month at  the observatory's little amphitheater. Dressed warmly and sitting on blankets  that protect them from the cool cement benches, astronomy enthusiasts of all  ages are taught about constellations such as the seven sisters, Betelgeuse and  Sirius, "the Dog Star."  </P> <P> After Jandorf and Leatart are finished with their separate lectures and slide  shows -- some of which make use of their own photographs -- they lead the  participants to the observatory's Celestron 14-inch-diameter telescope. Groups  of 10 climb the 11 steps to the scope that takes them up to 900 times closer to  their chosen astral subject. They step into the steel dome structure, dimly lit  with red light, and are enveloped in New Age music emanating from a boom box.  </P> <P> The voyage begins.  </P> <P> "We are going to be looking at a globular cluster," Jandorf said at a recent  program.  </P> <P> "Sounds like something that accumulates on the bottom of my bathtub," one  participant said.  </P> <P> According to Jandorf, a globular cluster is a massive star conglomeration  containing tens of thousands of stars, held together by the gravity of a black  hole located in the middle.  </P> <P> In addition to the main telescope, Jandorf and his assistants also set up a  number of other smaller scopes.  </P> <P> The next program in the series will be held 8:30 p.m. April 22, when spring  skies ought to provide optimum viewing for stargazers.  </P> <P> May's program will feature distant galaxies, and amateur astrophotography will  be covered in June.  </P> <P> There is a $3 charge each month. No registration is necessary.  </P> <P> For information, call 378-1408.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOOKING AT THE HEAVENS  </P> <P> Activities for people who want to put stars in their eyes:  </P> <P> * The Ventura County Astronomical Society holds monthly meetings featuring  lectures and seminars by professionals and amateurs on a variety of topics.  Slide shows, movies and panel discussions are given, along with equipment  demonstrations and reviews. Observing sessions are also held each month at  selected sites around Southern California. Field trips are taken to places such  as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Mt. Wilson. The society offers Starline, a  24-hour hot line for updated astronomy news and information on club events at  529-7813. Membership costs $30 per year for an individual or family. The group  meets 7:30 p.m. on the third Friday of each month at the Moorpark College  Science Building, Room 202.  </P> <P> * Ventura Parks and Recreation will hold "Spring Skywatch" 8 to 9:30 p.m. May 3  at Dennison Park, 7250 Ojai-Santa Paula Road, Ojai. Astronomer Ernest Underhay  will lecture about stars, constellations and other heavenly bodies. A telescope  will be available for viewing. There is a $5 charge. For information, call  Ventura Parks and Recreation at 658-4726.  </P> <P> * Comet Austin, discovered about six months ago, will pass over Southern  California during mid-April and will be appearing until the end of May. To see  it, look toward the northeastern part of the sky about one hour before sunrise.  "Although comets are unpredictable and sometimes nothing but duds, we have our  fingers crossed that Austin will put on a show," astronomer Hal Jandorf said.  RODNEY BOSCH  </P></p>

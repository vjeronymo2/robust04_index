			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Athletics Congress, the governing body for track and field in the United  States, began its program of out-of-competition drug testing, aimed at curbing  the use of anabolic steroids and other banned substances.  </P> <P> Fourteen athletes have been selected for testing this week.  </P> <P> Under the plan, the top 15 performers in each event are subject to random  selection for testing for the use of steroids, masking agents and diuretics  within 48 hours of notification.  </P> <P> TAC, which has budgeted $300,000 for the program and will receive an additional  $100,000 from the United States Olympic Committee, plans to test 60 athletes a  month.  </P> <P> Throughout the process the names of those tested will remain confidential.  Names will be revealed only after test results are conclusive and, in the event  of a positive test, all appeals are exhausted.  </P> <P> A positive test could result in a two-year suspension from competition, whereas  an athlete who tests positive a second time faces a lifetime ban from the  sport.  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD moved between good support and resistance on the London bullion market yesterday. Dealers said that selling emerged near to Dollars 356.50 a troy ounce, and above that level Australian and South African producers were likely to come into the market. However, when the price was pushed down below Dollars 355 there was good support from fund buying in New York. 'Gold has just been bouncing around between the two levels, it's a pretty aimless market at the moment,' one dealer said. Some said they were finding it impossible to deal in the market. Copper's weakness on the LME fed through to ALUMINIUM, which faltered when three-month metal reached Dollars 1,170 a tonne and tumbled back below Dollars 1,150 on speculative liquidation. London's robusta COFFEE extended earlier gains as New York staged a modest bounce after the sharp fall earlier in the week. Dealers said the market could soon begin to stabilise after its volatile spell, but the prospects of any major advance had been severely dented. High stocks and weak summer demand might also help to ensure the market's bias is more likely to be on the downside. Compiled from Reuters</p>

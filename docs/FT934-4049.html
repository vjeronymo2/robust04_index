			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / BT anger over European rules British Telecommunications will seize on a far-reaching alliance between the French and German state telecommunications operators, set to be announced tomorrow, to campaign for a rapid dismantling of barriers impeding competition between Europe's telecommunications companies. In a speech to an FT conference tomorrow, BT chairman Mr Iain Vallance will also vent BT's mounting frustration that over-regulation of its UK business is holding it back. In an outspoken attack on the European Commission, Mr Vallance will call on it to abandon attempts at tight 'utility-style' regulation and instead produce early proposals to allow competing networks to be built on the continent. So far, the Commission has only agreed to allow competition over existing public networks, and delayed its introduction until 1998. Describing the UK as the 'test bed' for the new age of competing multi-media services, Mr Vallance will step up BT's complaint that overseas operators, particularly the US regional Bell companies building cable and mobile networks in the UK, are free to provide a broader range of services to UK customers than is BT itself. 'Over the last decade, the UK has been conditioned to believe that, for companies, big is inherently bad,' he will warn. 'The trouble is that the rest of the world does not.' Citing recent moves by US telephone companies into the cellular mobile and cable sectors, he will note that BT 'may do neither of these things in its home market, because of the (regulatory) bar imposed on true convergence'. Although BT has a part share in mobile phone operator Cellnet, its freedom to integrate 'fixed' and 'mobile' services is circumscribed. Mr Vallance is concerned that BT faces a 'utility trap' of detailed constraints on its pricing and deployment of technology, while hostile alliances form against it on the continent. BT is also anxious to prevent a Franco-German alliance forming long in advance of the opening of European markets to full competition.</p>

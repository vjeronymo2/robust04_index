			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Improved sales help MIM climb MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced a 45 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 51.1m (USDollars 36.5m) for the six months to December 13, in spite of a weak second quarter. Net profit rose to ADollars 76.8m including an abnormal profit of ADollars 25.7m from the sale of a 28 per cent interest in the McArthur River zinc mining project. Sales rose 3.6 per cent to ADollars 871m. MIM said the improved result was caused by a fall in the value of the Australian dollar, higher domestic gold sales, higher coal sales from the Oakey Creek mines, and a higher zinc price. Gold operations at Porgera, the Papua New Guinea mining operation which is 30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, a 65 per cent subsidiary of MIM, produced 'good' results. Second-quarter net profit before abnormals was ADollars 16.6m, an increase on the ADollars 12.5m profit in the comparable period of the previous year, but lower than the ADollars 34.5m profit achieved in the first quarter of the current year. MIM said the subdued second-quarter result was influenced by a downturn in prices for copper, lead, silver and zinc. Sales volumes were lower.</p>

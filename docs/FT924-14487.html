			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Gorbachev criticises Yeltsin over raid on his institute MR MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, the former Soviet president, yesterday accused his successor, Mr Boris Yeltsin, of 'authoritarian tendencies' after an early morning raid on his institute which his aides described as 'the second October revolution'. 'This is an act of political revenge,' Mr Gorbachev told journalists, after he and a few assistants managed to force their way into the graceful, parquet-floored building from which his Gorbachev Foundation is being ousted. He said the move exemplified 'the increasingly authoritarian tendencies of today's leaders'. The eviction, ordered by decree by the Russian president on Wednesday night, followed Mr Gorbachev's declaration in a Russian newspaper interview that Mr Yeltsin was 'clearly not coping with his duties'. Mr Gorbachev learned his foundation was to be displaced by a new academy for financiers when he turned on his television on Wednesday night. Then early yesterday morning, Mr Arkady Murashov, the Moscow chief of police, with three busloads of municipal police and, according to the newspaper Izvestia, the OMON anti-riot forces, blocked all entrances to Mr Gorbachev's premises. The police sealed off the accounts and store-rooms of the building, leading Mr Gorbachev to joke that they might be seeking the gold and dollar reserves allegedly stolen by the now disbanded Communist party. Mr Alexander Poklad, a Yeltsin spokesman, said that Mr Yeltsin was 'above petty recriminations' and would not respond to Mr Gorbachev's charges. He claimed that the only objective of the presidential decree was to secure more space for the vital task of training financial specialists. However, Mr Yeltsin's tough action highlights his tendency to hold personal grudges and resolve troublesome issues by presidential fiat. Mr Gorbachev, who is barred from leaving the country because of his refusal to answer a second summons by the constitutional court in its inquest into the Communist party, was deprived of his black limousine when he attacked Mr Yeltsin's economic performance earlier this year. The former leader, who in the past was equally capable of dealing humiliating blows to his protege who became his rival, has gained some public sympathy as a result of the high-handedness of Mr Yeltsin's actions and the hardships caused by his economic reforms.

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / World Trade News: EC hits at Japan audio cassettes - Brussels' dumping arsenal likely to come under renewed scrutiny THE EUROPEAN Community is due on Monday to impose definitive anti-dumping duties on Japanese audio cassettes in a controversial move. The cassette dispute has already provoked a threat from Tokyo to cease investing in the EC. The case still excites concern in a minority of EC member states and is bound to lead to renewed scrutiny of the EC's anti-dumping arsenal. The EC Commission has secured a qualified majority of the 12 member states to impose the levy, Brussels officials say. To do so, it has dropped a more contentious case against imported tape used by Japanese companies to assemble cassettes in the EC. The tape case is incendiary because the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year outlawed the EC's so-called 'screwdriver' rules against products assembled in the EC using imported parts. Critics saw the tape action as an EC attempt to reintroduce the anti-circumvention provisions banned by Gatt. Brussels has agreed to drop the tape inquiry, but lawyers acting for Japanese companies say it has not altered the figures used to calculate injury to EC producers. These, they claim, are related to a percentage of market share which could only have been reached by including output of Japanese affiliates producing inside Europe. The Commission denies this. The measure is designed and drafted to specify that this output is not included in the injury, an official insisted. The definitive duties are likely to be lower than expected - an average of about 17 per cent. This compares with provisional duties ranging from 14.7 to 22.3 per cent imposed last November and a 22-24 per cent band suggested by the Commission last month. Commission investigators originally calculated there was a dumping margin of 60 per cent. The case has been bitterly fought. On April 30, Tokyo told Gatt's anti-dumping committee that if the EC went ahead with definitive levies on cassettes, Japanese companies would review plans to invest in Europe. According to one EC diplomat, Japanese companies have made veiled promises of investment in member states voting against the measure. But lawyers acting for Japanese companies in the row insist their clients have merely stressed that the EC's methodology amounts 'objectively to an attack on inward investment'. The row over methods centres on the reference period, fixed unusually far back in 1985-88. Injury has been related to EC cassette producers' market share in 1985 and the prices they would have needed to get a 12 per cent profit then. The Commission admits that during the reference period, market share of imports from Japan fell from 42 to 35 per cent. Hence the parallel investigation into audio tape. If cassettes produced inside the EC using imported tape are taken into account, Japan's share rose significantly. The Commission says the flaw in this argument is that 'it assumes that the remaining 35 per cent (market share) was not injurious, and was not unfairly gained'. EC diplomats say Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium, among the original dissenters from Brussels' view, now accept the cassettes case has been definitively cleansed of 'screwdriver' taint. Those member states almost certain to vote against the levies - the UK, Luxembourg and Denmark - also appear to accept that EC output by Japanese companies is not considered by the regulation. But the UK, for one, while not objecting to the dumping finding, is still unhappy with the methodology and the resulting figures.</p>

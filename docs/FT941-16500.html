			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Arts: Rostropovich at the Barbican At the Barbican on Saturday night, with a superlative piano-partner in Ian Brown, Mstislav Rostropovich played the cello. He was in easy, magisterial form. Not least among the delights of a Rostropovich recital is being firmly reminded that he is a great artist - a fact that is sometimes muddied in his appearances as conductor. There, an excess of enthusiasm over technique may disappoint; sometimes he doesn't transmit his intentions to his orchestra clearly enough to achieve much more than an excited hubbub, all noise and confusion. When he does, the result can of course be splendid; but not always. On the cello, however, his intentions are directly and gloriously realised. On Saturday there were two or three passages in which his pitch suddenly went peculiar (he is going on 68, after all), but they made no difference whatever. Even in the smallest pieces - a Marcello Adagio, the Rakhmaninov Vocalise, a racing Humoresque by himself fifty years ago, and most of all in an encore, Ravel's bijou Habanera - there were penetrating touches of phrasing and colour, of humour and feeling. Rostropovich is one of those rare players whose instrument has become his natural voice. Twenty and thirty years ago, he used to invest Bach's solo suites with taut drama. Here, the C minor Suite was broad, unhurried, grand and down-to-earth at once: a ripe musical experience. For the Beethoven sonata originally announced, he substituted the early, playful variation-set on the duet 'Ein Madchen oder Weibchen' from Mozart's Magic Flute, to which Brown made his own sparkling contribution. Early this season, Brown figured in a Nash Ensemble concert that got off on the wrong foot and grew steadily lamer (as I reported glumly on this page); it was a great pleasure to hear him rising to this occasion with such assured, creative finesse. He matched Rostropovich faultlessly in their crowning exhibit, Prokofiev's late C major Sonata - for which in 1949 the cellist himself had advised the composer on the cello-writing. Like other works of Prokofiev's last years, it is seemingly transparent, tuneful, sectional in an old-fashioned way, and yet elusively oblique. Here the partners invested its three discursive movements with glowing conviction and variety, moment by moment; by the end, we had registered a potent autumnal message, music too precisely expressive (as in Mendelssohn's famous remark) to be put into words.</p>

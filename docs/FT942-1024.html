			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Hungary parties agree coalition Hungary's new government of former communists and liberals passed its final hurdle yesterday when assemblies of the Socialist party and Alliance of Free Democrats approved a coalition. In last month's parliamentary elections the Socialists gained an absolute majority of seats. But the Socialists were aware of the concern aroused, both internationally and domestically, by the prospect of one-party rule by former communists, however reformed. The Free Democrats' nominal veto right over government decisions acts as a safeguard of sorts that Hungary will stick to its free market and western orientation. The alliance gives the new government the broad support and legitimacy it needs to implement austerity measures to deal with large budget and current account deficits. The way is now clear for Mr Gyula Horn, 61-year-old leader of the Socialists and former foreign minister, to be sworn in as Hungary's prime minister and to appoint his cabinet in mid-July. As expected, Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance minister in the last communist government, will return to the post. With another Socialist nominated to the Industry and Trade Ministry, the former communists are set to dominate economic policy. The new government plans to introduce protectionist measures to curb imports. It promises bankruptcy law reform to keep companies alive if it would cost more to close them, and rapid privatisation of banks and utilities. That and the forewarning of energy price increases add to the likelihood that the Dollars 1bn-plus sell-off of the power industry will go ahead soon.</p>

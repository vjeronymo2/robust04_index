			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: FRESNO ST. NAMES COLSON BASKETBALL COACH  </P> <P> Gary Colson, former Pepperdine and New Mexico basketball coach who was an  assistant at California the past two seasons, was appointed head coach at  Fresno State Monday.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Gary Cunningham named Colson to succeed Ron Adams, who  resigned with two weeks left in the season.  </P> <P> Adams had a 42-69 record in four years as the Bulldogs' coach.  </P> <P> Colson, 55, is credited with playing a key role in revitalizing the offense at  Cal, which made it to the NCAA tournament this year for the first time since  1960. The Bears beat Indiana in a first-round game, 65-63, then lost to  third-ranked Connecticut, 74-54.  </P> <P> Colson is the nation's 12th-winningest active coach with a record of 487-312.  </P> <P> Colson was coach at Valdosta State in Georgia for 10 seasons, starting in  1958-59, went to Pepperdine for 11 seasons, starting in 1968-69, and then was  at New Mexico for eight seasons, starting in 1980-81.  </P> <P> He was forced to resign at New Mexico by former athletic director John Koenig,  who resigned himself shortly thereafter in the midst of allegations of  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> New Mexico went 22-14 in 1987-88, Colson's last season there, and was ranked  18th after a 14-3 start. But a late-season slump cost the Lobos an NCAA  tournament berth. They went to the tournament the previous season.  </P> <P> Colson arrived at New Mexico in 1980, after a scandal that involved FBI  wiretaps as part of a gambling investigation. Uncovered, among other things,  were fake transcripts for junior college transfers. Coach Norm Ellenberger was  convicted of 21 counts of providing false public vouchers.  </P></p>

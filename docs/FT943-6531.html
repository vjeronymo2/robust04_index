			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / This Week: Sport Tennis August 29 to September 11, US Open Tennis Championships, Flushing Meadow, New York The richest tennis tournament of the year starts today. Record prize money of Dollars 9.36m is at stake on the unyielding hard courts at the US National Tennis Center - an arena famed for testing competitors' fitness and sapping their stamina. That may be a daunting thought for top seed Pete Sampras as he attempts to become the first man since Jimmy Connors (1974) and Mats Wilander (1988) to win three Grand Slam titles in the same year. Sampras is still suffering from the effects of an ankle injury at Wimbledon. Andre Agassi will be the people's choice. But watch out for back-in-form Boris Becker, coming off recent tournament wins in Los Angeles and New Haven. Motor Racing August 30, Michael Schumacher appeal in Paris Schumacher's bid to become the youngest world motor racing champion suffered a severe blow yesterday when the 25-year-old German was disqualified for a rules infringement after passing the chequered flag first in the Belgian Grand Prix. He could face another setback on Tuesday, when he appeals to the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile's Court of Appeal against the two-race suspension imposed last month for ignoring a black flag during the British Grand Prix. He will have in mind the fate of Eddie Irvine who earlier this year appealed against a one-race ban for his part in a three-car collision in Brazil. Irvine left Paris with his suspension increased to three races. Cricket September 3, NatWest Trophy Final, Lord's, London Victory in the NatWest final will be the next step in Warwickshire's bid to pull off an unprecedented sweep of all four major English cricket competitions in a season. The county is well placed to take both the County Championship and the Sunday League. Warwickshire's opponents on Saturday are Worcestershire, the team they beat in the Benson and Hedges Cup.</p>

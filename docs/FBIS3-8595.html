			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Democratic Alliance issued in Tirana on 11 </F> March: "Continuing Violence Against the Democratic Alliance  Will Not Yield Results"]    [Text] At about 2000 on Thursday [10 March], several  unknown persons assaulted Deputy Teodor Keko, member of the  Democratic Alliance [AD] Presidency, editor in chief of ALEANCA,  journalist, and writer. This incident is part of a long line of  oppressive measures that the present government has undertaken  against the political opposition and the independent and  opposition press. For the AD in particular, this criminal act  comes after the murder of Gjovalin Cekini, after the shameful  organization of a defense for his murderers, after the assault  on deputy editor in chief Gjergj Zefi, after dozens of incidents  prepared in the offices of the ruling Democratic Party against  the AD's work, and after attacks, insults, and slanders against  the party's leaders. This latest activity of the Albanian  Ton-Ton macoutes neither surprises us nor weakens us. As we  have declared, the AD's members are ready to give their lives to  establish democracy in Albania. They will die as Cekini did, if  this is the price required, but they will never fall silent and  they will continue to loudly denounce the police state that has  been created in Albania. The AD does not protest against the  state and asks for nothing from it, but issues a strong warning  that the last stop on the road of crime is prison.</p>

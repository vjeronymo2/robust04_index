According to available information, the device was placed by  two unidentified persons in their twenties who were driving a  black BMW around the center. The central security forces  arrested the two persons for interrogation. It turned out that  they had maps of Juniyah and neighboring areas. A third person  was taken in for interrogation by the security agencies.    The gift-wrapped device was six kg of a highly-explosive  material, equal to 25 kg of TNT, and was placed at the main  entrance to the center. It was discovered by the center  manager, Mrs. Chantal Mansur, who was suspicious and contacted  the security agencies.    A security meeting was immediately held in the office of  Juniyah Company Commander Colonel Ziyad 'Urabi in the presence  of the chiefs of security in the region.    The French Foreign Ministry announced a short while ago that  Paris is considering with the Lebanese authorities the  possibility of adopting security measures to protect French  interests in Lebanon. The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed  out that the targeted cultural center will resume its activity  as usual. He condemned the sabotage attempt, noting that the  French Government is in contact with the Lebanese authorities to  shed light on the incident and uncover the circumstances  surrounding it.    Sources at the French Embassy have said that there are no  plans to close the center as rumored.    Upon receiving the news, the French charge d'affairs headed  to the cultural center to find out what happened.    Foreign Ministry Secretary General Zafir al-Hasan telephoned  the French charge this afternoon to convey the Lebanese  Government's denunciation of the incident.</p>

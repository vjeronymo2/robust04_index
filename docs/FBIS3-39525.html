[Denktas] The Cyprus problem is on the UN Security Council's  table. Several proposals have been made on the problem from  time to time. It has been debated for a long time. However, no  results have been achieved. The reason for that is the Greek  Cypriot side's determination to function as the legal Cyprus  government. The Greek Cypriots wish neither to reduce nor to  lose completely what they have gained from using the legal title  of the Cyprus Government. They intend to achieve their  objective by having the Turkish Cypriots agree to join a  partnership administration. That obstacle has prolonged the  Cyprus problem for 30 years.    The UN officials and the countries that provide funds to  maintain the UN troops on the island, particularly the United  States, are determined to have the problem solved. The approach  they have used with us during the past year has been more  serious than in the past.    The Butrus-Ghali set of ideas was proposed when Yeoryios  Vasiliou was in power in south Cyprus. He misled the world by  saying that he agreed to the set of ideas. Meanwhile, he used  our wish to make changes in the set of ideas as an opportunity  to engage successfully in trickery, saying that the Turkish  Cypriot side had refused to hold talks and had abandoned the  negotiating table. Then we proposed to hold talks on each and  every paragraph of the set of ideas. Vasiliou placed  reservations on all the paragraphs when we arrived at that  point. He avoided responsibility by saying that he only agreed  to discuss the set of ideas not agree to them. Vasiliou's  behavior convinced those who supported him until that time that  he was not a trustworthy person.    When Glavkos Kliridhis came to power he failed to adopt a  favorable approach to the set of ideas, saying that significant  changes must be made and that the set of ideas could not be  considered until those changes were made. The UN officials, who  maintained a shuttle mission between us, ascertained that the  Greek Cypriots would not agree to the changes we wished to make  and the Turkish Cypriots would not agree to those that the Greek  Cypriots wished to make. They then said: "It seems that you do  not trust each other. Therefore, let us consider the package on  confidence-building measures." The UN secretary general  dispatched his experts to Cyprus when we outlined the problems  we established. We studied the report the experts drew up and  arrived at the conclusion that we could include many provisions  in the package, which was described as being very much in favor  of the Turkish Cypriots.    So, we called on the Greek Cypriot side to agree to hold  talks on the matter. As soon as we did so, the Greek Cypriots  described the experts' report as an invalid document and said  that it could not be placed on the negotiating table. The Greek  Cypriot leaders, excluding Kliridhis, then adopted a negative  approach against the package. Nevertheless, Kliridhis said: "I  am daring enough to do anything that will be in my people's  interest. I do not receive orders from anyone. I am prepared  to hold talks on the package for the cause I believe in and my  people's interests."    However, Glavkos Kliridhis signed a defense agreement with  Greece when preparations were made for the talks on the package.  He said that he was committed to his EOKA [Greek Cypriot  underground nationalist organization] oath, he had not forgotten  the oath he took on the Greek flag, and he would not allow  Cyprus to be further reduced in size.    Yes, those are the realities with which we are confronted.  Several of our colleagues have suggested that we should not  agree to "maintain the talks." However, we are not alone at the  negotiating table. We must bear in mind that Turkey has  responsibilities to the Turkish Cypriots and to the  international community. Important decisions like that must be  made with Turkey -- that is, if the time and conditions are  right. We cannot say that we have decided not to hold talks,  because we have realized that the Greek Cypriots do not wish to  reach an agreement with us and have prolonged the Cyprus problem  for that reason for 30 years. Unfortunately, the international  community has not yet realized that the Greek Cypriots do not  wish to reach an agreement. Therefore, we shall hold talks to  either explain that situation to the world or conclude a  balanced agreement with the Greek Cypriots in line with our  interests.    Can Maras [Varosha] be given up and returned? No, nothing  can be given up and returned. However, if we are to take  something in return, something that will be in our interest,  then we shall inform the people. We shall say: That is what  has been proposed in return. This is the value of the place we  may give up, a place that has been empty and in which our  authority has not been recognized. And the people will decide.    Kliridhis said yesterday that he will hold a referendum on  the agreement he may reach on the package. I welcomed his  statement because we also have to hold a referendum in  accordance with our Constitution.    [Duzgun] Will a referendum be held in north Cyprus on the  package of confidence-building measures?    [Denktas] We have to hold a referendum. However, Kliridhis  may or may not do so. We have to hold a referendum in  accordance with our Constitution. We have to maintain the talks  with a calm approach. No one can force us to sign an agreement,  saying that we have reached this or that point. It is the two  sides that will sign the agreement to be reached. We shall not  decide whether or not the agreement we have reached is in our  people's interest. We shall ask the people to decide.    [Duzgun] You have said that you are maintaining your cause  with Turkey. It has been reported that your current relations  with Turkey are the best they have ever been.    [Denktas] Our relations with Turkey have always been very  good. Turkey has supported us whenever we found ourselves in  difficulty. We have resolved our problems through consultations  and agreements with Turkey.    I was grieved to read a number of statements and reports  against the Turkish Foreign Ministry a few days ago. The  Turkish Foreign Ministry has carried the burden of the Cyprus  problem for many years. Very capable officials have worked in  that ministry, officials whom we trusted. Some of them have  retired and others have been promoted. They have not forgotten  Cyprus, however, because they have regarded the Cyprus issue as  a national problem and have worked hard. It is wrong to accuse  the Turkish Foreign Ministry and its officials when the  negotiating process is continuing. That will dishearten them.  I believe we are in a difficult stage.    Nevertheless, I have experienced similar stages in the past.  An example is the time I held talks with Glavkos Kliridhis in  1968. Several reports said at the time that we had reached an  agreement and that I had betrayed the Turkish Cypriot cause.  Another example was during the era of former President Turgut  Ozal in Turkey. Several claims were made at the time that he  agreed to give Cyprus away to end the problem. Similar claims  are being made at the present time. We have to be patient. We  are all aware of the Greek Cypriot side's nature, so we must not  allow it to mislead us.    [Duzgun] Can you resist against similar attacks?    [Denktas] We wish to conclude an agreement that will be in  our best interest. Otherwise, we shall not do so because we  have been promised that the Turkish Cypriot side will  significantly gain from the package. Let us wait and see if the  package will provide for cooperation, coexistence, and financial  opportunities. Let us wait and see if it will include travel  for Turkish Cypriots to wherever they wish to go with Turkish  Cypriot passports? Considering all that, sitting at the  negotiating table to hold talks is not a crime, it is a duty.    [Duzgun] The package on confidence-building measures  consists of three documents related to Maras, Nicosia Airport,  and measures aimed at promoting relations between the two  communities.    [Denktas] The question of Pyle is included among them. Also  included is the question of foreign aid the Turkish Cypriots  will receive...    [Duzgun] Regarding the confidence-building measures, the UN  Security Council report, dated 1 July 1993, only mentions Maras  and Nicosia Airport. What about the other measures? Are they  not on the agenda?    [Denktas] Yes, they are on the agenda. A disclosure will be  made tomorrow (today). You will see that they are on the  agenda. We have discussed them for several days and included  them on the agenda.    [Duzgun] Can you explain the agenda for the indirect talks?    [Denktas] That will be disclosed when Joe Clark arrives in  Cyprus.    [Duzgun] Does a problem exist on the agenda?    [Denktas] No, a problem does not exist. We have finalized  it.    [Duzgun] You said after conferring with Gustav Feissel that  you "do not wish to tread on anything slippery." Has an  initiative been made to make you say that?    [Denktas] The difficulty was to have the 12 provisions  included and proceed on the assumption that they exist.    [Duzgun] Are you frequently confronted with similar  initiatives?    [Denktas] Naturally, similar initiatives will be made.  Kliridhis will try to safeguard the Greek Cypriot side's  interests and I will try to safeguard the Turkish Cypriot side's  interests. He will try to have me tread on slippery ground and I  will reciprocate in the same way when our interests clash. Yes,  he will try that if he can.    [Duzgun] Can you comment on the concrete gains of the  Turkish  Cypriots when the package on confidence-building measures is  implemented?    [Denktas] Let us discuss that matter when the talks are  resumed. First, let us see what they are prepared to give.    [Duzgun] Is there nothing concrete at the present time?    [Denktas] No, nothing concrete exists. We shall see what  will happen when the talks resume.    [Duzgun] Will the Turkish Cypriots be able to fly from  Nicosia Airport to wherever they wish to travel with their TRNC  [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] passports?    [Denktas] That is among the promises that have been made to  us.    [Duzgun] Reports say that Britain and the United States will  move to facilitate the solution to that problem. They will  suggest that the TRNC passports...    [Denktas] Yes, they will suggest to all the European  countries that they treat the TRNC passports as they do. Yes,  those are the promises. We have moved to resume our work on the  basis of those promises. Nothing will be achieved if they are  not fulfilled.    [Duzgun] Do you wish to make a statement before the talks  resume?    [Denktas] No, I believe that making lengthy statements is  unnecessary. Meanwhile, Kliridhis is making lengthy statements.  In fact, he has indicated that several of our colleagues, who  expressed the view that "the Greek Cypriots have changed," were  wrong. I hope that Mr. Clark will assess that state of affairs.  I also hope that no one will think that we are stupid.    [Duzgun] Can you comment on your work with the government on  the Cyprus problem?    [Denktas] I can say that we are working in harmony. My  complaints are those of my country. The people have not allowed  the government members to work for several days. A lot of time  has been wasted by visits and the offering of coffee. There is  less of that at the present time.    [Duzgun] Have you found the harmony you expected in your  work  with the government on the Cyprus problem?    [Denktas] I cannot complain. We are working in harmony.  Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur attends the meetings. I  believe that he has no complaints. I have no complaints,  either. We are working in harmony and complying with the  realities. The burden will be easier to carry if responsible  people act in accordance with their responsibilities. It will  be difficult to carry shared responsibilities if any of those  officials forget how responsible they are and make irrelevant  statements. We have experienced that state of affairs in the  past. Hopefully, we shall not do so in the future.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES: ACADEMIC SENATE COULD USE STUDY SESSION  </P> <P> It is amazing how ignorant presumably intelligent people can sound when they  disparage something they know very little about.  </P> <P> The meeting of Cal State Northridge's Academic Senate this week is a prime  example.  </P> <P> After much discussion -- some of it comically lacking in accuracy -- senators  passed a motion expressing "concern" over the athletic program's move this year  to NCAA Division I status. The motion centered on a complaint that the school's  athletic program is receiving funds that could be best used in instructional  programs.  </P> <P> Northridge's budget -- as were those of other state universities -- was trimmed  this school year, by $6.6 million. Cost-containment measures are in effect at  CSUN, and, as a result, fewer classes are being offered, the school's libraries  are being shut down on Sundays and some faculty research projects have been  scrapped.  </P> <P> Despite the claim of school President James W. Cleary, who said "not one red  cent" of instructional money had been diverted to the athletic program, many  inquiring academicians are in an uproar.  </P> <P> Athletics just happens to be an easy target. Those who supported this motion of  "concern" -- which is really a vote of no confidence -- have been tricked into  basing their opposition on matters of money.  </P> <P> This clouds the real issue: Whether the athletic department belongs in the  university environment alongside, for instance, the business department.  </P> <P> Northridge has an enrollment of 31,000 students in the heart of a region with a  population of more than 2 million. Other areas of CSUN's curriculum have  expanded in size and national prominence along with the school's burgeoning  enrollment.  </P> <P> So why not athletics?  </P> <P> If any member of the Northridge faculty has a good answer, then let them base  their complaints on it. Claiming misuse of instructional funds simply doesn't  wash.  </P> <P> Several senators complained that $394,000 the Cal State Northridge Foundation  has earmarked for athletics would be better spent on instructional programs.  Let them apply for a grant. That's what the athletic department did. The  foundation is a nonprofit auxiliary organization of the university with a  governing board consisting of six students, six faculty members and two  administrators. Any university program or student can request to have projects  funded by a grant from the foundation.  </P> <P> The foundation's revenue is derived largely from Northridge students through  their purchases from the campus bookstore and food services. And where do the  students stand on the issue of athletics?  </P> <P> Well, when push came to shove at Thursday's senate meeting, Michelle Cooper,  president of the school's Associated Student Body, praised the athletic program  for its fund-raising efforts and held it up as a shining example that others  might choose to follow.  </P> <P> Hers were words lost in a wave of unsubstantiated claims.  </P> <P> One senator complained that coaches were not earning their keep in FTEs --  full-time equivalent students, the formula through which the state bases its  funding. In fact, the athletic department supports itself for staffing  purposes.  </P> <P> Several inaccuracies might have been avoided had senators taken a peek at the  five-year budget plan for athletics that has been available since February.  </P> <P> The feeling around the athletic department is that those who have misgivings  should study the reasons for the Division I move, ask questions about it, then  listen to the answers.  </P> <P> Most opponents, it seems, never reached square one.  </P> <P> When the senate met in May, another motion involving athletics was tabled for  lack of a quorum. Good thing. That motion was an effort to pull the plug on the  entire Division I move. Later, it was discovered, much to the dismay of several  embarrassed faculty members, that athletic schedules were set and the school  was committed to a minimum of three years in Division I.  </P> <P> Thankfully, this week's vote does little but leave a bad taste in the mouth of  athletic proponents.  </P> <P> That taste could have been worse.  </P> <P> The senate rejected an amendment brought by Harbhajan Sandhu, a professor in  the science and math department.  </P> <P> It said: "It is therefore moved that there should be no monies diverted from  instructionally related programs directly or indirectly to the Division I  program."  </P> <P> Told that some of those funds were legitimately assigned to athletics, Sandhu  said, "Then we will add that it is not legitimately assigned."  </P> <P> Mr. Sandhu, please see the first paragraph of this column.  </P> <P> Conked out: Let it never be said that Dean Conk does not get the most out of  money.  </P> <P> Conk coaches The Master's College women's volleyball team, which will spend two  days in the Bay Area next week. On Friday, Master's (10-10) will play at Mills  College and Saturday it has a doubleheader -- against different teams.  </P> <P> At noon, Master's will play at Dominican, then, at 7:30, will meet Menlo.  </P> <P> Are the players grumbling? Well, if they are, Conk isn't listening. "They have  no choice," he said.  </P> <P> Numbers game: Northridge will begin baseball practice next week with a 22-man  roster. That number might be a bit small, but it also is three more than the  Matadors had last season. "It shouldn't be a problem unless we get a bunch of  guys hurt at the same time," Coach Bill Kernen said. "We have a lot of guys who  can play different positions."  </P> <P> Kernen said he will work at least five players at the catcher's position: Mike  Sims, last season's starter; Kyle Washington, last season's backup; Mark  Clayton, Denny Vigo and Valley College recruit E. J. Pape.  </P> <P> The inclusion of Clayton is particularly interesting. Last season, Clayton  played outfield, first base and pitched in earning Division II All-American  honors. "About the only thing he didn't do last season was catch," Kernen said.  </P> <P> Look for Clayton's pitching role to be diminished this season.  </P> <P> Briefly: Even if Ken Jackson and Tom Berry don't go to trial for their alleged  involvement in an altercation with a Northridge campus security officer and  police, the Matador football players might still face disciplinary action by  the school.  </P> <P> The incident involving Jackson and Berry is not indicative of the relationship  between Northridge athletes and police, Lt. Mike Sugar of the State Campus  Police said. "These are two individuals who just got carried away," Sugar said.  "It shouldn't reflect on the entire athletic program."  </P> <P> Sugar said police had some difficulty controlling a crowd that had gathered at  the conclusion of the Sept. 14 incident, but he credited a handful of  Northridge athletes with helping to maintain order.  </P> <P> Bob Burt can tie Tom Keele for most wins by a Northridge football coach if the  Matadors defeat UC Davis tonight at North Campus Stadium. Burt is 29-18 in his  fifth season at CSUN. Keele was 30-43-1 in seven seasons.  </P> <P> Albert Fann needs 183 yards to establish a Northridge career rushing record.  Fann, CSUN's senior tailback, has 3,390 yards in 706 carries, trailing Mike  Kane, who gained 3,572 yards in 705 carries from 1983-86.  </P> <P> Abo Velasco is five field goals shy of the Northridge career record of 31 held  by Jose Ballina, who played from 1972-74. Velasco already holds the school  career mark for conversions with 82.  </P> <P> Darren McMahon tied the Northridge record for punts in a game last week with 11  against Central (Okla.) State. The sophomore from Granada Hills can thank the  Matadors' sputtering offense for his place in the record book.  </P> <P> McMahon shares the school record with Bryan Wagner, who punted 11 times against  Cal Lutheran in 1983. Wagner now punts for the Cleveland Browns and is enjoying  his third full season in the NFL. McMahon is second in the Western Football  Conference with an average of 38.8 yards a punt.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> It is an occupational disorder among philosophers of education that they harp  on one note in their criticisms/cures for their profession. The four notables  in education who make the case for "choice" in The Times ("To Get Parents  Involved, Put Choice Into L.A. Schools," Op-Ed Page, April 4) are no exception.  For with "choice" comes the freedom of teachers to teach, the willingness of  students to learn, etc.  </P> <P> No doubt there is truth in their contention. But education is an immense,  varied and distressingly human activity. It operates on theory and is a fertile  ground for further "theoryfication." He is a poor educator who does not have at  least one pet theory. I have several. But I submit that the issue of student  motivation is of a different order from questions of choice, magnet schools,  class size, desegregation, etc. The differential between Asian-American and  Mexican-American students in academic performance is consistent and striking,  for instance.  </P> <P> But I also submit that student motivation, like youthful drug addiction, is a  direct reflection of the level of youthful hopelessness. It is another measure  of national health, systematically related to the 51% turnout for the national  election last Nov. 8, for this was the great quadrennial health-test: Only half  of the eligible voters think the system works.  </P> <P> If so, if the disaffection among school children is but a part of the national  disaffection, then the problem is political and the indicated cure is  political. We need to raise generations of children talking politics beginning  with grade three. Sure, every child should be told that he or she can become  President, but also told how terrible recent Presidents have been in the  teacher's opinion. Never mind that this violates all the canons of what  constitutes textbook "civics" for the kids. What we look for is a return to a  healthy participation in government on the theory that if the parents are  deeply concerned with government, education will awaken and take care of  itself.  </P> <P> DAVID ALAN MUNRO  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P> <P>  (Munro is a retired professor of linguistics who has also taught at high  school level.)  </P> <P> </P></p>

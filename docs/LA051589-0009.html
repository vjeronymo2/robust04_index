			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOXIC WASTE  </P> <P> After several telephone calls to the appropriate city offices, and speaking to  very nice personnel, it became quite apparent that toxic waste collection  points are sadly missing. There are sporadic Saturday, 9-3, collection spots  around the city. What is one to do with oil-base paint cans, car batteries,  etc.?  </P> <P> The environment and toxic waste are in the forefront in thought with only  actual remedies (accessible collection points) lacking. Also, what about the  collection of food cans, household plastic bottles other than soft drink  bottles?  </P> <P> JANET GORDON KAPLAN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

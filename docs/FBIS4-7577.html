			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, March 30 (CTK) -- "It matters to no one in  the Czech Republic and no one is frightened by the fact that Mr.  (Vladimir) Dlouhy (Trade and Industry Minister) and Mr. (Ivan)  Kocarnik (Finance Minister), who are former Communists, have now  been in power for two years," Democratic Left Party (SDL)  Chairman Peter Weiss says in today's right-leaning TELEGRAF.    He said this in reply to a question about how he would react  to a statement that Communists had returned to power in Slovakia.    "If, however, Communists who created a new political party  assume power -- it instantly matters to everyone," Weiss adds.  (The SDL was formerly the Slovak Communist Party).    On early elections in Slovakia in autumn, he says: "In the  elections the Slovak people will have to express themselves  clearly about what path Slovakia will embark upon -- whether it  will follow the line of 'civil war rather than the President',  the policy, in other words, of political revenge on those who  had enough courage to democratically pass a no-confidence vote  on the Premier (Vladimir Meciar), the policy of populist  movements which endlessly give promises, but never keep them, or  whether it will follow a line of cooperation between political  parties which exist in the West," says Weiss.    On the new Slovak Government of Premier Jozef Moravcik and  the potential devaluation of the Slovak crown, Weiss says that  the new government's program is not based on "devaluation at any  cost and under any circumstances." He does not think that  Slovakia is "predetermined to experience rapid devaluation."    Commenting on the greatest problems Slovakia is now facing,  Weiss says that these are above all "growing state budget  deficit and a critical situation in the education and health  services, due to a lack of funds, which the new government  inherited from the previous one."    Comparing his party and similar parties in other East  European post-Communist countries, Weiss says that the SDL has  much in common with the Hungarian Socialist Party as well as  with the Polish Democratic Left Party, though the party  transformation took place under different circumstances there.  "We also have good relations with the Italian Democratic Left  Party," says Weiss, and adds that on the Czech political scene  the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) of Milos Zeman is  nearest to them.    "Our pro-Western orientation is unambiguous," Weiss says in  connection with Slovakia's foreign policy. He says that  together with Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis he "has pushed  through (a policy of Slovakia's) rapprochement with NATO to its  full membership in this organization."    Weiss says that Slovakia is watching developments in Russia  and is "not satisfied with the manifestation of extremism and a  new wave of 'Greater Russian' nationalism. This is also the  very reason why we agree with the (U.S.-proposed) Partnership  for Peace," Weiss says.    On the CSSD's initiative concerning the creation of a Czech-  Slovak union, Weiss says that the SDL sees the (January 1, 1993)  division of Czechoslovakia as a "reality which should not be  changed. Both successor states (the Czech and Slovak Republics)  have been recognized and so there are no longer political  conditions either at home or abroad for the restoration of what  has already existed," Weiss says.    Chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan  Carnogursky says in the economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that  the new Slovak Government will now have to make an "inventory of  Slovakia and assess what it has inherited from (the government  of ex-Premier) Vladimir Meciar."    In connection with Czech-Slovak problems ensued from  Czechoslovakia's split, he says that the new Slovak Government  "can free Slovak policy towards the Czech Republic from negative  emotions" and that it will maintain a "matter-of-fact approach"  in this respect, which has already been shown in the  Czech-Slovak negotiations of the Customs Union Council this  week. Some partial problems which burden the Czech-Slovak  relations will undoubtedly be resolved. But what the current  government will most likely not manage to resolve are for  instance the Czech National Bank claims towards Slovakia valued  at 24 million crowns (about $800 million), and some other  greater problems," Carnogursky says.</p>

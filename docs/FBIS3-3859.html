			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shiny Lin in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Maverick Hong Kong lawyer Liu Yiu-chu has become  the first to quit Beijing's handpicked elite preparing for the  1997 change of sovereignty. Ms Liu's resignation yesterday from  the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) came as no surprise.  She has long been an outspoken critic of the body, which  oversees preparations for the transition.    In recent weeks, she had vocally criticised the nomination  of  pro-British Hong Kong personalities to the PWC.    Ms Liu had already threatened to resign on several  occasions,  at one time openly crying when forced to be seated next to a  pro-British appointee during a meeting. Her resignation was  accepted during an hour-long meeting with China's most senior  official dealing with the territory, the director of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping.    "As a delegate to the NPC (National People's Congress), I  have the responsibility to watch the work of the PWC and to give  advice to the PWC," Ms Liu stated after her meeting with Mr Lu.  "I think that's enough for me. In order to work better in the  NPC, I want to resign as a member of the PWC."    Mr Lu will now formally report Ms Liu's resignation to the  NPC Standing Committee.    When granted Mr Lu's approval to resign, it felt "just like  a  stone lifting up from my heart," Ms Liu said. But she warned  that the Chinese government should not ignore the results of the  1994-95 elections, the last ones under British rule.</p>

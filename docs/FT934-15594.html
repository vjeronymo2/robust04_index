			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Snacks play byte-size role in computer games: New advertising ploy sparks call for regulation CHILDREN'S computer games are the latest, and apparently highly effective, advertising medium for snack food manufacturers seeking to promote their brands. Sweets, biscuits and crisps, and the logos and advertising characters associated with them, are appearing as integral parts of the computer games. For Pounds 13,000, a manufacturer is able to buy a 'standard inclusion' consisting of a 20-second animation sequence at the beginning of the game. An outlay of Pounds 50,000 would secure inclusion in one of the 10 top-selling games and an entire level of the game would probably be built around the product, according to Mr Daniel Bobroff, the 28-year-old executive who says he created the market. However, there is sometimes little or no indication on the packaging that games have been sponsored by food manufacturers in this largely unregulated advertising sector. The Consumers' Association is calling for the British Code of Advertising Practice to be extended to new media developments, including electronic games. Mr Bobroff's company, Microtime Media, which he says has an annual turnover of Pounds 1m, says his latest deal is a tie-up between The Sun newspaper, Domino's Pizza delivery chain and Fizzy Chewits sweets, for a game with a Sun photographer as its hero. Level one of Snapperazzi, which is due on sale at Christmas, features Page Three girls (their weapons are kisses); level two is rock stars; and level three has the Royal family firing corgis, said Mr Bobroff. It is 'too early to say' whether the packaging will make it clear that pizzas and sweets are also featured in the game, he added. Quavers crisps, and the character associated with the brand, Colin Curly, appear in the computer game One Step Beyond. Penguin biscuits feature in James Pond 2, while Chupa Chups, the Spanish lolly, is an integral part of the game Zool. Research conducted for Microtime Media by Carrick James Market Research is said to show that 87 per cent of youngsters aged from five to 19 in the UK regularly play computer games, while 76 per cent have a games console or personal computer in their home. However, awareness among parents of the advertising may not be as high. For example, the version of Zool on sale this weekend in the games department of Virgin Megastore in London's Oxford Street makes no mention on its packaging of the Chupa Chups advertising. McVities, which makes Penguin, said involvement with the computer game was 'a one-off tactical promotion. We were offered advertising slots with the game and costs were minimal.' Mr Bobroff said software publishers had been reluctant to feature prominent mentions of advertisers on packaging. However, all future productions would say they were 'produced in association with' or 'sponsored by' the brand advertising.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / People: Finance moves Michael McLintock, 33, who joined M&amp;G from Barings less than two years ago, is following in his father's footsteps and taking a seat on the board of Britain's biggest independent fund management group. McLintock, who looks after M&amp;G's institutional investment business, is one of two new faces joining the main M&amp;G board. Richard Hughes, 37, who joined the group in 1987 and manages the M&amp;G Recovery fund, has also joined the board. M&amp;G portrayed the appointments as routine promotions but they do suggest that the group is keen to rejuvenate an increasingly elderly top management team. Paddy Linaker, the chief executive, retires at the end of the month and is being succeeded by a man of similar age, David Morgan, 60. This has led to some speculation that Morgan will have little more than a caretaker role. Michael McLintock will not be able to enjoy sitting next to his father at board meetings. Alan McLintock, a senior figure in the accountancy profession, retired in February after 12 years on the M&amp;G board.</p>

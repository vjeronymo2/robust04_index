			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Bangkok Land valued at Dollars 3.6bn in stock exchange debut BANGKOK LAND, the property developer, was valued at more than Dollars 3.6bn yesterday when its shares were listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, giving it the largest capitalisation on the market. The company's stock market debut attracted intense interest from Thai and foreign investors and dealings in the shares amounted to about one-third of total trading volume. Bangkok Land closed at Bt154, up only Bt4 from its opening, but well above last year's initial public offering price of Bt90, when the underwriters had trouble finding buyers for the 10 per cent of the company on offer. Market sentiment has improved since the initial offering - a process described by one broker as 'neither initial nor public' in accordance with Thai practice - and the shares had recently traded on the grey market at around Bt140. From today, the company, valued at Bt92.4bn, will make up about 8 per cent of the SET index, giving the controlling Kanjanapas family considerable influence in the market. One brother, Anant, runs Bangkok Land, and another, Keeree, runs Thanayong, also a large property company. Bangkok Land's main project is Muang Thong Thani, an embryonic residential, commercial and industrial satellite city on the outskirts of Bangkok which is said to be the world's largest private property development. When construction of pre-fabricated units is running at full production, the company expects to finish one condominium unit every five minutes. Foreign brokers have generally advised their clients to be cautious of the stock or have treated it as a speculative buy, partly because of initial doubts about the way the company booked deposits on partially built properties as earnings. The property market has also started to soften, and although the low income housing sector favoured by Bangkok Land has held up well, there are fears the company in common with the developers of London's docklands, may have difficulty attracting customers and the industrial units may be hard to sell. The next big new listing on the Thai stock market is expected to come from the privatisation of Thai Airways.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY EMPLOYEES AND BEARDS  </P> <P> Mickey Mouse, Abe Lincoln, Captain Hook, Pluto, Goofy, Walt Disney and the  Seven Dwarfs: What do they have in common? They have facial hair and they are  employed in one way or another by Disney. If the amusement industry giant would  be consistent in its rules, all of these characters should be laid off. What's  next -- barring admission to their parks and hotels of customers with  mustaches? What a Goofy, Dopey, Mickey Mouse rule! Where is the ACLU when we  need it most?  </P> <P> TOM DEITERICH  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

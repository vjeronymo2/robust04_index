			<p>BFN     [Text] The Australian government has described the closure  of three Indonesian news magazines as very disappointing.    The Indonesian government yesterday banned TEMPO, the  country's leading news magazine, and the popular publications  DETIC and EDITOR.    Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said that the  prime minister, Paul Keating, would go ahead with his visit to  Indonesia next week despite a call that the trip be cancelled.    Senator Evans told parliament Mr. Keating would choose how  he  conveyed Australia's concerns during his talks with President  Suharto and senior Indonesian ministers.    [Begin Evans recording] It must be said without  qualification  that this is a very disappointing development indeed. In recent  times with the support or acceptance of this government  Indonesia has been making very rapid progress to a genuinely  free and open expression through a free media, reflecting in  that respect the rapidly growing openness which has been  developing in the country's economy and society more generally.  Yesterday's decision is in sharp contrast to that trend so far  as the media is concerned. We hope that it doesn't signal any  wider ranging impositions and that the magazines will, sooner  rather than later, be permitted to resume publication. [end  recording]</p>

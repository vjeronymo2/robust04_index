			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Commerce ministers from 125 countries started a  four-day meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, which will close with  the signing of the GATT. This document is over 20,000 pages  long and considered the most important commercial agreement in  history. Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche is representing  Mexico.    Moroccan Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed delivered a welcoming  speech to open the meeting, which will conclude Friday with the  signing of the final draft of the GATT. The crown prince  arrived at 1000 sharp, representing his father, Hassan II. More  than 120 representatives of GATT member countries arrived  simultaneously at the Marrakech Convention Center to participate  in the final meetings. The Mexican delegation was among them.    Speaking shortly before the plenum, Jaime Serra Puche,  Mexico's secretary of commerce and industrial development,  stressed important aspects of our times. He said that  reciprocal commercial opening and greater competition among  production plants [plantas] will prompt us to increase the  scales of production and to redistribute revenue margins. This  is how the Uruguay Round will promote the creation of new jobs  and increase the salaries of our workers, he added.    [Begin Serra recording] Mexico is convinced that the new  world commerce organization must focus on three main actions:    1. Deepening reciprocal commerce liberalization by  eliminating barriers and distortions that are still standing in  various productive sectors.    2. Updating and improving the various areas [disciplinas]  of the multilateral system of commerce to rid them of unilateral  measures and reverting protectionist trends.    3. Ensuring an appropriate interaction between the  competition policy and commercial measures to fight unfair  practices. [end recording]    Secretary Jaime Serra Puche also advocated respect for the  environment and protection of labor rights.</p>

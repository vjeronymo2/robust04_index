			<p>BFN     [Text] As of 26 May, the Havana Public Prosecutor's Office  has carried out joint operations with combined Interior Ministry  forces in five municipalities against 28 people identified as  being involved in the criminal actions contemplated in  Decree-Law 149 of the Council of State.    The operation against the so-called hoarders ranged from  raids on homes to arrests as necessary. The preliminary seizure  of goods included freezing bank accounts totaling 270,000 pesos  and confiscating $540, 15 automobiles, seven motorcycles of  diverse makes, three trucks, 500 animals, and 57 different  pieces of jewelry. The seizures also included several  properties, machines, tools, raw materials, fuel, and other  items. The authorities are currently investigating the origin  and suppliers of these items as well as conducting other related  police and judicial procedures.    During the fourth special session of the People's Government  in Havana, this station learned that legal action has been taken  against 100 cases of illegal sale and purchase of automobiles as  well as 100 cases on housing, which range from the illegal sale  and purchase of houses to fraudulent swaps.    Glenda Azoy, member of the provincial bureau of the Cuban  Communist Party in Havana, told reporters that this is not just  another temporary police program but a continuous offensive  against illegal actions and lack of respect for the law. We  will be strict and just in all cases, she said, but the measures  provided for by Decree-Law 149 are here to stay to benefit the  law and the interests of the Revolution.</p>

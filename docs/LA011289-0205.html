			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> EX-OFFICIALS ACCUSE PRO-ISRAEL LOBBY OF VOTE LAW VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> A group of prominent Americans filed a complaint today against 54 pro-Israel  lobbying and political action committees, charging them with violating federal  election laws.  </P> <P> Among the complainants are James E. Akins, formerly ambassador to Saudi Arabia;  George Ball, undersecretary of state in the Kennedy and Johnson  administrations; Paul Findley, a former Illinois congressman who contends he  was defeated in 1982 because of a campaign by the pro-Israeli lobby, and  Retired Adm. Robert J. Hanks, who headed the Navy's Middle East Task Force.  </P> <P> The petition to the Federal Election Commission focuses primarily on the  activities of an influential pro-Israel lobby called the American Israel Public  Affairs Committee. It contends that the lobby violated the law by failing to  register as a political action committee even though it allegedly targets  political candidates for support and contributes to their campaigns.  </P> <P> The complaint also charges that 53 pro-Israel political action committees made  excessive contributions to candidates in the 1984, 1986 and 1988 election  cycles.  </P></p>

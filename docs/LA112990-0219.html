			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: BELL GARDENS;  </P> <P> MORATORIUM EXTENDED UNTIL ZONING CODE IS REVISED  </P> <P> A moratorium limiting high-density developments such as multiunit apartments  has been extended in Bell Gardens until the City Council takes action on a  controversial plan to rezone the city.  </P> <P> The council voted to extend the moratorium for about 10 months to ensure that  developers do not build homes, apartments and businesses in areas of town where  future rezoning will prohibit such construction.  </P> <P> The council initially passed the moratorium in October after being deluged with  plans from developers who feared that the zoning changes would be adopted and  their plans scrapped. Last month, despite protests from residents and business  people, the Planning Commission gave its unanimous approval to the revised  zoning code. The plan now must go before the City Council.  </P> <P> If adopted by the council, about 3,000 properties would be rezoned in an  attempt to reduce density in the city and establish uniform commercial,  residential and industrial districts.  </P> <P> Some residents protested extension of the moratorium, describing the council's  move as a stall tactic. They urged the council to make a decision immediately  on the zoning change, and have warned that they plan to seek a referendum to  overturn any sweeping zoning changes approved by the council.  </P> <P> "Don't think that by dragging this out, you can wait us out," said Bell Gardens  resident Stanley Wantuch.  </P> <P> The council is expected to vote on the proposed zoning code early next year.  </P></p>

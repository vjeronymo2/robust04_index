			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Tories suffer crushing defeat: Major faces massive Euro-poll losses as Lib Dems triumph in Eastleigh Mr John Major's government was facing a mid-term electoral catastrophe early this morning after crashing to a humiliating third-place defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats in the Eastleigh by-election. The loss of the once-safe seat and a massive anti-government swing in four other by-elections raised the prospect of a performance in the European elections worse than even the Conservatives' most dire expectations. Initial projections raised the question whether the Tory representation in the Strasbourg assembly would fall from the present 32 seats to just a handful, an outcome which would re-ignite the threat to Mr Major's leadership. Labour and the Liberal Democrats, which treated the elections as a referendum on the prime minister's record, were both anticipating spectactular gains. As Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, sought to dismiss suggestions that Mr Major's premiership will be plunged into fresh crisis, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats overturned a Tory majority in Eastleigh of more than 17,000 at the 1992 general election. Completing a hat-trick of by-election victories over the past year, Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate secured a majority of 9,239 in the poll caused by the death earlier this year of Mr Stephen Milligan. The swing against the Conservatives was 21.5 per cent. Mr Stephen Reid, the Conservative candidate, was forced into a humiliating third place in a previously safe Tory seat after a vigorous campaign by Labour's Mrs Marilyn Birks. A massive protest vote against the government across the country was underlined by a similar collapse in the Conservative vote in four other by-elections in which Labour held on to previously safe seats. In Bradford South and Barking, a massive 21 per cent anti-government swing forced the Conservatives into third place behind the Liberal Democrats. Labour won comfortably also in Newham North East and Dagenham. But in all four seats there were extremely low turnouts. Mr David Butler, a leading psephologist and fellow of Nuffield College Oxford, said the by-election results were 'as devastating as they could be'. The Conservative vote was on average 23 per cent down on the 1992 general election. If replicated in the European elections when the results are announced on Sunday evening, the Eastleigh swing from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats was enough for them to win all the Strasbourg seats where they are the main challenger to the Conservatives. The swing from the Conservatives to Labour in the four other by-elections would guarantee a Labour win in every Conservative euro-seat where they are the main challenger. A low turnout in the European poll suggested that core Conservative voters had ignored last minute pleas from the prime minister to support his opposition to a centralised federal Europe. Early indications were that less than 40 per cent of the electorate had turned out. Sir Norman acknowledged early this morning that the government was heading for a serious defeat but insisted that Mr Major's position was secure. The prime minister, who took a high-profile personal role in the campaign, has repeatedly stressed he will fight any challenge to his leadership. But the return to Westminster early next week of Tory MPs is certain to fuel speculation about a challenge to the prime minister in the autumn. Exit surveys indicated that Conservative support in some areas had collapsed. A straw poll in Norfolk by the Eastern Daily Press suggested a 19 percentage points swing from the Tories to Labour. A straw poll in four West of England seats for Westcountry Television suggested a swing of about 18 points from the Conservatives to the two opposition parties. About two-thirds of the extra votes were going to the Liberal Democrats. However, election analysts warned that the polls were not based on scientific samples. The Conservatives had hoped that a late swing to the party could allow it to hold up to 20 seats. However the latest opinion poll, by Mori for The Times, indicated that the party could be left with as few as four seats. The poll gave the Conservatives 23 per cent of the vote, compared with 51 per cent for Labour, and 20 per cent for the Liberal Democrats.

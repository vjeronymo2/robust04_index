			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-CONVICT CHARGED IN ACCIDENTAL POLICE SHOOTING OF TODDLER  </P> <P> A convicted bank robber whose flight from officers allegedly led to the  accidental police shooting of a 10-month-old Anaheim girl was charged Friday  with the baby's wounding and ordered held without bail.  </P> <P> Steven Paul Harston's arraignment was continued for two weeks, but prosecutors  filed a criminal complaint charging him with kidnaping the  </P> <P> baby and her mother and assaulting the baby and the officer, who was identified  in court documents Friday as Leonard Rivera.  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Capt. Randall Gaston would only identify the officer as 36 years  old and a 15-year veteran of the Police Department. Gaston said this was the  first shooting of Rivera's law-enforcement career.  </P> <P> The officer declined through supervisors to be interviewed but was said to be  concerned for the baby's welfare. As is routine in shootings by officers,  Rivera is on paid leave and has seen the police psychiatrist, who will decide  when he is ready to return to duty.  </P> <P> The baby, Michelle Olmos, was released Thursday from the hospital with a  wounded buttock and is expected to heal with only the faintest of scars. She  was wounded once in the  </P> <P> right buttock as she sat strapped in the front passenger seat beside her  mother.  </P> <P> As Jody Olmos, 31, idled Wednesday morning in traffic on State College  Boulevard, a man climbed into her car, pointed a gun at her head and reportedly  said, "Drive, or I'll shoot you." Police say the gunman abandoned his rental  car and was fleeing officers who chased him for running a stop sign.  </P> <P> Rivera, a motorcycle officer, ordered the gunman to surrender. Police say the  gunman did not. Seeing the intruder pointing a semiautomatic handgun at Olmos  and then Rivera, the officer fired from 10 feet behind Olmos' Mercury, and two  shots shattered her rear windshield, authorities said. One slug lodged in a car  seat, the other pierced the passenger seat and struck the infant, who was in  front because she constantly climbed out of her safety seat.  </P> <P> The Olmos family criticized the officer for firing at the gunman when, they  said, he should have seen the child safety seat in the rear of the car. They  said it is frightening that Rivera could fire twice from "so close" and miss  his target.  </P> <P> But Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael W. Nunn said Friday that results  so far of his department's investigation of the shooting show that Rivera  "acted properly and according to procedure."  </P> <P> Gaston said the Anaheim Police Department's policy on use of deadly force holds  that an officer may use a gun to protect himself or others from what the  officer "reasonably believes is an imminent threat of death or serious bodily  injury." Such force is also considered justified in order to "prevent the  escape or arrest of a fleeing felon if the officer has reasonable cause to  believe the crime" caused serious harm to someone.  </P> <P> Rivera's actions, Gaston and Nunn said, were within those guidelines.  </P> <P> Gaston said there is a variety of hostage scenarios to which an officer might  react differently, depending on his position in relation to a suspect and his  ability to seek cover. Because the intruder pointed his gun at Rivera, police  said, he did not have that luxury.  </P> <P> "It is to our advantage not to rush the situation or create an immediate need  to use a gun," Gaston said. "However, there are some situations where an  officer is vulnerable and has to decide . . . 'Do I stand there and let them  drive off or try to shoot and stop them?'  </P> <P> "It's a millisecond of a decision," Gaston said, "and it's the longest  millisecond of your life."  </P> <P> On Friday, Harston, 24, was charged in Municipal Court in Fullerton with seven  felonies. They were one count each of evading arrest, being a felon in  possession of a gun, assault on an officer, assault with a firearm on an  officer, assault -- for the baby's shooting -- and two counts of kidnaping.  </P> <P> If convicted of the kidnaping charges alone, Harston, an unemployed drifter  with a history of drug use, could be sentenced to life in prison without the  possibility of parole, authorities said.  </P> <P> Because Harston violated his parole on a federal bank robbery conviction,  Municipal Judge Kazuharu Makino ordered him held without bail in Orange County  Jail pending his arraignment Sept. 29. He was assigned a public defender.  </P> <P> Nunn said he charged Harston with assaulting the child with a deadly weapon  because "the child got hurt as a result of his actions."  </P> <P> The shooting would never have occurred had Harston not threatened people with  his own gun after bolting from traffic officers Wednesday morning, Nunn said.  </P> <P> "If the guy had driven off with the mother and baby, everyone would be saying  he should have shot the guy," Nunn said. Rivera "did the best he could do. Any  way around it, that (officer) is going to lose. But the officer is not on trial  here. Mr. Harston is. And I would like to get him sent to jail for the rest of  his life."  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres (7): Aiming to be a stepping stone off Europe - The differences between two Channel Islands JERSEY, SAYS Mr Colin Powell, the island's economic adviser and top civil servant, is aiming to be 'a stepping stone off Europe for people worldwide to use'. Already a substantial and comparatively sophisticated financial centre, but one geared in primarily to the UK and to British expatriates around the world, Jersey is hoping to broaden its appeal, so as to become 'offshore Europe' rather than 'offshore UK'. Perched just off the coast of Normandy the island is certainly well-positioned, and already plays host to a good range of international financial institutions. But perhaps it needs to improve its linguistic skills and become more accommodating to Continental practices before it can fully assume a multinational role. Jersey's financial industry has been growing strongly for many years, although there is now a hint of a slowdown, as a reflection of the international economic recession. Bank deposits of Pounds 44.4bn at the end of 1990 (in some 60 licensed banking institutions) showed a rise of Pounds 4bn in the year, a satisfactory figure, though indicating a deceleration compared with the much more buoyant conditions of the late 1980s. Investment funds had a tough year, especially in the second half. From Pounds 6.7bn at the end of June the total assets of funds registered in the island dropped to Pounds 5.3bn in September, reflecting poor stock market conditions as well as a stagnation in the number of funds. In the final quarter the total value edged up to Pounds 5.6bn, however, and clearly will have surged forward in recent months in line with buoyant share prices worldwide. It is in this offshore funds sector that Jersey has felt competition from the two 'onshore/offshore' European Community centres in Luxembourg and Dublin. A few fund management groups have shifted funds to those locations, hoping to find it easier to market their investment products on the Continent. However, most of the fund groups have found their Luxembourg 'umbrella' funds to be disappointingly slow sellers. Jersey funds, in contrast, can only be sold through normal retail channels in EC member states by means of bilateral agreements. Only one such agreement has been concluded with the UK, and about 25 funds out of 170-odd can be sold on the UK mainland. An important business in Jersey, as in its rival Channel Island of Guernsey, is the management of offshore trusts. However, this received a sharp (though long expected) setback in the UK Budget on March 19 when UK taxes were slapped on new trusts set up by UK residents. However, the Jersey view is that the damage will be small. 'The loss of that business is marginal in its impact,' claims Mr Powell. 'The majority of trust management firms have non-UK oriented trust business anyway.' In fact, the government of Jersey has been forced into something of a reconsideration of the island's future development as an offshore centre in the light of the progress of the European Community towards a Single Market. At one stage the island's isolation from the EC - it has links, but is a non-member for most purposes - was viewed with a degree of anxiety. More recently, though, the potential of the 'Offshore Europe' role has been seen to be considerable. A comparatively well-developed legal and regulatory framework offers considerable advantages compared with, say, the upstart centres of the Mediterranean. At the same time, the limited physical capacity of the island, with a population of some 86,000, which it is determined to restrain, has caused concern. It is hard for new financial institutions to enter Jersey, although the government is anxious to deny suggestions that it is full up. The zero job growth policy is designed to reduce employment growth to nil by 1992, and yet Mr Powell insists that flexibility will be applied, and it is still possible for new companies to enter if they bring additional connections and skills to the island. Public relations advisers have been hired to create a more positive marketing formula, and Jersey will soon publish a Strategic Policy Report setting out five-year objectives. But no great departures are expected: relationships with the UK and the Continent are already regarded as satisfactory, and as providing the basis for future growth. The 'offshore Europe' role could get a boost soon from a deal with Japan allowing Jersey funds to be sold to retail investors in Japan. Already a large volume of Japanese institutional investment money enters Europe through Jersey, where it is cushioned from the hazards of mainland taxation. If Luxembourg and Dublin should ever lose their tax privileges, and succumb to the pressures for EC-wide investment income withholding taxes, the Channel Islands would be waiting to pick up large volumes of displaced financial business.</p>

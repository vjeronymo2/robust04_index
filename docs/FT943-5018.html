			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Burmah Castrol rises 16% - US activities advance 50% on lower crude prices and synthetic sales Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, increased interim pre-tax profits by 16 per cent but said it would be unable to repeat in the second half an exceptional performance by Castrol in the US. Pre-tax profits from Pounds 89.5m to Pounds 103.8m in the six months to June 30, and attributable profits climbed 15 per cent to Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 44m). The shares closed 14p lower at 891p. Mr Jonathan Fry, chief executive, said Castrol's US profits had risen by 50 per cent, thanks to increased sales, the move into profit of the new synthetic lubricant, Syntec, and a fall in the price of crude oil at the start of the period which had now been reversed. In lubricants as a whole, trading profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 86.6m (Pounds 70m). In Asia, there were strong performances from India, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam, while Australasia benefited from economic recovery. In Europe, although the industrial market showed some pick up, consumer demand remained subdued, notably in Germany, the UK and France. Latin America suffered from 'chaotic' trading conditions in Brazil. Chemicals also increased trading profits by 24 per cent, to Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 17.8m). Profits from Foseco Metallurgical Chemicals bounced back by 85 per cent, mainly because of the restructuring and rationalisation which has been completed in Europe and North America. The group said Sericol Printing Inks continued to power ahead, and adhesives also had a good first half. Coatings had a poor first quarter, although the second quarter was stronger. Fosroc Construction and Mining Chemicals suffered from difficult trading in Europe and a softening in key Middle Eastern markets. In fuels, trading profits fell to Pounds 8.5m from Pounds 13.5m. Competitive markets in the UK and Sweden combined with economic turmoil in Turkey to drive down volumes and profits. LNG Transportation was also down, to Pounds 3.2m from Pounds 7m, mainly because the previous period benefited from the inclusion of a provision release of Pounds 3.5m. Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman, said the group intended to pay up to a third of the year's total dividend as a Foreign Income Dividend, which would reduce the group's ongoing surplus Advance Corporation Tax problem. It declared an interim dividend of 10p, compared with 16.5p. Last year's payment had been increased in case the use of an enhanced scrip dividend was blocked by the Budget. Earnings per share increased by only 9.4 per cent, to 25.6p (23.4p), because of the greater number of shares in issue following last year's enhanced scrip scheme and the Pounds 32m acquisition of Tribol, a US lubricants specialist.

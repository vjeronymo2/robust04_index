			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] After a three-day session, the State Chamber  passed the 1994 budget last night. Some 407.6 billion Slovene  tolars are expected to accumulate in the state treasury, while  the budget deficit will reach 12.8 billion Slovene tolars, which  is 0.8 percent of the estimated GNP. The deficit will thus be a  good billion higher than anticipated and its increase is  primarily due to the additional funds for the maintenance of  local and regional highways. All other allocations of funds more  or less stayed within the proposed limits. [passage omitted]</p>

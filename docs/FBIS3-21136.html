The group developed a technique that uses a  photochemical reaction as a pretreatment during manufacturing to  untangle the carbon fibers, which enables uniform dispersion of  the fibers throughout the composite material. Uniform dispersion  is essential for increased strength. The group is aiming for  rapid practical application of this technique as a pretreatment  to achieve higher quality more easily and lower manufacturing  costs.    The developers are professor Akira Kojima and assistant  professor Ryoichi Akabane from Gumma School of Technology,  researchers from the Railway Technical Research Institute, and a  group led by professor Sugiro Otani, Faculty of Developmental  Engineering, Tokai University.    When CFRP and carbon fiber reinforced concrete (CFRC) are  manufactured, pretreatment is required to efficiently disperse  the carbon fibers in resin, etc. This new technique concerns a  pretreatment that neatly separates individual carbon fibers,  which are usually all tangled together.    In the past separation has been accomplished by oxidizing  the  surfaces of heated carbon fibers by electrolytic or chemical  methods to break the bonds between them. This joint research  group used a photochemical reaction instead for oxidation.    The new method involves applying a coating to the surfaces  of  the carbon fibers that releases activated oxygen when it is  exposed to light, and then exposing the fibers to sunlight. In  the sunlight, activated oxygen, which has a negative charge and  acts powerfully to break the links between carbon atoms, is  formed on the surfaces of the fibers, and the carbon fibers  neatly untangle and disperse.    Methylene blue was used in the experiments as a coating, and  after it was applied to a bundle of about 3000 carbon fibers,  they were exposed to sunlight. When researchers put the carbon  fibers in resin and measured the amount of dispersion (wetting  strength), it was about three times greater than before the  pretreatment. When researchers mixed the carbon fibers with  cement and formed CFRC, the strength was 1.6 times greater than  that of CFRC manufactured by past methods.    Professor Kojima says, ``This new technique requires no  special equipment and should be easy to implement right on the  assembly line.''    Composite materials are used in golf clubs and aircraft  because they are very strong and lightweight. If material costs  can be reduced because of this development, we can expect  composite materials to find a wider range of uses such as in  railway coaches and manufactured products in general.</p>

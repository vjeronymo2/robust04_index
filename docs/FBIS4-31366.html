			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vesna Tenjovic] </F>   [Excerpt] The supply of gasoline will improve, but the  prices of derivatives will not decrease for the time being, said  Zivko Soklovacki, director of the Public Liaison Office of the  Serbian Oil Industry [Naftna Industrija Srbije -- NIS]. Vesna  Tenjovic reports.    [Begin recording] Owing to great pressure, it is diesel that  is mostly produced at the moment. The production is progressing  according to plan and it should remain at last year's level.  Rationalization within the oil industry has led to a decrease in  expenses, which has created conditions for a 4.5 percent  decrease in prices. However, owing to problems that arose in  the earlier period, NIS believes that the price of derivatives  should not be decreased immediately, but rather after the  company has been consolidated. A decrease in taxes would also  create leeway for decreasing prices. NIS is also preparing a  program of rationalization and reorganization of the company,  but the changes probably will not be great. [passage omitted]  [end recording]</p>

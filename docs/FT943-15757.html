			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany plans second banana quota challenge German economics minister Mr Guenter Rexrodt said yesterday that Germany would launch a second European Court case over new European Union banana import quotas, which it claims unfairly disadvantage its traditional Latin American suppliers, reports Reuters from Bonn. '(The German government) will ask the European Court to review the legality of the new export quota regime,' a statement from Mr Rexrodt's ministry said. 'I stick to my view that the export quota agreement infringes aspects of EU and Gatt law,' Mr Rexrodt added. The court's Advocate General has already recommended in an official opinion rejection of a German case already running. The final judgment on that first case is due on October 6. A ministry official said the second case would contend that the quota decision was invalid because it had not been brought before the EU's Council of Ministers. Germany says that the EU banana import rules, which came into force last July, are biased in favour of former EU colonies in the African, Caribbean and Pacific group. The rules allocate a 30 per cent share of the EU market to ACP producers and limit imports from Latin America, often called 'dollar bananas' because many of the plantations are owned by US companies. Germany claims the regulations give British and French importers with traditional links to ACP countries an unfair advantage. It says they have prompted a big rise in the price of bananas in Germany, causing sales to drop by 25 per cent. Mr Rexrodt said jobs in German ports and in the producer countries were being endangered by the quota system. 'The absurdity of the regime can be seen in the fact that a support system for ACP bananas has been passed to counter the sealing-off of the EU market, which has already taken place,' he said. He added that it was doubtful that ACP producers were even in a position to fulfil their quotas.</p>

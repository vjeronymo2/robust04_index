			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRUG KINGS THREATEN COLOMBIAN VIOLENCE  </P> <P> Colombia's drug barons stated Friday that they would step up their war against  political and industrial leaders and said their escalation was prompted by the  torture and murder of their colleagues.  </P> <P> The drug traffickers, known as Extraditables because they are wanted in the  United States, said fighting the government's policy of extradition was no  longer their main concern.  </P> <P> "Our principal motive for war will be the torture, murder and disappearance of  our colleagues," they said in a statement.  </P> <P> Referring to the gunning down of at least 14 police officers in the cocaine  capital of Medellin this week, the drug barons said they would order the  suspension of executions of police who had never taken part in torture.  </P></p>

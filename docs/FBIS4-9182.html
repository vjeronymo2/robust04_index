			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Professionalization Is Beginning"] </F>   [Text] Presov--Defense Minister Pavol Kanis visited the  14th Mechanized Division in Presov yesterday. He met with its  commander, Colonel Jan Cmilansky, and with the Division's corps  of commanders. During their discussion, he briefed them on the  current situation in the Slovak Army. The defense minister  said, among other things, that the number of personnel in our  Army should be reduced to 46,667 by November 1995, in accordance  with the Vienna Agreements. "For this reason, procedures have  to be adopted to ensure that the state's defense capability is  not weakened. This is also necessary because the Army has  already been reduced by 32 percent due to its division following  the breakup of Czechoslovakia." At a meeting with reporters,  Kanis said, in connection with the Army's professionalization,  that "preparations are already under way in this regard.  Professionalization is proceeding in the two mechanized  battalions in Bratislava, and it will be enough to  professionalize 390 noncommissioned officer posts in order to  make a significant positive change."</p>

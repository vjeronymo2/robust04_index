			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLE LIFE: GREETING CARDS PUT NEW STAMP ON DATING RITUAL  </P> <P> Situation One: You were under the impression that your blind date had as much  fun as you did. But 2 weeks have passed and you haven't heard a peep out of  him. What's a woman to do?  </P> <P> Solution: Send him a card, perhaps the one that says, "1,387 hours, 22 seconds.  Average length of time a woman waits for a man to call. . . . Time's up."  (Carolyn Bean Cards.)  </P> <P> Situation Two: You and your best friend recently had a no-good-men  conversation, which she immediately followed up with an appropriate card. So  now you owe her one. How can you outdo her?  </P> <P> Solution: Go to a Hallmark shop, and find the card that says, "We shouldn't  worry about finding a man. There are lots of men out there. They're married,  lunatics and losers, sure, but they're out there."  </P> <P> And so on, ad infinitum.  </P> <P> In the past few years, there has been a proliferation of such greeting cards  aimed at the singles market. Commonly found in the "Fun and Love" section at  gift shops, the humorous cards address every aspect of single life -- for  better or worse.  </P> <P> There are post-date cards, love-hate cards, losing-weight cards. There are  congratulations-on-your-divorce cards and sorry-your-dumb-boyfriend-dumped-you  cards. There are cards too sweet for words and cards too dirty for mention.  </P> <P> "We have cards for all the different stages of dating -- first date, casual  flirtation, longstanding relationships," Hallmark spokeswoman Barbara Miller  said. "They are one of our fastest-growing areas."  </P> <P> Paper Moon Graphics, the Los Angeles-based manufacturer that rocketed into  orbit 12 years ago, sells as many "Fun and Love" cards as it does birthday  cards. "In the past 3 years, our relationship cards have had phenomenal  success," said Vivian Lipman, national sales manager for Paper Moon.  </P> <P> Lipman attributed the genre's upward mobility to relationship-confused yuppies.  "So many men have the Peter Pan syndrome (i.e., fear of commitment) that it has  become women's little joke," she said.  </P> <P> Male-bashing is definitely hot in card land. "Quick: What's the difference?"  asks a Hallmark witticism displaying a rock vs. a man on its cover. Answer:  "Right, the rock is slightly more sensitive (also a better listener)."  </P> <P> Larry Templeman, president of Southern California-based Scott Cards  (distributed by Recycled Paper Products), gave two reasons for the popularity  of male-bashing.  </P> <P> First, women buy 85% to 90% of all greeting cards. "It's a female-dominated  market," Templeman said.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Templeman added, "all those male-bashing books of the past 10  years" have fanned the fire.  </P> <P> "There's a double standard," he said. "Some of the things you can get away with  saying about men would be viewed as sexist if said about women.  </P> <P> "But it's all in fun; I don't think men take this stuff too seriously."  </P> <P> Relationship themes have been "revolutionary rather than evolutionary," said  Dennis Chupa, executive director of everyday products for American Greeting.  "They emerge almost spontaneously -- seemingly overnight," he said.  </P> <P> Divorce cards did not fare well for American Greeting until they recently  gained a sense of humor: "Let's face it: Your prince turned out to be a frog."  </P> <P> "Still, divorce cards are tricky, no matter how they're approached," Chupa  said. "You have to know how the person is handling their divorce before you can  send them a joke about it."  </P> <P> San Francisco-based Carolyn Bean Cards offers this consolation: "Your spouse  was a louse. Be sure you get the house."  </P> <P> A lot of "Fun and Love" cards actually deal with love -- or, at least, like.  Many do so in a risque manner:  </P> <P> * "The moment our eyes met, the rest of me wanted to get acquainted."  (Carlton.)  </P> <P> * "I've had it with you. And boy was it great." (Paper Moon.)  </P> <P> * "Wanna cuddle? Or whatever." (Scott Cards.)  </P> <P> * "You make me feel like a kid again. Wanna sleep over?" (Hallmark.)  </P> <P> That last one is about as suggestive as Hallmark gets, but other manufacturers  push the limits. "Some of the most conservative-looking people come in here and  buy cards with four-letter words," said Sandra Small, manager of Mr. G's  Expressions card shop in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Although Hallmark's 3-year-old Shoebox Cards division sprinkles  double-entendres throughout its line of cards, the company still steers clear  of strong language.  </P> <P> "It's a hard call," spokeswoman Miller admitted. "Our overriding concern is  that customers consider our cards in good taste. Yet we don't want to seem  old-fashioned; we want to be timely and to reflect contemporary society."  </P> <P> Many "Fun and Love" cards reflect the issues singles are facing in contemporary  society.  </P> <P> Relationship befuddlement: "If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right.  But if loving you is right, I don't want to be wrong, either. I'm so confused."  (Hallmark.)  </P> <P> Safe sex: "So it's our first date. How does dinner, a movie and a blood test  sound?" (Paper Moon.)  </P> <P> Birth control: One dog to another -- "Jowles, I hate to spoil the romantic  mood, but have you been fixed?" (Paper Moon.)  </P> <P> Fear of scaring off a love interest: "Please don't take this as a sign of  weakness, but I miss you." (Scott Cards.)  </P> <P> Noncommittal communication: "I want to tell you how I really feel. I really  feel fine, thanks." (Recycled Paper.)  </P> <P> Unrequited love: "I'm so miserable without you.. . . . It's almost like having  you here." And, "Thinking of you. . . . Wish you would change." (Paper Moon.)  </P> <P> But most "Fun and Love" cards are on the lighter side.  </P> <P> Mitch Zack, manager of Krazy Kards store in Santa Ana, summed them up this way:  "They get the message across without saying, 'I want to have your children.' "  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Three Yorkshire pits face closure Frickley Colliery (above) one of three South Yorkshire pits facing closure. British Coal yesterday told unions that the amount of Yorkshire coal burnt at power stations would be 3.5m tonnes less than expected this year. The company said it wanted further talks on Frickley, Hatfield and Bentley, starting on Friday with Frickley. Meetings on Bentley and Hatfield will follow on Tuesday and Friday next week. The announcement was made at the end of a two-and-a-half-hour meeting between management and unions at Allerton Bywater, West Yorkshire, at which all 17 pits in the northern group were discussed. British Coal, which operates 30 pits, started pre-privatisation closures last week by announcing the shutdown of Calverton, Nottinghamshire. Bentley employs 450 men, Frickley 740 and Hatfield 260. Hatfield lost Pounds 8.3m in the six months to the end of September and Frickley Pounds 1.8m.</p>

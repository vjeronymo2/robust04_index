			<p>BFN     [Text] Hizballah has denied that al-Fajr Television  violated the ban on newscasts and political programs. The  denial said: As a clarification to reports published by some  news media on 11 May 1994, a Hizballah information source has  stressed that the newscast transmitted by al-Fajr Television in  al-Biqa' was an economic, cultural, and social newscast and  cannot be considered a violation of the decision banning  newscasts and political programs.</p>

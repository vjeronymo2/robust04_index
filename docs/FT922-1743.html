			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Insurers curb independents - Commission is being paid even if unwanted INSURANCE companies are blocking the way for fee-charging independent advice by paying commission to intermediaries even if they do not want it. A survey published this week by London adviser Blyth McKenna showed that only two life offices out of 28 - Eagle Star and Scottish Widows - offered total flexibility by allowing full or partial surrender of both initial and renewal commission on endowment policies. Half the companies contacted had no facilities at all for commission sacrifice - come what may, they will pay it. Intermediaries can always pass the commission they receive straight to their customers. But if this happens, the customer has to pay income tax on the refunded commission, as it was meant originally as income for the intermediary. In any case, it would be more appropriate to use the money to enhance the investment; if the investor is prepared to part with it, it might as well be used to invest for profit in a relatively tax-efficient way. The companies which did not offer any opportunity to enhance with-profits policies by re-investing commission were National Mutual, Provident Mutual, Scottish Equitable, Commercial Union, General Accident, Guardian Royal Exchange, Royal Life and Scottish Mutual. For unit-linked policies, the companies which would not allow any rebate were Scottish Amicable, Scottish Equitable, Abbey Life, Albany Life, Allied Dunbar, Commercial Union, General Accident, the Life Association of Scotland, Royal Life, Skandia Life and Sun Alliance. Most of these offices pointed out that pension policies were much more flexible, typically with a range of commission re-investment options. Endowments remain inflexible. The insurers' replies to Blyth McKenna show a wide range of attitudes. Standard Life sent a seven-page letter detailing the effects of re-investing commission, while Scottish Life provided five pages of notes on how returns could be increased by giving up all or part of a commission. Others were less helpful. Allied Dunbar said: 'You will appreciate that as we receive very few requests to provide this facility, we are unable to comply with your request at this moment in time.' Provident Mutual explained its approach by saying: 'This, I suspect, arises from the fact that there has in the past been little or no demand for such contracts from the independent intermediary market.' Re-investing commission can make a big difference - for example, Clerical Medical increases the sum assured on a 25-year policy by 7 per cent if the adviser gives up all his initial commission. There will, of course, be a fee to pay on top, but enhancement is likely to be better - over 25 years, the increased sum within the insurance policy has a good chance of snow-balling into a significant sum. Ian McKenna, of Blyth McKenna, says: 'Many independents are keen to see us move quickly away from the commission system. I believe we are ready. It is the insurers who are standing in the way.' Not all brokers are as happy about fee-charging advice as he is. But his argument that insurers should be forced to offer intermediaries the opportunity to waive their commission has some merit, as it would remove one of the greatest obstacles to a system of fee-charging independent advice in the UK. James Clancy, a fee-charging adviser based in Northumberland, also suggests that advisers should lobby with insurance companies for more flexibility. Ultimately, the insurers' responses suggest that more consumers asking to pay by fee could also have a big impact.</p>

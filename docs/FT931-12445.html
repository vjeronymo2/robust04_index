			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Russia may shift stance on Iraq RUSSIAN Vice President Alexander Rutskoi was quoted as saying yesterday that Moscow was ready to use its veto power in the United Nations Security Council to halt 'ill-conceived' US attacks on Iraq, AP reports from Moscow. His criticism was among the harshest yet by a Russian leader and was at odds with the line taken by President Boris Yeltsin. The vice president has often disagreed with Mr Yeltsin, and his comments reflected hard-line pressure on the president to oppose the US actions. The United Nations must 'not allow the US to act in this way on its own will,' Mr Rutskoi told the Interfax news agency. Russia was prepared to use its 'possibilities' as a veto-wielding member of the Security Council to prevent further raids. ' I am against the tactics of force against Iraq being employed by the United States,' the vice president told Interfax. Several Russian officials and lawmakers stepped up their criticism of the US raids following an attack on Baghdad this month. The Foreign Ministry later demanded a UN review of the US actions. Mr Rutskoi criticised the 'disproportionate and sometimes ill-conceived deployment of the US military.' He accused the US of claiming UN permission for the raids while acting almost unilaterally. Armed Iraqis have crossed the border three times over the past week to rob Kuwaiti farmers and their Asian employees, Sheik Ahmed al-Hamoud al-Sabah, Kuwait's interior minister, said yesterday. He said he believed the intruders were Iraqi security police dressed in civilian clothes. They stole money, watches and television sets, he said. Nevertheless, the minister noted that security had improved markedly since January 17, when Iraq removed six police posts from land ceded to Kuwait under a new border demarcated by the United Nations last year. 'But still we have incidents, especially shooting at night,' said Sheik Ahmed. There have been numerous border incidents involving smugglers of sheep, whisky and guns since the end of the Gulf war nearly two years ago. Both the minister and western officials said agricultural projects along the border were most likely to be the flashpoint for future clashes between Iraq and Kuwait. About 50 Iraqi farmers must move onto Kuwaiti soil to harvest their crops - mostly tomatoes, along with onions and garlic, officials said.</p>

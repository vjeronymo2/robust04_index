			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] is also  assessing the chances of the second round of the election and  hopes that in three weeks' time it will be able to overtake the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. Agnes Pap reports:    [Pap] The Smallholders are satisfied with the first round of  the elections and are expecting the position of the parties in  third and fourth place to change on 29 May, in other words that  the FKGP will overtake the MDF and will be one of those to stand  on the podium, [FKGP Chairman] Jozsef Torgyan said.    The party chairman stressed: They will in any event conduct  politics in opposition. There can be no question of joining an  eventual government made up of the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and such a  government is possible, in his opinion. The FKGP does not want  to conclude an all-embracing election alliance with any party  for the second round, he said, recalling the bad experiences of  the second round of the 1990 elections.    However, Jozsef Torgyan did not exclude the possibility of  concluding one-off agreements with the parties on the national  side, or that they might step back in favor of one another.    Mrs. G. Nagy, nee Agnes Maczo [FKGP deputy chairwoman], said  she can imagine this at most in connection with the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] because, she stressed, there is  no reason to change the existing decisive opposition approach to  politicizing with the MDF.

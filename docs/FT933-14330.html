			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Hong Kong reserves at Dollars 35bn Hong Kong's foreign currency reserves rose by Dollars 6bn to Dollars 35.2bn (Pounds 23.7bn) at the end of 1992, Mr Hamish Macleod, the colony's financial secretary said yesterday, Simon Holberton writes from Hong Kong. At the end of last year Hong Kong had the ninth largest stock of foreign currency reserves. Taiwan's reserves were USDollars 83bn, while China's - excluding the external assets of Bank of China - were about USDollars 20bn. Hong Kong disclosed its external position for the first time a year ago. The colony's reserves are managed by the newly created Monetary Authority - a central bank in all but name. The Authority is responsible for maintaining the Hong Kong dollar's fixed link with the dollar - at HKDollars 7.8 - and regulates the colony's banking system and money market. The development of the money market is one of the Authority's prime aims. In 1992 the stock of outstanding short-term money market instruments rose to HKDollars 19.3bn from HKDollars 13.6bn in 1992.</p>

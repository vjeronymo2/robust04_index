			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Husni Mubarak at al-Azhar University in </F> Cairo on 8 March--live]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. The grand imam of al-Azhar, venerable ulemas,  brothers and sisters, dear sons: Feelings of veneration and  devotion engulf all of us at this meeting on this blessed night,  as we derive the noble morals and deep lessons on the occasion  marking the night when the skies inspired the Prophet, God's  peace and blessings be upon him. Yes, this is the occasion when  the holy inspiration manifested itself to the Prophet on the  night the Koran was revealed--a night holier than 1,000 months.  Our celebration of this occasion, which in our hearts and minds  is associated with the greatest divine verses, is worthy of  inspiring us with the best lessons and greatest preachings. How  true God's words are in His holy book: "But teach thy message  for teaching benefits the believers." [Koranic verse]    We have the most noble potentials, with which we mobilize  ourselves, and the best lessons, with which we train our minds,  while reliving this glorious commemoration; it is for us to see  these things as the Creator wanted us to see them through his  holy Koran--as guidance and mercy for all people. We should  turn it into an appropriate annual occasion, at which we pause  to review the state of the nation. We hold ourselves  accountable before others. We read our files and record of  achievements before they are read to us out of our desire to  rectify our steps, correct our trends, and work on overcoming  the obstacles before us. This should take place on the basis of  the noble Islamic values and correct Islamic morality that we  acquire from the wise teachings God sent us in the form of a  book which, without the shadow of a doubt, is guidance for the  devout and a blessed message from the skies to the earth to  light the path of progress and prosperity for all mankind.    The Koran is the lighthouse leading to the haven of security  and the shore of salvation for those who are oppressed and  tossed around by the storms of disaster. This has been  confirmed by historic developments throughout the ages when the  Muslims were guided by its tolerant values and noble principles.  They progressed, developed, and advanced as advocates of  justice and goodwill until the light of Islam and its teachings  dawned on the most important parts of the world.    The Koran brought the Arabs out of darkness and ignorance  into the realm of knowledge and civilization. It turned them  from divided tribes and unrighteous paganism into a united and  monotheist nation. It uplifted them from conflicts and  divisions to the realms of accord, harmony, compassion, and  peace. Islam then spread East and West and its minarets and  banners rose everywhere. This clear victory was achieved thanks  to the Koran's immortal humanitarian and civilized values, which  Islam added to man's civilization. The most significant of  these values are those of freedom, tolerance, equality, justice,  fraternity, cooperation, love, and peace. Islam acknowledges  the value of useful knowledge and appreciates didactic  literature and sublime art. It exalts the value of serious  effort and considers straightforward ethics as a basic part of  religion and even the main goal of religiosity.    A look at the affairs of the Muslim people today fills us  with pain, despite the successes achieved by our Muslim people  in many areas and the accomplishments attained due to the  efforts of faithful leaders, the sacrifices of our martyrs, and  the endeavors of good citizens. A look at the affairs of our  people and reflection on our conditions would bring sorrow to  our souls, agony to our hearts, and would puzzle our intellect.  What pains us in our people's situation today are those  negative phenomena that are completely alien to our nature and  at odds with the tenets of our God-given faith. Among these  phenomena are:    First, ravaging conflicts;    Second, disabling backwardness;    Third, disrupting discord, destructive terrorism, fanatic  extremism, rampant deviation, and misguided doctrines.    Brothers and sisters, regrettably, we can see divisive  conflicts in more than one place in the Islamic world. These  conflicts take many and varied forms, ranging from tribal power  struggles and ideological power struggles to ethnic power  struggles aimed at domination. They sometimes take the form of  material conflicts to satisfy ambitions. I don't want to  specify these areas of conflict or name the leaders or rival  factions or say anything that might be considered interference  in others' affairs. But I would like to say with clarity and  conviction that these conflicts have nothing to do with our  religion. No way do they serve the interests of our nation.  The impact of these conflicts is evidently destructive,  disunites our nation, undermines our force, and offends the  image of Islam. They cause the death of many innocent people,  bloodshed, waste our wealth, and destroy our establishments.  The consequences of these conflicts will weaken and exhaust our  nation and drown it in misery and wretchedness and threaten it,  God forbid, with annihilation.    Strange that this struggle is taking place in several  places in the Islamic world and is affecting and threatening us,  despite the Koran's appeal for solidarity, call for  collaboration, and prohibition of conflict and struggle. How  great are the almighty's words: "And hold fast, all together,  by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be not divided  among yourselves." And his words: "And fall into no disputes,  lest ye lose heart and your power depart."    The disabling backwardness has many forms in the life of our  nation and different forms among the people. There is  scientific backwardness, which has made the nation's illiteracy  rate among the highest in the world. There is cultural  backwardness, which has led to a lack of awareness among many  people regarding the facts and changes of the age and has led to  an unwarranted conflict between adherence to origins and keeping  abreast of modern developments or between adherence to the  teachings of religion and expressing views on temporal affairs  or even unjustly claiming that thought, modernization, and  development are contrary to religion.    There is also material backwardness, which has made many  members of our nation importers, not producers or innovators,  and deprived them of having their own means and applications  appropriate for their conditions, the nature of their resources,  and their manpower requirements. Puzzling is that all this  appears in numerous places in our nation, although the Koran has  urged the faithful to manage their own affairs and manage the  creatures of the earth, and seek progress and the means for  material, moral, and spiritual strength. The Koran also orders  them to strive and work in every field of life, in building, in  developing the universe, and in seeking education and knowledge.  We must strive for scientific progress according to the  almighty God's words: "Are those equal, those who know and  those who do not know?" The almighty's words are: "Those truly  fear God among his servants who have knowledge."    The Koran is full of testimonial verses calling for  advancing  thought and elevating sentiments and advocating innovation and  the subjugation of nature to the use of mankind. How numerous  are the Koranic verses that advocate the need to use our brains,  correct the view, develop the mind, elevate the sentiments by  walking through the land, following the news of nations, taking  lessons from history, and contemplating the beauties of  existence, the magnificence of creation, and the wonders of the  universe.    We should remember that the first words revealed by God on  that blessed night and the first words with which the heavens  addressed the earth in those immortal moments were those sacred  verses that open the eyes to the magnificence of the creation  and call for knowledge and education. They, at the same time,  glorify the most important tool for recording sciences,  encyclopedias, and cultures. These sacred verses are the  almighty's words: "Proclaim (or read) in the name of thy lord  and cherisher, who created--created man out of a (mere) clot of  congealed blood. Proclaim! And thy lord is most bountiful, he  who taught (the use of) the pen--taught man that which he knew  not."    Islam has fought backwardness in all its forms and persisted  in urging the Muslims to take their place at the front. But we  see among the negative phenomena in our nation today this  disabling backwardness that halts the movement of the nation and  stands between it and the glory and advancement it deserves.    As for the destructive terror, it is wreaking havoc in more  than one area on the Islamic scene. Its conduct is wicked,  criminal, aggressive, and shows disregard for human life. Its  objectives are criminal. Its plans are bloody. Despite that,  it masquerades in religious attire, hides behind a false claim  of reform, and adopts deceptively attractive slogans. At the  best of times, these slogans are words of truth but their  objective is evil and misleading. But terrorism twists and  deflects these slogans and takes them out of context to serve  its criminal objectives and support its bloody plans. This is  hypocrisy and those who practice it are the hypocrites whom God  has condemned to eternal fire because they rephrase God's words  and do what they do not state.    What does religion have to do with the killing of innocent  people? Where do reform and piety stand with respect to  spreading panic and bloodshed? Where is the justice in shaking  stability, fighting a war against people's livelihood, and  hampering progress and prosperity? Where is the honesty and  piety in behavior that contradicts all the teachings dictated by  the pure Koranic texts and the noble prophetic traditions such  as the sanctity of human life and preserving the rights of  mankind to freedom?    Where are the texts that sanction human bloodshed because  they object to an individual's opinion or reject his ideas? Did  not the almighty God say in precise verses: "Invite all to the  way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue  with them in ways that are best and most gracious. For thy lord  knoweth best who have strayed from his path and who receive  guidance." Where are the texts that sanction the bloodshed of  innocent people, including those people who have nothing to do  with a specific opinion or way of thinking?    Dear brothers and sisters, the holy Koran, which the  hypocrites and terrorists use as their slogan and that has  nothing to do with them, has stipulated: "If any one slew a  person--unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the  land--it would be as if he slew the whole people." [Koranic  verse]    The terrorists claim the prophet of great Islam is their  guide, while he rejects them and disassociates himself from them  and has decreed that the sanctity of a Muslim's blood is greater  to God than the sanctity of the Kaaba. He banned an individual  from terrorizing his brother, even by merely directing a weapon  at him or something that looks like a weapon and that frightens  him. Terrorists and hypocrites add to their crimes of  terrorizing, killing, and attacking innocent people one more  crime: They explain religion for the sake of their vile  objectives and exploit its texts for their destructive  practices. They are lying to God and his prophet. They are  oppressing God's people. "And soon will the unjust assailants  know what vicissitudes their affairs will take." [Koranic  verse] [applause]    As for extremism, ladies and gentlemen, we see mental  extremism and arrested behavior in many stances diverting some  people away from moderation, which is the course of our religion  and the call of our Koran. This extremism and stagnation cause  negative behavior among those who adopt such a course, thus  pushing them to fight others and misjudge moderates. It leads  them to seclusion and isolation to the extent of secession.  This also leads them to making enemies with society at times  and to desecrating and attacking it at other times.    Thus, hate driven by extremism becomes terrorism when it  turns from a negative political stance into criminal and  aggressive behavior. Extremism deflects Islamic behavior from  the correct course because it obstructs social harmony, mental  peace, and moderation. It leads to isolation and alienation and  pushes individuals to resort to terrorism and to join bloody  criminals and outlaws who have reneged on society and who attack  peaceful citizens. These reneging extremists have distorted the  image of Muslims. Many non-Muslims now judge Islam unfairly  through the behavior of these extremists who belong to the  nation of Islam.    It is painful that this happens while virtues are at the  core  of Islam. The most important aim of worship in Islam is to  teach Muslims moral values and good behavior. The Koranic  verses and the prophet's sayings are replete with calls for  adherence to sublime moral values and virtuous behavior.    Brothers and sisters, these negative factors to which I have  referred have obstructed the march of our nation, weakened it,  and distorted its image. They have encouraged others to prey on  this nation and have doubled the number of its enemies. As a  result, some blatant forces have belittled some of the sons of  our nation, cruelly torturing them, killing them brutally, and  attacking their sanctities with barbarism. Because of these  negative factors that have distorted the nation's image and  increased the enemies of its religion some people have called  for fighting this nation and eliminating it. Our nation cannot  restore its prestige, retake its position, or catch up with the  new world unless it gets rid of everything that obstructs its  march, weakens it strength, and distorts its image.    The new world is the world of the strong who are respected  by  everyone, whose words are heard, and whose rights are  safeguarded. The new world is the world of detente and unity,  not of division and conflict. The new world, brothers and  sisters, is the world of progress and development, not the world  of backwardness and stagnation. The new world is that of  integration and interaction, the exchange of interests, and  cooperation for a better future, not of contradictions and  contrasts and the depletion of wealth and resources. The new  world is supposed to be the world of security, stability, and  peace, not of disturbances, threats, intimidation, and  bloodshed. The new world must be a world of openness,  tolerance, and brotherhood, not a world torn asunder by  fanaticism and extremism. The new world must be one of human  values and good behavior, not of lawlessness, deviation, chaos,  and barbarism. All these values preached by the new world have  been preached by Islam and Prophet Muhammad since the holy  inspiration descended on him on Laylat al-Qadr [night of the  revelation of the Koran] and throughout his mission, which he  performed perfectly until he died and joined his God.    If we want to correct our march and eschew our negative  aspects, we have the verses of the holy Koran and the teachings  of our great prophet to guide us so that we may forge ahead on  the path of progress instead of remaining backward and stagnant.  We can strive to achieve integration and cooperation instead of  continuing with our contradictions and slackness. We must also  promote a spirit of moderation in line with Islam's course and  tolerance. We must first make morality and ethics the basis of  our life, the framework of our activities, and the light of our  behavior so that our way of life will be set right and so that  our image will be corrected in others' eyes. We will thus be  worthy of the Koranic verse: "Ye are the best of peoples,  evolved for mankind." [Koranic verse]    Grand Imam and Rector of al-Azhar Mosque, O venerable ulema,  brothers and sisters, you may agree with me that the best  celebration of this blessed night lies in learning a useful  lesson in its rich significance for our situation and our path.  You may agree with me that our need for this lesson and  significance is more pressing now than ever. Our nation,  regrettably, is suffering from numerous negative aspects. Part  of our nation is suffering from painful types of aggression and  violation. These negative aspects and violations recently took  a form that agonizes the hearts of the zealots and sincere  people. Remedying these negative aspects and warding off  violations lies, as I have often said, in following the values  of the holy Koran and the example of our great prophet, may  God's peace and prayers be upon him.    On this blessed night and from the grounds of the al-Azhar  Mosque, I appeal to my brothers, sons of the Islamic nation  everywhere, each to play a role in reviving his nation as much  as he can. I appeal to everyone to face up to his duty and  responsibility. We are all shepherds and every shepherd is  responsible for his community. The basis of reviving the nation  lies in adherence to its holy Koran, the principles of its  prophet, and the teachings of its religion. Foremost among  these values, principles, and teachings are cohesion and  adherence to God's path in a way that rejects divisive conflicts  and that rises and achieves progress and rejects disabling  backwardness. They should seek integration and cooperation so  as to end the divisive contradictions. They should seek to  establish security and consolidate stability and finish off  destructive terrorism. They should spread a spirit of  moderation and tolerance to prevent rigid extremism. And last  but not least, they should strengthen straightforward ethics and  honest behavior to prevent rampant deviation. Brothers and  sisters, let us begin today, not tomorrow, to perform our duty  in adhering to these immortal humanitarian Islamic values that  will ensure our salvation. Let us work with the utmost  determination to eschew our negative aspects and achieve our  renaissance. This is a selfless call that I address for the  sake of God and the interest of my nation. I hope my brothers  will heed this call. All I want is to create reform. God  grants success. May God's peace and blessings be upon you.  [applause]</p>

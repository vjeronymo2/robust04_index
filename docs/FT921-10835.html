			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Citizen's Charter schemes questioned COMPENSATION schemes in the public services are failing to improve the quality of those services, according to the Consumers' Association. Commenting today on the schemes, an important part of the prime minister's Citizen's Charter, the association says: 'A season ticket discount for trains which do not turn up on time or cash in the consumer's pocket for a day without a telephone is welcome, but it is no guarantee of significant improvements in BR or BT services.' It says more needs to be done to incorporate performance criteria into decisions about levels of charges. Ms Sue Bloomfield, a senior policy officer with the association, says in Consumer Policy Review, one of its journals, that compensation schemes need to be simple, flexible and accessible. They should cover a wide and appropriate range of service aspects, set stretching standards and be well publicised. Existing schemes fail to meet these criteria, however: BT's scheme covers only two aspects of telephone service - keeping installation appointments and restoring service within certain deadlines. The scheme introduced by the Office of Water Services for water companies could leave customers unexpectedly without water for 72 hours. Compensation from regional electricity companies normally offers a reduction in bills rather than cash in hand, which many aggrieved consumers would prefer. Most schemes offer fixed compensation payments, irrespective of the level of inconvenience suffered. Many schemes - including those for the water companies and BT - require a claim from the customer, sometimes in a set period and in writing. Ms Bloomfield says there is no clear-cut evidence that schemes already in operation have achieved anything in practice. Meanwhile the association has criticised the practice of adding service charges to restaurant bills as 'inappropriate and unjustified'. It is to meet officials from the Department of Trade and Industry today to argue for a ban on the practice. The Restaurateurs' Association of Great Britain, representing about 500 leading establishments, is also expected to argue at the meeting for a move to all-in prices.</p>

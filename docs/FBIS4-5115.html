			<p>BFN     [Text] The French government has recently included South  Korea in a list of countries that can export marine products to  France, the Foreign Ministry said yesterday. Cheap imported  maritime products have been gobbling up the French market,  prompting Paris to draw up a list of a handful of countries  outside the European Union that can continue selling such goods.  Only five countries, including Argentina and Canada, had been  put on the list publicized in February.    Seoul had an existing agreement with France on fisheries  exports effective until January next year but was excluded from  the list, the ministry said. The French government belatedly  added eight more countries, including South Korea, Thailand and  Singapore, to the list carried in its gazette March 26, it said.    South Korean exports of maritime products to France, which  reached $21.9 million in 1991, decreased to $14.4 million in  1992 and $10.8 million last year, according to the Seoul  government's statistics.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Shareholders approve Pepe rescue measures ACTIONS to try to safeguard the future of Pepe Group, the jeans designer and distributor, have been approved by shareholders. As a result the USM quotation has been cancelled. Under the open offer of 199.9m shares to raise Pounds 9.1m, applications were received in respect just over 1m shares or 0.5 per cent. The offer was underwritten by SML, a company set up by its new management and Novel, the Hong Kong textile group, which now has a controlling interest. SML has an inventive option to buy up to 75 per cent of Pepe's equity if and when the company's market capitalisation reaches Pounds 118m. A Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.5m) global advertising campaign will be launched. The provision of Pounds 35m of new banking facilities, which were conditional on the approval, have been agreed. The new management consists of Mr Silas Chou, who became chairman when Novel acquired 29.6 per cent of Pepe in March last year and Mr Lawrence Stroll, a director of Tommy Hilfiger, the US clothes group, as chief executive officer. Mr Maurice Marciano, former president of Guess Jeans, is vice chairman and chief executive officer (Americas). Mr Arun Shah, who founded Pepe, stays on the board as an executive director.</p>

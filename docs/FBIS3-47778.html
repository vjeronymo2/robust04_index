The land, which was left almost waste for quite a long time, as  it was subjected to droughts for six months and floods for the  other six months of a year. A few people settled down in this  area. Every year they just came in November to harvest floating  rice which grew naturally during flood seasons.    In order to turn that quadrangele into arable lands, the  province implemented a five-year programme 1988-1992 with the  total investment capital of 400 billion dong contributed by both  the central and the local governments. Roads were upgraded,  canals and ditches dredged and many rural areas supplied with  electricity. As a result more and more poeple came and settled  down in the quadrangle, bringing its population to 1.5 million.    Farmers began farming double rice crops and got an average  yield of 9.8 tonnes/ha/year, making An Giang the biggest rice  producer in the country in 1993 with an output of nearly 2  million tonnes.

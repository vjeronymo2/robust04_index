			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Throbs" column by Dr. Nu'man Jum'ah] </F>   [Excerpts] We, the Arabs, live a big tragedy. Arab  countries are suffering from emptiness, lack of purpose, and  weakness. Neighboring them is a Zionist entity with a strong and  cohesive fabric. The juxtaposition of strength with emptiness  causes cracks and instability on the empty side.    Arab countries have despotic and repressive political  regimes. Their governments have no popular basis. Governments  that fail to communicate and interact with their peoples remain  weak and handicapped. More often than not, they end up in  conflict with their people or some sections of them. Such  governments must seek protection from the state's regular forces  and get foreign assistance and protection. Foreigners do not  provide such things without a price, usually that of restricting  and controlling the national administration.    Once an administration is sold out, the state's relations  and  external interests fall under foreign control. The result, as  we see it, is that all Arab regimes flutter like a leaf in the  wind or drift like a rudderless boat in high seas, having no  initiative or direction of their own. They just react and  respond to disasters after they occur. Most of the time, their  reactions are too belated and indecisive to rise to the occasion  and answer the challenges initiated by others. So, we mostly  end up denouncing, lamenting, and shedding tears.    In this same region, we have a neighbor that is strong,  gritty, and vibrant: the Zionist entity. This entity is a  democracy in which the people have the final say. The  government there represents the people, listens to the people,  and does not defy their will. Such governments are strong  because they do not exhaust their resources in a conflict with  their people. They need no regular troops to fortify their  position with their people. Therefore, their regular forces  train the guns on their adversaries, the Arabs.    The Israeli Government does not need foreign countries to  support it against its own people. On the contrary, it uses the  strength, cohesiveness, and support of its people to put  pressure on foreign countries whose material and political  support it needs. [passage omitted]    This is the scary backdrop to the current ideas of peace,  normalization, water negotiations, and a Middle East market, all  of which are vehicles through which Israel will achieve its  historical dream. What it has failed to achieve by war it will  achieve by peace. A Zionist empire will spring up between the  Nile and the Euphrates, one in which the mighty Zionists will be  masters and the inept, misguided, and dysfunctional Arabs the  underdogs.    It may be said that Egypt is poor and desperate for U.S.  help  and that this is why it has to listen to the orders of the U.S.  Administration. This would explain our role in the Iraq-Iran  war and then the Gulf war. This would also explain our  unjustified hostility toward Iran and Sudan, our dealings with  the Serbs despite their crimes in Bosnia, and our dispatch of  troops to Somalia to replace U.S. troops.    My answer to this is that honest women go hungry rather than  turn tricks. We can avoid antagonizing America while  maintaining a measure of independence and freedom of action.  But this would require a true democracy, a government that  relies on its people, one that would cut its budget rather than  seek foreign assistance, and a leadership that awakens the  latent power of its people rather than resort to totalitarian  police rule to repress them.</p>

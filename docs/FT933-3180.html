			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Local attraction of pacts Britannica: Liberal Democrats are gaining influence through alliances Commander 'Chipps' Selby Bennett bears a heavy burden. In the Dorset council seat of Lytchett tomorrow, it falls to him to strike the first blow in a putative Conservative fightback against the Liberal Democrat hordes sweeping southern England. Chipps, a Conservative councillor for four years, will carry the tattered Tory flag in a by-election ordered by the High Court following an investigation into an unstamped ballot paper cast in the county council elections in May. But as he marches towards the Liberal Democrat gunfire, Chipps sounds like a reluctant champion, mainly because the by-election campaign, which ought to be about local issues, has focused instead on complaints about the government. In the wake of the Christchurch by-election in July, in which the Liberal Democrats overturned a Conservative majority of more than 23,000, it was never going to be easy. But Chipps has had his work cut out to fend off the anger of local people about national issues such as water charges and the extension of value added tax to heating fuel. 'When they protest, I say: 'Join the club, you are not nearly as fed up as I am,' ' he says wearily. Describing himself as an 'independent-minded chap', he adds: 'It is not a very clever government.' Sentiments like that will be shouted from the rooftops of Torquay next week when the Liberal Democrats gather for their annual conference. After decades in the parliamentary wilderness, the party is inherently prone to over-optimism. But this year, the delegates will be able to celebrate the achievement of real power, albeit at a local level. Almost unnoticed in Westminster, third-party candidates have been gaining ground in local elections for two decades. In 1978, the Liberal party held 800 council seats across the country. After gains in 12 of the last 15 years, its Liberal Democrat successor now holds 4,250. The real breakthrough came in May's county council elections, when an anti-government landslide left the Conservative party in control of just one county - Buckinghamshire - in the south of England. Even Conservatives are admitting publicly that the Liberal Democrats' increasingly professional and well-organised approach has made them a real threat to the Conservatives, especially in the party's southern heartlands. 'There is a new Liberal Democrat establishment being built up,' says Mr Tony Speller, the former Conservative MP for North Devon, who lost his seat to a Liberal Democrat at the last general election. 'Many of the people who are serving as Liberal Democrat councillors would have been Conservatives 10 years ago, and they are running things perfectly well. There is very little of the brown bread and sandals nonsense you used to get from the Liberals.' It was this realisation that sent Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, scurrying to the south-west earlier this month to assess the damage. Pointedly, Mr John Major, the prime minister, trod much the same ground in the first of his morale-boosting forays into the regions last week. With the prime minister's backing, Sir Norman delivered a strong warning to last week's cabinet meeting about the urgent need to halt the Liberal Democrat bandwagon. As of now, he told the cabinet, the Liberal Democrats are the number one political target. To the Liberal Democrats, that kind of talk smacks of King Canute ordering the waves to retreat. Mr David Fox, the party's western region co-ordinator, acknowledges that it benefited in May from a protest vote, but argues that people were also responding to the party's long-standing local campaigning. 'We didn't just get elected as a protest but as a result of two years of planning and of consistent campaigning,' he says. As proof, he claims that membership growth has accelerated since the election. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, goes further. 'It is quite clear that the Conservatives are running scared in the south-west, and well they might be, since they are now the third party in many places,' he says. 'It is very sensible of them to perceive that we are the major challengers in the south of England, but it will not do them any good. We know there is no room for complacency on our part, but we will just go on campaigning with good, solid common-sense policies, and the Conservatives have no idea how to combat that.' There is some evidence that this jibe is correct. Local Conservative activists who heard Mr Major speak in the south-west last week say he appeared more comfortable attacking Labour than spelling out how the party would respond to the Liberal Democrat threat. However, events since May have shown that the Conservatives are not alone in their confusion. The Tories' losses in the county council elections left all the parties in un-charted territory but the Liberal Democrats can claim to have a clearer strategy. Put simply, their aim is to grab whatever share of power they can, wherever they can, on whatever terms. The rationale is that the party's best hope of long-term gain is to build up a record in local government administration. That, the strategists believe, will undermine the 'untried' label often hung on the party by the Conservatives, and help to establish a cadre of good parliamentary candidates. As a result of May's elections, the Liberal Democrats find themselves playing a role in administering almost all the 22 southern counties, sometimes depending on Labour support, as in Berkshire, East Sussex and Hereford/Worcester; sometimes supporting the Conservatives, as in Hertfordshire; or backing Labour, as in Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Norfolk. In some, such as Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire, all three parties share control; and in others, such as Avon, Essex, Kent and Hampshire, the Liberal Democrats and Labour have established unannounced alliances. Most of these arrangements are informal, and all have been negotiated locally, sometimes without the participation of national party officials. Some, as in Berkshire and East Sussex, are operated under 'conventions' which regulate relationships between the parties. Others are fiercely disputed. In Wiltshire, for example, the Liberal Democrats claim they have been excluded by an 'unholy alliance' of the Labour and Conservative groups. Both major parties deny the charge. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats fight shy of characterising any of these loose agreements as 'pacts'. None involves an agreed policy programme, and in many, alliances sometimes shift as issues change. In Wiltshire the Tories and Labour combined to vote through an operational arrangement (in which the chairperson is elected at each meeting and has no casting vote) but the Liberals and Labour combined to reverse Conservative spending cuts on secondary schools, aid for voluntary organisations and a disabled workshop. Mr Ashdown and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, have ruled out any extension of the county council arrangements to parliamentary or European parliament seats. Nevertheless, the Conservative party's inability to rely on the loyalty of its heartland is a serious blow to the government. The Tories will have to reverse this state of affairs to have any real hope of winning the next general election. Much is riding on Commander Selby Bennett's shoulders.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH-WEST STRONGHOLDS: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS' SURGE IN MAY'S ELECTIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gloucestershire              No overall control; from Con                              Lib Dem 30, Lab 20, Con 10, Ind 2, Others 1                              Lib Dem gained 8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Avon                         No overall control; no change                              Lab 33, Con 25, Lib Dem 18                              Lib Dem gained 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Somerset                     Lib Dem; gain from Con                              Lib Dem 41, Con 13, Lab 2, Ind 1                              Lib Dem gained 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Devon                        No overall control; from Con                              Lib Dem 41, Lab 21, Con 18, Ind 4, Lib 1                              Lib Dem gained 29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cornwall &amp; Scilly Isles      Lib Dem; from NOC                              Lib Dem 42, Ind 21, Lab 8, Con 6, Lib 1,                              Others 1                              Lib Dem gained 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dorset                       No overall control; from Con                              Lib Dem 38, Con 28, Lab 6, Ind 4                              Lib Dem gained 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Wiltshire                    No overall control; from Con                              Lib Dem 33, Con 18, Lab 17                              Lib Dem gained 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Isle of Wight                Lib Dem; no change                              New council:                              Lib Dem 28, Con 9, Ind 6                              Lib Dem gained 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hampshire                    No overall control; from Con                              Lib Dem 48, Con 29, Lab 24, Ind 1                              Lib Dem gained 22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lib Dem     Liberal Democrats Con         Conservative Lab         Labour Lib         Liberal Ind         Independent  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei discouraged by political haggling CONTINUED haggling by the Liberal Democratic Party to stall the naming of the new prime minister discouraged investors, and the Nikkei average lost further ground on index-linked selling by investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The leading 225-issue index fell 67.70 to 20,357.94 after a day's high of 20,379.74 and a low of 20,244.82, barely changed on the week. The yen's rise to a record Y103 level against the dollar in overseas markets, also kept investors away. Volume totaled 200m shares against 238m. Arbitrageurs were seen placing small lot buy orders. Declines led advances by 611 to 307, with 224 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 7.23 to 1,654.59 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 67.7 to close at 20357.94. Traders said that overseas investors remained buyers of financial stocks, especially trust banks, which are considered to be laggards among bank issues. 'The stocks are fundamentally risky, and we expect a shift away from the stocks in about a month,' said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson International. Mitsui Trust and Banking rose Y20 to Y1,260 and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking advanced Y10 to Y1,420. However, investors took profits on most commercial banks. Bank of Tokyo fell Y30 to Y1,800 and Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y70 to Y3,400. Exporters were weak on the rise in the yen. Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y10 to Y1,350, Sony fell Y30 to Y4,420 and Toyota Motor fell Y10 to Y1,660. An overnight fall in gold prices on overseas markets prompted a fall in mining stocks. Sumitomo Metal Mining fell Y40 to Y1,010 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting lost Y20 to Y532. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 74.85 to 22,295.10 in volume of 25.8m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets went their own ways yesterday. HONG KONG continued to derive benefit from the better-than-expected results from HSBC's Midland Bank with domestic and foreign demand driving the market higher. The Hang Seng index ended 89.23 or 1.2 per cent higher at 7,396.77, for a 5.8 per cent rise on the week. Cheung Kong climbed HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 27.80 and its afilliate Hutchison Whampoa was up 40 cents to HKDollars 22.00. Jardine Matheson was up HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 59.50. But most active HSBC Holdings came under pressure from profit-taking after its 5 per cent surge on Thursday. It ended 50 cents down at HKDollars 79.50, but its Hang Seng Bank unit climbed HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 61.50. NEW ZEALAND saw a rise in Telecom mask an otherwise corrective day and the NZSE-40 capital index reversed an early 13.4 point fall to end 2.13 higher at 1,895.99, up 4.4 per cent on the week and another three year high. Telecom, 8 cents ahead at NZDollars 4.00, is seen as a major beneficiary from a tax reduction to foreign portfolio investors, announced earlier this week. BANGKOK was broadly higher in an extended bull run that surprised many analysts. The SET index advanced 10.58 to a five-month high of 958.84 in heavy turnover of Bt8.93bn. Property, media and electrical issues led the rally which has lifted the index by 7.7 percent over the past eight sessions. SINGAPORE was lifted by some late buying ahead of the long holiday weekend, and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 9.62 to 1,871.25, for a 3.5 per cent rise on the week. SYDNEY was hard hit early in the session by the gold price slump which left the All Ordinaries index 36 points lower initially. However, shares subsequently clawed back some of the losses and the index ended down 23.1 at 1,842.2, little changed on the week. Selling was on low volumes and mainly by smaller investors. Gold stocks recovered slightly from early selling, but still finished down 188.1 or 8.11 per cent at 2,131.4. Poseidon Gold shed 35 cents to ADollars 4.45, Placer Pacific 28 cents at ADollars 3.00, Homestake 26 cents to ADollars 2.02 and Newcrest 42 cents to ADollars 4.18. TAIWAN finished lower, as late profit-taking erased early gains. The weighted index, which gained more than 20 points in early trade, ended down 29.59 at 4,025.93, 0.8 per cent up on the week. Cement stocks, which had recently lagged the market, were the only gainers. Taiwan Cement rose 50 cents to TDollars 51.5. MANILA gave up some of its recent gains in response to the lower bullion price and the composite index dropped 16.95 at 1,743.97, a 0.4 per cent fall on the week. Benguet, the country's biggest gold producer, eased 1.25 pesos to 17 pesos. SEOUL was sharply lower as large-capitalisation shares shed early gains and individual investors remained in the sidelines. The composite index dipped 10.57 to 721.48, a 1.2 per cent fall on the week. BOMBAY finished higher in spite of heavy selling pressure by domestic financial institutions late in a session cut to 90 minutes to enable brokers to settle unmatched trades. The BSE index closed 53.19 higher at 2,375.90.</p>

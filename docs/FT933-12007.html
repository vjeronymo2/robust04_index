			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht challenge opens in High Court LORD Rees-Mogg's attempt to block ratification of the Maastricht treaty was launched in the High Court yesterday. The former editor of The Times was in court to hear his counsel, Mr David Pannick QC, accuse the government of acting unlawfully by seeking to ratify the treaty without parliamentary approval. Mr Pannick moved to reassure the court that the case did not pose a threat to the rights and privileges of the Houses of Parliament. Last week Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the Commons, warned the courts not to interfere in parliamentary proceedings. Mr Pannick said: 'These proceedings in our submission do not involve any questioning of proceedings in the Houses of Parliament contrary to article nine of the Bill of Rights 1688.' He told a packed courtroom that the case was not concerned with the merits of the UK's decision to sign the treaty nor with the wisdom - or folly - of the UK's intention to ratify it. The proceedings were solely concerned with the legality of the government's proposed course of action. The essence of the case was that 'contrary to the requirements laid down by parliament itself in the 1972 European Communities Act and the 1978 European Parliamentary Elections Act, the Crown, through the government, intends, without the authorisation of parliament, to increase the powers of the European parliament to alter the content of Community law'. Mr Pannick said the government was acting unlawfully in three respects: It intended to increase the powers of the European parliament by ratifying the protocol on social policy. Without parliamentary authority it intended to alter the content of the Treaty of Rome by ratifying the protocol on social policy. Without parliamentary authority it intended to ratify title V of the Treaty on European Union which deals with a common foreign and security policy which would transfer prerogative powers away from the UK. Mr Sydney Kentridge QC for Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said that Lord Rees-Mogg's case was based on 'fundamental constitutional misconceptions' and amounted to an attack on parliament. Considered as a whole, he said he regarded 'with some scepticism' Mr Pannick's disclaimer that the challenge had nothing to do with the merits or demerits of the decision to ratify the treaty. Rejecting Lord Rees-Mogg's assertion that his aim was not to interfere with political debate in parliament, Mr Kentridge suggested that 'sometimes judicial review may be the continuation of politics by other means'. He said: 'We were told that the government's decision was an attempt by the Crown to reassert powers which had been lost to them at the end of the 17th century. 'We submit it is nothing of the sort. There is no conflict at all between the Crown and Parliament.' The hearing is expected to last until tomorrow.</p>

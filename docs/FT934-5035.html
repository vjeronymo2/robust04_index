			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Moves to compensate for VAT on heating - Help for pensioners A package of help for pensioners, including the government's promised compensation for the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, was a significant part of the Budget speech. But the chancellor drew his proposals wider, and included a proposal for a pensioners' guaranteed income bond with regular payments of a guaranteed fixed rate of interest, to compensate for the fact that many of those on fixed incomes have seen their spending power fall as interest rates have come down. The other main features of the package were: Extra help of Pounds 1.25bn a year by 1996-97 for 15m people; A 50p-a-week increase in the rate for all single pensioners and 70p a week for all pensioner couples from April 1994 in addition to their normal uprating; An intention to award the same weekly cash increases again in April 1995, taking extra help overall to Pounds 1 for all single pensioners and Pounds 1.40 for all pensioner couples: by April 1996 total extra help will amount to Pounds 1.30 for singles and Pounds 1.85 for couples (Pounds 1.40 and Pounds 2.00 for poorer pensioners); The same increases for those on widows and invalidity benefit. The same increases for disabled people on income support. Other groups on income related benefits to be paid the benefit increases consequent upon VAT a year earlier than normal in April 1994, so that extra money is available before the first VAT bill arrives. A similar approach will be adopted in April 1995 for the second instalment of VAT and this extra money will remain as a permanent addition to benefit levels. Cold weather payments increased by 25 per cent from Pounds 6 a week to Pounds 7 from next winter and Pounds 7.50 from the following winter. All pensioners and disabled people to qualify for energy efficiency grants at a cost of Pounds 35m a year, which represents a near-doubling of the home energy efficiency scheme. The government announced its intention to extend VAT to domestic fuel and power in the March Budget at 8 per cent from April 1 1994, and at the standard rate (currently 17 1/4 per cent) from April 1 1995. The previous chancellor made it clear in the March Budget that the government recognised that the measure would cause particular problems for those on low incomes and this would be taken into account in the April 1994 benefit uprating. The chancellor announced in his Budget speech detailed measures to help not only households and pensioners on low incomes but also all pensioner households, regardless of income. From April 1994, some 15m people - including those on low incomes, all pensioners, widows, and the long-term sick on invalidity benefit - will receive extra help to meet the cost of VAT on their fuel bills. Pensioners, including those receiving income support, will receive 50p a week for a single pensioner on top of the normal uprating (70p where there is a dependent husband or wife). Where both members of a couple are receiving a full basic retirement pension in their own right, they will each receive the 50p. In April 1995, VAT on domestic fuel rises to the standard rate of 17.5 per cent. In considering the April 1995 benefit rates the intention is, within the exercise of the secretary of state's statutory responsibilities, to increase the extra help overall to Pounds 1 for singles (Pounds 1.40 where there is a dependent husband or wife). Again, where both members of a couple receive the full basic retirement pension in their own right, they will each receive the Pounds 1. These increases will partly comprise indexation and partly further special additions. In April 1996, when the relevant indices 'catch up' with the effect of VAT, the extra help given to pensioners in the earlier years will remain an integral part of their benefit rates. The retirement pension will be Pounds 1.30 a week higher for singles and Pounds 1.85 a week higher for couples (Pounds 1.40 a week and Pounds 2 a week for poorer pensioners). For pensioners on income support, the increases will come on top of the special increases of Pounds 2 a week for singles and Pounds 3 a week for couples paid from October 1992 over and above normal upratings. Pensioners are not the only group targeted for extra help. Widows, and people receiving invalidity benefit, invalid care allowance, severe disablement allowance, war pensions unemployability supplement and disabled people on income support, will see similar increases to those for pensioners. For poorer households other than pensioners and disabled people, the extra help will be provided by calculating the increases in benefit that would result at the April 1995 uprating from VAT and paying these increases from April 1994 instead. This is a year ahead of the normal timetable and will ensure that the extra help is available before the first VAT bill arrives. It will mean increases in benefits in April 1994 of 3.9 per cent - a higher rate of increase than many people in work are likely to receive. People receiving other income-related benefits - family credit, disability working allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit - will also see increases in their benefits. For April 1995 the intention is to adopt a similar approach. In April 1996, this extra payment will remain as a permanent addition to benefit levels. These increases in income-related benefits come on top of the extra sums for community charge payments which were consolidated into benefit levels from April 1993, even though recipients no longer have to pay local taxation. These increases were worth an extra Pounds 1.60 for a single person and Pounds 2.80 a week for a couple. Cold weather payments will increase from the current weekly amount of Pounds 6 to Pounds 7 from next winter, and the intention is to make a further increase the following winter to Pounds 7.50: a 25 per cent increase over two years. These payments are made automatically when there are sharp spells of cold weather to those pensioner households, families with young children and disabled people claiming income support. An extra Pounds 35m a year will be made available for the next three years to provide more grants for energy efficiency measures. The Department of Environment's home energy efficiency scheme, which will almost double in size, will be extended to all pensioners and disabled people. Similar arrangements will be made in Northern Ireland, where there is a separate scheme. At present, the scheme only covers households on income-related benefits. They will continue to qualify for help, and since the scheme was introduced in 1991 more than 500,000 such households have received grants. The extra Pounds 35m a year will provide grants for more than 200,000 extra pensioner households a year, bringing the total number of households receiving grants to almost 500,000 a year. The pensioners' guaranteed income bond will combine a fixed rate of interest, guaranteed for five years, with regular monthly interest payments. This will enable pensioners to invest their savings in a secure asset and know exactly how much they will receive in interest each month.</p>

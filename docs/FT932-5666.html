			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / NZ budget deficit revised downwards NEW Zealand faces a budget deficit of NZDollars 2.57bn (Dollars 1.4bn) in the year to June 30, some Dollars NZ730m better than predicted on budget night last year, Ms Ruth Richardson, the minister of finance, announced yesterday, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. This is the third revision of the forecasts. Last June Ms Richardson estimated that it would be NZDollars 3.3m, and in December she said it would be NZDollars 3.2m. However a series of monthly forecasts have been hinting at a lower budget deficit. Ms Richardson said that the improvement was due to the country paying less on its foreign debt because of a fall in interest rates, and a rise in the value of the New Zealand dollar. Government departments had also constrained their spending. Opposition spokesman on finance, Dr Michael Cullen, said Ms Richardson had had inflated the initial deficit estimate and progressively made it look better to impress voters.</p>

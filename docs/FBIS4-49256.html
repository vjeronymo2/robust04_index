			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Do a Good Job in the Comprehensive </F> Management of Public Order To Achieve Long-Term Peace and  Stability in the Rural Areas"]    [Text] The fundemental problems in our country's economic  development and modernization are agrticulture, rural areas, and  the peasants. The 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee demanded the  further deepening of rural reforms, accelerating rural economic  development, and strengthening the role of agriculture as the  economic foundation to ensure that it moves up to a new level by  the end of this century. This is an arduous and urgent task  confronting the entire party and people throughout the whole  country.    To open a new dimension in rural reforms and development, it  is necessary to have a stable and harmonious social environment  in rural areas. Since the beginning of reform and opening up,  guided by the party's rural policies, our country's rural  economy has developed greatly and the living standards of  peasants have risen considerably, with the majority of peasants  living and working contentedly and happily. The pursuit of  socialist spiritual civilization in rural areas has also scored  great achievements. However, it should be seen that public order  in our country's rural areas in recent years has not been  satisfactory. The public order situation in rural areas is  chaotic and this is not only affecting the normal life of the  broad mass of peasants but is also impeding efforts to further  deepen rural reforms and increase the pace of developing the  rural economy.    To stabilize the public order situation in rural areas, it  is  necessary to crack down on various crimes. In particular,  felons, criminals with long criminal records, recidivists, and  criminal gang leaders, local thugs and village brutes who  terrorize localities must be resolutely punished according to  law and, in this, there should be no mercy. Only thus can the  arrogance of lawbreaking criminals be punctured, the righteous  spirit overpower the evil spirit, and can the situation in rural  areas whereby good people are brutalized by villains, be  rectified.    To improve public order in rural areas, it is also necessary  to double the efforts to pursue socialist spiritual civilization  and to eradicate the influence of all kinds of corruption,  feudalism, backwardness, and superstitious thinking in rural  areas. To this end, it is necessary to change the situation in  rural work whereby "one type of work is stressed at the expense  of another." In pursuing rural economic construction well, we  must pay great attention to guidance and education for the  peasants, especially socialist ideological education and  education in the legal system. We must adopt forms welcomed and  accepted by the peasants which enrich peasants' cultural lives  and allow advanced and healthy ideology and culture to take over  the spiritual realm and cultural markets in the vast rural areas.    One proven method for the pursuit of a comprehensive  management of public order in rural areas is to believe in and  rely on the masses, fully motivate the broad peasant masses, and  mobilize them into taking the initiative. Local rural areas  must learn from the positive experiences of some localities  which did a good job in public order, mobilize and organize the  broad peasant masses, provide mass prevention and remedy by  making use of peasants' own power, and direct the public order  work down to villages, units, households, and individuals. This  will improve the peasants' ability to protect themselves and  their property and to guard against transgressions, lawbreaking,  and criminal behavior, so that results reaped will be double the  amount of effort made.    All comprehensive measures must depend on dynamic and  resourceful organization for implementation. Therefore, it is  necessary to boost grass-roots party and government  organizations in rural areas to make them really capable of  carrying out the arduous work demanded by various comprehensive  measures. At present, village party branches and village  committees in some rural areas are basically paralyzed. There  are no authorities in villages, the masses are as disorganized  as a pan of sand, and nobody is responsible for the  comprehensive management of public order and other tasks and  measures. Villages are powerless against local thugs and  village brutes and the evil tendency grows unchecked. Party  committees and governments at all levels must: Adopt resolute  and powerful measures to rectify and strengthen grass-roots  party and government organizations; transfer capable,  responsible, and courageous comrades to grass-roots  organizations, and firmly expel those who are weak and cringe  before bad people and bad things, or even conspire and collude  with local thugs, so that grass-roots party and government  organizations can become bastions with stronger muscles for work.    Party committees and governments at all levels have a great  responsibility in stabilizing rural social order. They must  unify thinking around reform, opening up, and economic  construction and efforts must revolve around rural social  stability. Party committees and governments at all levels,  especially those in relatively economically backward areas, must  try their best to develop the rural economy and work hard to  raise the material well- being of the masses. Party and  government officials of all ranks must overcome bureaucratism,  venture deep into the grass roots, listen to the voices of the  peasants, perform practical services for them, and solve  practical problems. Leading party and government comrades at  all levels must strictly enforce the responsibility system in  the comprehensive management of public order; conscientiously  organize the comprehensive management of public order in rural  areas and tackle such work properly; vigorously support  comprehensive rural management work in the areas of policy  guidance, organizational establishment and improvement,  staffing, and capital and equipment; and hold individual leaders  accountable for failing to fulfil their assigned  responsibilities in the comprehensive management of public order  in rural areas.    The comprehensive management of public order in rural areas  is an important task which allows only success and not failure.  If the problem of rural public order is solved and social order  is stable, rural reforms and economic construction can steadily  deepen. If the rural economy is developed and the role of  agriculture as the economic foundation is secure, the stability  of the whole nation will be based on a solid foundation and the  further deepening of reform and opening up will have a powerful  safeguard. Otherwise, there will be chaos and turmoil in rural  areas and the very root of the progress of our country's  socialist modernization will be jeopardized. All party members  and cadres, especially comrades with responsibility in rural  areas and those with leadership and management duties in rural  public order, must understand the importance of public order  work in rural areas, implement all comprehensive management  measures by the central authorities, and struggle actively for  long-term peace and stability in rural areas!</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Stronger rules urged to prevent trade war A fresh outbreak of trade warfare is likely unless stronger multilateral trade rules are drawn up quickly in the wake of last year's Uruguay Round agreement, a study* commissioned by a transatlantic group of business and labour leaders and academics warns today. The study, published by the British-North American Committee, implicitly criticises the thinking behind current US trade and industrial policies as one of the main challenges to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The conclusions are firmly endorsed by the committee's joint chairmen, Sir David Plastow, chairman of Inchcape, the British services group, and Mr John Heimann, a former US comptroller of the currency and senior executive of Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank. The committee believes the principles of the multilateral trade system are threatened by a growing belief among policy-makers that economic advantage is best achieved by promoting national champion industries and other monopolistic and oligopolistic forms of competition. The study points out that enthusiasm for this so-called New International Trade Theory (NITT) is particularly strong among senior members of the Clinton administration, which have used it to justify more government support for US exports and subsidies for high-tech industries. Though the theory offered some valuable insights into international trade, policies based on it might not deliver the expected benefits. Such policies were also likely to distort markets and provoke retaliation unless further multilateral agreements were reached soon to liberalise non-tariff barriers, curb subsidies, reform anti-dumping regulations and restrict cartels. 'If Gatt cannot be reformed fast enough to embody new international rules covering non-tariff trade trade barrier issues, there will be intense pressure on public and private sector decision-makers to deploy NITT trade-enhancing strategies to an increasing extent.' The authors, a US and a British economist, say one solution could be to create a 'Super-Gatt', membership of which would be open to countries which signed up to new rules intended to eliminate non-tariff barriers. Members of the British-North American Committee committee are drawn from the UK, the US and Canada, and include senior executives of many large companies. *Unfinished Tasks: The New International Trade Theory and Post-Uruguay Challenges, by Prof F M Scherer and Dr Richard Belous.

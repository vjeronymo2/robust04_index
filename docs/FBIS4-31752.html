			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ryszard Choroszy: "`Strategy for Poland'; One </F> Move Forward"]    [Excerpt] According to Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz  Kolodko, over the next three years there will be more money for  public security or for the national defense than there is now.  How much? It will be decided by the parliament.    The author of the "Strategy for Poland" does not conceal  that  the expectations of the "uniform" ministries should be  realistic. The plans for the socioeconomic policy until 1997  envisions an increase in the expenditures primarily in  education, culture, and health protection. This year it takes  approximately 11.4 percent of the GDP. If the expenditures in  that sphere continue to increase, the "short blanket" will not  satisfy the needs of other ministries.  <H5>  Pressure on Expenditures </H5>   The deputy prime minister is not an advocate of defining  permanent indexes of the share of the expenditures in the  various areas of the state's total expenditures. The Ministry  of National Defense [MON], however, expects that its budget will  amount to at least 3 percent of the GDP. Only such expenditures  make it possible to modernize the Army, which is a condition for  adjusting the Army's structures, equipment, and armament to the  requirements of the Western states. The sum in question is more  than 10 trillion zlotys.    Similar expectations are held by the Ministry of Internal  Affairs [MSW]. Not long ago Minister Andrzej Milcznowski  revealed that he would like substantive expenditures to be the  same as personal expenditures (currently they constitute 35  percent of the MSW budget). At the same time, at a government  session devoted to public security, he demanded raising the  wages of the functionaries of special services to the level  found in MON.    The government's stand is that the expenditures in MON and  MSW will increase at a rate close to the increase in the GDP.  It plans that the GDP will be 22.5 percent higher in 1997 than  it is now. Therefore, the expenditure on MON and MSW should  increase 5 percent faster than inflation.    Will that really happen? It seems difficult to accomplish,  if for only one reason: the "Strategy for Poland" also envisions  the gradual limiting of the budget deficit to 2 percent of the  GDP. Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko told POLSKA ZBROJNA that the  balancing of public expenditures calls for discipline and  "thrift spending of resources" that the ministries have.  However, the ministers demand an increase in expenditures,  which can be seen at every session of the government. [passage  omitted]</p>

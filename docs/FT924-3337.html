			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Accord reached on airline landing slots EUROPEAN Community transport ministers agreed early today on a system designed to help smaller airlines get better access to landing slots at major EC airports, EC officials said, Reuter reports from Brussels. The system tightens rules under which airlines lose slots they don't use, but falls short of a proposal to confiscate slots from major airlines to make room for smaller ones. As a result, it is likely to be criticised by smaller airlines such as British Midland and Virgin Atlantic which have campaigned for firm EC action to help them compete on the EC market and offer lower fares in time for the EC's January 1 single market deadline. Under the accord, which must be formalised at a future meeting of EC ministers, airlines holding fewer than four slots at a particular airport will qualify for slots which become available under the system. The rules would be especially needed at the heavily congested airports of Paris Orly, London Heathrow and Frankfurt. EC transport ministers yesterday agreed to explore emergency steps to rescue EC airline companies from their current crisis and set minimum fare prices, according to French Transport Minister Jean-Louis Bianco. He said that between 1990 and 1993 the air transport sector was expected to lose about Dollars 10bn and that the crisis, harmful in the short term for airlines, could soon be detrimental to passengers too. Citing steps that could be taken, the French minister said the EC could invoke a safeguard clause enabling it to put a floor under fare prices and protect EC airlines from 'ruinous competition'.</p>

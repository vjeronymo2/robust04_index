			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (14): A whiff of corruption - The Filesa Case IT IS not Italy. But it is starting to smell that way. Political corruption has become a burning issue in Spain. Later this month a Madrid judge is likely to ask parliament to lift the immunity on a congressman and a senator who are allegedly linked to a judicial investigation into illicit funding of the governing Socialist party. The judge's probe, known as the Filesa case after a Barcelona-based group of consultancy companies that allegedly bankrolled the government's 1989 general electoral campaign, has an identifiable Italian whiff about it. Tax inspectors working for Judge Mariano Barbero last month compiled a report that itemised a list of payments, totalling Pta1bn (Dollars 8.4m), that the Filesa group received from leading domestic banks and companies in return for consultancy reports and also a list of subsequent payments that the group made to the Socialist party to cover its electoral expenses. The report is an explosive one because it alleges that Filesa, which was controlled by Mr Carlos Navarro, a congressman and former treasurer of the Socialist parliamentary party, and by Sen Jose Maria Sala, administrative secretary of the Catalan Socialist party, never wrote the consultancy reports that it was paid for. Compounding the damage, the report claims that Filesa directly paid service companies supplying the Socialist campaign headquarters and that in order to disguise the payments it took receipts for them from a group of companies, called 2020, which is controlled by Ms Aida Alvarez, a former national co-ordinator of the Socialist party's finances. The Filesa case is viewed by some as the mere tip of a corruption iceberg. The 2020 group itself has been linked in press reports to large consultancy payments made by Germany's Siemens group at the time it was negotiating the contract to supply the Madrid-Seville high speed train. Other press reports have suggested backhanders were common practice among suppliers to last year's Universal Exposition in Seville and certain Seville officials are already under judicial investigation for allegedly receiving bribes from construction companies. The corruption spotlight was first trained on Seville, the main Socialist power base, in 1991 when Mr Alfonso Guerra, the city's leading Socialist politician, was forced to resign as deputy prime minister after his younger brother was accused of political scams at the government's local headquarters. Mr Guerra, who remains deputy leader of the Socialist party, is responsible for the party's electoral campaigns. Corruption by no means appears to be exclusively a Socialist party vice. The centre right opposition, the Partido Popular, PP, has been severely embarrassed by real estate scandals involving the chief executive of the regional government of Cantabria, north Spain, one of the party's fiefdoms, and three years ago it had to sack its national treasurer who was accused of organising illicit funding in a scandal not unlike the current Filesa affair. The governing Socialists are taking the flak now but the problem is general. Spain, much like Italy, has not adequately worked out how to finance a democratic process in which the parties run large bureaucracies and spend heavily during a never-ending round of municipal, regional and general elections. Budget allocations to the parties cover only a fraction of their running costs, party membership is low and dues are derisory, and there is no mechanism for tax-deductible political donations, which are in any case curtailed by law. So far, the parliamentary parties have failed to agree on limiting their campaign expenses but all are expected to refer to the need for such legislation in their manifestos for the general elections later this year. One hopeful feature in the Spanish scenario is that corruption, thanks to the press and to individual judges, has come out into the open. The Partido Popular, which believes that it has put its own house in order, is now fuelling the debate, for it rightly believes that is a vote-getter. Unlike Italy, corruption has almost certainly not permeated the entire political system. This is not because Spaniards are more virtuous but because democracy was reintroduced only in the late 1970s and political parties have consequently been at the game for a shorter period. There is no suggestion, so far, that political leaders in Spain are themselves corrupt.</p>

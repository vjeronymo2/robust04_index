			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOUR THEATER TROUPES RATED FOR STATE GRANTS;  </P> <P> STAGE: LAGUNA PLAYHOUSE, BLACK ACTORS THEATRE, FULLERTON CIVIC LIGHT OPERA AND  GROVE THEATRE COMPANY ARE LIKELY CAC RECIPIENTS.  </P> <P> Four county theater troupes are likely to receive state grants, based on  ratings given this week in Sacramento by a California Arts Council grants  advisory panel. Two of the groups' ratings dropped from previous years,  however.  </P> <P> The panel, recommending groups for 1990-91 support grants, measured  organizational as well as artistic competence on a four-point scale. Though the  size of the individual grants cannot be determined until the council's budget  is set this summer, groups rated 3- and above have been funded in the past,  council officials say.  </P> <P> Council spokeswoman Joanne Anglin said Friday that the panel gave 3+ ratings to  the Laguna Playhouse and the Orange County Black Actors Theatre, the same score  both troupes received when they last applied for grants two years ago.  </P> <P> The Fullerton Civic Light Opera was given a 3- score, half a point lower than  the 3 rating it received when it last applied in 1985. Also taking a half-point  drop was the Grove Theatre Company, given a 3 after receiving a 3+ last year.  </P> <P> No council officials involved with the week's rating process were immediately  available for comment Friday.  </P> <P> South Coast Repertory had not been given a rating by press time.  </P> <P> The council will vote in August on the panel's recommendations.  </P></p>

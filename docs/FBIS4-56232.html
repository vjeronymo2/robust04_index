			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 27 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Military sources  announced today that the Honduran Armed Forces will deactivate  four battalions in June, as part of the government's military  reduction program. Each of the deactivated military units has  approximately 800 soldiers, according to the sources quoted by  the private television "Today" newscast. The newscast did not  disclose the source.    Sources close to the presidential palace said that the  Honduran Armed Forces will be reduced from 24,000 to 12,000  troops, an amount similar to Nicaragua's Armed Forces.  Reduction of the Honduran military will follow once the  demilitarization in Nicaragua and El Salvador is completed, in  accordance with these neighboring countries' peace agreements.    General Luis Alonso Discus Elvir, commander in chief of the  Armed Forces, said recently that the Honduran Army will reduce  operating costs by 10 percent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In fact, as the legislative history indicates, it appears that Congress intended the preemption provisions of section 209, as applied to nonroad engines, to be analogous to the preemption provisions as applied to motor vehicles, except that California cannot request any waiver of the Federal preemption of state regulation of new small farm and construction equipment and locomotives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further indication that section 209(e)(2) was not intended to apply to in-use regulations is the fact that, if the subsection were applied to in-use regulations, then California would be the only government (local, state or federal) that could directly set regulations for nonroad engines in use. EPA's mandate under section 213 applies only to new engines. Therefore, EPA will not promulgate standards for in-use regulation of nonroad engines under section 213, beyond in-use regulations normally associated with new certified engines ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . in-use testing and recall requirements under section 207). States other than California would not be able to regulate nonroad engines in use ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . operation controls under section 209(d)) until California regulates them and could only regulate them in a manner identical to California's regulations. Nothing in the legislative history indicates such a dramatic departure from the current ability of states and local authorities to regulate emissions of mobile sources in use. Therefore, if section 209(e)(2) is determined to apply to in-use regulations, the entire United States regulatory scheme for regulation of nonroad engines in use would be dependent on the actions of one state, California. Congress could not have meant to grant such plenary power to a single state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is especially true given the location-specific nature of in-use regulations. In-use regulations, such as time of use or place of use restrictions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . high occupancy vehicle lanes) are typically very site specific. An in-use regulation suitable for California, or in part of California, may have little or no relevance or practicality to the type of in-use regulation suitable for another area. Such regulations which primarily effect local users are more appropriately controlled and implemented by local and state governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, section 209(d) of the Act clearly limits the preemption of state regulation in use. It states that ``nothing in this part shall preclude or deny to any other State or political subdivision thereof the right otherwise to control, regulate, or restrict the use, operation or movement of registered or licensed motor vehicles.'' As was stated above, section 209 as a whole applies equally to nonroad engines. Thus, section 209(d) should be interpreted to mean that, unless state regulation of use of nonroad engines is specifically preempted, section 209 should not be interpreted to grant any implicit preemption, except within the framework of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allway Taxi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the language of section 209 and the lack of any express preemption, the legislative history of these provisions, and the general presumption against providing broad preemption where such preemption is not made explicit, EPA believes that it is clear that section 209(e)(2) does not apply to in use regulation of nonroad engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA recognizes the important principle of narrowly construing the preemptive effect of the Act as explained in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allway Taxi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA also notes that certain state regulations that may be characterized as ``in-use'' regulations may be preempted because they are effectively regulations on the design of new engines rather than on the use of ``in-use'' engines. Industry has expressed concern that states might impose retrofit requirements on nonroad engines and vehicles as soon as they are introduced into commerce, or when such engines are being rebuilt, or at a date after which nonroad engines are typically rebuilt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA recognizes that CARB does not envision a retrofit requirement and that, because of the nature of the nonroad market, it is unlikely that other states would adopt such a requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, given EPA's definition of new and the scope of the definition within this rulemaking, this issue could arise when other states plan their in-use emission strategy. In such a case, EPA believes that a retrofit requirement mandating a retrofit of a nonroad engine immediately after the engine is no longer new is adverse to the Congressional intent of section 209(e) and the principles laid out in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allway Taxi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Therefore, in this scenario, such a retrofit requirement would be deemed an in-use emission standard relating back to the original design of the new engine by the original engine manufacturer (OEM) and would be subject to the waiver criteria of section 209(e)(2). Within this same scenario, only California could adopt such a requirement and other states could only adopt California's requirement if California subsequently was granted a waiver. However, after a reasonable amount of time has passed and the engine is no longer new (most likely when an engine is being rebuilt), modest retrofit requirements would most likely not be deemed to significantly affect the OEM and thus such requirements would not be subject to subsection 209(e)(2). In this second scenario, the modest retrofit requirements would still be subject to challenge in court under the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allway Taxi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  criteria. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Oral Statement of the Engine Manufacturers Association, Docket entry IV&hyph;F&hyph;7, which states ``The ultimate purchaser must have the assurance that the engine .&blank;.&blank;. she might purchase, and which properly meets EPA requirements_is `good' until that engine is ready to be rebuilt.

This problem is avoided since California's Utility Engine Rule ties the date of manufacture to the standard, therefore a 1990 engine would be subject to a 1990 standard and a 1994 engine subject to a 1994 standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

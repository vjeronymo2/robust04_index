			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROB REINER'S DEBT  </P> <P> Film lovers often complain that Woody Allen no longer makes the type of films  he used to; films like "Annie Hall" and "Manhattan" are what these people want.  </P> <P> Well, director Rob Reiner and writer Nora Ephron rectified this problem by  making a film just like Allen used to make.  </P> <P> Some critics claim the film is an homage to Allen. If the definition of homage  has been changed to mean rip-off or copy, then, yes, "When Harry Met Sally . .  ." is an homage to Allen.  </P> <P> TONY HERSHEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

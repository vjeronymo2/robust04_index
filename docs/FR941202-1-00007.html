			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 32(e)(1) Repayment Ability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129(h) of the TILA prohibits creditors extending high-rate, high-fee mortgage loans from engaging in a pattern or practice of extending such credit to consumers based on the consumer's collateral without regard to the consumer's repayment ability, including the consumer's current and expected income, current obligations, and employment. The Board believes that the information provided by the consumer in connection with paragraph (d)(7) can be relied on when considering a consumer's ability to repay the debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 32(e)(2) Home Improvement Contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129(i) of the TILA restricts how creditors may disburse proceeds to contractors under a home improvement contract secured by a high-rate, high-fee mortgage. The proposed regulation reflects the statutory requirement that the creditor must disburse the proceeds by an instrument payable to the consumer or jointly to the consumer and the contractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, at the election of the consumer, the creditor could disburse the proceeds through an escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the consumer, the creditor, and the contractor prior to the disbursement. The Board solicits comment on whether further guidance is needed regarding the use of a third party escrow agent. For example, comment is solicited on whether an affiliate of the creditor could act as a disbursing agent. The Board believes the Congress contemplated that both the consumer and the creditor would make a good-faith effort to agree to a mutually acceptable third party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statutory provision on check disbursements is technical and narrowly drawn. Its limitations are imposed only on ``creditors''_the person to whom a note is intially made payable. The consumer protections of this provision would not apply to the disbursement of funds by a lender such as a bank or finance company that purchases a high-rate, high-fee mortgage note made payable to a home improvement contractor, because the lender is not the ``creditor.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Exemptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129(l)(1) of the TILA authorizes the Board to create exemptions to the limitations set forth in proposed paragraph (d) and paragraph (e) of this section, upon a finding that the exemption is in the interest of the borrowing public and will apply only to mortgage products or categories of products that maintain and strengthen home ownership and equity protection. The legislative history expresses the Congress' concern that the legislation might inappropriately apply to some government loans or short-term ``bridge'' construction loans. It also states that in granting the exemption authority to the Board, the Congress intended that the Board consider exemptions on a product-by-product basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has not proposed any exemptions at this time. Comment is solicited on whether the Board should exercise its exemption authority for a product. And if a product is identified, the Board requests comment on the potential for abusive lending practices to be used for the products, and how the product is used to facilitate homeownership and strengthen the homeowner's equity interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

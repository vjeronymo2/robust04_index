			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] On Wednesday [6 April], Russia removed the clause in  the draft Russian-Estonian troop withdrawal agreement obligating  Russia to pull its troops out of Estonia by 31 August 1994,  saying the final date would reappear in the draft agreement if  Estonia altered its legislation on military retirees, Estonian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed ETA. In essence this move,  which came on the second and final day of the 18th round of  bilateral negotiations, in Moscow, set talks back to last  August, before Russia had proposed a final withdrawal date, the  Ministry says in its statement.    After last month's round when Russia announced that the  already agreed upon final withdrawal date of 31 August 1994 was  "no longer current", numerous states and international  organizations, including NATO, the European Union, the CSCE, the  Nordic prime ministers and the United States, publicly expressed  their support for the Estonian position and urged the Russian  Federation to keep the final date. In the wake of this  overwhelming support for Estonia, top Russian Federation  leaders, including Defence Minister Pavel Grachev and Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev, reiterated that 31 August 1994 was  still in force.    On this background Estonia came to the current round of  talks  in good faith expecting to initial the withdrawal agreement  which was ready to be initialed in last round, the Ministry  states. "However, by continuing to link troop withdrawal to  additional and irrelevant conditions today, Russia clearly  signalled that it did not in fact intend to keep the final  withdrawal date," the statement stresses.    According to the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Russia linked  the  final withdrawal to two additional conditions. First, Russia  heightened demands on demobilized former Soviet military  officers, insisting that "Estonia deem all its relevant  legislation null and void," the Ministry says. Second, despite  numerous offers of Western aid, the Russian side called on  Estonia to pay the Government of Russia 23 million U.S. dollars  directly.    In addition, the manner and tone of the Russian side  suggests  that Russia has hardened its position, the Ministry states. For  the duration of the round, Russia "presented its positions in a  more or less ultimatum style", introducing its own proposals as  "non-negotiable", the statement goes on. For instance the  Russian side told the Estonian side outright that the final date  would reappear in the draft withdrawal agreement as soon as  Estonia agreed to alter its legislation on military retirees.    Progress in the three remaining baskets of  negotiations-economic, border and humanitarian  questions-remained stalemated as the Russian side waited for  progress in the military group, the Ministry informs.    This round marked the second anniversary of Russian-Estonian  negotiations. The Estonian side remains hopeful that during the  next round, proposed by Estonia for next May in Tallinn, Russia  will bring a more constructive approach to the talks and will  both signal its clear intention to pull out its troops as well  as come to Tallinn prepared to negotiate practical solutions not  contradictory to existing Estonian legislation, the statement of  Estonian Foreign Ministry concludes.</p>

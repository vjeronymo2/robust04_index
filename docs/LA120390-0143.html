			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> REAL MOTHER JOLTS ED BEGLEY  </P> <P> Ed Begley Jr., the father in television's "Parenthood," says when he applied  for his driver's license at 16 he learned who his real mother was from his  birth certificate.  </P> <P> Begley, 41, said in the Dec. 8 issue of TV Guide that it took him some time to  adjust to the fact his father's first wife was not his mother, as he had  assumed.  </P> <P> "It's pretty strange when you think one woman is your mother and you find out  it's another woman," he said. "That lady who used to bring you Lincoln Logs?  Yeah, I remember her. Well, for good reason, son. That's your mom."  </P> <P> Begley said he gets along great with his mother, whom he knew as a family  friend during his childhood.  </P> <P> The name of the woman was not revealed.  </P></p>

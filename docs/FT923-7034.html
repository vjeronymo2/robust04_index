			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Latin American banana producers attack EC quota plan LATIN AMERICAN banana-producing countries have issued a joint statement opposing the European Commission's plan to impose quotas on banana imports from January 1, 1993. Ministers and other delegates from eight countries meeting in Bogota criticised the commission's proposal for violating the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and undermining efforts to open up Latin American economies. Mr Juan Manuel Santos, Colombia's foreign trade minister, said a quota system combined with the 20 per cent tariff could cost Latin American exporters USDollars 5.6bn over the next 10 years. The exporters are launching a diplomatic offensive to persuade European countries to reject the quota proposal. 'We have sufficient allies to veto it,' said Mr Santos, referring to the six EC members who do not apply any import restrictions now. The Latin Americans are taking the banana issue to the Gatt on the grounds that a quota system is illegal. They are also sending a letter to Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, setting out their position. According to the joint statement, the commission's plan would upset world banana trading, raise the price of the fruit for European consumers and damage Latin American economies by reducing export income and putting jobs at risk. At present, the exporters' group includes the Central American countries and Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. Mr Santos said that Mexico was expected to join soon and the group might be able to unite all the remaining Latin American producers. All the countries would accept higher tariff levels rather than face quotas. Colombia and Ecuador are particularly indignant over the EC's treatment of them as 'transnational' exporters, when most of their marketing is in national hands. Between them, the two countries supply about 20 per cent of EC banana imports; last year Ecuador earned more than USDollars 700m and Colombia USDollars 380m from world-wide banana sales.</p>

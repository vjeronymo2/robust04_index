			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Tax breaks for US film studios criticised A BRITISH media lawyer has criticised the big US film studios for extracting large sums of money from the UK film market and paying very low levels of tax. Mr Michael Henry, of lawyers Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones, has sent a report on the industry to the National Heritage Department, the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of Fair Trading. In it he calls for action over what he sees as a distortion of the market. Mr Henry argues that between 1988 and 1991, the six main US studios had a turnover of Pounds 1.3bn in the UK but paid an average of 1.33 per cent tax on profits and remitted royalties. The report says that the total UK tax paid by United International Pictures was 0.5 per cent. Mr Henry argues: 'It is my view that a direct causal link exists between the parlous state of the UK production sector and the activities of the US majors, whose combined market share exceeds 85 per cent of the UK market.' The payment from the UK of royalties to overseas owners of intellectual property rights is normally subject to the deduction of withholding tax  - something that the film industry is exempt from. 'It is clearly in the public interest that action should be taken to remove the imbalance in the market,' says Mr Henry, who would like the government to reappraise the tax position of the UK subsidiaries of US film companies and consider imposing a withholding tax on domestic remittances of royalties. Other possible courses of action, he suggests, would include a competition investigation into the film industry or adoption of a scheme for voluntary investment in the UK film sector. The Motion Picture Association of America yesterday said its members paid all the taxes they were liable for under British law and under the double taxation agreement between the UK and the US. The association also pointed out that a large proportion of the money in UK film production was US money.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Steven Wolf joins Air France Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, the loss-making airline, has appointed Mr Steven Wolf, former head of United Airlines, the US carrier, as an adviser to help him implement his cost-cutting strategy. The appointment of Mr Wolf, who orchestrated a rationalisation and recovery programme at United Airlines before engineering an employee buy-out earlier this year, coincides with the launch of a reorganisation at Air France. The French group, which made heavy losses in 1993 and was crippled by last autumn's strike against a previous cost-cutting plan, will on Thursday unveil a new corporate structure to separate international and domestic operations. Mr Blanc intends to shed 5,000 jobs over the next three years, to reduce the Air France fleet and to implement a pay freeze. Financial analysts welcomed the arrival of Mr Wolf, who is a highly-experienced airline executive. He held posts at American Airlines, Pan Am and Continental, as well as United. However, the Air France unions yesterday criticised his appointment. The CFDT, one of the largest unions, condemned the decision to appoint 'an icon of airline deregulation' to the state-controlled airline. The union said Mr Wolf was the 11th external senior appointment to Air France since the announcement of the rationalisation, and described such hirings as 'shocking' at a time of job losses.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wu Yilin (0124 5030 2651): "Support the Work of </F> Deputies and Welcome Their Supervision"]    [Text] Not long ago, the municipal party committee held a  study and report meeting. Liu Zheng, deputy secretary general  of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, was  invited to deliver a report on the study of the "PRC law on the  people's deputies to the NPC and the local people's congresses  at all levels."    Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, and Wang Daming attended the report  meeting. Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party  committee, presided over the report meeting.    In his report, Comrade Liu Zheng vividly expounded the  nature, substance, and meaning of the "Law on Deputies" in line  with China's fundamental political system--the people's congress  system. He pointed out: The "Law on Deputies" is one of the  laws related to the people's congress system. This law has  further defined the legal status of deputies and specifically  stipulated the work of deputies during the people's congress  session, their activities after the conclusion of the session,  and the guarantee for deputies to exercise their duties. The  promulgation of the "Law on Deputies" has provided a legal basis  for deputies to exercise their functions, authority, and  obligation, and to give play to their role. It is also  conducive to further improving China's people's congress system,  promoting socialist democracy and the legal system, and  guaranteeing the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and  modernization.    Addressing the report meeting, Comrade Chen Xitong pointed  out: In order to promote the study of leading cadres at all  levels, the municipal party committee has held several study and  report meetings. To strengthen study, the most fundamental  thing for the leading comrades to do is to study well Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and Volume No. 3 of "The Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" and to conscientiously study the "decision" of the  third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and a  series of supporting laws, regulations, and methods related to  the "decision." Only by conscientiously studying the law can we  implement it and accelerate the establishment of the socialist  market economic structure.    Comrade Chen Xitong also pointed out: All county and  district end-of-term elections have ended recently. Leading  cadres at all levels should pay attention to studying and  implementing the "Law on Deputies," and the relevant substance  of the People's Congress system.    We must clarify that if party committees and governments at  all levels want to do their work well, they must respect  deputies, support their work, and give play to their role. The  people's deputies represent the interests and will of the masses  of people. Practice has proved that if greater attention and  support are paid to deputies, they can carry out their work more  smoothly and do more things in conformity with the will of the  people. We should welcome supervision from deputies and regard  their supervision as their help to the work of the party  committees and governments at all levels. This will help us to  do a better job in serving the people and realizing the  objective of becoming well-off three years ahead of schedule.    Leading comrades of the municipal party committee, the  municipal people's congress standing committee, the municipal  government, the municipal committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, and the municipal discipline  inspection commission, principal responsible comrades of  departments, committees and offices of the municipal government  and of various districts, counties, and bureaus, and principal  responsible comrades of the municipal Trade Union Council, the  Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation also  attended the meeting.</p>

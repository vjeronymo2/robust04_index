			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Files recording the  Japanese massacre in Nanjing in 1937, which were discovered here  in late 1992, are expected to be published shortly.    The massacre record, more than 20,000 words long, was kept  in  the files of the formerly Japanese Manchu Railway Company. It  was unearthed at the end of 1992 in an archive in Shenyang,  capital of north-east China's Liaoning Province.    The record, in Japanese, says that the Shanghai office of  the  Japanese company took part in burying more than 30,000 of the  people killed in the massacre.    It notes that over 600 men participated in the burying,  which  took three months.    "It was a hard job," it says, and refers to the problems  caused by warm weather.    According to the record, the population of the city of  Nanjing dropped drastically by 80 percent after the Japanese  occupation.    The Japanese railway company was a colonialist institution  set up by the Japanese invaders in north-east China at the end  of Japanese-Russian War, mainly engaged in railway management,  and also involved in mining, industry and agriculture, politics,  economy and military affairs.    It was responsible for economic take-overs for the Japanese  aggressors and provided a large amount of war materials for them.</p>

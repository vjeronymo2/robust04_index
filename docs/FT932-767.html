			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Markets: And one final thing, Eddie . . . - London / (as dictated to Maggie Urry) Internal Memorandum From: the Governor To: the Governor-elect Dear Eddie, I thought I would just jot down a few notes to help you with the handover this week. I wouldn't want all my good work over the past 10 years to be wasted because you couldn't unlock the filing cabinet. Inflation Getting inflation down has been my top priority since I first sat at this desk on July 1 1983. Although I say it myself, I have done rather well, though those politicians keep trying to take the credit. Perhaps that is an argument for an independent central bank. Now, don't you go messing it up. Promising to take a pay freeze yourself was a good wheeze - and an incentive to keep the screws on - and keeping the Jag rather than taking the new Roller was another, although your successor might not like the precedent. Above all else, don't let base rates come down too soon. You saw how the stock market got worked up on Monday at the thought of a rate cut - up 24 points on the day and through 2,900 again. One good thing about Lamont's resignation speech: he blew the whistle on political interest rate cuts, so you ought to be able to fend off Downing Street for a while. Clarke was sounding a bit more reasonable in that interview, but don't trust 'em is my advice. Currencies Afraid I'm handing over to you at a rather busy time, with the European currencies all over the place. That bust-up between our friends in Germany and France has really stirred things up. My advice is to keep your head down and let them fight it out. And if sterling appreciates a bit against the D-Mark, never mind - it will all help on the inflation front. The economy Some better news on this one. I am really quite optimistic that the recovery is getting going. Those first-quarter GDP figures on Tuesday, showing an upward revision from the provisional number to +0.9 per cent (excluding oil and gas), are encouraging. My main concern is that recession in Europe could drag our economy back down again later in the year. But exports have been doing rather well. So, you can use that as further evidence that an interest rate cut isn't necessary. The Budget deficit I wouldn't presume to give you any advice about funding; after all, you've been telling me how to do it for years. Seems to me it's going pretty well so far this year, with another auction coming up on Wednesday, despite the size of the deficit. Of course, there's BT3 as well. And after Warburg's success with the Zeneca rights issue this week - 86 per cent take-up, not bad - it ought to get away. But whenever you're talking to the politicians, do remind them that funding is one thing but the real solution is to cut the deficit. We just can't go on living beyond our means like this. Clarke's hints that taxes could go up aren't enough in my view. They've really got to cut benefits - so long as the current generation of pensioners is protected. Corporate sector Company finances are better than they have been for years. Borrowing is at a five-year low, according to the statistics put out this week; and, with a bit of luck, the corporate sector should move into a cash-flow surplus this year. But mind your eye, is my advice. There are still a lot of difficult situations around with heavily-borrowed companies - the ones that were in too much of a mess to have rights issues. We should know whether Gerald Ronson's Heron outfit has got its creditors on-side this week, but you might still have to do a bit of nudging on that one. That Spring Ram episode was a bit nasty, too, and it's not as though it is the only company recently to issue two profit warnings in as many months. I sometimes wonder if these companies have any idea what's going on in their businesses. How different from life at the Bank. Another potential problem that needs to be headed off is how companies are going to finance the recovery once it gets moving. The banks have suffered so badly in the recession that they can't lend too much risk capital. You need to find a way to let their profits recover - let lending margins widen somehow - but this is a really tricky one, politically. I'm sure you understand my concern as a former, and perhaps future, clearing banker. The stock market I fear that the market is getting a bit frothy, although it had settled down again by the end of the week. Some of the brokers have been pushing up their forecasts for the Footsie at the year-end on the hopes of faster earnings growth than they had thought. I'd feel a bit easier if they would wait for some firmer evidence first. The stock exchange You need to keep a watchful eye on the chaps at the Tower, too. Everything's been going wrong lately, what with the Taurus mess and all. They seem to be getting a bit lax about company announcements, as well. Did you notice the way shares in Rothmans and Dunhill jumped on Tuesday when their controlling shareholder, Richemont, said it was going to re-organise the businesses? The exchange really should have made sure that announcement came out after the market closed, or else suspended the shares first. The EBRD Oh dear. Jacques Attali's resignation throws that up in the air - and after all the trouble we took to make sure the blessed bank came to London. Try to use your influence to get a sensible replacement. Well, that's about everything I think. I've left the keys in the top right-hand drawer. Remember, if you can stick it out without too many disasters, you collect the peerage at the end. And, as the man said, don't let the b*****s get you down. Hope to see you down at Dunguvnin sometime. ROBIN</p>

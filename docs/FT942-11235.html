			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lombard forced to cut float price The impact of a falling UK stock market has forced Lombard Insurance to reduce its flotation price. The company yesterday announced it will issue Pounds 33m of shares through a placing and intermediaries offer valuing it at Pounds 57m, compared with the initial target of 'at least Pounds 65m'. At the issue price of 160p, the shares are being sold on a p/e of 9.3 and dividend yield of 6 per cent, based on the prospectus forecast of pro forma Pounds 6.2m profits for the year to June 1994. Even at the reduced price, brokers said the reception had been lukewarm, reflecting concerns over increasing competition in the insurance market, and the anticipated impact of weakening bond and equity prices. Mr Andrew Laing, managing director, said there was no downward pressure on premiums, as 'so much capacity went out in 1991 and 1992, that there is no appetite for competition for the sake of it'. Lombard will raise Pounds 16m after expenses and the redemption of preference shares. The management buy-out team, which purchased Lombard from its parent Continental Inc in May 1993 for Pounds 32m, will also be amply rewarded. The shares begin trading on May 13. COMMENT Lombard is focused on the lower risk portion of the general insurance market, and has taken no exposure to London, let alone the US. The management is confident that it offers limited risk at good time of the cycle, but Lombard is in the sector of the market where everyone wants to be, and competition is tightening. Having been reduced by 10 per cent, the issue price looks more attractive, but institutions have shown little appetite for the placing. The shares look set for a lacklustre debut.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Arts: Lament for a lost warrior - Opera in Munich A youth barely out of his mother's arms rushes off to defend his people in war, has his first taste of sexual love, heads into battle and is slaughtered. Germany 1914? Britain in 1939? Bosnia today? It could be any - but all are wrapped into one in Siegfried Matthus's Die Weise von Liebe und Tod des Cornets Christoph Rilke (Cornet Christoph Rilke's Song of Love and Death), which has just joined the repertory at Munich's Gartnerplatztheater and will receive its British premiere in early October during Glyndebourne Touring Opera's London season. Matthus, born in 1934, had his talents honed by a long association with the Komische Oper and is now enjoying belated international recognition as one of Germany's most skilful, performable composers. Cornet Rilke is the sixth and most successful of his eight operas. Commissioned for the reopening of the Semper Opera House in Dresden in 1985, this 90-minute 'operatic vision' is based on Rainer Maria Rilke's prose poem about his 17th century ancestor, a young cavalry officer who died defending Europe against the heathen Turkish hordes. A copy of the poem accompanied German soldiers heading for the 1914-18 front, to inspire them with visions of a glorious death in defence of the Fatherland. Rilke later tried to disclaim this interpretation, saying his poem symbolised the way youth sheds its innocent bloom in the explosive breakthrough to adulthood. Without undermining the dream-like mood of romance, Matthus turns the poem into an anti-war elegy, framing it with an a capella Dies Irae inspired by the Allied destruction of Dresden. The poem itself offers little in the way of conventional dialogue or narrative. What it does provide is a sequence of thoughts, feelings and impressions, which Matthus clothes in music of lyrical power and dramatic sensibility. Horn, timpani and side-drum invoke the marching rhythms and regimental call to arms, while a flute quartet, two harps and xylophone summon the atmosphere of reverie, augmented by a mirage-like offstage chorus (reminiscent of the hallucinatory echoes of 'Grimes' in the final act of Britten's opera). The range of imagery Matthus draws from his 11 instrumentalists is wide - and even wider in the intricate choral parts, requiring absolute security of pitch and balance. With his undogmatic brand of serialism, subtly neo-romantic in effect, Matthus matches the emotional power of the poem without dissolving into kitsch. The Munich production, staged by Heinz Lukas-Kindermann in designs by Hans Hoffer and Anette Schroder was well sung and acted, but sometimes missed the mark in its choice of visual imagery. The performance began with a projection of the autograph of Rilke's poem and the appearance of a small boy with rocking horse and toy-banner; an unidentified man took a book out of his pocket and began to read. The action unfolded on a stage-wide staircase, populated by a row of outsize infantry boots in the opening march, a troupe of debauched revellers in the bacchanale, and visionary figures appearing from hidden doors during the Cornet's contemplative soliloquies. A giant upright chair dominated the mysterious love scene, which lacked dramatic focus. The finale, in which the Cornet awakes in a blazing castle before riding to his death, was mimed in an abstract glow of red light. In the title role - a breeches part shared by two mezzos, one of whom gives voice to the Cornet's inner thoughts - Annette Seiltgen and Sneshinka Awramowa sang beautifully and movingly. The Countess, which Matthus divides less convincingly between two sopranos, was elegantly portrayed by Evelyn Holzschuh and Ulrike Steinsky. Above all, the chorus-master Hans-Joachim Willrich and conductor Aleksander Kalajdzic deserve praise for their grasp of Matthus's idiom. So I enjoyed my visit to Munich's second opera house, where high standards can be appreciated at a fraction of the cost of the starrily-cast but sometimes barely-rehearsed festival performances across at the National Theater. The Gartnerplatztheater's repertory is refreshingly offbeat (with Weill's Street Scene also on this month's programme), and the building itself is a jewel.</p>

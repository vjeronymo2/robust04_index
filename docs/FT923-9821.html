			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / UK Company News: S&amp;P may downgrade ICI debt IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) of long-term debt has been placed under review for possible downgrade by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, following Thursday's announcement that the group may be divided into two separate public companies. Moody's, the other leading US rating agency, said it is expanding its review of the company's debt to include the rating implications of the split. Moody's placed ICI's debt under review for possible downgrade on July 15, prompted by increasing evidence of a slower pace of recovery in profitability. ICI's debt is currently rated AA- by S&amp;P and AA3 by Moody's. Although the future capital structures of the two companies has not been determined, S&amp;P expected 'a large portion of existing debt' to remain at ICI, which would then consist of the less profitable and more cyclical industrial chemical operations.</p>

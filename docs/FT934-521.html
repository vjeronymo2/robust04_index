			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Mercy's short shelf-life: Political capital and human suffering Unless you pay particularly close attention to the small print in the newspapers, you probably won't know who Faruk Catisbusic is. Seven-year-old Faruk was among the six children and one adult evacuated from central Bosnia this week for urgent medical treatment in the UK as part of Operation Angel. He is now in the Midlands Centre for Neurosurgery in Smethwick, recovering after an operation to remove shrapnel from his brain. Rather more familiar will be the name of Irma Hadzimuratovic. Irma's evacuation from Sarajevo became the subject of fleeting worldwide interest in August after Mr John Major, UK prime minister, intervened to offer the gravely injured girl a hospital bed in Britain. Mr Major's intervention sparked a much bigger evacuation drive, dubbed Operation Irma, to airlift people needing medical treatment from Bosnia to the UK, Sweden, Ireland, the US and several other European and Islamic countries. Newspapers devoted their pages to reports on the plight of children and other non-combatants in the former Yugoslav republic. TV and radio news bulletins led on little else for much of the week. Yet this week's Operation Angel evacuation has received only cursory coverage in the UK media. The tabloid newspapers have given at least as much space to the video link-up between British soldiers in the former Yugoslavia and their families at home. The contrast between the two evacuation operations could hardly be more striking. The first came in the middle of what is known as the 'the silly season'. With most politicians and many newspaper readers on holiday, there is often little of substance to report in August. A human interest story can attract much more attention than at busier periods of the year. So it was with the case of 'little Irma', as the wounded child became known. The five-year-old had suffered head, stomach and spinal injuries at the end of July in a random mortar attack by the Bosnian Serb army laying siege to Sarajevo. Her mother had been killed, and Irma seemed unlikely to recover from her injuries in primitive hospital conditions. The main stumbling block to her evacuation was the shortage of hospital beds available in other countries. Between April and August, only 90 people were evacuated from Bosnia on medical grounds. But a Sunday evening news report of Irma's plight on BBC television began to open doors. As calls poured into Downing Street, Mr Major ordered an RAF Hercules to bring back Irma, her father and sister. By Monday evening, Irma was in London's Great Ormond Street children's hospital, undergoing a three-hour operation. With a further 20 refugees on their way to Britain, the prime minister's intervention was followed by other countries. More than 2,000 hospital beds have since been offered in more than 20 countries. Ms Sylvana Foa of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says that the change in attitudes after 16 months of indifference from western countries was like 'day following night'. But Irma and the 41 other evacuees flown out that week were not the only people to benefit. For Mr Major, Operation Irma marked a turning point in a year when good news had been in short supply. The exit of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism, the battle to ratify the Maastricht treaty, the slow economic recovery, and hefty tax increases announced in the spring Budget had culminated in two Tory by-election defeats in the formerly safe seats of Newbury and Christchurch. The prime minister could now bathe in the approbation of those who welcomed the lead he had given through this humanitarian gesture. The goodwill generated by Mr Major's intervention on behalf of the Bosnian refugees was, however, dented after it was reported that Downing Street was unhappy with the preponderance of adults in the airlift. To the UNHCR's Ms Foa, it appeared that Mr Major wanted to see photogenic children rather than the adults who made up the bulk of those needing evacuation. She accused Britain of using Sarajevo as a 'supermarket'. Further criticism followed about the preference of western governments for high-profile evacuations of sick children over more basic, cost-effective aid to those treating the injured on the ground. Even the families of the evacuees called for international military action to stop the fighting which caused the suffering, rather than palliative rescue missions. Four months on, the plight of the people of Bosnia no longer catches the attention of the public or the media. Christmas has its own silly season, but it tends to focus on domestic concerns. Charities can raise money for the homeless in Britain, but know that it is a bad time to involve the public in suffering in far-off countries. The success of the rock singer Bob Geldof's 'Do they know it's Christmas', the Band Aid record that raised Pounds 8m for Ethiopian famine victims in 1984, was the exception that proved the rule. Most of the politicians who jumped on the bandwagon of Operation Irma now want Bosnia's government to accept the settlement brokered by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators. Mr Major, over the worst of his troubles, looks instead to peace in Northern Ireland - a much greater prize in UK political terms. As for Irma Hadzimuratovic, she remains in intensive care on a ventilator in Great Ormond Street hospital. Like Faruk Catisbusic and the 400 other evacuees brought out of Bosnia since August, Irma is the beneficiary of intense media interest in individual suffering. But thousands more are stranded in the middle of a civil war which shows no sign of an early end.</p>

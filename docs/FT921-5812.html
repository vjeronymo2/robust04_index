			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Perez faces pressure to resign POLITICAL pressure is mounting in Venezuela for President Carlos Andres Perez to resign, and for his three-year-old government to take other radical measures aimed at reforming the country's democratic system. Former President Rafael Caldera, founder of the principal opposition political party, the Christian Democrats, called on Mr Perez to step down in order to help resolve Venezuela's 'crisis'. Mr Perez, whose government is not scheduled to leave office until February next year, said in a nationwide radio and TV broadcast at the weekend he had no intention of leaving his post. The calls for Mr Perez to resign came just over three weeks after loyal units of the Venezuelan armed forces quashed an attempted coup by heavily-armed army units. Early yesterday, a small group of soldiers led by an army lieutenant forcibly removed sub-machine guns, rifles and ammunition from an armoury at Fort Tiuna in Caracas, according the Ministry of Defence. The incident illustrates the ferment still existing among the armed forces.</p>

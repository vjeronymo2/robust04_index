			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Mirror in the frame The administrators who control 55 per cent of Mirror Group Newspapers' shares will be furiously puzzling about when to dispose of their stake. They must be happy enough with management's ferocious assault on MGN's costs and the progress of its shares. But they are not long-term shareholders. And a surging stock market, a series of suspiciously upbeat stockbrokers' circulars and a sprightly set of interim results next month could prove an irresistible temptation to sell. The counter argument is that nothing will be lost by waiting. Indeed, MGN's shares should be worth considerably more next year. The company's aggressive management is steadily improving earnings. Any pick-up in advertising volumes adds that splash of recovery appeal. But at some point the market will switch its focus from the short-term profits bounce to the long-term sales trend. Here, the outlook is far less rosy. Tabloid newspaper sales are in decline. The Daily Mirror's circulation has fallen 40 per cent over the past 30 years. News International has recently added to the pressure by cutting The Sun's cover price to 20p. Although this does not appear to have damaged MGN greatly, it must have ruled out any price rises for a while. Meanwhile, the possible imposition of value-added tax on newspapers in the November Budget threatens margins. Cyclically depressed newsprint prices have only one way to move. On the basis that it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive, the administrators may well conclude that this autumn would be a good time to sell.</p>

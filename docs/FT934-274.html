			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Government to give funds for new selective schools The government yesterday announced that it would provide funds for new selective grammar schools in a radical extension of its policy of encouraging 'choice and diversity' in education. This departure from the policy of building comprehensive schools, in force for about 25 years, was immediately condemned by the Labour party. Individual promoters, which the government expects will include parents, religious interest groups and business organisations, will be allowed to establish new schools, with 85 per cent of the capital building costs met by the government. The balance must come from the promoters. This is the same financial requirement that must currently be met by churches when funding voluntary-aided schools. However, the new schools will be grant-maintained and funded directly by the government, rather than by local authorities. Mr Robin Squire, the schools minister, said: 'Promoters may propose different types of schools. For example, new grant-maintained schools may be selective, or have partial selection. They could be single-sex or have a single-sex stream.' Existing independent schools which are in financial difficulties will also be allowed to apply for grant-maintained status. Methods of selection must be published, and approved by Mr John Patten, the education secretary. Written academic examinations would be acceptable, although the department stressed this did not mean a return to the '11-plus' system. Schools will also be allowed to select pupils on the basis of aptitude in specialisms, such as technology, music or dance. Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said: 'Labour has consistently warned that Mr Patten has a hidden agenda to reintroduce selective education. Today that agenda has been made explicit.' She said: 'Selective education favours the very few at the expense of the vast majority. Children are labelled, often wrongly, with the majority being classified as failures.' Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'The government is putting the education of the children of this country up for grabs and it's not good enough. They are asking for money from industry which it's probably unable to give.' The measures are outlined in draft guidance for promoters, on which the government has asked for comments by the end of next month. The draft refers only to building new schools rather than converting existing schools. According to the education department, there is a need for new schools in the south-west, Hampshire and the south-east. However, school administrators questioned this. The Association of County Councils, which represents rural local education authorities, said it found the announcement surprising as 'the secretary of state has been telling us there are millions of surplus places in existing schools'.</p>

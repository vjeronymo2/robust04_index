			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Confident Meyer rises to Pounds 42m - Sales currently 13% ahead and benefits of cost cuts coming through Fears that the UK economy might be overheating were dismissed yesterday by Meyer International, the timber and building products group, which said it had perceived only modest and steady growth over the last year. Mr John Dobby, who took over as chief executive following the departure of Mr Richard Jewson in September, said he had seen no evidence of inflation getting out of control. 'We are seeing a steady recovery and the pace of that recovery is not accelerating,' he said. Sales were running 13 per cent ahead of last year, against a 9 per cent increase for the whole of 1993. Yet they were still substantially lower than the peaks of the 1980s. Mr Dobby was speaking at the announcement of the results for the year ended March 31 1994, which showed a better-than-expected profits improvement from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 41.6m. Sales were 10 per cent higher at Pounds 1.2bn. Benefits were being seen from two years of cost-cutting, following the ill-fated move into plumbing and heating in the late 1980s. With costs across the group rising 6 per cent compared with the 10 per cent sales increase, much of the turnover improvement had dropped straight to profits. The UK builders merchant business, Jewson, improved operating profits by 78 per cent on an 8 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 425m. Sales on a like-for-like basis rose by 9 per cent, including a 4 per cent price increase. Forest products benefited from a 10 per cent increase in softwood prices over the year. Profits rose by 63 per cent to Pounds 19.6m on sales 21 per cent higher at Pounds 389.5m. The Dutch business returned operating profits of Fl 36.7m, 47 per cent ahead of last year. Meyer's debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds fell from 50 per cent to 19 per cent, largely because of the Pounds 70m cash call last year. The final dividend, cut from 16.5p last year, was increased by 18 per cent to 6.6p, for a total 12.5 per cent up at 10.8p. Earnings more than doubled from 10.1p to 24p. Also announced was the appointment of Mr Richard Miles, ex-md of Steetley, as a non-executive director. COMMENT Meyer is doing everything possible to regain the investment community's favour. It stresses caution and is focusing on organic growth. Yet it remains shadowed by its former ambitions. News that Meyer is thinking about returning to plumbing and heating, albeit more cautiously through specialist counters in its branches, left many feeling somewhat stunned. The economic recovery will give great momentum to profits but, in the longer term, this is more of management play. Given its recent history, the jury is still out. Forecasts are for Pounds 57m, with a prospective p/e of 14 times.</p>

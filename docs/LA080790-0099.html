			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 FIRMS LIMIT GAS TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS;  </P> <P> ENERGY: ARCO, TEXACO AND CHEVRON SAY THEY ARE ENSURING SUPPLY FOR THEIR OWN  STATIONS. CRITICS SAY THEY ARE STOCKPILING TO PUSH UP PRICES.  </P> <P> In a move that independent gasoline distributors say could boost gasoline  prices further, at least three major oil companies have restricted gasoline  sales to the firms.  </P> <P> Atlantic Richfield, Texaco and Chevron have limited sales to the distributors,  the middle men who in turn sell to independent service stations. The  restrictions have sent the distributors scrambling for alternate gasoline  sources and prompted further criticism of an industry facing widening charges  of price gouging.  </P> <P> "It's a reminder that we're held hostage by the industry and they'll use any  excuses to raise prices," said Lee Ross, president of the California  Independent Oil Marketers Assn. "To me, this is strictly a price move that is  motivated by exploitation."  </P> <P> Other critics contend that the restrictions are a way that oil companies are  trying to stockpile reserves in anticipation of higher oil prices.  </P> <P> "Everybody is trying to hold onto supply because it might be worth more  tomorrow," said consumer advocate Ed Rothschild with Citizen Action in  Washington. "They're acting as if there's going to be a shortage and are  creating one."  </P> <P> Gordon Wallace, owner of South Bay Petroleum Co., said Arco cut his allocation  by 250,000 gallons a month, a reduction of 30%. The move is forcing him to find  new suppliers in a frenzied market.  </P> <P> "It's an unfair cost and expense to these independent business people," he  said.  </P> <P> Arco, the leading gasoline retailer on the West Coast, said it restricted sales  to independent wholesalers last week to ensure adequate reserves for its  company stations.  </P> <P> "These people have the capability of taking all of our product if we let them,"  said George Babikian, president of Arco Products Co., Atlantic Richfield's  refining and marketing division.  </P> <P> Referring to similar restrictions after the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska,  Fereidun Fesharaki, an oil market expert at the government-funded East-West  Center in Honolulu, said other companies likely will follow with restrictions  similar to those by Arco, Texaco and Chevron.  </P> <P> "Arco usually is the leader in this kind of activity," he said. "I'd be  surprised if other companies didn't follow."  </P> <P> The restrictions allow oil companies to hedge against uncertainties, Fesharaki  said.  </P> <P> "If you can reduce the commitment at present, you are more flexible as a  business," he said.  </P> <P> Independent wholesalers supply about 20% of all fuel sold in the United States,  according to the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America.  </P> <P> Arco said it funnels about 18% of its business through independent  distributors.  </P></p>

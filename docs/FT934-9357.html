			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Vietnam promised Dollars 1.86bn in aid VIETNAM was yesterday promised Dollars 1.86bn (Pounds 1.23bn) in development aid from foreign governments and multilateral agencies, in a move which marks a further step in the country's return to the international financial community. After the first meeting of a World Bank-headed donors' conference for Vietnam, Mr Phan Van Khai, its vice-prime minister, said the money would be largely spent on education, child nutrition and infrastructure. The World Bank agreed with these priorities, but stressed Vietnam needed to tackle its 'quite high' population increase of 2.2 per cent a year. Mr Phan expected the aid programme would lead companies to increase investment in Vietnam. Hanoi had already licensed some 700-800 investments worth Dollars 7bn. More than half the promised aid, mainly in the form of soft loans, will come from other governments, with Japan accounting for the largest amount, of Dollars 550m. Other prominent donor governments are France, Britain, South Korea and Australia. The rest of the aid will come from multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The one predictable absence from the aid consortium is the US, Hanoi's antagonist during the Vietnam war. But Japan as the main regional power, and France as the region's former colonial power, have stepped in to wipe out Vietnam's debt arrears to the World Bank and the ADB. This has allowed Hanoi to reach agreement, with US acquiescence, on a Dollars 223m standby credit with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF accord in turn opens the way for Vietnam to start discussions with the Paris club of official creditors in early December on rescheduling payments on some Dollars 500m of its debt, Mr Phan confirmed yesterday. The country's total debt stands at Dollars 2bn. Mr Phan said Vietnam would need considerable further aid, if it was to meet its goal of doubling its national income by the year 2000. The vice-prime minister did, however, bridle at questions about human rights, stressing Vietnam had its own Asian interpretation of such rights which differed from western concepts.</p>

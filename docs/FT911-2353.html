			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: US steel companies suffer from recession THREE leading US steel companies yesterday reported first quarter losses as the US recession hit demand for their products, particularly in the automotive and consumer white goods markets. USX, the largest steel manufacturer in the US, reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 237m, or 94 cent a share, compared with net income of Dollars 176m, or 66 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. Sales were Dollars 4.5bn, against Dollars 4.7bn. The figures included Dollars 346m of one-time restructuring charges. Its steel business reported an operating loss of Dollars 502m, or Dollars 180m without restructuring charges, but its Marathon energy operations produced operating income of Dollars 229m, including a Dollars 24m restructuring charge, aided by a strong downstream performance. Mr Charles Corry, the chairman, said the downstream energy business should be helped by the coming summer driving season. No appreciable improvement in steel prices was expected until the second half, but the steel division's second quarter results were expected to improve. LTV, the third largest US steel group, reported a first quarter net loss of Dollars 46.3m on sales of Dollars 1.43bn, compared with income of Dollars 44.2m in the same period of last year on sales of Dollars 1.49bn. The loss per share was 46 cents, against earnings last year of 32 cents. LTV's steel operations reported a first quarter operating loss of Dollars 48.8m, before restructuring charges, compared with operating income of Dollars 41.1m in the first quarter of 1990. National Steel, the fifth largest US manufacturer, reported a net loss of Dollars 64.4m in the first quarter on sales of Dollars 524m, compared to a net loss of Dollars 4.2m on sales of Dollars 612m in 1990.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / OFT names life insurers giving zero refund after one year UK investors get no money back from more than a dozen life insurers if they stop Pounds 100-a-month, 10-year savings plans after only one year, according to unpublished figures collected by the Office of Fair Trading. Last month, the OFT published a report on the values returned by life offices to customers surrendering long-term policies early, and published figures for surrender values where a customer was paying Pounds 50 a month in premiums. The latest figures, which cover cases in which a customer could have paid Pounds 1,200 and yet be entitled to nothing if the policy is cancelled after one year, underline why early surrender values are increasingly becoming an issue in the life industry. The life insurers offering a zero surrender value at the end of the first year for both types of savings policies considered by the OFT are: London &amp; Manchester; London Life; MGM; Refuge; Royal Life; Tunbridge Wells; Abbey Life; Allied Dunbar; Confederation Life; Cornhill Insurance; Irish Life; Midland Life; Reliance Mutual and Royal Life. Although the surrender values offered by some of these insurers in subsequent years compare more favourably with those given by their competitors, the information available suggests that more people stop paying their premiums in the first year than in any later year. Estimates put first-year lapse rates in the 17 per cent-23 per cent range. Mr Mike Bateman, MGM sales and marketing director, said the company was considering changes to the surrender value in the first year. Eleven per cent of the company's savings plans were surrendered in the first year, he said. Mr Peter Kelly, life marketing director for Allied Dunbar, said the proportion of this type of savings plan surrendered in the first year was 'significantly less' than 10 per cent. Mr Nigel Stephens, marketing actuary for Confederation Life, said that while such policies had previously been sold for the long term, early surrender rates were now at historically high levels.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "African News" segment of the "Focus on Africa" </F> program]    [Text] The United Nations' World Food Program [WFP] in  Liberia is suspending its deliveries of food aid to Tubmanburg,  the headquarters of the divided ULIMO [United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction. A WFP spokesman  said it was acting because of the poor security situation and  threats to its personnel. He said three aid vehicles had been  seized by Mandingo supporters of Alhaji Koromah, and three  others looted by Krahn of Koromah's rival, Roosevelt Johnson.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Herminio Blanco Mendoza, under secretary for  international trade negotiations of the Commerce and Industrial  Development Secretariat, appeared today before the Senate of the  Republic to explain the content and progress of the free trade  agreement signed by Costa Rica and Mexico. During his speech,  the under secretary explained that the trade agreement will  encourage investment and generate better paying jobs for  Mexicans. The agreement, he said, will be particularly  attractive to small- and medium-sized businesses.    When members of the Senate Trade Committee asked him about  the current state of trade between Mexico and the United States,  Herminio Blanco reported that Mexican exports to the United  States totaled $4.2 billion and that Mexico's trade balance  deficit is $83 million. Herminio Blanco described this as a  fairly well-balanced bilateral trade relationship. The under  secretary admitted that there are still a number of problems  that need to be addressed.    [Begin Blanco recording] Obviously, paperwork and  bureaucracy  are always a problem because they reduce competitiveness. We  have fought against this throughout the Salinas administration,  but there is still plenty of work to do. In terms of the  trade issue along the border, I must say there has been  progress. There has been progress, and I am sure we can advance  even further to allow border retailers to successfully compete  against the large commercial chains on the other side of the  border. [end recording]    He concluded by saying that Mexico cannot limit itself to  trade with its North American partners. He announced that in  addition to the free trade agreement signed with Costa Rica,  other agreements will be signed in June with Colombia and  Venezuela, and that Mexico is currently involved in negotiations  with Bolivia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  This will give us access the entire Central American market  with its 30 million inhabitants and $7.8 billion in total  imports.</p>

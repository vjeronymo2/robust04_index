			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICKERS CLEARS A HURDLE;  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD: SHE UPSETS FARMER-PATRICK DESPITE STUMBLING NEAR THE FINISH.  </P> <P> Janeene Vickers has excellent speed and is stronger than most women running the  400-meter hurdles. But in Saturday's finals of the USA/Mobil National Track and  Field Championships, her role was clear.  </P> <P> Sandra Farmer-Patrick, owner of the U.S. record (53.37 seconds), was the star,  and if all went well, Vickers would push Farmer-Patrick down the stretch and  finish a close second.  </P> <P> That's what made Vickers' 54.80-second first-place finish, the fourth-fastest  time by an American, one of the biggest upsets of the three-day meet.  </P> <P> Vickers was followed by Farmer-Patrick (55.10), Schowonda Williams (55.61) and  Victoria Fulcher (56.06).  </P> <P> According to Vickers' coach, Bob Kersee, the game plan was for Vickers to lead  at the eighth hurdle, then use her tremendous speed to close out the race.  </P> <P> "I told her, 'Don't worry about being in a tie with Sandra at the 10th hurdle,'  " Kersee said. "Nobody can run down Janeene in the last 50 meters."  </P> <P> At least half the game plan worked.  </P> <P> At the eighth hurdle, Vickers led, but she couldn't pull away. In fact,  Farmer-Patrick was slowly gaining, and as they neared the 10th hurdle, it was  nearly a dead heat.  </P> <P> But Vickers has a history of problems clearing the 10th hurdle going back to  her freshman year at UCLA.  </P> <P> In the 1988 NCAA championships, Vickers surprisingly took the lead going into  the 10th hurdle, but blew it when she tensed up and lost her timing -- "I was  in the lead and I just wanted to take off" -- and fell going over the hurdle.  </P> <P> The same thing almost happened again Saturday.  </P> <P> Vickers stuttered-stepped just before reaching the 10th hurdle, but she cleared  it without incident, then stumbled.  </P> <P> Farmer-Patrick gained a step and appeared primed for victory. But Vickers  quickly regained her composure, and with one final burst, outsprinted Patrick  to the finish.  </P> <P> "I had no idea where she was," Vickers said. "I was just running for my life  because I knew she was coming.  </P> <P> "I knew she was going to dig down, and the odds were that she was going to  catch me. You've got to close your eyes and go for it."  </P> <P> The victory was a big one for Vickers, a two-time NCAA champion who will travel  to the Goodwill Games in Seattle next month.  </P> <P> "Today it was a matter of confidence and focusing on what I had done before.  This is a dream come true," she said.  </P> <P> Despite the loss, Farmer-Patrick said that she is confident that she will do  well in the Goodwill Games.  </P> <P> "It was a good race," Farmer-Patrick said. "I really can't make any excuses. My  strength was there, and after another two or three weeks, I think I'll be  definitely ready for the Goodwill Games -- without a doubt."  </P> <P> Farmer-Patrick, who set her record at this meet last year, was positioned in  the seventh lane.  </P> <P> "I was in lane seven, so it was hard to see my competition," Farmer-Patrick  said. "I thought I was in good shape. Then I came of the final curve and saw  everybody in my race. I was surprised. I really can't make any excuses."  </P> <P> While the women's 400-meter hurdles went to an unlikely winner, the javelin  ended quite predictably.  </P> <P> Karin Smith, a three-time Olympian in the event, won her sixth TAC championship  with a throw of 206 feet 3 inches, outdistancing her nearest rival by more than  12 feet.  </P> <P> For world-class women's javelin throwers, the average age is 26, which might  leave one wondering if the 34-year-old Smith has thought about retiring soon.  </P> <P> For Smith, it's a regular question and a most annoying one.  </P> <P> "No," she says flatly. "In fact, I think I can better my (personal record)."  </P></p>

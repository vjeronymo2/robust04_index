			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: 3M registers first annual profit reverse since 1985 MINNESOTA, Mining &amp; Manufacturing (3M), the St Paul, Minnesota-based conglomerate, has registered its first full-year decline in earnings since 1985. Net 1991 income fell to Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 5.26 a share, from Dollars 1.3bn, or Dollars 5.91, in 1990. Annual sales of the group, whose interests range from office supplies and industrial materials to health care products, were up by 2.5 per cent to Dollars 13.34bn, from Dollars 13.02bn in 1990. Mr ID DeSimone, chairman, said a weak global economy was the main reason for the company's poorer performance, though higher research and development spending and depreciation expense also affected profits. Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 259m, or Dollars 1.18, down 12.2 per cent from Dollars 295m, or Dollars 1.34, last year. Currency fluctuations shaved 7 cents per share off the last quarter's results, and lower non-operating income cut them another 9 cents. Fourth-quarter sales were down to Dollars 3.22bn from Dollars 3.28bn for the year-ago period. The US recession continued to hold back domestic demand for 3M products, but foreign demand was relatively robust. 3M's US sales declined by 1 per cent, while foreign sales rose by 6 per cent. Mr DeSimone said he had 'yet to see evidence of meaningful economic recovery' in the US, and he did not expect to see a significant earnings improvement until the second half of the year. But with better economic growth predicted for foreign markets, Mr DeSimone believes the company will grow faster abroad.</p>

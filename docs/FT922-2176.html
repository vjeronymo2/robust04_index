			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (7): Brighter prospects - Electronic Mail ELECTRONIC mail has had a rough press over the years. It arrived in Europe in the early 1980s, to the mildest of fanfares, only to be overshadowed almost immediately by the phenomenal success of the facsimile machine. The few press reports there were tended to concentrate on how awkward electronic mail (or 'e-mail') was to use compared with facsimile or other disadvantages such as how information - or even worse, usage accounts - could fall prey to hackers. In one notable case in 1986, Prince Philip's electronic mailbox on British Telecom's Prestel service was hacked. In another, just last year, hackers managed to disrupt what should have been a public relations coup for e-mail when they filled an astronaut's mailbox with more than 80 messages, preventing the first e-mail message being sent between the Earth and the Space Shuttle Atlantis. And in Germany, the Hamburg-based Chaos group of hackers pulled off a series of stunts on Deutsche Bundespost Telekom's e-mail services which regularly earned them space on the front pages of German newspapers, until they decided to call it a day last year. Given all this bad publicity, it is not surprisingly that the take-up of electronic mail has been generally disappointing. Even in the US, for example, where e-mail was pioneered and still has the highest penetration, there are only about a million users compared to 6m users of fax terminals, 8m cellular phone users and almost 200m phone subscribers. What is worse for the industry, the income generated by e- mail users is substantially less than that from users of other communications technologies. For example, while the average US fax machine is used to run up a monthly phone bill of Dollars 90 and the average cellular phone user spends Dollars 75 a month, the average e-mail user spends only Dollars 25. But now it looks as if things may at last be looking up for electronic mail. In an era of personal communications, there is a promise that the idea of sending each other electronic correspondence may gain a new lease of life. E-mail's 'store and forward' nature - where the recipient decides when and where he or she wants to receive a message - is very compatible with the mobility and flexibility of the personal communications concept. New innovations are making it even more so. A big perceived drawback of e-mail systems has been incompatibility between many systems and the inability to send messages between users of different systems. New systems are being based on so-called open system principles, however. In particular, the X400 series of message handling system standards developed by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) during the 1980s are now forming the basis for e-mail systems which allow their users to communicate with users of other systems. Another ITU series of specifications, the X500 series, promises to extend this inter-system compatibility even further by providing a standard for electronic messaging directories - so that it is as easy to look up the correct dialling code and number for another e-mail user as it is for another telephone user. At the same time new, more sophisticated, software 'front-ends' are being developed for e-mail users so that they do not have to memorise complicated commands to access their mail or send messages. Many of these now exploit all the tricks of the computer trade such as windows and icons to make using e-mail as easy as using a facsimile terminal. But the icing on the cake, many observers are predicting, will be the ability to combine e-mail with highly portable computers and radio communications networks. Modems in portable computers have now become standard accessories. But these still require access to a fixed telephone line which can make their use while on the move awkward. Last year, however, US computer manufacturers IBM and NCR and the Japanese electronics giant Canon all introduced laptop computers with built-in radio communications facilities. At the same time, radio networks are being planned or built capable of supporting these kinds of terminals. In the UK, for example, Dowty, Hutchison and Ram have all launched or are in the process of launching mobile data services. Cellular radio mobile telephone networks are also capable of carrying data although not very well - fewer than 100,000 of the 8m mobile telephone users in the US transmit data via their cellular lines. A new technology being jointly developed by IBM and nine US cellular network operators promises to change this, however. By exploiting the idle moments of airtime between voice conversations, the group believes data rates of up to 19,200 bits of information a second can be achieved; on a par with the best fixed network dial-up modems. When it becomes available in the US, early next year, some e-mail experts are predicting a wireless electronic mail boom with a market passing the Dollars 1bn-a-year mark very soon.</p>

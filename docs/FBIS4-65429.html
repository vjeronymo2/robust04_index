			<p>BFN     [Text] New British High Commissioner David Madden arrived  in Cyprus this afternoon to assume his duties. In a statement  made at Larnaca Airport, he said that the efforts made in the  Cyprus issue must continue on the basis of the current process  of the confidence-building measures. David Madden reiterated  the British view that the confidence-building measures offer a  great deal to both communities and called on the Turkish Cypriot  side to realize this position so that the process can continue.    The new British high commissioner said that his country will  continue to encourage the two sides to implement the  confidence-building measures. On the consultations in Vienna,  he said he has not yet been fully briefed and that this will be  his first priority. He also announced that he will be received  by President Kliridhis on Tuesday [17 May], and that he will  listen to Mr. Kliridhis' views on the confidence-building  measures and the prospects for achieving progress.</p>

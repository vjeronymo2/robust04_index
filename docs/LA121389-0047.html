			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROTATOR CUFF INJURIES  </P> <P> Question: Anyone who follows sports for any length of time soon becomes as  interested in the hospital reports as in the statistics of the game. At some  time or other, it seems that every professional ball player is going to have an  injury, and one of the most popular ones today is the rotator cuff injury. Why  do so many ball players in so many different sports have a problem with this?  </P> <P> Answer: There is some disagreement about whether rotator cuff injuries occur  because of some congenital problem or simply result from overuse. The injury  occurs in all athletes who repeatedly use an overhead arm motion: baseball  players, football quarterbacks, tennis players and swimmers.  </P></p>

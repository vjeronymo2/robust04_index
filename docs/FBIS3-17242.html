			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Kondratenko] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg, 24 Mar -- The elections to the St.  Petersburg city assembly, which took place on 20 and 21 March,  are not legally valid, the city's Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak  announced late on Wednesday evening, live on St. Petersburg  television and radio.    Analysis of their results is a task for the future, but one  thing is clear now -- we got something we did not expect, he  said. There was a definite negative attitude among voters to  the elections, in Sobchak's opinion. As a result, the elections  were recognized in only 25 out of 50 constituencies and even in  these no candidate got the required 50 percent of votes.  Therefore, in accordance with the law, there will be a second  round of voting in these constituencies on 3 April in which the  candidates who got the most votes will take part, the mayor  said. Elections will be held in the other constituencies in the  fall, when structures of public self government will be set up.    For the transition period it is planned to set up a public  council of elected deputies and of representatives of political  parties and blocs under the mayor's office, Sobchak said. This  is necessary to ensure that, while there is still no assembly,  the public may take part in examining all important issues in  the city.    This is a forced measure, Sobchak noted, but, as the saying  goes, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. This will  allow time to test the deputies to see what they are capable of  and then, perhaps in the fall, the citizens will make the right  choice.    Sobchak said it was a very dangerous situation when people  were being disappointed by democratic forms of state affairs.  The very fact of the elections that had taken place, he pointed  out, forces one to think seriously about the reasons for the  passivity of St. Petersburg's citizens. This is an abnormal  situation, the mayor said, and it confirms how deeply resented  the previous members of the city council were, whose deputies  were competing with one another to see who would cancel the most  decisions by the mayor, and effectively failed to tackle the  city's problems. In Sobchak's opinion, the reasons are also  that the present candidates did not have their own  individuality, they were unable to convince the electors, and  the latter naturally refused to give them their confidence.    The mayor believes the negative result is also a reflection  of the elections to the State Duma, but in the present situation  the city cannot be left without its own legislative assembly.  Therefore, Sobchak again appealed to the citizens to assume  responsibility and carry out their civic duty in the second  round of voting.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: P&amp;G sells portion of pulp, timber assets PROCTER &amp; Gamble, one of the largest US consumer products companies, yesterday announced the sale of a large portion of its pulp and timber business to Weyerhaeuser, the Tacoma-based timber group, for Dollars 600m. P&amp;G added that it was still reviewing proposals from potential acquirers for the rest of its pulp and timber business. The group announced in March that it planned to divest the pulp interests. The move - a step away from the traditional strategy of internal vertical integration - was designed to make the group 'more globally focused on core consumer businesses'. About half the pulp and timber division's output is sold to P&amp;G for its products. The assets which Weyerhaeuser is buying comprise pulp mills in Grande Prairie, Alberta and Oglethorpe, Georgia; three saw mills, also in Alberta and Georgia; and about 175,000 acres of timberland in Georgia. Yesterday, P&amp;G said it expected to work with Weyerhaeuser as a supplier of pulp from the mills that it was selling. The buyer is also expected to offer continued jobs to all employees at the Georgia and Alberta facilities. However, Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the large US rating agencies, decided to downgrade Weyerhaeuser's senior debt as a result of the deal, to A from A-plus. It stressed that it saw a beneficial relationship between the two companies but added that the increase in the buyer's debt levels, as a result of the purchase, 'occurs at a time when pulp, paper and real estate markets are very soft'. 'As a result, cash flow protection measures, which are already low for the rating, will weaken even further,' suggested S&amp;P. The remaining timber assets for which P&amp;G hopes to find buyers include a pulp mill and 665,000 acres of timberland in northern Florida, and a cotton linter's pulp plant and the cellulose and specialties division headquarters' site in Memphis.</p>

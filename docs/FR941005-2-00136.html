			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. When additional portfolios are added to the Separate Account, Contractowners will be allowed to transfer among available portfolios during the accumulation period. TIAA reserves the right to limit the number of transfers among portfolios to once in any 90-day period. Currently, no charge is made for transfers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. TIAA imposes a daily administrative expense charge at an effective annual rate of 0.20% of the net assets of the Separate Account. Applicants represent that this charge is deducted in reliance on Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act and is not greater than the expected cost of the administrative services to be provided over the life of the Contract. TIAA does not expect or intend to earn a surplus from the administrative expense charge. The rate of the charge is guaranteed not to increase for the duration of the Contracts and is applicable only during the period from the date of issue of the Contract until the end of the accumulation period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. A daily investment advisory fee is deducted from the net assets of the Separate Account and paid to Teachers Advisors, Inc. (``Advisors''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIAA VA Holdings, Inc. Advisors will be registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The investment advisory fee will be 0.30% of the average daily net assets of the Separate Account. Advisors has agreed to waive a portion of the advisory fee so that the current effective annual rate will be 0.10% of the average daily net assets of the Separate Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. TIAA deducts a Mortality and Expense Risk Charge that is equal, on an annual basis, to 0.25% of the average daily net asset value of the Separate Account: approximately .06% for mortality risks and .19% for expense risks. TIAA reserves the right to increase this charge to an effective annual rate of 1.00% of the net assets of each portfolio of the Separate Account (approximately .20% for mortality risks and .80% for expense risks) and guarantees that this charge will never exceed 1.00%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The mortality risks assumed by TIAA arise from its contractual obligation to make annuity payment in accordance with the provisions of the Contracts regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant lives. In addition, TIAA assumes the risk that the total premiums paid under a Contract less any cash withdrawals exceed the account value of a Contract when a death benefit becomes payable. The death benefit under the Contract is the greater of (a) account value or (b) total premiums paid less cash withdrawals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The expense risk assumed by TIAA is that actual expenses involved in administering the Contracts (including Contract maintenance costs, administrative costs, mailing costs, data processing costs, and costs of other services) may exceed the amount recovered from the administrative expense charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a qualified trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) exempting the from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge from the assets of the Separate Account under the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants represent that the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants base this representation on an analysis of publicly available information about similar annuity products, taking into consideration such factors as the current charge levels, existence of charge level guarantees, any death benefit guarantees, guaranteed annuity rates, and other policy options. TIAA represents that it will maintain at its administrative offices a memorandum, available to the Commission, setting forth in detail this analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge is insufficient to cover actual costs, the loss will be borne by TIAA. Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will be a profit to TIAA. TIAA does not expect a profit from this charge during the first years of the Separate Account's operation. To the extent this charge results in a surplus to TIAA, such surplus will be available for use by TIAA for the payment of distribution, sales, and other expenses. Applicants represent that no separate charge for distribution expenses will be imposed upon the assets of the Separate Account unless and until the requirements of Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act have been complied with. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

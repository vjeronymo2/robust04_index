			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Greene King sells Morland stake Greene King, the East Anglian brewer, has sold for Pounds 28.7m its 28.8 per cent stake in Morland, the Thames Valley brewer it failed to acquire in 1992. Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, bought the 6.23m shares for 460p a share and placed them with institutions. Greene King had paid an average of 450p a share for them during the abortive bid, with the bulk coming from the Whitbread Investment Company. Greene King will book an exceptional profit of Pounds 600,000 before expenses but it had already taken a Pounds 2.7m charge for the bid costs in its 1992 results. It will use the proceeds to cut its debt to Pounds 66m from Pounds 95m. Gearing will fall by 10 percentage points to 30 per cent. Greene King was attracted by Morland's pub estate in the Thames Valley. It also hoped to close Morland's Abingdon brewery and use the site as a distribution centre for its own beers such as Abbott and IPA.</p>

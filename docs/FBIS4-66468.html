			<p>Overseas   Procurement by 30-Fold   <F P=102> 94FE0269F Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 3 Dec 93 p  13 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0269F </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article with no byline] </F>   [Text] The Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc.  (SJAC), announced the results of its survey of aircraft  procurements made by the Defense Agency during the period of  FY90 through FY94 (based on the budget request amounts).  According to the survey, although the procurement amount in FY90  consisted of &yen;355.3 billion from domestic suppliers and  &yen;4.2 billion from overseas suppliers, the latter being only  about 1% of the total amount, the percentage of  procurement  from overseas gradually increased as a result of the need to  correct the Japan-U.S. trade imbalance; in FY93, the domestic  procurement was cut to &yen;189.4 billion, or about half of what  it was previously, and the overseas procurement was sharply  increased to &yen;117.3 billion, accounting for about one-third  of the total amount. The overseas procurement in FY94 is  expected to remain at a high level of &yen;113.9 billion.    All defense-related manufacturers here are quite concerned  about the sharp increase in the share of the overseas  procurement in addition to the general tendency of defense  budget reduction.    While the total aircraft procurement in FY90, mainly  consisting of the frontal equipment, was &yen;359.5 billion,  that figure dropped to about &yen;270 billion in FY91 and FY92  as a result of the end of the Cold War. The amount increased in  FY93 and FY94 because of the fact that the procurement of two  AWACS [airborne warning and control system] (about &yen;55  billion) was included. It continued to grow in FY93, rising to  &yen;306.7 billion, and it is expected to be about &yen;337.1 in  FY94; however, it is still lower than FY90.    Domestic procurement also dropped from its peak in FY90 to  &yen;189.4 billion, or about half of the peak value, in FY93. In  FY94, however, it is expected to recover to &yen;223.2 billion.    Overseas procurement, however, sharply increased to  38.2% in  FY93 and 33.8% in FY94, from 1.2% in FY90. There  is a  difference of night and day between the trends in the domestic  and overseas procurements.</p>

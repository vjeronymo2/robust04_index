			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Claims processing offices without approval authority. A claims processing office that has not been granted claims approval authority will provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned jurisdiction, either on an area basis or on a command or agency basis. Once the investigation is completed, the claims file will be forwarded to the appropriate area claims office for action. Alternatively, an area claims office may direct that a claims investigation made by a claims processing office without approval authority be forwarded to another claims processing office within the area that has approval authority if the claim is within the jurisdiction of the latter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claims processing office with approval authority. A claims processing office that has been granted approval authority must provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned jurisdiction, either on an area basis or on a command or agency basis, and for the adjudication and payment of all presented claims within its monetary jurisdiction. If the estimated value of a claim, after investigation, is beyond the payment authority of the claims processing office or if disapproval is the appropriate action, the claim file will be forwarded to the area claims office unless otherwise specified in this part, or forwarded to USARCS or the command claims service, as appropriate, if directed by such service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Medical claims processing offices. The medical claims JAs at Army medical centers, other than Fitzsimons Army Medical Center and Walter Reed Army Medical Center, may be designated by the SJA/head of area claims office for the installation on which the center is located as claims processing offices with approval authority for medical malpractice claims only. Claims beyond their approval authority will be investigated and forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. The SJA, Health Services Command, Quality Assurance Division, OTSG (DASG&hyph;PSQ) and the Consultation Case Review Branch, Clinical Policy and Consultants Division, Office of the Surgeon General (CCRB), will be advised by USARCS of all referrals, provided a copy of all claims, and informed of their disposition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Special claims processing offices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The Commander, USARCS, the chief of a command claims service or the head of an area claims office may designate special claims processing offices within his or her command for specific, short-term purposes (for example, maneuvers, civil disturbances, and emergencies). These special claims processing offices may be delegated approval authority necessary to effect the purpose of their creation, but in no case will this delegation exceed the approval authority maximums set forth in other subparts of this part for regular claims processing offices. All claims will be processed under the claims expenditure allowance and claims command and office code of the authority who established the office or a code assigned by USARCS. The existence of any special claims processing office must be reported to the Commander, USARCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A special claims processing office is the proper organization to process and approve, as appropriate, maneuver damage claims, except where a foreign government is responsible for adjudication under an international agreement (see subpart G). Personnel from the maneuvering command should be used in the investigation of claims and, at the discretion of the area claims office, may be assigned to the special claims processing office. Claims filed after the termination of the maneuver will be processed by the area claims office. Claims arising within the jurisdiction of other area claims offices, while units are traveling to or from the maneuver, will be investigated by the special claims processing office and forwarded for action to the area claims office in whose area the claims arose. Claims for damage to real or personal property arising on private land being used under a permit may be paid from funds specifically budgeted by the maneuver for such purposes in accordance with AR 405&hyph;15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

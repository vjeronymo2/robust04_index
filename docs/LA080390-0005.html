			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEATH PENALTY TO BE SOUGHT IN ACTRESS'  MURDER  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Thursday they will seek the death penalty for an obsessed fan  accused of murdering actress Rebecca Schaeffer -- unless the defense can give  them a good reason not to.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said documentation of Robert Bardo's reported  history of mental illness might persuade them to seek a life sentence.  </P> <P> Bardo, 20, of Tucson, allegedly stalked Schaeffer before shooting her at the  door of her Fairfax district apartment last July.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Stephen Galindo said his client is receiving medication  and may plead not guilty by reason of insanity. A psychiatric examination of  Bardo was ordered by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Connor.  </P></p>

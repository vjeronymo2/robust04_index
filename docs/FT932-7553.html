			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Keep the taxman off your land - Little-known tax privileges OWNERS OF businesses and farms are well aware that the relief from inheritance tax on gifts of much business and agricultural property is now 100 per cent. What is not widely known is that, with proper planning, it is possible to use the 100 per cent relief twice, so as to double the value of assets which can be gifted free of inheritance tax. Property qualifying for 100 per cent relief includes 'in hand' (ie untenanted) agricultural property, most businesses and partnership interests, and shareholdings in unquoted trading companies carrying more than 25 per cent of the votes. The property must have been owned for at least two years. As a result, such property can now be passed down to the younger generation entirely free of inheritance tax. Consider Mr and Mrs Archer, whose assets are as follows: Mr Archer owns agricultural estate worth Pounds 1m, a farmhouse worth Pounds 400,000 and investments of Pounds 1m; Mrs Archer has investments of Pounds 300,000. The Archers wish to retain and to continue to run the estate. However, they have been told that they should consider giving some of their investments to their adult children. This is because, if the Archers survive the gifts by seven years, they will avoid the inheritance tax that will otherwise be payable on death. Unfortunately, their investments contain large gains. If Mr and Mrs Archer give them away, CGT will be payable. They therefore do not do so. Mr Archer dies first, leaving everything to his wife. There is no inheritance tax to pay, because gifts between spouses are exempt from tax. After her husband's death, Mrs Archer takes charge of the business, though, as in Mr Archer's lifetime, the actual day to day management is undertaken by others. Mrs Archer dies three years later. Her property passes to the children. Both her agricultural estate and her farmhouse qualify for 100 per cent relief from inheritance tax, but she has to pay Pounds 460,000 on her investments of Pounds 1.3m (40 per cent of the excess over the Pounds 150,000 threshold). This may seen a reasonable outcome. But the young Archers do not consider it at all satisfactory. For they have been advised that, had two steps been taken, the tax bill could have been reduced from Pounds 460,000 to nil. One step is for Mr Archer to bequeath the agricultural estate and Pounds 150,000, equal to the tax free 'nil rate band', to a suitable flexible trust for the potential benefit of Mrs Archer and the children. This will not give rise to a tax charge on his death, because the agricultural estate qualifies for 100 per cent relief, and the Pounds 150,000 is within the tax free band. The other step is for Mrs Archer, after her husband's death, to buy the agricultural estate from the trust for its market value of Pounds 1,000,000. The effect of this is that Mrs Archer ends up owning the agricultural estate together with the farmhouse and Pounds 150,000 of investments; and the trust ends up owning Pounds 1,150,000 of investments (ie Pounds 150,000 bequeathed by Mr Archer plus Pounds 1,000,000 paid by Mrs Archer). The result of these arrangements is that no inheritance tax is payable on Mrs Archer's death. It may be objected that Mrs Archer would be unwise to divest herself of most of the investments in this way, for she might require them, eg. to meet nursing home bills. The answer to this is that, as she is a potential beneficiary of the flexible trust, the investments in the trust can be paid out to her at the trustees' discretion if this proves necessary. The moral is that owners of business and agricultural property which potentially qualify for 100 per cent relief would be well advised to review their assets and their wills to ensure not only that 100 per cent relief is available but also that it can be turned into 200 per cent relief by being used twice. Sophisticated technical provisions are required to pave the way for the strategy, and very few conventional wills contain these. In the authors' experience, owners of businesses and in-hand farms have begun to appreciate the remarkable tax privileges which their property enjoys, or to take advantage of the tax planning opportunities which these privileges present.

He pointed out that plans made by foreign companies to enter  the Russian market are becoming a reality. "Foreign planes are  directly purchased and leased from abroad which means that we  are beginning to lose the CIS market," Soskovets said.    The director general of the Aviastar joint stock society,  Viktor Mikhailov, said the auctioning with the involvement of  other investors had failed to produce the desire economic  effect. According to Mikhailov, part of the planned credit  allocated by the state was used for new technologies. "The  shortage of completing parts remains one of the worst problems  today," Mikhailov said.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD RADIO STATION MOUNTS BILLBOARD BLAST AT GRAFFITI;  </P> <P> OUTDOOR ADVERTISING: FROM HOLLYWOOD TO LONG BEACH, KACE-FM DEEJAYS URGE 'DON'T  PLAY THAT MESS' ON 400 POSTERS.  </P> <P> Some people alter billboards, bus shelter signs and bus benches with graffiti.  But KACE-FM (103.9) is using the same forums to deliver an anti-graffiti  message.  </P> <P> The Inglewood-based radio station, in an effort to draw attention to the city's  graffiti menace, is bolstering its outdoor advertising campaign this week to  spread the message that the community is sick and tired of spray paint and  marking pens.  </P> <P> Since the first week of June, when 400 billboards were posted from Hollywood to  Long Beach, KACE morning deejay team Steve Woods and Sam Putney, wearing stern  expressions and polo shirts, have been pointing at pedestrians and motorists  underneath the message, "Graffiti: Don't Play That Mess!"  </P> <P> Now that message is being underlined by adding 200 billboards, 150 bus shelter  signs and 220 bus bench signs to the campaign.  </P> <P> Although the urban-contemporary station's demographics are more in line with  the vandals' parents than the vandals themselves, some graffiti experts say  that the colorfully worded billboard is at least making a dent in the  multi-million dollar problem, especially where the non-gang-aligned,  thrill-seeking "taggers" are concerned. RTD transit police claim that taggers  are responsible for "99.9%" of the $10 million of annual graffiti damage to RTD  busses alone.  </P> <P> According to KACE promotions director Valerie Williamson, 40, the program is  targeted at the taggers, who are typically grammar school to high school age  and from a variety of ethnic groups and income brackets. Whereas gang graffiti  is designed to mark territory, taggers are spray-painting or writing their  names in an effort to self-advertise to friends, other taggers and the public.  </P> <P> Because buses act as moving billboards throughout the city, they are a favorite  target of taggers, but the problem isn't limited to buses. "Maybe 40% to 45% of  graffiti in Los Angeles is done by taggers," said Daniel Martinez, 36, who  heads graffiti abatement for the L.A.-based Community Youth Gang Services  organization.  </P> <P> Mike Mann, currently the station producer at KACE, initiated the anti-graffiti  campaign in October when he held the title of promotions and creative services  director. The station approached the RTD, which became co-sponsor, and enlisted  the help of Continental Cablevision and the California Department of Health  Services.  </P> <P> Ricky Tatum, 32, vice president and general manager at the station, said that  the cable company and the state agency each contributed $10,000 and KACE kicked  in $4,000 for manufacturing the signs. The RTD helped neogtiate the donation of  the billboard space from Metropolitan Outdoor Advertising -- which otherwise  would have cost $60,000 a month, he said.  </P> <P> The 150 bus shelter signs -- which would run about $12,000 to $14,000 a month  -- and the 220 bus bench signs -- $11,000 a month -- have been donated by  Gannett and Coast United Advertising respectively. 150 bus shelter signs run  about $12,000 to $14,000 a month, and the bus bench signs would cost $11,000 a  month to rent.  </P> <P> Over the course of the six-month campaign, Steve and Sam will be posted on  about half a million dollars worth of donated space.  </P> <P> KACE prides itself on being a community service station, and it has addressed  the graffiti problem on the air in the past, but its .8 arbitron rating and  target audience of 18- to 49-year-olds with an annual salary of $35,000 or more  makes it seemingly difficult to reach the vandals. That's part of the reason  KACE went to the signs in the first place.  </P> <P> "We're trying to reach those people, younger people who might not listen to  KACE but could still get our message when outdoors," said Ricky Tatum, 32, vice  president and general manager at the station. "The reason we use outdoor  advertising is to reach those people -- trying to spread the message as far and  wide as possible."  </P> <P> This is not the station's only billboard campaign -- KACE launched a  100-billboard "Reclaim Your Community" campaign two weeks ago, co-sponsored by  Nix Check Cashing, to support Community Youth Gang Services, and there are  still some traces of the "Stop the Violence" billboards launched in conjuction  with RCA last year -- but the anti-graffiti campaign is KACE's largest.  </P> <P> It's also unique for KACE in that it uses its own disc jockeys to speak to kids  about graffiti. Woods, 39, and Putney, 42, are perhaps less obvious role models  than Linden King and Greg Townsend of the Los Angeles Raiders, who were  featured in an earlier RTD anti-graffiti campaign, but they feel contact with  the public allows them the same kind of forum that the Raiders have.  </P> <P> "Hopefully we're a symbol in the community," Putney said. "We feel we're more  in touch with the community than the Raiders. We physically go out to the  community, so that's a point in our favor. We're out in the community at least  once a week, meeting people. When we have open house at the station, a lot of  kids want to meet Steve and Sam."  </P> <P> According to some involved with graffiti cleanup, the campaign is a welcome one  that will make a difference.  </P> <P> "(The signs) help out," Martinez said. "It gives out a message -- rather than  individual property owners telling kids not to do it, which makes them more  defiant, a sign shows that the whole community is telling them not to do it. It  shows that there is a wide concern."  </P> <P> "I think we need more programs like what KACE is doing," said Delphia Jones,  37, director of Operation Clean Sweep, the graffiti abatement department of the  city's Board of Public Works, which spends $2.7 million a year on graffiti  cleanup. "My impression is that (the campaign) will deter some of the younger  people that haven't started graffiti yet."  </P> <P> Others, like California state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Inglewood), emphasize that  the signs are only a small part of a larger solution.  </P> <P> "I think, along with a lot of other things, it's helpful," she said. "The media  can help, along with the businesses and the private sector and parents at home.  Principals in junior high and high schools have to talk to the kids about  tagging."  </P> <P> But for Putney, it's quality and not quantity that matters. "We address lots of  issues -- drugs, literacy, graffiti, and just the need for self-esteem. If we  save just one kid, it'll do me some good."  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fenner falls 38% to Pounds 2.3m and halves pay-out THE ABSENCE of a recovery in its UK businesses led Fenner, the engineering group, to halve its interim dividend and to warn of a similar cut in the final payment. Its share price fell 11p to 86p yesterday. An uncovered dividend of 1.7p (3.45p) was announced alongside a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.28m (Pounds 3.71m) for the six months to February 29. The UK part of the business, which accounted for about 40 per cent of the Pounds 97.7m (Pounds 100.5m) turnover, incurred a loss after interest. This aggravated the problem of unrelieved ACT and the tax rate rose from 53 per cent to 62 per cent. After a minority charge of Pounds 685,000 (Pounds 728,000), mainly relating to the 50 per cent-owned South African subsidiary, earnings per share fell to 0.41p (2.36p). Mr Peter Barker, chairman, said power transmission had been worst hit by the UK recession. Other UK companies were profitable, including conveyor-belt manufacture which had been concentrated on Hull after a closure in Scotland. A further 5 per cent of the UK workforce had been made redundant, bringing the total cut to 20 per cent - well over 400 jobs. Altogether cost cutting moves had knocked Pounds 800,000 off operating profit. One of the group's priorities was to enhance UK earnings, for instance through acquisitions offering rationalisation opportunities. About 85 per cent of the Pounds 4m (Pounds 5.63m) operating profits were made overseas, with South Africa a star performer. Profits held up in North America, where the fluid power subsidiary had a record order book. In continental Europe, deteriorating demand in France and Germany had had an adverse effect on the UK factories. Australia was undergoing its third depressed year. Net debt rose from Pounds 30.5m last August to Pounds 38m, gearing of about 60 per cent. Interest costs were nearly Pounds 2m (Pounds 2.37m). COMMENT Fenner is showing all the signs of being squeezed for cash. Halving the dividend will save Pounds 2.5m this year and capital spending has been cut from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 4m, two thirds of depreciation. Interest cover has shrunk to roughly 1.5, if you leave out the 50 per cent of the South African business that it does not own (South Africa accounted for nearly half of operating profit). Year-end gearing will still be near 60 per cent. In terms of trading, the most encouraging area is North America. In the UK, demand in the capital goods sector remains depressed and Fenner will not be an early recoverer. Meanwhile, continental Europe and South Africa are deteriorating. A full-year pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 4.5m leaves the prospective p/e ludicrously high after big tax and minority charges. It still looks high on a Pounds 7m forecast next year. Dividend support? A halved total gives a prospective yield of 6.6 per cent, above the market but not sufficiently so to give cast-iron support.</p>

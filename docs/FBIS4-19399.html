			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller upon her return </F> from the United States at Ankara's Esenboga Airport on 18 April  -- recorded]    [Text] As you know, I went to the United States on 13  April to deliver a speech at the Elie Wiesel Foundation on the  issue of human rights. That occasion offered me the opportunity  to meet with President Clinton for close to an hour on 14 April.  We discussed various issues. We discussed the issue of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in detail and assessed the steps that can be  taken by NATO. I also had the opportunity to explain in detail  the fact that Armenians and Armenia have been occupying  Azerbaijan. I pointed out that a similar approach must  definitely be adopted in the Caucasus.    At the same time, I discussed in detail the measures we have  taken to eliminate the bottleneck in which the Turkish economy  finds itself. I can say very frankly that the U.S.  Administration has given its full support to what we said and to  the economic package. The U.S. Administration said that clearly.    In a meeting later with the World Bank, details of the  economic package were discussed. I was happy to see that the  World Bank clearly supports the economic program. This program  involves a series of measures that must definitely be  implemented to bring prosperity to our people. This program  will bring prosperity to our people. It consists of a series of  measures that we will implement ourselves, without the support  of any financial organization. Nonetheless, we were happy to see  the support given to it by the World Bank and later by the IMF.  We were happy because they gave their full support.    We later met with Mr. Bentsen, secretary of the U.S.  Treasury. He expressed similar views and support.    I then went from Washington back to New York, where I  delivered a speech at the Elie Wiesel Foundation on the issue of  human rights. We had the opportunity to stress to the whole  world once again Turkey's dedication to human rights and to  democracy. This reverberated throughout those circles. Our  faith in democracy and in human rights may be interpreted  differently at certain international platforms. It is  beneficial for us to take every opportunity to show the truth  and to stress and explain the Turkish people's dedication to  democracy and to the struggle for human rights at different  international platforms.    We also held a series of contacts with various U.S.  financial  institutions and banks. I was happy to see the renewed trust in  Turkey and the extent of the support to be given its integration  into world money markets.    In brief, our visit to the United States was positive in all  aspects and was auspicious for our country.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITAN SOFTBALL TEAM EARNS NCAA PLAYOFF BERTH  </P> <P> The Cal State Fullerton softball team received an at-large bid to the NCAA  tournament and will play host to Cal State Long Beach in a best-of-three series  this weekend.  </P> <P> The Titans (44-21) and 49ers (45-16) will play on Friday at 7:30 p.m. and on  Saturday at 1 p.m. If necessary, the third game will follow the second on  Saturday.  </P> <P> The series winner advances to the College World Series, May 23-27 at Oklahoma  City.  </P> <P> Fullerton, ranked fifth in the nation, and fourth-ranked Long Beach have met  five times this season, with the 49ers winning four. But all five games were  decided by one run, and two went into extra innings. Long Beach finished second  to Fresno State in the Big West Conference, and Fullerton finished third.  </P> <P> The Titans, who lost to Cal Poly Pomona in a 1989 regional, are led by  sophomore pitcher Ann Van Dortrecht, who is 28-10 with a conference-leading  0.44 earned-run average and 211 strikeouts. The 49ers will counter with  freshman pitcher Mary Letourneau.  </P> <P> Offensively, Fullerton is led by third baseman Joy Tiner (.313, 10 doubles, 15  RBIs), center fielder Mich DeBree (.291) and shortstop Charlotte Wiley (.290).  </P> <P> The Titans and 49ers are two of 20 teams selected to play in eight regionals  across the country. Four are two-team regionals, and four are three-team  regionals, and the winner of each will advance to the College World Series.  </P> <P> The remaining NCAA pairings: Northern Iowa at UCLA; Oregon, Kent State at Ohio  State; Nevada Las Vegas, San Jose State at California; Arizona State at  Arizona; Oklahoma State, Adelphi at Connecticut; Texas A&amp;M, Florida State  at Southwest Louisiana; Creighton at Fresno State.

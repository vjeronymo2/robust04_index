			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Arts: A Venetian feast - Concert Connoisseurs of fine Monteverdi have much to savour in London at present. Last week the New London Consort presented Philip Pickett's performing edition of the Vespers of 1610; in a fortnight's time the same performers are introducing to Britain Pickett's much more contentious version of the favola in musica, Orfeo. Separating them on Thursday was a programme of Monteverdi that threw down no textural or musicological challenges, just a succession of delights: the Paris-based Les Arts Florissants under their founder-director William Christie offered a selection of madrigals from the seventh and eighth books, the two collections that summarise Monteverdi's secular lyricism during his Venetian years. Christie has an unerring knack of recruiting vivid young voices to his group, skillfully deploying and complementing their talents. So for this programme he had three sopranos of vividly contrasted tone and personality, a male alto of rounded subtlety without a hint of hoot or acidic edge, and pairs of tenors and basses of disarming enthusiasm and agility. Each is nurtured and encouraged to give of their best; Christie's drawing together of the threads, relating voices to instruments (a string septet, which he directed from the harpsichord), became an ever-changing web of possibilities, constantly renewing itself. The concern for detail that Christie lavishes on the performances - right down to his strict marshalling of every stage entrance and exit - logically informs his programme-building too. With Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda as the centrepiece, the concert was framed by two of the eight-part madrigali guerrieri from book 8, ending with the extraordinary 'Hor ch'el ciel e la terra', and in between offered a tour around some of the more intimate settings. The placing of Il combattimento was perfectly judged to maximise its dramatic contrast, with Nicolas Cavallier as a compelling narrator, nimble never bombastic, and muscular, intense instrumental playing. Yet the smaller-scale pieces offered equal delights: the seductive meshing of soprano (the luscious-toned Calire Brua) and men's voices in the madrigal sequence of Lamento della ninfa; the bright, crystalline accuracy of Sandrine Piau in 'Chi vol haver felice'; the extraordinary sombre textures of 'Interrote speranze' from book 7, with its pair of tenors, Bernard Loonen and Adrian Brand, emerging from a swarm of buzzing theorbo and lirone figures. But then everything was lit with the same happy inspiration; it was altogether an enthralling occasion, a joyous feast of vital, committed singing.</p>

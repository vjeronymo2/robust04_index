			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 18 (AFP) -- Rebels of the Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF) called on Rwandans at home and abroad  Saturday [18 June] to "mobilise" against a French initiative to  send a humanitarian intervention force to Rwanda.    "Mobilise to bring down the French treason plan. You are  Rwandan, you must live or die in Rwanda and not elsewhere," RPF  politburo member Jacques Bihozagara said in a statement issued  here.    The appeal to "general mobilisation" also called on "African  countries which want to follow France in carrying out its  sinister plan" to think again.    "Maybe you have debts to France, but find other ways to  repay  them than with Rwandan blood," the statement said.    Earlier in the day, French President Francois Mitterrand  told  a meeting of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural  Organisation in Paris that the setting up of the "humanitarian  protection force", proposed by France, was a matter of "hours  and days".    France also wants to involve other African countries in  sending to Rwanda a peace-keeping force of some 1,000 to 2,000  soldiers under UN guidance.    "Today, France, rounding off its plan, flies to the rescue  of  the executioners on the run," the RPF statement also said,  speaking of France's alleged support for the embattled  Hutu-dominated Rwandan government.    The head of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] bureau in  Brussels, James Rwego, said the text was a "call to take up arms  against France on Rwandan territory."    If French troops went to Rwanda, they would be considered "a  hostile force," he told AFP.    He said the statement had been drawn up after consulting RPF  officials in Rwanda.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Technology: Making light work To enthusiasts of the latest technology, it is an exciting portent. To those dismayed by the prospect of homes swamped by myriad television programmes, it is a nightmare. Either way, information superhighways promise dramatic changes in work and leisure habits. Using fibre amplifiers containing erbium (a rare earth), laboratory demonstrations have shown that as many as 400 TV channels from one studio could be transmitted to 40m subscribers in a 500km radius. Now, a consortium involving the UK's Southampton University, whose Optoelectronics Research Centre invented the erbium fibre amplifier, has been set up to develop 'loss-less splitters' on optical chips intended to make such huge distribution networks much more commercially attractive by reducing the need for transmission power. A loss-less splitter takes an incoming signal from an optical fibre and divides it between multiple output fibres, but maintains signal strength by boosting the power with an optical amplifier. The consortium, funded by the European Union's RACE programme (research and development of advanced communications in Europe) aims to produce optical amplifiers not in optical fibres but using specially cut glass slices in which optical circuits are embedded, rather like silicon chips for electronics. Optical glass slices measure a few centimetres and contain optical waveguide circuits (finer than human hair) and components instead of transistors. They are hard to construct but are likely to play an essential part in the new information infrastructures that a number of countries are planning. Other members of the consortium are Corning France, AT&amp;T Network Systems Netherlands, and the R&amp;D centre of the German postal and telecommunications network.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: New options give fund managers a wider choice - The prospects for new derivative instruments on the FT-SE Mid 250 stock index launched today The launch of futures and options on the FT-SE Mid 250 index today on OMLX, the London-based equity derivatives exchange, could not have been better timed. The path for OMLX is far from smooth: in three weeks, Liffe, Europe's largest futures exchange, will weigh in with its own FT-SE 250 futures contract (though no options), which will be traded alongside its already successful FT-SE 100 futures and options. But the omens for at least one successful Mid 250 product are good. After outperforming the FT-SE 100 index last year, the FT-SE 250 index of medium-sized companies stormed to new highs in January. 'The dramatic outperformance of the FT-SE 250 has highlighted the opportunity - or missed opportunity - provided by the mid-cap sector,' said one fund manager. In addition, a growing number of UK fund managers are starting to use the FT-SE 350 index (which is made up of the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices) as a key benchmark for measuring their performance. The FT-SE 100 index is widely viewed as 'not representative' or 'too specialised' for performance measurement purposes, while the smaller FT-SE All-Share stocks are seen as too illiquid. 'I would be surprised if more (fund managers) do not move over to the 350 in the next couple of years,' said Mr Mel Stimpson, an investment manager at Standard Life. Many have already made the switch. 'We are split into large and small companies. When the new indices (the FT-SE 350 and FT-SE SmallCap) were introduced, we incorporated them as separate benchmarks,' said Mr Jeremy Dyer, portfolio manager at Scottish Amicable. For fund managers who track these indices, the new futures contracts on Liffe and OMLX will facilitate switches between these sectors for asset allocation purposes. Other uses include hedging existing portfolios, writing options against stock holdings to enhance returns, and playing the spread between the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices or the cash market. Mr Dyer said he would be keen to use the new products providing there is sufficient liquidity, and added that he hoped to see the introduction of futures on a smaller companies index in the future. Although the FT-SE 100 futures on Liffe are actively traded - a daily average of close to 17,000 contracts in January - the size of the market is relatively small compared with the UK market capitalisation. Attitudes are changing towards the use of derivatives - for example, many trustees have amended their deeds to allow at least limited use of derivatives - but it is a slow process. 'Derivatives are redefining people's views of performance. If you want to outperform the stock market, you can just buy the futures and stick the rest in T-bills,' said Mr David Courtney, marketing director of OMLX. 'Those who are becoming more active in derivatives are typically performing well rather than badly relative to the index.' But some observers doubt whether there will be sufficiently broad demand to create liquid contracts. And no one seems to think that the market is large enough to support the two rival contracts on OMLX and Liffe. On the face of it, Liffe should be the favourite. It already trades FT-SE 100 contracts, as well as a broad array of interest rate products, and is the obvious port of call for most brokers. But fund managers, some of whom had not previously come across OMLX - which traded an average of nearly 23,000 Swedish stock index options in January - have been impressed by the smaller exchange's speed in getting the new contracts off the block and in marketing them. Further, Liffe's track record in equity derivatives has been less impressive than its performance in interest rate products. From the point of view of the fund managers who will be served by the new contracts, the advent of competition for Liffe is welcomed. Few investors expressed fears that liquidity will be split between the rival contracts. OMLX said yesterday that it would have 10 market makers and eight designated brokers on its FT-SE 250 contracts. Market makers will be obliged to quote two-way prices, but there is no minimum bid/offer spread.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Global equity buyers dance to a Latin beat Last year the global equity market was blown up like a bubble but in 1994 it has behaved more like a sponge. The eager US pension funds and mutual fund investors have seen the FT-Actuaries World Index mostly reverse in the second half-year the 3 per cent gain of the first six months. This is the relatively benign picture as viewed from the perspective of a dollar-based investor. The Swiss fund manager, however, thinks the world index is down by 13 per cent, the Japanese by 8 per cent. The spread around an unexciting global average performance has been less dispersed than in 1993. The key features have been relative strength in Japan, up 16 per cent in terms of dollars, and in parts of Latin America, where Brazil - newly admitted to the World Index list - is up more than 60 per cent. Weakness has been concentrated in Asia, focused on Malaysia and, especially, Hong Kong where the index fall has been 37 per cent. There has been more modest relative weakness in some of the European stock markets, notably those of France and the UK. By the close last night London's Footsie Index was showing a decline of 14 per cent on the year. These movements clearly reflect the flows of funds across borders, in so far as slow and patchy statistics permit them to be tracked. The notable event in 1994 has been the rush of Dollars 47bn (Pounds 28.6bn) of foreign funds into Japanese equities in the first half. But the benefit was seen in the currency as much as in the stock market, where overstretched Japanese financial institutions have taken advantage of the gaijin money to improve their balance sheets. There were better rewards from the cascade of dollars into South America. In the first half, US investors put Dollars 5.2bn into Latin America but only Dollars 600m into Asia (excluding Japan). In fact money was withdrawn from Hong Kong in the first quarter, and despite a flow back during the early summer the outflow appears to have been resumed more recently. The challenge for the global investor is how to front-run these ebbs and flows of hot money, mostly deriving from the US. UK fund managers used to be among the leading global players but have recently been sitting largely on the sidelines - where their performance has suffered. Thus UK pension funds began the year with less than half the World Index weightings in Japan and the US, and two or three times the weightings in Asia (excluding Japan) and continental Europe. The money was in all the wrong places. During the year there has been some modest shifting of money into Japan and more recently a repatriation from continental Europe. But according to measurement data from the WM Company, the median overseas equity portfolio of a UK pension fund was showing a negative return of 3.3 per cent by the end of the third quarter, suggesting nine-month underperformance against the World ex-UK Index of some 5 per cent. Of course, this has to be seen in the context of outperformance of a massive 14 per cent in 1993. Recently the UK fund managers' own domestic market appears to have been under attack by foreign sellers. Can this be the start of the much-feared sell-off by US international mutual funds as their cash inflows turn negative? As it happens, international investors have themselves taken a dim view recently of the US stock market - which still accounts for 33 per cent of global market capitalisation. Foreigners were net sellers of Dollars 2bn of US equities in the second quarter. But this was a fleabite and Wall Street has remained amazingly steady, despite pressures from the bond bear market. Flow of funds statistics are so out of date that we can only guess at the most recent trends. The modest recovery of the dollar would certainly argue that some repatriation of funds has been proceeding. The danger is that by imposing currency losses on remaining US global portfolios the effect will be destabilising. Until Americans have a longer track record as major cross-border portfolio investors their behaviour will continue to worry and perplex the established global players.</p>

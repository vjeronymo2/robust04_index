			<p>Areas   <F P=102>   PA1106183494 Paris AFP in Spanish 1735 GMT 11 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> PA1106183494 </F> <F P=104>  Paris AFP </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Lima, 11 Jun (AFP) -- The Peruvian Government  extended the state of emergency for 60 days beginning today in  several provinces of three Amazonian departments, because  "narcoterrorist actions continue" there, it was officially  reported today.    Meanwhile, the Police reported that on the evening of 10  June  two policemen and a private agent who were guarding stores--the  former two in the capital city District of El Agustino and the  third in San Miguel--were overpowered by presumed Shining Path  commando units, who seized their weapons. The attackers made  death threats against the three attack victims and threw  leaflets referring to the "armed struggle" and expressing  opposition to the government.    This special measure, which is contained in a supreme decree  published by the EL PERUANO official gazette, affects the  provinces of the jungle departments of Huanuco, San Martin, and  Loreto. The provision implies the suspension of constitutional  guarantees in the areas mentioned and also means that the Armed  Forces will continue to guarantee public order.    Official figures indicate that more than 60 percent of  national territory falls under this regime and that the  constitutional guarantees of nearly 50 percent of the Peruvian  population (22,128,466 inhabitants) have been restricted since  the start of the "fratricidal war" in 1980 in Ayacucho, in the  southeastern Andean region, which has claimed more than 27,000  lives.</p>

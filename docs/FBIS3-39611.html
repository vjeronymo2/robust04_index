			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>   [Text] Britain is to send a 60-strong team of radar  specialists to Bosnia and move up to 300 of the Coldstream  Guards into the capital Sarajevo.    The Government move is a response to the United Nations  request to help strengthen the peacekeeping operation in the  Bosnian capital.    But Britain backed away from intense pressure to send a  mechanised battalion of at least 700 men with armoured personnel  carriers.    And in a thinly-veiled attack on the United States  Administration, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said it was  time that other countries made "helpful contributions."    He said that Britain, which has 2,400 troops on the ground,  and France were the largest contributors to the UN operation in  Bosnia.    "It would not be appropriate to think that the UK should  shoulder the burden by itself," he said. "It would not be  thought fair and reasonable by the British public."    Asked whether he would like to see the United States provide  ground troops, he said: "It is important that all countries that  can make an important contribution should seriously consider  doing so.    "All of those countries interested in a successful  resolution  of this operation should realise it is not reasonable to expect  the burden to fall only on a small number of countries.    "We hope that all countries that are able to assist will  look  positively at ways in which this can be done."    Two companies of the Coldstream Guards will be moved from  their base in Vitez to Sarajevo to help monitor Serb heavy  weapons.    A mortar-locating troop equipped with Cymbeline radar will  be  sent to Sarajevo along with an additional number of military  liaison officers and observers.    The 60-strong troop will be able to pinpoint precisely the  source of any mortars that are fired during the ceasefire.    However, Britain's response falls far short of the United  Nations request for up to 3,000 troops, including two mechanised  infantry battalions, six helicopters as well as specialised  units.    The initiative came from Lieutenant General Sir Michael  Rose,  the UN commander in Bosnia, who needed the extra forces to  monitor the Sarajevo ceasefire and control Serb heavy weapons.    He did not get all he wanted but Mr Rifkind today praised  him  on a "magnificent job" in achieving the longest ceasefire in  Sarajevo since the conflict started two years ago.    "The action we are now taking will help to establish the  ceasefire more firmly and, as we all hope, achieve the  demilitarisation of Sarajevo," he said. NATO has threatened  air strikes against any artillery or heavy weapons around the  Bosnian capital unless they are withdrawn at least 12 miles from  the city or surrendered to the United Nations by midnight on  Sunday [20 February].    Mr Rifkind will meet his American, French, Spanish, Italian  and Dutch counterparts for urgent last-minute talks in Italy on  Sunday -- just hours before the deadline expires.    It is expected that U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's  aircraft will stop in Britain to pick up Mr Rifkind en route to  the meeting, which will probably take place at NATO's southern  region command headquarters in Naples.    The government was under intense pressure to provide more  forces but their decision was made easier when the other allies  -- France, Holland and Spain -- all said they had already sent  the maximum possible.    Mr Rifkind said it was "encouraging" that some good progress  had already been made with a number of Serb heavy weapons handed  over to UN control.    "At the moment it is looking quite encouraging but there is  still a long way to go," he said.    He was confident that Sir Michael would have the necessary  number of troops in Sarajevo to monitor the heavy weapons.    Large numbers of French troops have already been pulled in  from elsewhere in the region and the extra British troops will  make a significant impact on the operation.    Sir Michael has made plain that Serb or Muslim troops  attempting to win back control of their heavy weapons would have  to "fight" for them.    Mr Rifkind said that in such a situation British troops  would  be fully entitled to defend themselves under the UN mandate.    The decision to send up to 300 Coldstream Guards to Sarajevo  will inevitably limit the number of aid convoys that can be  escorted through central Bosnia.    But Mr Rifkind stressed that other nations should be able to  provide forces to help that operation.</p>

Saiget] </F>   [Text] Beijing, Jan. 9 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata's just completed two-day visit to China was short,  tough and to the point as the two Asian giants patiently lay  down their cards amid ever-changing roles in Asia's burgeoning  economic sweepstakes.    The theme of Hata's visit this time around was a new era of  development based on an orientation toward future relations and  discussed in the context of contributions toward the  international community, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman  said.    Such a "forward orientation," an obvious way to avoid the  horrors of times gone by, was carefully balanced by Hata's  reiteration that Japan would not forget "the self-reflection of  the past."    While the Chinese leadership cordially listened to Hata's  explanation of developing relations in a global context, they  remained mum on questions concerning war retribution and refused  to comment on Japan's ambitions to join the United Nations  Security Council, the spokesman said.    Hata, while sidestepping direct references to the war, told  the press that "a frank exchange of views is natural to deeper  relations."    He did not, however, say when that exchange of view will  come  nor did he speculate on how China will use the "war compensation  card."    China, too, appears to be ready to use Japan's UN ambitions  to the fullest effect, which in China's case usually means "more  economic aid."    Japan has lent thousands of billions of yen to China through  its overseas development assistance program and the  rearrangement in the loan schedules during the visit were  applauded by both sides.    Japan, among developed nations, arguably has the clearest  understanding of the actual situation in China and is fully  aware of China's financial situation which remains bogged down  by the large, backward and underdeveloped regions.    Meanwhile bilateral trade relations neared 35 billion  dollars  in 1993 to reach a record height, while China continued to call  for increased investment from Japan.    In such a light, the future of Japan-China relations has no  big change on the horizon -- the Japanese Government will  continue in its quiet ways to offer support and assistance to  China's endeavors, while Japanese businesses will take advantage  of their technology and advanced products to reap the benefits  of the huge Chinese market.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / People: Robert Fleming Robert Fleming, the UK merchant banking group, has recruited Bill Harrison to fill the new post of chief executive of investment banking. Harrison is currently vice chairman of Lehman Brothers International, the European arm of the US investment bank owned by American Express. At Fleming he will be in charge of the corporate finance and capital markets departments, which are responsible for advising companies on mergers and acquisitions and issues of securities. He hopes to expand Flemings' activities in these areas, since they are currently far less significant to the group than its fund management businesses. Harrison, 44, has previously worked for the merchant bank J Henry Schroder Wagg and for the oil company Tricentrol.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Westminster auditor 'wrong to seize papers' A former senior local government officer yesterday told the public inquiry into alleged vote-rigging by Westminster City Council that it was unprecedented for the district auditor to have obtained secret political papers from councillors. Mr John Hender, chief executive of West Midlands County Council between 1973 and 1986, was called as an expert witness by Conservative councillor Ms Judith Warner, one of the 10 accused of vote-rigging by Mr John Magill, district auditor. Mr Hender said: 'I have never before come across a situation where a district auditor has had access to the party political papers of the majority party in his investigations of any alleged improper political activity by members or officers and I frankly would not expect to have access myself.' Lawyers for the accused have argued at the inquiry that it was wrong for Mr Magill to seize political papers from closed meetings of Tory councillors and rely on them as evidence of what was decided in committee meetings. They have argued that everybody in local government except Mr Magill understood the 'great divide' between what councillors discussed in these closed meetings and what they were legally allowed to do in the council chamber. In his provisional report Mr Magill recommended a surcharge of Pounds 21.25m on 10 councillors and officials for selling off homes in marginal wards. Mr Hender also said councillors and officials should be safe from being surcharged if they had acted on legal advice from a respected counsel, even if that advice was wrong. The accused have said that proper legal approval for the sales policy was obtained from Mr Jeremy Sullivan QC before it was implemented in 1987. The inquiry continues today.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield Having spent the late 1980s liberating itself from the vagaries of the commodities markets, Harrisons &amp; Crosfield is now shackled firmly to the UK industrial cycle. Even so, thank heavens for plantations; the lion's share of yesterday's 12 per cent increase in pre-tax interim profits derived from the price of palm oil. Small contributions came from chemicals and building supplies as costs were cut, but this was also the story in 1990 and 1991. It is doubtful whether much more can be squeezed from the mainstream businesses without a sustained economic upturn. With capital expenditure still running at Pounds 65m a year, the best that can be said is that H &amp; C should be positioned to benefit from any cyclical upturn. The group appears willing to hold the full year dividend even if it is again uncovered. Forward sales of palm oil at least offer a source of known income in the second half, although the company may not be so lucky thereafter. Yet even with an unexpectedly strong recovery there may be little scope both to raise the dividend and rebuild cover. Without an improvement in UK earnings, an increasing proportion of overseas profits will disappear into the coffers of the Inland Revenue. The UK tax charge increased by a third this time as additional ACT went unrelieved. At 135p the shares are on a historic yield of 9.7 per cent, but those who took up the 1990 rights at 137p must be feeling disappointed.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Lonrho urged to change board: Shareholders want trading group to appoint non-executive directors LONRHO, the international trading group, is under pressure from its shareholders to appoint non-executive directors to its board as a consultant yesterday criticised the group's corporate governance. Pensions Investment Research Consultants acts as a consultant to private pension funds in the UK and the US. Ms Anne Simpson, PIRC's joint managing director, said: 'Lonrho's corporate governance has deteriorated in the course of the year from a low base. It is the only company in the FTSE-100 which does not have a single non-executive on its board. 'We recommend that shareholders set Lonrho a timetable for producing a team of independent directors with first class track records to bring the board up to strength.' Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, is the only other FTSE-100 company without non-executives. However, its eight-strong advisory board is considered to do the work of non-executives. Lonrho's institutional shareholders, which include the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society, Phillips and Drew Fund Managers, Legal and General, Robert Fleming Investment Management and Postel Investment Management, have expressed similar views to the Lonrho's directors in meetings over the past 10 days. A number of fund managers yesterday said that they strongly backed PIRC's comments. One fund manager criticised Lonrho for not taking corporate governance seriously, while another complained of the conglomerate's 'refusal to accept non-executive directors'. The issue is likely to come to a head after Lonrho publishes its annual report on February 26. PIRC is drawing up a detailed study on the group which it plans to send to shareholders. Lonrho's banks, led by Standard Chartered, Barclays and National Westminster, and two Swiss banks, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation, would also like to see the appointment of non-executive directors. While they have told the group that they are not calling for sweeping changes they would also like to see a replacement for Mr Terry Robinson, who resigned from the group's board last month. Lonrho said it does not believe the appointment of non-executives is necessary.</p>

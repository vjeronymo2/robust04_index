			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Abu Dhabi issues documents in US THE government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce In-ternational, said yesterday that it had released 19,000 important BCCI documents to US investigators and had invited US officials to visit Abu Dhabi in the next two months. The pledge of co-operation - which Congressional critics claimed was part of a public-relations campaign by Abu Dhabi aimed at deflecting past criticism  -comes days before the expected publication of a long BCCI report by Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who has led Senate investigations into the collapsed bank. Abu Dhabi is also keen to make its case ahead of the publication of Lord Justice Bingham's BCCI report in the UK. However, the government of Abu Dhabi is not giving the BCCI documents to US investigators. It is merely allowing the authorities to view the documents, which are being held at the Washington Embassy of the United Arab Emirates. Photocopies will not be permitted. Among those who had previously claimed that Abu Dhabi had failed to provide adequate co-operation in the BCCI case were the offices of Mr Kerry and of Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney who last year brought fraud charges against the bank. Although Abu Dhabi has claimed it was 'the single biggest victim' of the BCCI fraud, it is understood that its role has been under investigation by Mr Morgenthau's office. Robinson, Lake, Lerer &amp; Montgomery, the Washington public-relations firm that speaks for Abu Dhabi, said the documents were being made available to officials of the US Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve Board and the office of Mr Morgenthau. Senator Kerry criticised Abu Dhabi's use of Robinson Lake in March because Mr James Lake is also deputy manager of the campaign for the re-election of President George Bush. Senator Kerry has called on President Bush to dismiss Mr Lake, who serves as a US adviser to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the key investment vehicles used by Sheikh Zayed Sultan Nahyan to retain majority control of BCCI. Mr Lake's office dismissed Senator Kerry's criticism as 'election-year politics' yesterday and denied that there was any conflict of interest in Mr Lake's helping to manage the Bush campaign while being paid to represent BCCI's biggest shareholder.</p>

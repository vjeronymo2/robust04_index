			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Two-thirds of workforce show improved skill level BRITAIN HAS experienced a training revolution during the past five years. Nearly two thirds of workers have increased the level of skill they use in their jobs, and now as many as 56 per cent of employees use computers or automated equipment. That is one of the most important findings of a joint government/industry-commissioned survey of British employment, published today by the Policy Studies Institute. It discovered that 54 per cent of employees received training during the past three years, compared with only a third who had in 1986. The increase in skills was particularly sharp among technicians and supervisors. The survey confounds some of the conventional views of industrial skill levels in Britain. It found that 65 per cent of employees wanted training, although only 54 per cent thought they were very or fairly likely to receive it. Other key findings in the study, the first of its kind in Britain: Workers feel their jobs are more stressful than they were five years ago, with 54 per cent saying stress levels had increased since 1988 and 31 per cent reporting significant levels of stress as a result of their work. As many as 67.6 per cent of employees claim they are putting a lot more effort than formally required into their tasks. Job insecurity is more widespread than before, particularly among professional management and skilled manual workers. Men feel more insecure than women. Frustration and dissatisfaction are considerable among many workers at the lack of responsibility they feel they are given by their employers. Just over half the sample believe they should have more say in decisions relating to changes in the organisation of their work. The proportion who believe they have a principal say over the amount and pace of their work has risen from 67 per cent in 1984 to 77 per cent last year. Trade unionism has not yet been marginalised in the workplace. While 43 per cent of employees still belong to unions, 59 per cent said unions were present in the places in which they worked. Only 9 per cent felt their employers were trying to discourage union membership. Most workers feel committed to, rather than alienated from, the enterprises they work for, but only 29 per cent of them would turn down another job that offered more pay. Just over a quarter of employees receive incentive pay and 53 per cent have formal appraisals of their work annually. The survey was conducted between May and September of last year based on a random sample of 3,855 people in work aged between 20 and 60 with a 72 per cent overall response rate.

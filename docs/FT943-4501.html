			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / People: Finance moves Kleinwort Benson Securities is clearly expecting the UK market to build up a head of steam and has moved quickly to bolster its highly-rated team of marketmakers, recruiting three of the UK market's senior traders. Peter Angeli, 28, joins KB from Lehman Brothers and previously spent four years marketmaking at Smith New Court. Hugh McAlister, 33, and Wayne Grossman, 37, move over from UBS where both were directors. McAlister spent five years at UBS, and was previously at the then County NatWest. Grossman has been one of UBS's front-line marketmakers since 1986. KB had a couple of bad experiences in the market in the late 1980s but has gradually rebuilt its confidence in the securities trading arena. It scored a big hit recently in recruiting top economist Ian Harwood from SG Warburg and says it is still keen to expand on all fronts in the securities business.</p>

But  the government and the ANC [African National Congress] have said  they are prepared to give members of the Freedom Alliance more  time for possible participation.    At a meeting in Ulundi, the IFP's Central Committee called  for international mediation to bring about a negotiated  settlement. The message from the Central Committee was clear --  no participation in the election with the constitution as it is  at the moment. The party's negotiators gave feedback on the  unsuccessful talks with the government and the ANC. Many of the  members stated unequivocally that the negotiations had brought  them nothing.    [Begin IFP leader Buthelezi recording in English] We want  actually those things that have not been accommodated,  accommodated. So I mean that question applies both ways because  even now if those things were acquired -- even if there was no  international mediation. If they were accommodated, we would  still participate in the election. So because we have not  acquired that that's why we now seek international mediation so  that those things can be accommodated before we can participate  in the election. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Fabrics side underpins 39% growth at Lamont A successful performance from the fabrics and fabric printing division underpinned a 39 per cent pre-tax profits increase at Lamont Holdings, the Northern Ireland-based textiles group, in the first half of 1994. However, that success was a sharp counterpoint to the troubles the group experienced in the carpet and carpet yarn division, which swung into the red at the operating level. Lamont's shares eased 4p to 333p. Group pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 5.62m (Pounds 4.05m) on turnover 8 per cent ahead at Pounds 71m (Pounds 65.8m). Within those figures, operating profits from the fabrics side grew 52 per cent to Pounds 6.39m (Pounds 4.2m) on turnover up 33 per cent at Pounds 43.2m (Pounds 32.6m), while the carpets side fell into losses of Pounds 437,000 (profits Pounds 561,000) on turnover down Pounds 2m at Pounds 26.9m. Mr Dick Milliken, chief executive, said that the maintenance of gross margins at 27.4 per cent masked an underlying pressure on group margins. On carpets they were down about 2 points, and the half under review included Cunningham Johnson, the fabric printer bought in October 1993 and now consolidated into Alexander Drew. Since June, Lamont has bought for Pounds 500,000 a linen weaving operation in Estonia. Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman, said it was an exciting prospect 'if we can make it work'. Sir Desmond the recovery was 'hesitating, rather than progressing', impacting adversely on the carpets side. Although Northern Ireland Carpets, the downmarket manufacturer, remained resilient and in profit, Shaw Carpets in Barnsley was likely to incur greater losses this year than 1993's Pounds 2m. Deciding against closure because of the previous Pounds 4m investment on the backing plant, Shaw is to be 'brought into line with current market activity levels'. This, Sir Desmond said, would cost Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m this year and would involve about 150 job losses out of the 350 total. Borrowings at June 30 were about Pounds 14m (Pounds 9m) and, after expected capital expenditure of Pounds 17m for the year, would total about Pounds 28m at the year-end. Earnings rose to 12.6p (10.62p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.65p (3.5p).</p>

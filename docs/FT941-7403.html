			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / French pension reform delayed Reform of the French pension system, due to be presented to parliament in the spring, is likely to be pushed back to the autumn, the economy ministry said yesterday, writes John Ridding in Paris. It said the expected delay reflected the time needed to study the various proposals for the introduction of capitalised pensions to complement the existing 'pay as you go' system. But it may also reflect concerns that the creation of private pension funds could discourage consumption and hamper efforts to revive the economy by stimulating private consumption. Economists believe the introduction of private pension funds would increase savings and hence reduce spending.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (5): Balaguer set to award Dollars 200m contract - Mining IN A few weeks the Dominican government will name the foreign company it has approved to develop what will be one of the largest gold-mining ventures in the Americas, writes Canute James. The companies have put in bids for building facilities to exploit gold and silver deposits, which are owned by Rosario Dominicana, the state company, in Pueblo Viejo in the island's north. The development of the facility follows the exhaustion of reserves in the oxide zone of the mine, and a decline in the country's gold and silver output in recent years. Bids are being considered from four companies - Davy McKee of the UK, Minproc Engineering and BHP Utah International of Australia, and Paulo Abib/Andrea Gutierrez of Brazil. The favoured company will be granted a Dollars 200m contract. Rosario Dominicana expects that the Pueblo Viejo sulphide zone will yield an average of 1,100 ounces of gold (with 40 per cent silver content) a day. The country expects to earn about USDollars 7bn before the deposits are exhausted. All the companies have presented projects that would take between two and 2 1/2 years to complete. The board of Rosario Dominicana is evaluating the bids, and such is the importance which the government has attached to the venture that the final decision on the award of the contract will be taken by President Balaguer. The development and exploitation of the sulphide zone will reverse the trend in the decline in production of precious metals. Gold production in 1981 was 412,991 ounces, but fell gradually to 138,640 ounces in 1990 and is estimated to have been slightly less last year. 'Gold production has been falling as the oxide deposits have been exhausted and attention has been turned to a transition zone,' says Mr Gerald Ellis, director-general for minerals. That zone will be worked for three years and then the sulphite zone will be exploited for about 25 years. The transition zone will be mined until 1993 and is expected to yield gold and silver worth about Dollars 125m. Earnings from the expanded gold-mining venture will lift the country's already significant minerals sector, now dominated by nickel production. The Dominican Republic is the world's seventh largest nickel producer and the second largest after Canada in the western hemisphere. The country's proven reserves are about 37.8m tonnes with a grading of 1.72 per cent nickel. The only producer, Falconbridge Dominicana, a subsidiary of a Canadian company, has a facility with a capacity of 63m lb a year. The industry, which has overtaken sugar as the main foreign currency earner for the Dominican Republic, has been troubled by domestic and market problems in recent years. The plant was shut in 1988 as the company and the government argued over an export levy. The issue was resolved when the government guaranteed the company's mining operations and exports, while the company allowed the state an increased share in profits. More recently, the industry was affected by low prices and weak demand for nickel. Exports last year are estimated to have been slightly lower that the 67.4m lb exported in 1990, and which were valued at Dollars 262.1m. The reduced production was caused by a cutback in production by Falconbridge in the last quarter of last year because of low prices. 'Several companies are involved in exploration for precious and base metals in other parts of the country,' says Mr Ellis. 'There is some hope of finding another major gold deposit, and several major Japanese, US and Canadian companies are in the hunt.' The companies include the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan and Canyon Resources and Battle Mountain of the US. At the same time, a number of companies is involved in oil exploration as the government attempts to reduce its dependence on foreign oil, and to ensure that its electricity generating capacity is below demand. The company needs about 23m barrels of oil a year, and the government clearly hopes that two ventures will yield oil. Mobil of the US and Once Once, a joint US/Dominican venture are exploring areas offshore and onshore for which they have been granted licences. 'The Dominican Republic has a policy which is favourable to investments in petroleum and mining,' says Mr Ellis. 'The country is willing to welcome any company which comes. The paperwork and the bureaucracy are slow, but we are trying to speed up things.' The bauxite mining industry is in an uncertain state. Mines which were worked by the Aluminum Company of America were closed in 1982 after declining production. The Dominican Republic, a founding member of the International Bauxite Association, a producers' organisation, lost its membership when the industry died. There have since been bauxite shipments from the country when agreed quantities are mined by a local company, Ideal Dominicana, for the Aluminum Company of America. Most of this has been to fill shortfalls in Alcoa's operations, notably in Surinam when that industry was affected two years ago by anti-government rebels. Mr Ellis reported that the Dominican Republic has 15m tonnes of bauxite reserves, and that Alcoa ordered 150,000 tonnes of ore last year. The order was not filled as President Balaguer suspended mining because of increasing local concern over deforestation and other adverse environmental effects. The government has also been trying to expand production of other minerals. Corde, the holding company for state enterprises, is attempting to increase output of gypsum, lifting production which was 75,000 tonnes in 1990, to about 250,000 tonnes a year. There are also plans to lift marble extraction well beyond current levels which average 20,000 cubic metres a year. Limestone production has also fluctuated in recent years, moving from 350,000 tonnes in 1989 to 503,000 tonnes last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren said here today that China has always insisted that a  political settlement for the Mideast issue should be sought on  the basis of resolutions adopted by the Security Council of the  United Nations.    Rong made the remarks when meeting with Faruq al-Qaddumi,  foreign minister of the State of Palestine, who arrived in  Beijing on Thursday [7 April] for a six-day visit to China.    Rong said that the signing of the agreement between Israel  and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on implementing  a declaration of principles for palestinian self-rule on the  West Bank and in Gaza shows that the Palestinian issue can be  solved through peaceful negotiations.    China hopes that the recent U.N. resolutions on occupied  territory would be implemented smoothly, he said, adding that  parties concerned should continue to work for peace in an  all-round manner.    Rong said that China firmly supports the mideast peace  process and will, as always, support the just cause of the  Palestinians.    Al-Qaddumi, also director of the Political Department of the  Palestine Liberation Organization, said that his organization  would work patiently and continue peaceful negotiations for an  early realization of the legitimate rights of the palestinians.</p>

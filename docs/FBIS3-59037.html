			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "Lz.": "Militia Army By No Means Outdated"] </F>   [Text] At the general meeting of the Officers' Society of  the Canton of Zurich (KOG) on Saturday [14 January], Federal  Councillor Kaspar Villiger said the militia system is still a  good form of defense. The chief of the Swiss Military  Department thinks that security policy openness is essential.  In his opinion, the discussion of the future of national  defense has to continue, but now the implementation of "Army 95"  is in the foreground.    On Saturday a surprisingly large number of politicians,  federal and canton parliamentarians, and government and Zurich  city councillors gathered in the Zurich congress house, where  the KOG general meeting took place. The focus of the event was  the definition of security and defense policy positions by  Federal Councillor Kaspar Villiger. In the introduction of his  lecture entitled, "Topical Security Policy Questions," Villiger  gave a general outline of the world political situation. It is  now clearly proven that the Report 90 is a useful basis for  Switzerland's security policy. There are no longer any islands  of total security; Switzerland will also have to live in a gray  area between peace and war, he said.    Afterward, the chief of the Swiss Military Department  reported on the diverse efforts to establish security  structures, particularly in Europe. In his opinion, a small  state like Switzerland with a limited security policy scope has  every interest in the establishment of such systems, for  neutrality has largely lost its importance as a security  strategy. In his representations, Villiger followed the line of  the neutrality report in the addendum to the recently published  foreign policy report. The principle that Switzerland still does  not interfere in foreign controversies is still extant. It  lends particular credibility to the Red Cross and later perhaps  to Swiss blue helmets as well. Neutrality must not be  abandoned, but adjusted to the changed general conditions.  According to Villiger, neutrality that is understood in a modern  way provides scope for security policy opening. In his view,  security policy cooperation is indispensable. Establishing  relations with NATO -- the federal councillor mentioned the  invitation to Partnership for Peace -- and the Western European  Union (WEU) is possible, but membership is not conceivable for  reasons of neutrality, he said.    In view of the numerous unsolved conflicts and the absence  of  a solid European security system, it is necessary for  Switzerland to continue to maintain an adequate defense  capability. Villiger briefly dealt with the new defense  doctrine, which is formulated in the "Operative Command 95"  regulations. It translates the security policy strategy into  military practice, and is now to be tested in exercises. In  addition, the Army has to adjust its mission to the new spectrum  of risks and to extend it. With a view to defense against forms  of violence below the threshold of war, it is useful to employ  troops to support civilian governments in extraordinary  situations. Those who claim -- Villiger referred here to the  "security policy" working group's report -- the Army wants  additional tasks in order to legitimize itself anew do not take  into account security policy realities.    Villiger got to talking about military peace operations that  represent means to prevent crises and crisis management.  Participation in UN operations with blue helmets is of solid  military use for Switzerland; blue helmets would convey  experiences of war that one would otherwise not have. Villiger  knows that many officers are skeptical of such a commitment.  This is not an existential question; the credibility of  Switzerland's security policy is at issue, he said. Therefore,  he appealed to the present cadres to consider this matter  thoroughly and to deal constructively with the blue helmet file.  At the same time, however, he intimated that a political  opinion is not forced on anybody. In Austria, Finland, and  Sweden, one is proud of being able to provide blue helmets.  Villiger substantiated the "multiple functions" of "Army 95,"  which concerns the Army as a whole and not individual units. Of  course, in the medical service, for example, it is possible to  rely more on civilian structures and facilities. It is useful  to use military means and military knowledge for disaster  relief, however, even if some people do not understand this.  The militia system is by no means outdated either. It is true  that only professional armed forces can by used as intervention  forces in international operations. However, Switzerland does  not want to participate in them. Moreover, a professional army  is out of the question for Switzerland for political and  financial reasons. As for the rest, Villiger pointed out that  armed forces assigned for defensive fighting are based on  draftees or militia structures. Increasing interest in the Swiss  militia system can even be internationally determined, he said.    The militia's power of cohesion must not be underestimated.  "Army 95" has to be translated into reality now. The solution  that has been found will be reexamined according to the  development of the world political situation or because of  changes in general internal conditions. The question of  strength will certainly be put on the list again, since studies  show that it will no longer be possible to ensure a control  strength as of 2005. Villiger did not conceal that the project  would be fundamentally affected in the event of further budget  cuts and thus seriously endangered. Even though the  implementation of reforms is in the foreground, the discussion  on future development has to continue. Innovative ideas are  always welcome, he said.    In the business segment of the event, KOG President Guenter  Heuberger, major in the General Staff, reported on the  importance of the officers' societies for Switzerland's military  policy and also called on the officers present to deal  objectively with the question of blue helmets. Heuberger will  be replaced according to routine rotation by Peter Fischer,  captain in the General Staff.</p>

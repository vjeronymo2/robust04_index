Zhu, member of the Standing Committee of the Political  Bureau  of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, praised  Sichuan for its achievements in various sectors and its efforts  to properly handle the relations between the reforms,  development and stability.    On January 6, Zhu paid a visit to the Chongqing No.1 Textile  Mill, where he called a meeting of nine enterprises in  difficulty to discuss with them how to end their plight.    Zhu Rongji said that the establishment of a modern  enterprise  system required that the government kept its hands off  enterprises, allowing them to enjoy decision-making powers and  managers to bear full responsibility for their decisions.    He said that for enterprises which continually suffer losses  and cannot pay their debts, an experimental bankruptcy policy  can be applied so as to reorganize them.    He also stressed the importance of reforming the social  security system so that the enterprises can smoothly transform  their system and maintain stability.    He urged managers and directors to overcome their  difficulties mainly on their own by developing new products and  studying the market, improving management and transforming the  operational system.    He called on them to show more concern for the living of  their employees.</p>

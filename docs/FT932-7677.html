			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Greece liberalises capital movement GREECE has loosened controls on medium-term capital movement to other European Community countries, making it easier for residents to borrow in foreign currency and buy securities abroad. Under the new central bank directives, Greeks are no longer required to hold foreign securities for at least one year and are also allowed to invest abroad in derivatives for the first time. Companies can borrow in foreign exchange without restriction, while all forward transactions in drachmas with a duration of more than three months are permitted. The liberalisation will be extended to non-EC countries later this year, the Bank of Greece said. The central bank has also transferred its responsibility for day-to-day monitoring of capital movements to the commercial banks, in an effort to reduce bureaucratic delay in handling foreign exchange transactions. 'Effectively, we have taken away 90 per cent of remaining exchange restrictions. The rest will be automatically lifted next July,' a Bank of Greece official said. Greece was allowed by its Community partners to maintain existing controls on capital movement for 18 months after the launch of the single market.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Rutland Trust falls by 9% to Pounds 3.54m RUTLAND TRUST, the financial services and property surveying group, suffered a decline of almost 9 per cent in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 3.87m to Pounds 3.54m, in the first six months of 1992. Mr Christopher Dowling, director of corporate finance, said that the result was 'satisfactory under the (recessionary) circumstances'. Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, said that all three divisions had remained profitable 'although at a lower rate' and the group was 'in a healthy financial position'. The interim dividend is held at 0.27p. The head office/corporate finance division lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 266,000 to Pounds 639,000. Rutland has central cash resources of a little more than Pounds 8m net giving it interest of some Pounds 500,000. However, some corporate finance deals have been delayed by recent uncertainties. Progress at Capital Industries, in which it has a 37.9 per cent interest, was 'encouraging'. Trading conditions in the second-hand car market were 'at an all-time low', said Mr Dowling, though he felt that the bottom of the cycle had been reached and was encouraged for next year. Profits in the asset financing side declined by 25 per cent, from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 892,000. In professional services profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 2.01m (Pounds 2.41m). Ellis &amp; Buckle, the loss-adjusting business, received fewer claims because of the mild winter, but managed to gain market share. However, building surveying at Hunter &amp; Partners traded only at about break-even. Group turnover was down at Pounds 46.4m (Pounds 52.2m), partly, said Mr Dowling, because this time Capital Industries was an associate. After tax of Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.35m) and minorities of Pounds 233,000 (Pounds 388,000) earnings slipped to 0.84p (0.88p) per share.</p>

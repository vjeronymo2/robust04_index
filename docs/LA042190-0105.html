			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESTONIAN CONTINGENT WILL COMPETE WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM MOSCOW  </P> <P> Six Estonian athletes, originally denied permission by the Soviet Sports  Federation to compete in the Mt. San Antonio College Relays, will participate  anyway.  </P> <P> A party of 10, including Juri Tamm, arrived after a 20-hour flight from Moscow  via Havana and Mexico City.  </P> <P> Tamm was the bronze medalist in the hammer throw at the 1980 and '88 Olympic  Games.  </P> <P> Meet director Dan Shrum said that after delays in communication with the  Estonian sports officials, contact was made with the Baltic republic through a  private party in Helsinki, Finland. The invitation was then accepted.  </P> <P> Anatoli Bondarchuk, a hammer throw coach who was the Olympic gold medalist in  the event while representing the Soviet Union in 1972, was asked Friday if  there would be any reprisals from Soviet authorities against the Estonians for  competing here.  </P> <P> "No problem," said Bondarchuk, who is a Ukrainian from Kiev.  </P> <P> Estonia is seeking independence from the Soviet Union through negotiations, but  supports neighboring Lithuania, which has formally declared its independence  and is now being pressured by the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Estonian athletes will compete this weekend at Mt. San Antonio, at the UC  Irvine Invitational April 28 and at the Modesto Invitational May 5 before  returning to Estonia May 12. MAL FLORENCE  </P></p>

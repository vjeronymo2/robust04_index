IZVESTIYA was first to obtain a copy of this bulky  report prepared by the Academy of Sciences' economics department  and the international foundation, Reform.    Ten of the most well-known economists gathered around the  same table to work on this document in the final stage. We have  highlighted three of them solely because Stanislav Shatalin was  director of this work, while Leonid Abalkin and Nikolay Petrakov  were recently named chief advisers to a government which is  renewing its course. There was even talk of instructing first  deputy chairman Oleg Soskovets to draw up a program of essential  changes.    Nevertheless, Stanislav Shatalin told your IZVESTIYA  correspondent that the notion of a special "Abalkin-Petrakov"  program is a myth. All that they have to offer the government  is this report and it is this joint document which is now lying  before the president, the chairman of the government, and the  deputies in the Federal Assembly. Well, we are reading this  undoubtedly interesting work slightly earlier than the president  and all the rest.    We shall omit the detailed criticism of Gaydar's reform. It  was voiced fairly often when the reform was being implemented  and its opponents became even more active after the retirement  of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov. The Shatalin team's main  conclusion is this: The scale of the present crisis, which has  increased as a result of shock therapy, and its internal  structure are having an extremely dire effect on the solution of  social tasks and threaten the irreversible destruction of the  country's economic, scientific, and technical potential.    After expressing the ritualistic criticism of the  monetarists, and moreover expressed in sometimes well argued  criticism, the academicians move onto the basic principles of  the development of their strategy. There are six. To summarize  briefly, first there is the "definition of the social indicators  of the reform" -- a guaranteed subsistence minimum, an  employment threshhold, the proportion of expenditure on  education, health care, and so forth -- limits which may not be  exceeded under any circumstances or for any reason.    Second, they are demanding the abandonment of the "naive  belief in the automatic improvement of the economy by impersonal  monetarism" and demand the restoration of state regulation.  Material production must be supported, the competitiveness of  Russian goods must be increased, and reliable economic  legislation must be adopted.    The third principle is financial stabilization. How? The  measures include the mobilization of domestic sources of  accumulation using the population's money savings. While  proclaiming a rigid financial and credit policy, the  academicians nevertheless believe that the priority spheres and  production units must be supported. They propose the regulation  of prices and incomes. And so forth.    The fourth principle is the guideline toward the single  Russian market. But here they utter the traditional phrase  about switching the focus of the reform "from the center to the  regions."    Fifth. Reliance on one's own efforts. A reappraisal of the  role of foreign aid. We will cope by ourselves.    Sixth and last. The transformation of the relations of  ownership. This is the main area. Every form of ownership, and  that includes state ownership, must have an owner. The economy  is multi-tiered. Attracting investments is the main criterion  in the decision on privatization. Switching the focus from the  privatization of property to the privatization of management  (eternal glory to the directors!). And a sweeping blow: the  "consistent curtailment of voucher-based privatization as a  populist measure, which is incapable of resolving the problem of  social injustice but can intensify the rise in inflation and the  collapse of the production potential." The old guys know how to  swear eruditely.    There are three stages to the "new" reform. In the first 2-3  years we will achieve stabilization. We will stop the slump in  production and reduce the rate of inflation. We will highlight  the "crucial areas" (housing, food, and medicines) and place the  emphasis on them. In stage two -- 10 years -- we will embark on  the structural reorganization of the economy. We will achieve  the pre-crisis volume of gross product and ease the  stratification of property so that in the third stage we can  join the ranks of the world's economic leaders.    But that is in the future. In the first half of this year it  is planned to settle all the wage debts. To establish in  legislation a subsistence minimum and within a year raise the  minimum wage to that level.    "But that means the money supply," I said to Shatalin, "it  means increasing the money supply again. " "Yes, it means the  money supply," the academician agreed, "which in its pure form  leads to a rise in inflation. But if the extra money leads to a  growth in production and extra goods, this will reduce  inflation. You have to do your calculations. That is what I  told Boris Fedorov -- you have to do your calculations."    The authors of the report argued among themselves most about  prices and customs policy and the attitude toward hard  currencies. This is how it turned out in the end.    The liberalization of prices, first and foremost prices for  energy resources, can only restrict the market and lead to a new  spiral of inflation, a further slump in production, and the  collapse of whole sectors if the commodity producers retain  their monopoly, the authors believe. This means that it is  necessary to use the traditional stabilization measures. In  other words, to regulate prices. The sequence goes like this --  first prices for certain raw materials and transport charges are  fixed. The state pays the debt to the sectors. Then within the  framework of this set of measures the ratio between prices and  pay levels are normalized by agreement. Prices will be indexed  by means of special funds created from tax receipts from  above-norm profits. This tax will be paid by those who sell  output at deregulated prices. The aim is that a certain  rational correlation of prices will be fixed initially using  administrative measures and then within a few months an entire  system of economic regulators will be built to "underpin" these  correlations.    The academicians' dream is that inflation will then be  around  3-5 percent. As a consumer of their economic plans I can  foresee empty shelves in the stores. Just like before. Empty  shelves will be the result of the proposed principle of the  protectionism of this country's producers primarily through a  customs import tariff. The course aimed at the convertibility  of the ruble is acknowledged to be long-term and is effectively  postponed indefinitely. But the task right now is to regulate  the system of the internal convertibility of the ruble. The  auction rate ceases to be official. The Central Bank fixes the  price of the dollar.    After that it is like it used to be in the old days. The  course of the reintegration of the former republics of the USSR,  although, admittedly, on the basis of national currencies. The  restoration of the manageability of the economy. That is, the  direct management of state enterprises. State control of the  process of privatization. The appointment of leaders. The  participation of local organs in the direction of joint-stock  and holding companies. "It can no longer be tolerated that  ministries and departments are removed from the processes of the  reform of enterprises.. from influencing the consumer market"....    Shatalin himself admitted honestly: He knows how things must  not be done but he only half knows how things ought to be done.  Nevertheless, instead of surgical intervention, the ailing  economy is being offered the old, tried and tested medicines  whose effectiveness is only half guaranteed.    The point, it seems to us, is not whether the prescriptions  are old. The point is that even if you wrap them in a new  package, they passed their use-by date long ago.</p>

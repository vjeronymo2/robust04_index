			<p>BFN     [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia June 17 (CTK) -- "Vladimir  Meciar as Slovak premier ordered the Interior Ministry to watch  head of its secretariat Anna Nagyova at the time when there was  a minor misunderstanding between them," Ludovit Cernak,  parliament deputy chairman and chairman of the National  Democratic Party (NDS) confirms in the daily SLOVENSKY VYCHOD  today.    Asked by the daily, Cernak confirmed the existence of a  private firm which acts as information and intelligence agency  for ex-Premier Meciar. The firm, according to SLOVENSKY VYCHOD,  obtained "unofficial" information about Slovak high-ranking  politicians. The paper says that Jaroslav Svechota, former  Slovak interior minister in 1990 when Meciar led the ministry,  works in the firm.    Cernak says that he has documents to prove that Meciar, in  the interests of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS),  corrupted the Slovak National Party (SNS) when Cernak was its  chairman, and had thus contributed to the victory of  non-tolerant and radical wing.</p>

But others didn't notice anything.  </P> <P> Rebels Coach Jerry Tarkanian, whose team hopes to break a two-game losing  streak tonight against UC Santa Barbara, said: "I've got so many things to  worry about, I didn't even know anything was happening."  </P> <P> Airline officials said the cabin pressure loss was caused by a circuit break,  which was repaired in flight.  </P></p>

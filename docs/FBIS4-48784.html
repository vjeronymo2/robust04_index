			<p>BFN     [Text] Former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction  Assembly] Government President Charles Gankay Taylor has spoken  harshly against the frequent wave of attacks on the NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], in the wake of the  ongoing peace process. President Taylor said these attacks are  heavily concentrated on areas where NPFL has demobilized its  forces, particularly in Compound No. 2 in Grand Bassa County.  The NPFL leader said his organization is holding ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in  Liberia] responsible for these attacks, because they were  present in these areas where the NPFL originally demobilized its  forces. He reminded ULIMO and ECOMOG that, under the Charter of  the United Nations, peacekeepers are posted to countries where  conflicts have gone beyond internal control, requiring the  involvement of neutral forces to end the conflicts.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Party set to discipline councillors  -Lambeth Council THE LABOUR Party's national executive is intending to bring disciplinary charges against thirteen suspended Lambeth councillors. At a meeting yesterday the NEC committee reaffirmed its decision to suspend members of the south London borough for 'continual breaches of the rules of the party' and agreed to consider drawing up charges to go to the party's national constitutional committee. At this stage the councillors could face expulsion from the party. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said at the meeting: 'Who is going to be convinced by people who say they are going to change the world and can't even collect the garbage.' The suspension of the councillors, which included Ms Joan Twelves, leader of the council, followed council meetings which, in one case, voted against the Labour leadership's policy by condemning Britain's role in the Gulf war and, in the other, refused to allow bailiffs to be used to collect poll tax. The meetings were deemed highly damaging to the national party. Also suspended along with the councillors were Mr Steve Nally, secretary of the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation, which Labour judges to be a Militant front group, and Mr Kevin Fernandez, a prominent member. With the campaign for next week's local elections well under way, the Labour Party's national leadership is anxious to distance itself from hard-left councils like Lambeth which is considered by some to be an electoral liability. The remaining 27 Labour councillors in Lambeth have been told to write to the council's chief executive stating that they are members of the Labour group. The NEC has also instructed them to elect new officers at their next council meeting on May 13th. Until then Ms Twelves, one of those who has been suspended, is technically still the leader of the council.</p>

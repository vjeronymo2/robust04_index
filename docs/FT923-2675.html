			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Relaunch for postponed mortgage-backed issue A RARE mortgage-backed Eurobond issue from a continental European borrower was relaunched yesterday, having been pulled last week due to the turmoil in Swedish financial markets. Goldman Sachs relaunched the offer, by Osprey Mortgage Securities - a special purpose vehicle for a subsidiary of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken - in the face of renewed pressure on Swedish markets. However, the bank said that after discussions with the issuer, investors and the rating agencies it was confident the issue would not need to be delayed again, even if the markets suffered the same upheaval as last week. The terms of the Dollars 372m offer have been amended only slightly, with a change of size in two of the three tranches of bonds. Also, CSFB was replaced by Morgan Stanley as a co-lead to the issue. However, the spreads over US Treasuries offered on the bonds were squarely within the ranges indicated last week. The first tranche, for instance, was offered at a spread of 78.5 basis points, compared with an indicated range last week of 77-80 basis points. The original decision to delay the issue had caused concern in some quarters, since it marked an unusual move to hold back an offer that had already been underwritten. However, Goldman said at the time that it merely intended to postpone the offer until the markets settled down. Trading in German Bund futures on the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) will start one hour earlier on Monday, the day after the French vote on the Maastricht treaty, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt. Trading will begin at 7am local time on Bund futures, as well as for Bobl futures and options on Bund futures.</p>

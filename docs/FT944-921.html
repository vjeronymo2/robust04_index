			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Canadian tax deepens culture row with US A dispute between the US and Canada over efforts to protect Canadian magazines, television services and cultural institutions deepened yesterday when Ottawa imposed an 80 per cent excise tax on advertising revenues from magazines compiled in the US and beamed electronically to Canadian printing plants. The new tax is payable by the printer or local distributor. The move was specifically directed against Time Warner, the US entertainment and publishing group which took advantage of a loophole in Canadian trade laws last year to combine Canadian advertising and US editorial content in a low-cost local edition of Sports Illustrated. Other US magazines, which already dominate Canadian news stands, have been closely watching the Sports Illustrated experiment. US trade officials say Canada's most recent moves on cultural protectionism represent 'a disturbing trend'. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, is expected to announce that he will work closely with the US industry to consider all options, including retaliation. Ottawa secured an exemption for the cultural sector from the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement. But the US is allowed to retaliate against any new protective measures to an equivalent commercial value. Washington is also angered by a Canadian regulatory ruling this year to withdraw a licence granted to Country Music Television (CMT), a US cable-TV channel two-thirds owned by Westinghouse Electric. Cable operators are due to replace the US channel with a Canadian country music service on January 1. CMT, which has been available in Canada for about 10 years and is carried to 2m Canadian homes, plans to ask the US trade representative to file a complaint under section 301 of the US international trade law. Although they voraciously tune into US television stations and read US publications, Canadians are highly sensitive to any perceived threat to their own cultural institutions. 'The Americans simply see it as a product and entertainment,' Ms Catherine Keachie, director of the Canadian Magazine Publishers Association said yesterday. 'Canadians are quite clear that we have to have our own books, films and magazines to maintain a unique culture.' About half of Canada's 1,400 periodicals made a profit in 1992. 'It is not a matter of profitability . . . but of survival,' Mr Michel Dupuy, heritage minister, said yesterday. The government also unveiled plans to impose a consumer levy on blank audio tapes. The proceeds will be distributed to musicians, singers and other artists to compensate for lost sales due to copying of tapes and records.</p>

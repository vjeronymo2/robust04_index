			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A charter for passengers THE PASSENGER'S Charter yesterday drew into the platform almost six months later than scheduled. The reason for the delay was not leaves on the track or the wrong kind of snow so much as the difficulty of finding money to fund the scheme. If passengers are to be paid compensation for service failures, British Rail must either find the money from lower investment or higher fares - in either case rebounding on the passengers it is intended to help. The charter therefore emphasises prevention rather than cure. For example, each of the 15 main commuter routes into London is to be set 'challenging but achievable' targets for reliability and punctuality which will reflect the investment which has gone into it. Failure to meet the targets will lead to automatic discounts for commuters on the cost of renewing season tickets. Each line's progress will be monitored on a monthly basis, so that managers have the opportunity to improve performance and avoid payouts. Hard-pressed commuters on unmodernised lines such as that between Southend and London's Fenchurch Street station will no doubt welcome any incentive for BR managers to reduce the level of misery created by continual delays and cancellations. But the London arrangements will not automatically apply to commuters in other conurbations where local rail services are the responsibility of Passenger Transport Executives. Existing scheme On other parts of the railway network, yesterday's charter may offer less compensation than is available under the existing discretionary and little-publicised scheme. For example, while the charter specifies compensation for trains which are excessively delayed, no recompense is offered if trains are unheated in cold weather (as is sometimes available under the present scheme). And compensation will be in vouchers against the cost of future travel, rather than in cash. All of this is understandable if the aim is to persuade rail managers to be more attentive to passengers' needs without incurring extra expenditure. But the only long-term solution to the failure of state ownership to provide an acceptable level of service is to open the railways to private capital and competitive pressures. Like the passenger's charter, the government's plans to privatise BR have been running unconscionably late. In this case, the delay has been to good purpose, since it has allowed ministers to examine and reject the favoured strategy of selling off profitable operations such as InterCity complete with trains and tracks. This would have left each operation as a monopoly, and made it hard to privatise parts of the network which cannot be profitable when competing with roads that are free at the point of use. Piecemeal procedure Now ministers plan to proceed piecemeal, beginning by removing BR's monopoly over the provision of rail services. With more than a dozen private operators queueing up to run trains on the network, an element of competition could be introduced quickly. That would be followed by the sale of profitable operations such as InterCity without their tracks. Loss-making services would be franchised to the bidder prepared to accept the lowest subsidy. Ultimately, BR itself would dwindle to a track authority, with responsibility for centralised functions such as safety, timetabling and ticketing. This divorce of the ownership of trains from the ownership of track offers a significant benefit. If the government would accept responsibility for the latter - as it does for roads - the charging structure for both could be put on a comparable basis. Much more of the rail network would then offer profitable opportunities for business. It would also place UK rail operators in a strong position if the European Commission proceeds with plans to separate train operation from track infrastructure across the EC. If British train operators have become accustomed to competing on the UK railways, they will enjoy competitive advantage in any deregulated European rail market.</p>

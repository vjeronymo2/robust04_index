			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Goldman cleared in share probe GOLDMAN SACHS, the US investment bank, was yesterday cleared by the Stock Exchange on one aspect of its relationship with the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The exchange's investigation covered only a narrow part of the bank's dealings with Maxwell. It plans no further investigations. Wider aspects of Goldman's relationship with Mr Maxwell are still under scrutiny by other authorities such as the Serious Fraud Office and the Department of Trade and Industry. They are studying, for example, the purchase late in 1991 of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of Mr Maxwell's two listed companies, by Maxwell vehicles as part of an alleged share support scheme. The purchases were made through Goldman. The US bank has denied knowing at the time that the purchases were linked to Mr Maxwell. The exchange set up a working party in January to report on whether Goldman had acted within the exchange's rules when dealing in MCC shares. The party was told to look only at one aspect of Goldman's dealings: whether it had been covered by the Companies Act exemption which allows market-makers not to disclose stakes in listed companies which would normally have to be revealed to the stock market. The investigation focused on Goldman's dealings between August 1990 and February 1991 - after it had bought a large put option from Robert Maxwell, giving it the ability to place shares with Mr Maxwell at a predetermined price. The exchange is believed to have been concerned that any shares bought by Goldman after that time might not count technically as market-making positions, but rather should be treated as holdings built up through own-account trading. Whereas market-makers take stock on to their books through the normal course of quoting buy and sell prices to support the market, own-account traders buy shares with a view to taking a position and making a profit. The existence of the put option raised a question over whether Goldman had been acting purely as a market-maker. The exchange said: 'The working party found no evidence to support speculation that there had been a breach of Stock Exchange rules, or that there had been some form of illegal share support operation by Goldman Sachs.'</p>

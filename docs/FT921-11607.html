Salomon Brothers, the sole manager of the bond offer, said Dollars 550m of the proceeds will be used in a tender offer to buy back senior and subordinated notes issued by Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling, a unit of CCE. The remaining Dollars 950m will be used to redeem other CCE debt. The CCE offer, priced yesterday, was supposed to consist of Dollars 1bn of 10 and 30-year notes. Strong demand resulted in the issue being expanded to include Dollars 500m of 10-year notes, Dollars 250m of 20-year paper and Dollars 750m of 30-year bonds. The 10-year paper, with a 7.875 per cent coupon, was priced at par, as was the 20-year issue, with a coupon of 8.50 per cent. The 30-year bonds, was priced at 98.83 to yield 8.61 per cent.

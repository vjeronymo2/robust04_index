			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: THE COST OF LIVING BY CHRISTOPHER ZENOWICH (HARPER &amp; ROW:  $17.95; 267 PP.)  </P> <P> What would happen if an MBA wrote a novel? As "The Cost of Living" opens, Bob  and Irene are scouring the countryside around Ann Arbor, Mich., in a company  car -- a Caprice Classic -- looking for an apartment. Bob has just taken a  highly demanding job as a district inventory coordinator (DIC) with a chain of  discount drug stores; Irene needs some months to "dull out" before beginning a  law school stint to which she intends to devote her entire being. They settle  on a town for the compelling reason that it is the home of Kwik Kake, a snack  they used to eat in college to satisfy the "munchies." At this point, the  reader is not sure how seriously to take all this. The number of K's in the  munchy food seems to indicate a parody of consumerism . . . but it's not clear.  Expect no definite answers from Christopher Zenowich. It cannot be said,  however, that this is a bad novel.  </P> <P> "The Cost of Living" takes us through the first months of Bob's job. We get  details we never expect in a novel: the contents of business textbooks, for  example, such as "Store Layout as a Function of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs."  Soon Bob begins to travel his district and make out reports, struggling with  the fact that his recommendations will mean unemployment for store managers who  underperform. As Bob discovers his genius for marketing, home office takes a  greater interest in him, and his relationship with Irene becomes more distant.  </P> <P> Bob finds it difficult to explain to Irene what happens during those long days  on the job for the same reason that novels aren't written about jobs like this.  When Irene presses Bob for details, he routinely answers: "Oh, you know, the  same old stuff. It couldn't possibly interest you." The fact is that Zenowich  manages to make descriptions of the meetings, the petty triumphs, the paper  work well done, the consumer-tricking strategies, absolutely gripping. It  brings up all kinds of questions about what novels should do: Why shouldn't  fiction talk about what many of us do in the daily grind? Bob and Irene are far  from shallow; they are intelligent young people who are coming to grips with  the great questions of growing up. Somehow, however, "The Cost of Living"  remains a well-executed curiosity. Just as perhaps one novel can be written  about high-energy physics, one can be written about high-level management  training seminars, but one wouldn't want the style to take over the genre.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Saburov, member of the Crimean </F> Cabinet of Ministers, and Doctor of Economic Sciences Vladimir  Remyga, chairman of the Crimean State Committee for Foreign  Economic Relations, by Aleksandr Ryabushev in Simferopol under  the rubric "In Governments"; date not given: "Prosperity Lies  in Unity"]    [Text] "How does Crimea see the new government in the  future?" Our correspondent put this question to Yevgeniy  Saburov, a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, and to Doctor of  Economic Sciences Vladimir Remyga, chairman of the Crimean State  Committee for Foreign Economic Relations.    [Answer: speaker not identified] Well, first of all, I see  the top-priority strategic task in the foreign economic policy  sphere as determining a place for our Republic on a federative  basis with Ukraine, and in Kiev's giving us economic autonomy.  Full autonomy, according to the pattern of mutual relations  between the governments of Tataria and Russia, and the  settlement of contradictions between the Crimean Constitution of  6 May 1992 and the legislative acts of the former Ukrainian  parliament. But once these contradictions are definitively  resolved by means of talks between Crimean and Ukrainian  parliamentary commissions, then we will start to implement our  own foreign economic program, which the Crimean Supreme Council  has already submitted to us for ratification.    [Ryabushev] But talks could go on for a month, or two  months, and the reforms will remain on paper only.    [Answer] No, we are not standing still. One of Yuriy  Meshkov's first edicts was to open a trade mission in Moscow,  and treaties on economic cooperation have been signed with  Tatarstan and Krasnodar Kray. Not long ago the Crimean  president flew out to Cyprus. We are now preparing to sign a  similar agreement with Cyprus. In addition, a memorandum has  been signed in Moscow with the trade representative of Taiwan,  which wants to participate in the creation of a joint,  transnational, "Kerch-Taiwan" free economic zone. A working  group is already forming under the aegis of an international  association for the development of free economic zones. In  general terms, the priority concepts of our foreign economic  program are: to attract foreign investment into Crimea and  technical assistance within the framework of UN international  programs; to secure the establishment in Crimea of an office of  the agency for international cooperation with and investment in  Ukraine, and offices of corresponding Russian and UN  organizations; to organize cooperation with Ukrainian and  Russian trade and economic missions; to establish  telecommunications links and obtain the right of access to the  information systems of the Russian and Ukrainian Ministries of  Foreign Economic Relations; and to secure for Simferopol a  regional office of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry consular  administration. We are also planning to open a Crimean currency  exchange and a center for clearing accounts for making payments  between Crimean and Russian enterprises, and also to sign an  agreement with Russia on a single certificate of safety for our  output issued by the Crimean standardization service. As soon  as political passions die down, we are planning to examine a  project for the construction of a bridge linking Kerch with  Krasnodar Kray. In a word, as is written on our Republic's  emblem, prosperity lies in unity.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop (6): New winners emerging / Delays in adjusting to shifts in computer usage have proved costly for some of the largest system suppliers - US market The financial problems of International Business Machines and Digital Equipment have cast a pall over the US computer industry. Yet while these two companies are struggling, the market is growing and some of their competitors' sales are booming. In particular, Hewlett-Packard has emerged as a new industry leader, overtaking Digital to become second only to IBM among US companies in computer revenues, while Compaq Computer goes from strength to strength in the personal computers sector. One of the most important factors that is sorting out winners and loosers in the US computer market is the extent to which companies have adjusted to the 'new computing model,' based on networks of desktop computers, called clients, linked to 'servers,' a term that covers the broad range of computers that can be used to provide services on a computer network. For IBM , with its roots firmly planted in centralised mainframe computing, this adjustment is proving difficultand painful - 'the failure to capitalise on this sea-change in our industry (from centralised 'host' mainframe computer systems to distributed networks) is the single most important mistake IBM has made in the last decade,' Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, said recently. Announcing plans to recast IBM's entire product line, he said that the company must 'take all we know about powerful host-based systems and create new products for the open, distributed world. We should have done it a decade ago.' Similarly, Digital Equipment was slow to react to changes in the computer market, in particular the trend toward 'open systems' standards that make it easier to link computers from different manufacturers into heterogeneous client-server networks. Although Digital was an early leader in distributed computing, its traditional products were based on proprietary technology. Until the appointment of Robert Palmer, who replaced company founder Kenneth Olsen as president and chief executive in October 1992, Digital did not wholeheartedly adopt the concept of open systems. 'We have finally established credibility in the UNIX (open systems) marketplace after years of struggle and confusion,' said Mr Palmer said in a recent address to employees. These delays at IBM and Digital have proved very costly. Both companies have recorded heavy losses over the past two years and although IBM has recorded a small net profit in each of the past two quarters, Digital remains mired in losses. In contrast, Hewlett-Packard is reaping the rewards of an early shift to open systems software and client-server computing. HP 'anticipated well (the) necessary changes in technology,' says John Jones of Salomon Brothers, the US broking house. HP was in the forefront of the shift from proprietary computers to 'open systems' based on industry standards. The company was the first to implement Reduced Instruction Set Computing (Risc) technology in mid-range and mainframe computer systems, providing high performance at lower costs. HP has also been faster to come to terms with an industry-wide decline in gross profit margins as computer prices fall. Over the past five years, it has cut operating expenses from more than 40 per cent of revenues in 1988 to 28 per cent in the first fiscal quarter of 1994 (which ended on January 31). For fiscal 1993, HP's net revenue rose 24 percent to Dollars 20.3bn, compared with Dollars 16.4bn in fiscal 1992. Net earnings for the year were Dollars 1.2bn, an increase of 21 per cent. Yet it would be a mistake to dismiss HP's biggest competitors as 'has beens.' The remarkable turnaround staged by Unisys is evidence that large, stumbing computer companies can make a comeback. After three years of heavy losses, write-offs and layoffs, Unisys has put its troubles behind it. The turnaround began at the end of 1991, when Unisys recorded a modest fourth quarter profit. The company has not looked back since. Over the past two years Unisys' profits have doubled, to Dollars 565.4m in 1993. Net debts have been reduced from a peak of almost Dollars 4bn to Dollars 1.1bn at the end of 1993. 'The turnaround is real . . . no management in the computer business has executed better over the past two years . . .' commented Curt Rohrman of First Boston in a recent report on the company. Revenues, however, are still declining. For 1993, the company reported sales of Dollars 7.7bn, down 23 percent from a 1990 peak of Dollars 10.1bn. Currently only about 10 to 15 per cent of Unisys' sales are to new customers. In a bid to boost flagging sales of mainframe computers, Unisys has moved ahead of competitors in a transition to more cost efficient semiconductor chips which will be manufactured for Unisys by its long-time rival IBM. Unlike traditional mainframes, Unisys' new computer systems will not require elaborate water-cooling systems. This will make them better suited to today's networked computer systems, and more cost competitive. To further offset declining sales, Unisys is now focusing increasingly upon the services side of the computer business, providing systems integration and consulting services to its customers. The contrasting fortunes of the leading US large and mid-range computer systems companies are mirrored in the personal computer sector where Compaq Computer is growing rapidly while Apple Computer is struggling to maintain profitability and IBM's PC operations appear to be faltering after a strong comeback in 1993. Compaq Computer reported 'unprecedented demand' for its PC products in 1993 and set a goal of becoming the world PC market leader by 1996, overtaking IBM and Apple Computer. Compaq's 1993 revenues jumped 75 percent to Dollars 7.2bn. Net income more than doubled to Dollars 462m. 'We feel very much like the market leader,' said Eckhart Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive. 'We have mapped out our strategy and I believe that we can get there.' According to market analysts at International Data Corporation (IDC), Compaq may achieve its goal even sooner. In terms of unit shipments, Compaq led IBM and Apple in the first quarter of 1994, according to IDC's preliminary estimates. The market research group estimates Compaq's unit shipments in the first quarter at 970,000, up 40 per cent from the same period last year. Apple shipped about 845,000 Macintosh PCs in the first quarter, an increase of eight percent year to year, maintaining its second place position in the market. IBM, however, dropped to third place with shipments of about 840,000 PCs worldwide in the first quarter, up six percent from the same period last year, but 48 percent lower than in the fourth quarter of 1993. Compaq has become the model PC company, which competitors aim to emulate. The secret to Compaq's success, says a senior executive at one of its competitors, is that the company 'has perfectly interpreted the new style of computing.'</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Which is next? Those who missed out on C&amp;G want to know which society will be the next to reward customers, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. In the case of Lloyds' bid for C&amp;G, the society has been operating from a position of strength - hence its ability to negotiate more generous terms for its members. Investors are, therefore, more likely to get a bigger windfall by being with a stronger society than a weaker one. But there are a far greater number of smaller societies, which increases the possibility of their being taken over. 'There's no real telling which society might be next - it's a complete lottery,' said Robert Villiers, building societies analyst at UBS. Of the top 10 societies, the largest are Halifax, Woolwich and Nationwide. These are probably too big to be taken over, Villiers feels, but they might decide to become a bank and give investors free shares. Of the others, Villiers says: 'Alliance &amp; Leicester, the Leeds and Bradford &amp; Bingley have come out of the recession well enough to be takeover targets.' Perhaps the most plausible bid targets are the second-tier societies such as Northern Rock, Birmingham Midshires and Portman, But a word of caution: there is a potential catch in the C&amp;G deal, which is why it is going to court next month with the Building Societies Association. At issue are two questions: whether a 'third party' (in this case, Lloyds) can make payments to a society's members, and whether the cash be distributed to anyone who has not been an investing member of the society for at least two years.</p>

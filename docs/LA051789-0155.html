			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GRAF SWAMPS DIAS 6-0, 6-0 IN 39 MINUTES  </P> <P> Top-ranked Steffi Graf of West Germany overwhelmed Niege Dias of Brazil 6-0,  6-0 today in the third round of the $300,000 Berlin women's tennis tournament.  </P> <P> Graf needed only 39 minutes to dispatch Dias.  </P> <P> It was a stunning comeback for Graf, who had struggled to defeat Tine  Scheuer-Larsen of Denmark in the second round on Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Today I was back in form," Graf said after the match.  </P> <P> Graf, the 1988 women's Olympic champion, is favored to win the tournament that  continues through Sunday.  </P> <P> In other third-round matches today, Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina defeated  Austria's Petra Ritter 6-4, 6-2; Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia beat France's  Marie Damas 6-1, 6-1; and Austria's Barbara Paulus eliminated Silke Meier of  West Germany 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> In Rome, play resumed in the Italian Open today after a 4 1/2-hour rain delay.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, Italy's Omar Camporese, a wild card entry ranked 120th in the  world, beat fourth-seeded Miloslav Mecir 6-2, 7-5 in the first round of the  tournament.  </P> <P> Mecir, who returned to action two weeks ago after a back injury suffered in  march at a tournament in Key Biscayne, Fla., looked confused and disinterested.  </P> <P> The 21-year-old Italian, a doubles specialist who had beaten Mecir once before  in Milan, scored often with big first serves and played patiently from the  baseline while Mecir made many unforced errors.  </P> <P> "I really had a lot of problems tonight," Mecir said after the match. "I didn't  know where to go or where to hit. Every ball that came across the net was a new  problem."  </P> <P> "I was very lucky tonight to have played against a Mecir who was not in top  condition," Camporese said.  </P></p>

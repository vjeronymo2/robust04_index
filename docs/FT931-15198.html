			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht coup advances referendum cause A PROCEDURAL coup by Tory Euro-sceptics and Labour MPs opposed to any further extension of the powers of the European Community yesterday opened up the possibility of British voters having the opportunity to decide the fate of the Maastricht treaty through a referendum. They have succeeded in framing new provisions for insertion in the European Communities (Amendment) Bill - certain to be strongly resisted by the government - requiring a referendum to be held before the treaty is given legal effect in the UK. They will be debated towards the end of the committee stage of the bill, which was resumed in the Commons yesterday amid further attempts to delay its progress by anti-Maastricht MPs on both sides of the House. Earlier attempts to include a referendum provision were ruled out of order, and the favourable verdict secured by the latest version was hailed as a 'historic decision' by Mr Bill Cash (C Stafford), a leading opponent of the bill. Should MPs vote for a referendum, it would be financed by the taxpayer. Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, have firmly opposed earlier calls for a referendum, but will be unable to prevent sizeable numbers of their backbenchers voting for it. Whatever the outcome of the Commons vote, ministers must now envisage that the referendum demand will also be taken up in the House of Lords by Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, and some of her closest followers. Liberal Democrat MPs, who with one exception are strong supporters of the Maastricht treaty, have consistently backed demands for a referendum. Mr Bryan Gould, who challenged Mr Smith for the Labour leadership and later resigned from his shadow cabinet, is among prominent supporters of a referendum on the opposition benches. Mr Cash announced that the campaign in favour of a referendum would get under way on Sunday with a march from Hyde Park in London to Trafalgar Square, where MPs from the three main parties will address a rally. Before debate was resumed on the bill in the Commons, Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North), the former cabinet minister, called for clarification of the pledge given by the prime minister that the third reading would not take place until after Denmark had held its second referendum on the Maastricht treaty. He emphasised the uncertainties of the political situation in Denmark. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, denied that commitments arising from the Maastricht treaty meant that the British government could be compelled to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism against its will. He clashed repeatedly with Mr Michael Spicer (C Worcestershire South), another leading opponent of the bill, who argued that the issue would not be determined by ministerial statements but by decisions made by the EC Commission and the European Court.</p>

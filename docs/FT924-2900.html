			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / US defence groups consolidate THE rapid consolidation of the US defence industry took a dramatic leap forward yesterday when General Dynamics an-nounced that it was selling its military aircraft business to rival Lockheed for Dollars 1.53bn (Pounds 1bn) in cash. The business, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and has revenues of around Dollars 3bn, is prime contractor for the F-16 fighter aircraft. It is also partnered with prime contractor Lockheed, and with Boeing, in the development of the F-22, a new generation of fighter aircraft meant to be a mainstay of the US Air Force in the next century. The deal is the latest example of a merger wave in the defence sector, which is reacting to the end of the Cold war and a Pentagon budget dropping at around 5 per cent a year. The two companies said the deal would create a Dollars 6.5bn military aircraft company which ranked first in the industry and was the second largest US defence prime contractor. The takeover, which had been rumoured for some weeks, represents a sharp strategy shift by General Dynamics, which said earlier this year that it would sell off non-core civilian and military businesses to concentrate on four key defence areas, one of them aircraft, and it would build these up to 'critical mass' through acquisitions. However, Mr William Anders, General Dynamics chairman, said yesterday that 'after unsuccessfully pursuing possible alternatives available for purchase or merger to obtain critical mass, this transaction was clearly the best way to meet the strategic needs of the tactical military aircraft franchise'. Analysts said this left open the possibility that General Dynamics might be willing to sell off its other core businesses - which include the manufacture of tanks, submarines and space systems - return the cash generated to shareholders, and shrink to little more than a shell. General Dynamics said it expected to have a net gain of about Dollars 650m on the deal, which should be completed in the first quarter of next year. Lockheed, which plans to finance the acquisition through short and long-term debt, said it expected the deal to add immediately to both earnings and cash flow per share.

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Muted holiday trading The continued closure of London's financial markets yesterday made for quiet currency trading in other centres in spite of better than expected US consumer confidence data and a surprise cut in Belgium's central rate for money market lending, writes Peter Norman. Traders in Europe said that activity was unlikely to revive until after the new year even though London operators return to the fray today. Although exchange rates moved in narrow ranges yesterday, there was a considerable amount of information for the market to digest. The dollar yesterday was a good example of a currency that failed to respond to news. The Conference Board's US consumer confidence index jumped to 80.10 in December from a revised 71.9 in November and was well above market's expectations of an index reading around 73. But the dollar did little more than drift in thin trading, to close at DM1.7015 in Frankfurt, barely changed from DM1.7017 at the opening and Monday's New York close of DM1.701. The US currency traded in a half pfennig range throughout yesterday's European session to end little changed from the DM1.695 close in London on Christmas Eve. Today sees the announcement of US leading indicators for November while US weekly jobless data will be released tomorrow. However, so long as many banks remain shut with their trading positions squared until the new year, it is difficult to foresee any revival of trading between the dollar and D-mark this week. German based traders are in any case waiting to see if their expectations of a Bundesbank rate cut are fulfilled early in the new year. The Bundesbank's first council meeting is scheduled for January 6. Yesterday Mr Otmar Issing, one of the anti-inflation hawks on the Bundesbank board, said considerable progress would be made in the fight against inflation next year. He added that the bank would continue to assess room for rate cuts but had set no date for an easing. The D-mark was mixed against other continental currencies yesterday. It was steady at FFr3.4073 against FFr 3.408 in late Monday trading. However, by last night the French currency had strengthened noticeably from the FFr3.412 recorded in London on Christmas Eve. The Italian lira eased against the D-Mark to L988.75 from Monday's L986.25 and London's pre-Christmas L983.1 on renewed political uncertainty in Italy. The Bundesbank's money market operations yesterday gave no clue to interest rate intentions. It called for tenders on its latest round of 14-day securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 6 per cent to replace some DM79.5bn in 6 per cent repos which expire today. The new tranche of repos expires on January 12 and will be the fourth consecutive operation of its kind at which the rate has been fixed at 6 per cent. The amount accepted will be announced today, when payment also will be due. By contrast, the Belgian National Bank surprised the markets by cutting its key central rate for money market lending by 0.15 percentage points to 7.25 per cent yesterday. It also cut its regular overnight interest rate by 0.15 points to 8.95 per cent while leaving its discount rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent and its emergency rate for overnight lending at 11.50 per cent. The Belgian National Bank declined to coment on the rate cuts. But they clearly did the Belgian franc no harm. It closed marginally stronger against the D-mark at BFr20.82 compared with BFr20.8295 late Monday and BFr20.84 in London on December 24. Sterling was supported in the absence of London trading by bullish remarks about the UK recovery from Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. The pound was firm in late European dealings at DM2.5645 against Monday's DM2.5580 and DM 2.545 in London last Friday. Against the dollar, sterling traded at Dollars 1.5085 in late European activity compared with Dollars 1.504 on Monday and Dollars 1.502 in pre-holiday London dealings. Earlier in Tokyo, the yen maintained a fragile stability. It closed against the dollar at Y111.45, slightly weaker than Y111.40 of late Monday in New York and the Y111.25 yen in Tokyo on Monday. Yesterday in New York lunchtime trading it was quoted at around Y111.35. A moderate recovery of Tokyo stock prices hindered aggressive selling of the yen in Japan yesterday. Also operators were reported to be 'very nervous about the wall of Y112,' according to one dealer at a Japanese credit bank. 'At present Y112 is a thick psychological barrier,' he said. Dealers said that the majority in the market predict a rise in the dollar at the beginning of January. However, the real intentions of the US regarding the yen's exchange rate remain uncertain, keeping traders uneasy. Aggressive dollar buying has been discouraged by last week's comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, who said the US administration has been disappointed with the Japanese government's efforts towards stimulating domestic demand. Moreover, complaints late on Monday from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, about a drop in the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market in the third quarter of this year fueled concerns that the US might place upward pressure on the yen. The Japanese finance ministry announced yesterday that Japan's current account surplus for November fell 21 per cent from the year-earlier month to Dollars 8.21bn. Although the drop was sharper than expected, it failed to trigger any reaction in foreign exchange trading. Because of the extended UK holiday, the tables on this page containing data from London carry information from December 24. Data relating to US and continental European markets reflect yesterday's trading conditions.</p>

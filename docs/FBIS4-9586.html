			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Radovan Radinovic by Slobodan </F> Reljic; place and date not given: "Now or Never"]    [Text] General Radovan Radinovic (55) does not look like a  pensioner. "That is how things go in the army and in the  police. A new boss, a new team," he says. Since he retired in  January 1994, he has been working for the Institute of Economy  in Belgrade as a scientific adviser for military and strategic  studies and research. He had for years taught military strategy  at the War School. He came to the Institute from the Strategy  Division of the Federal Defense Ministry, where he was division  head. At the beginning of 1993, he was a member of Cosic's team  at the Geneva negotiations. "I would like this interview to  reflect my attitude that this is an historic chance for Serbia.  What we did not succeed in achieving in 1918, we can achieve  now. The price may be higher, but it should be paid. I visited  Krajina, I visited every part of the front, I went to Bosnia, I  spoke with people, and I really convinced myself that this is a  historic struggle for the survival of the Serbian nation. If  this chance is missed, we shall never have it again."    We then went back to the analysis of the present situation:  "If we were to look just at Gorazde, it could not be said that  it is a town of big strategic importance. At the moment,  however, there are approximately 70,000 people there, maybe  more. From the point of view of the constitution of a Muslim  state in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is being supported  by a new Turkish expansion toward the Balkans, toward "the belly  of Europe," Gorazde is of exceptional importance. It is one of  the most important points because it is a natural connection  between Sandzak and Bosnia.    [Relic] You are speaking about its importance for the  Muslims. What about the Serbs?    [Radinovic] It is important for us that the Muslims do not  achieve their goal -- that is, that we cut the so-called green  transversal. What is important for us is that the Yugoslav  border toward the former Bosnia-Herzegovina be as safe as  possible, and it will be safer if this part is in Serbian hands.    [Reljic] The Western press wrote that Gorazde, an island in  the Serbian territory, would have fallen anyway, so they found  it senseless to insist on a military solution.    [Radinovic] I can tell you that I never thought the original  Serbian idea was to occupy Gorazde. On the contrary: The Serbs  in the republic of Srpska of Bosnia-Herzegovina accepted that  Gorazde should remain a UN protected area. The Serbs were,  however, provoked by the Muslim offensive, supported by the  international community and the announced military assistance,  first of all by the United States.    [Reljic] Do the United States and Europe have a clear  strategy for Bosnia or are they adapting themselves to changes?    [Radinovic] The rest of Yugoslavia was of strategic  interest for neither the United States nor Europe. As a  powerful state in the Balkans, Yugoslavia prevented the  infiltration of new centers of power -- Germany, on the one  hand, and Turkey, on the other. It was only a matter of time  when it would come to a breakup of Yugoslavia. It can be said  that they mostly did not have a clearly defined military and  political strategy. I would say that their wish was to reshape  the territory. The present crisis shows that Europe is not  capable of controlling a situation on its territory.    [Reljic] Are you speaking about U.S. strategy?    [Radinovic] Yes.    [Reljic] What can the unfolding of events tell us about the  U.S. strategy? There is the impression that NATO -- where the  United States is the decisionmaker -- is behaving like the  Yugoslav People's Army during the breakup of Yugoslavia.  Politicians are in two minds and the army makes a funny  impression.    [Radinovic] First of all, NATO wants to obtain a new  legitimacy, which can be achieved if there are crises that  cannot be solved without its participation. In the former  Yugoslavia, however, NATO seems to be losing what it has gained  so far, because it took part of one side in a civil war. This  could be damaging not only for NATO but also for the United  Nations. They have underestimated the civil war in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Reljic] Has their strategic interest been seriously  affected?    [Radinovic] I would not say that this will affect their  strategic interest, but they will have to adapt their behavior  to the situation. First of all, they have decided to be the  only judge, forgetting that Russia also has its legitimate right  to require that the Yugoslav crisis be solved with its  participation. There are historical, cultural, and other  connections between Serbia and Russia, so even Russia is obliged  to protect Serbian interests, at least to the extent to which  the West and Islamic countries have been protecting the Croats  and the Muslims. Apart from that, if Russia allows the Balkan  crisis to be solved without its participation, it will give up  its historic idea that Russia is and should be a big power,  which started with Petar the Great and has lasted until the  present day.    [Reljic] Apart from this emotional aspect and the opposition  to the United States, does Russia have a concrete interest here?    [Radinovic] A minimum interest, which is the maximum needed  in the present situation. I think that Russian interests are  legitimate.    [Reljic] Why does it seem now that Karadzic is insisting  on the plan made by the European Union? Is this only tactics or  is this map also what the Serbs want?    [Radinovic] There are both elements in his behavior. I  think it is politically wise and strategically favorable to find  "cracks" in the clash of interests of superpowers. The European  Union is trying to establish its strategic identity in  Yugoslavia, but this seems to be a very difficult task. It is  not homogeneous itself. It is dominated by Germany. Its  strategic interest is to get access to the Adriatic and put  Central Europe under control, which it seems to have achieved by  the secession of Croatia and Slovenia, but I think this is only  one of the German illusions. I wrote for a German newspaper  that the present Croatia is rather a burden for Germany than a  partner that could contribute to the materialization of German  interests. It would be more productive for Germany if it tried  to articulate its interests in the Balkans by reestablishing its  relations with Serbia as the most powerful factor in the Balkans  and a link with Asia.    [Reljic] This sounds logical, but why has no one entered an  alliance with Serbia yet?    [Radinovic] Out of political prejudices, I think. Serbia's  politics have been declared imperial because Serbia allegedly  wants to create a Greater Serbia. Even if all the Serbian  countries were united, this would not be a large state that  could inspire fear in someone. There is no imperial behavior in  the Serbian tradition. The achievement of the Serbian national  interest is even inhibited by the fact that there is no imperial  consciousness in Serbs. I think the European Union has realized  this now and that Serbia will be respected in future.    [Reljic] At the beginning of 1993, you worked on the  elaboration of the Geneva maps. What has changed in Bosnia  since that time?    [Radinovic] These were great moments for the Yugoslav  delegation and the delegation of the republic of Srpska, who  tried to achieve national and political independence for the  Serbian nation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. All  international powers, on the other hand, tried to prevent this  by splitting the ethnic Serbian territory into unconnected  enclaves. There were very many controversial points: the right  Una River bank, Posavina, northeast Herzegovina, Podrinje,  Kupres, the Dubrovnik hinterland.... Unfortunately, these areas  are still stumbling blocks in the partition issue. As far as  intentions are concerned, very little has changed, but as far as  facts are concerned, very much has changed. First of all, all  these games and calculations have been eliminated because of the  Serbian victory. The keys are: the military success, a  consistent policy made by the republic of Srpska, and a fervent  support from Serbia.    [Reljic] Does this mean the situation is more favorable now  than at the beginning of 1993?    [Radinovic] Yes, I think it is.    [Reljic] How big is the danger that everything is returned  to a more difficult position by an inconsiderate action?    [Radinovic] There is the risk of returning everything to the  beginning. International powers are trying everything but, in  the end, they will have to accept the real situation -- first of  all, because this situation shows what has always belonged to  the ethnic Serbian territory.    [Reljic] This can be criticized since some of the towns were  not predominantly Serbian before the war, such as Brcko,  Zvornik....    [Radinovic] One thing has to be clear. A state cannot exist  if certain conditions are not met, and one of them is the  territorial connection between areas populated by a Serbian  majority. It is certain that injustice will be done to some  areas in the final partition, but this can be balanced by an  exchange of territories.    [Reljic] How would you assess the strategic stability of  newly established states in the former Yugoslavia: Croatia, the  republic of Srpska, the republic of Serbian Krajina, and the  still undefined Muslim territory?    [Radinovic] The strategic position of Croatia was very  unfavorable before the war, too. This is a very elongated  state; if we measured it, it would be more than 1,000 km long.  Its depth does not exceed 10 km in places. Such states can  hardly survive even if they had very amicable neighbors. The  republic of Serbian Krajina is elongated and thus unfavorable,  too. If you bear in mind though that Baranja, eastern  Slavonija, and western Srem are adjacent to Serbia, the  territory looks much better.    [Reljic] What about the republic of Srpska with its  "Maslenica" at Brcko?    [Radinovic] This is the weakest strategic point the republic  of Srpska has. This even more, since the newly established  federation -- which I think can hardly survive -- threatens to  cut the republic of Srpska into two parts.    [Reljic] Is the Muslim-Croatian federation a good solution  from a strategical point of view?    [Radinovic] Several interests overlapped here. First of  all, Croatia had to be saved from sanctions because of its  direct involvement in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Apart from  that, Croatian military defeats in Central Bosnia had to be  covered up. Everyone knows that regular Croatian units occupied  a part of the republic of Srpska between Trebinje and Dubrovnik,  that they are situated in central Bosnia and in western  Herzegovina. Apart from that, the anti-Serbian coalition had to  be strengthened. This was partially accomplished. Besides, the  establishment of a pure Muslim state in Bosnia-Herzegovina had  to be prevented. The completely wrong Croatian policy toward  Bosnia-Herzegovina had to be improved. The weakest point in the  Croatian political strategy is that it agreed to partition  Bosnia-Herzegovina, because they practically gave up their old  dream -- from Starcevic [19th century Croatian intellectual]  through Pavelic [fascist leader of World War II Independent  State of Croatia] to [Croatian President] Tudjman -- that  Croatia should reach the Drina and the Danube. The creation of  the Croatian-Muslim federation has a political and strategic  function because it will give Croatia the necessary depth of the  territory.    [Reljic] Why did the Muslims accept this link with Croatia?    [Radinovic] The United States exerted pressure on the  Muslims. The federation is not favorable for the Muslims, since  they had almost won the war in Central Bosnia before they  entered the federation. I think it is a mistake that they  agreed to it. I do not expect that this federation will hold  for a long time, especially not the confederation between this  federation and Croatia. I think this is favorable for Serbia,  because our right to establish an independent Serbian state in  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and its merger with other Serbian  countries will become legitimate in this way.    [Reljic] Can Croatia correct the border through the use of  force, even though several of its military actions against the  republic of Srpska were futile?    [Radinovic] Croatia is not able to correct the borders with  military means. Their constant threats are used only to make an  impression on the domestic political scene. Even the most  superficial analysis can prove they are not able to do it. It  is only 6 km from the foremost Serbian positions to the Slovene  border, toward Metlika. In certain places along the  communication line between Karlovac and the Rijeka front,  Serbian positions lie only two km from the road. The road can  be hit even from 60-caliber mortars. This means that in case of  a military escalation, the Serbs can eliminate the  Karlovac-Rijeka communication line very quickly. Apart from  that, the distance between the foremost Serbian positions and  the seaside lies between 6 and 10 km, which is within the range  of all usual weapons.    In other words, the Serbs can place all Dalmatian towns,  including Split, under artillery fire. Split has not been  attacked so far because it was estimated that this should not be  done. Let me summarize: We can attack Split, Sibenik, Zadar,  Karlovac, the oil industry in Sisak, Zagreb, Vinkovci, Slavonski  Brod, Osijek.... The most dangerous thing for them is that the  Serbs have weapons that enable them to destroy Zagreb and the  whole infrastructure in the area of the Croatian capital. The  republic of Serbian Krajina has powerful weapons for the  so-called revenge strategy, which can carry out very successful  operations and strikes against those facilities and targets the  destruction of which Croatia cannot allow. This is an insoluble  problem for them.    [Reljic] Such a state is the factor of permanent instability  in the whole region.    [Radinovic] Croatia is in this sense the source of permanent  instability. This is their problem, however. The only  possibility is to solve the question of Croat-Serbian relations  to the satisfaction of both so that Croats cease to consider  Serbs a disturbing factor within their state and in the Balkans  in general.    [Reljic] It is evident that the creation of small states  results in uncontrollable conditions, under which wars can break  out at any moment, because "a drunkard can go from one border to  the next" -- at Maslenica, for example.    [Radinovic] I think it was the interest of international  powers to create satellite states in the territory of the former  Yugoslavia. I do not think that anything can be changed now.  The only state that can exist is the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia.    [Reljic] Yugoslavia has Kosovo, however!    [Radinovic] I am not emotional, although emotions cannot be  excluded when speaking about Kosovo. Kosovo is the historical  center of the Serbian state. It is not the center of the  Serbian state any longer, because the center moved northwards.  All political parties and politicians have to treat Kosovo as  an integral part of Serbia if they want to have any kind of  support by the people. I do not want to say that Kosovo is not  a Serbian problem; it is one of the points at which the  political stability can be seriously affected. I would say that  Kosovo is one of the points at which the independence of our  state can be attacked by weapons.    [Reljic] What do you think about the comparison between the  republic of Serbian Krajina and Kosovo?    [Radinovic] These are two completely different matters.  Kosovo has always been an integral part of the Serbian state,  and Krajina was not an integral part of Croatia until the first  Yugoslav state was established.    [Reljic] You are speaking about historical rights, but when  national states come into existence, there is the right of the  stronger over the weaker in a certain territory.    [Radinovic] Kosovo cannot be regarded as an isolated entity.  Serbia is stronger than Kosovo Albanians. Kosovo is Serbian  territory. It is out of the question that Kosovo is a part of  Serbia. I am convinced that no one even thinks of leading such  conversations.    [Reljic] What do you think about "Partnership for Peace?"  The countries around Serbia have already applied for membership  in that alliance. Russia will also apply for it.    [Radinovic] Even if we wanted to apply, we would not be  accepted now, but I do not think we should enter this alliance.    [Reljic] Not even after Russia?    [Radinovic] Not even after Russia.    [Reljic] Should we be against the world again?    [Radinovic] There is no reason for the Serbs to take to the  market everything they succeeded in retaining though their  history -- true self-confidence. This does not mean that we  should remain isolated. Isolation, which I fervently oppose, is  one thing and servility is another. "Partnership for Peace" is  actually a cheap phrase -- a more elaborate concept for the  transfer of the sovereignty of single states to international  powers. This is practically silent occupation.    [Reljic] Do you think that Russia has not realized this?    [Radinovic] This is another name for a new world order under  U.S. domination. We should look for allies among nations that  are spiritually close to us. It is clear who they are.    [Reljic] Who?    [Radinovic] Primarily Greece, Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine,  Romania.    [Reljic] Greece is a NATO member, though. Why do you think  it would not betray us if it needed it?    [Radinovic] I do not agree with it. Greeks would never  betray us, but they can never defend us to the extent they would  like to because they must not forget their interests. I refuse  this theory.    [Reljic] They have had their interests in mind all the time,  and Serbia served them more or less only as a good argument.  Russia, too.    [Radinovic] Every state cares for its own interests; Greece  and Russia, but also Serbia and Yugoslavia, because interests  are eternal and all other things are transitory. It has been  proven, however, that there are real values -- ethic, spiritual  and civilization closeness. They are relevant even in political  alliances. I support the theory that contacts should be sought  with those states and nations that want us.</p>

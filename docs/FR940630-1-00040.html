			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1143&blank;Engine Controls <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.1143(f) requires that if a power or thrust control incorporates a fuel shutoff feature, the control must have a means to prevent the inadvertent movement of the control into the shutoff position. Paragraph (f) would be revised to add that a fuel control (other than a mixture control) must also have such a means. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1153&blank;Propeller Feathering Controls <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.1153 requires that if there are propeller feathering controls, each propeller must have a separate control, and each control must have a means to prevent inadvertent operation. This section would be revised because it does not matter whether the feathering controls are separate from the propeller speed and pitch controls as long as it is possible to feather each propeller separately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1181&blank;Designated Fire Zones; Regions Included <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.1181, which was added in Amendment 23&hyph;43, defines designated fire zones for reciprocating engines and turbine engines. Proposed new &sect;23.1181(b)(3) would add to the designated fire zones for turbine engines any complete powerplant compartments that do not have firewalls between compressor, accessory, combustor, turbine and tailpipe sections. The proposal would codify current certification practice and increase safety by ensuring that all appropriate regions of turbine engines are evaluated as designated fire zones. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1183&blank;Lines, Fittings, and Components <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.1183(a) includes the requirement that flexible hose assemblies must be approved. This requirement in paragraph (a) would be revised by replacing the word ``approved'' with the words ``shown to be suitable for the particular application.'' The revision clarifies what is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1191&blank;Firewalls <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.1191(a) requires that each engine, auxiliary power unit, fuel-burning heater, and other combustion equipment intended for operation in flight must be isolated ``by fire walls, shrouds, or equivalent means.'' Paragraph (b) of the section requires that each firewall or shroud must be constructed so that no hazardous quantity of liquid, gas, or flame can pass from the engine compartment to other parts of the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) would be revised to define isolated compartment and to show that the provisions of paragraph (b) would also apply to APU's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1203&blank;Fire Detector System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.1203(e) requires that wiring and other components of each fire detector system in an engine compartment must be at least fire resistant. For accuracy, proposed &sect;23.1203(e) would replace the words ``engine compartment'' with ``designated fire zone'' to correct an oversight in the amendment and to make it consistent with &sect;23.1181. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1305&blank;Powerplant Instruments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;23.1305(b)(3), as amended in Amendment 23&hyph;43, requires, for reciprocating engine-powered airplanes, a cylinder head temperature indicator for each air-cooled engine with cowl flaps; each airplane for which compliance with &sect;23.1041 is shown at a speed higher than V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; and each commuter category airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision to paragraph (b)(3) would delete paragraph (b)(3)(ii), which refers to compliance with &sect;23.1041. The flight notice referenced above contains a proposal to delete the determination of the V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  speed and this notice proposes a change that the engine cooling test of &sect;23.1047 be conducted at a speed recommended in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). Accordingly, other sections referencing the V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  speed or the engine cooling test would also be amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision would retain the requirement that a cylinder head temperature indicator is required for commuter category airplanes having reciprocating engines and for airplanes having air-cooled engines and cowl flaps. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1337&blank;Powerplant Instruments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the area of ``Installation,'' the reference in &sect;23.1337(b)(1) to &sect;23.959 would be changed to &sect;23.959(a), in accordance with the revision to &sect;23.959 proposed in this notice. The revision would redesignate the existing &sect;23.959 text as &sect;23.959(a); there is no change in the requirement itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

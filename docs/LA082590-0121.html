			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAINOUTS FORCE TV TO CHANGE BROADCAST PLAN  </P> <P> The rainouts that have delayed the Little League championship game until Sunday  wiped out plans to televise the entire game.  </P> <P> ESPN will have one-hour taped coverage of the title game, after the telecast of  the final round of the U.S. Amateur golf championship from Denver.  </P> <P> The golf coverage is scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m. (PDT).  </P> <P> "If it ends earlier, we'll show the Little League game earlier," a spokesman  for ESPN said. "But only one hour of the Little League will be shown."  </P> <P> Originally, the championship game was to have been televised today on ABC, but  because the game was postponed, the network instead will show portions of the  U.S. and international finals, the tournament's semifinals, on a tape-delayed  basis at 4 p.m. (PDT).  </P></p>

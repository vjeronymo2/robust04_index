			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Escort re-launched after only two years FORD will today unveil heavily-revised versions of its Escort/Orion car range just two years after the previous generation was launched at a cost of Pounds 1bn. The exercise, which Ford acknowledged yesterday involved further 'substantial' investment, follows sharp criticism - mainly in the UK - of the styling and other aspects of the cars at their orig-inal launch in October 1990. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said: 'We listened to what was being said about the last versions of the cars, married these comments with our own on-going (development) programme and introduced changes.' Ford insisted that the most extensive - and expensive - changes involved re-engineering to improve crash protection and other beneath-the-skin specifications.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Property: Digging in the groves of academe - Gerald Cadogan revisits the perennial problem of affordable student lodgings BUYING a house for a university student son or daughter once seemed a good idea: student got three years' accommodation, parents got cash from lettings during holidays - and made a handsome profit at the end of their offspring's stay. That was the theory. Now alarm bells are starting to ring. 'Our financial planning did not work,' say Miranda's parents. They bought her a flat in Edinburgh, which seemed a good idea for several reasons. In the event it brought nothing but trouble and a negligible capital gain. Julia's parents bought her a terrace house in Oxford to live in while she was up at the university, but problems with mortgage interest relief and insurance mushroomed when she came down. Rebecca, another Oxford student, says: 'Be as specific as you can when you make the contracts with the others (sharing the house), and do not let friends be brought in who do not contribute.' Ever since the property boom of the late 1980s, students and parents have found buying a flat or house a mutually appealing idea. The young get a base of their own and are freed from dreary halls of residence or ruthless landlords. 'Digs' are often simply too expensive. (It is a long time since I, when an Oxford undergraduate, had two rooms and a cooked breakfast, within walking distance of my college, for Pounds 3 a week; the Oxbridge college of today is furiously building accommodation with the aim of housing all its students.) If you buy a house or flat for your child, the fellow students he or she selects will contribute to the outgoings and mortgage, almost certainly paying less than to a conventional landlord. Rebecca's housemates pay Pounds 125 a month for rent before the outgoings on utilities: a good price, but much dearer than living in college. After Miranda's first year in a 'grotty flat' in Edinburgh, her parents were posted abroad and decided to let the family home. She needed somewhere better as her base in Britain. A long rental in Edinburgh was impossible; buying was the alternative. Her parents paid a third more than they expected, but set against it the prospect of selling while they were abroad and, as non-residents, escaping capital gains tax. They think now that they are lucky to have sold it at all - at a price which has produced only a small gain. But unexpectedly, they came home a tax year early. so they may be deemed resident for the time of sale - and taxable. And as for all that cocktail party chat about money from letting for the Edinburgh Festival, it turned out to be a mirage, as agents wanted a huge commission. Finally, it was hard to get the flatmates to pay their share of the bills or keep the place clean. Julia's complications at Oxford were different. Her parents gifted the house to her as a long-term transfer of assets and an investment to pay for itself. She became the owner-occupier, responsible for the mortgage and receiving the mortgage tax relief (MIRAS), with her housemates' payments going towards the mortgage. But when she left Oxford, they were no longer housemates. It became a commercial let, with different rules, and she another university landlady. The trouble started with the insurance policy, which was solely for people living in their own house: if there was a fire or burglary and she was not living in the premises, the insurance company might not pay up. With Julia gone, expensive business tariffs applied. Then the building society put the mortgage up by 2 per cent and, as a matter of course, told the tax man she lived elsewhere. So her MIRAS disappeared. Rebecca recommends specifying in writing at the start what rights the housemates have to introduce boy or girl friends, for how long, and on what terms. Other people's lovers are nothing but trouble, Rebecca has discovered, one night's stay often turns into a week - or even a term. She does not, however, have trouble with the utility bills. 'I wait till the red one comes, and then pay up, and collect from the others. Itemised telephone bills are a great help.' Her father bought the house in her second year when she was still in college, and let it through Carter Jonas (0865-511444) to a New Zealand couple for nine months until she came in. She will be there for two years; more, if she stays on for post-graduate work. Then there will be a gap while he lets it again until - the family hopes - Rebecca's younger sister can use it. Her father sees the house as an investment and will sell it in five or six years. Julia's father says: 'It is not so simple as it looks.' Even if finding the cash is not a problem, think carefully before you put your money where your child is. Siren calls of what a good investment it will have been in five years' time should be the last consideration.</p>

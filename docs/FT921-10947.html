			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Letter: Why are there no carriers providing flights into Orly? Sir, In your story 'Air France to halt flights from Stansted' (January 29) you report that Paris-bound passengers on Air France will no longer be able to fly from Stansted and will have to restrict their choice to just two of London's airports. What you do not mention is that in Paris there is only one possible airport for flights to and from London - Charles de Gaulle at Roissy. There are six carriers - Air France, Air UK, British Airways, British Midland, Brymon and Danair - with scheduled daily flights between London and Paris. In London, passengers may select from four airports - Gatwick, Heathrow, London City and Stansted - depending on time of travel, geographical convenience and/or onward connections. In Paris, there is no choice. When are we going to be able to use Orly again? For passengers from London with rendezvous to the south of Paris or with connections to other French towns (many Air Inter flights to provincial destinations use Orly exclusively) it is frustrating and time-costly to have to use Roissy. Surely at least one of the six carriers could offer a service into Orly from at least one London airport. Michael W Poynor, 63 Lant Street, London SE1 1QN</p>

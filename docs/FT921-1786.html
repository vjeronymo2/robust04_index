			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / More UN peacekeepers arrive in Yugoslavia MORE United Nations peacekeepers arrived at the weekend to take up positions in war-torn regions of Croatia amid renewed fighting between Serbs and Croats. Croatian and Serbian news media reported fighting in eastern and central Croatia and Dubrovnik, the Adriatic port. Each side accused the other of violating the ceasefire brokered by the UN on January 3. UN officials said the pace of deployment was expected to pick up over the next week, and a force of about 14,000 peacekeepers would be in place by April 25. Some 29 police officers from Argentina arrived on Saturday in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital. A force of 29 Swedes and 29 Danes was yesterday expected to join some 500 peacekeepers already despatched to three UN Protected Areas in Croatia. Meanwhile officials from the Yugoslav and Croat armies after two days of talks brokered by the International Red Cross in Pecs, southern Hungary, agreed at the weekend on a full exchange of prisoners of war, according to Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Minister of Government German Quiroga,  coca growers are using the industrialization of the coca leaf as  a pretext for freely marketing this product, in many cases with  illegal purposes.    The coca growers reject the [industrialization] decree  because it not only restricts the industrialization of coca leaf  in traditional zones -- that is, in Yungas in La Paz -- but also  because Article No. 2 states ambiguously that coca leaf is  penalized in Bolivia.    Minister Quiroga asserts that the article is not ambiguous.    [Begin Quiroga recording] Coca leaf is penalized by Law No.  1008. [end recording]    According to Law No. 1008 the production of coca leaf is  penalized. According to Article No. 8 of this law, there are  three regions: The Yungas zone in La Paz is the traditional  production zone; the Chapare zone in Cochabamba is the  transition surplus production zone; and the illegal production  zone entails the whole of Bolivian territory with the exception  of the two aforementioned zones.    [Begin Quiroga recording] There are coca growers who want to  be completely free to transport it from one place to another, to  transfer it under the pretext of industrializing it. I told the  coca growers that if we are successful with the regulation for  industrialization in the Yungas zone, and if we run short of raw  materials, then we would take the next step, and immediately  authorize its industrialization in Chapare. But they do not  accept this, they want everything. [end recording]    The coca growers have announced pressure measures if the  government does not modify the decree after the COB [Bolivian  Labor Federation] congress.    The government has asserted that there is nothing to modify,  as this legal tool is the result of consensus and coinciding  points of view.</p>

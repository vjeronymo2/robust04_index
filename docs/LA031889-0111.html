			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART MAGAZINE TO TRACK TRENDS ON PACIFIC RIM  </P> <P> Reflecting a significant interest in art trends in the Pacific Rim, Artcoast, a  new contemporary art magazine was launched this month.  </P> <P> The magazine hit the stands on Monday and publisher Bob Crothers is already  worried about running out of stock.  </P> <P> "I can't believe it. Copies are flying off the shelves and we've had to  reorder," Crothers said.  </P> <P> Crothers attributed the success to curiosity over what Artcoast is all about.  </P> <P> "The whole idea behind our coverage is to start in Los Angeles and then look  around us -- to Japan, Australia and other Pacific Rim countries," Aaron  Betsky, managing editor, said.  </P> <P> "Artcoast recognizes the need for diversity and contradiction," said Charles  Scheips, associate publisher of the bi-monthly magazine. (In January, 1990, it  is scheduled to begin monthly publication.)  </P> <P> "We also recognize that California is the center of changing boundaries  affecting the art world," he added. "We are not a regional magazine and not  about Los Angeles art. We want to expose ideas and trends in a nonconventional  manner."  </P> <P> Editor Kay Larson, longtime art writer for New York magazine, said in the new  magazine's opening statement: "The articles and reviews will emphasize visual  culture and also be concerned with traditional aesthetics of European and  American art, broadly defined through paintings, sculptures, performance,  street art, photography, books and any other kind of creative works that seem  appealing. "In short, anything goes -- if it's good enough," said Larson.  </P> <P> The magazine will feature museum and gallery reviews from Los Angeles, San  Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Hawaii, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand and  other countries in the Pacific Rim. It will also focus on commentaries,  articles and interviews with artists, critics and other influential members of  the art community.  </P> <P> "We won't be reviewing exhibitions in New York and Europe, but if there is an  important art trend in those areas, we'll cover it," said Betsky.  </P> <P> The cover story of Artcoast's first issue profiles Japanese-American artist  Masami Teraoka. Other articles include an interview with David Hockney about  the relationship between quantum physics and visual arts, a commentary on Frank  Gehry's winning proposal for the $65-million Walt Disney Concert Hall and an  article by artist Robert Morris on the first international museum exhibition of  Australian aboriginal art.  </P> <P> The second issue will focus on the state of art in California, Crothers said.  </P> <P> The philosophy behind Artcoast's coverage is not the only aspect setting it  apart from other similar publications. One look at the March cover makes  Artcoast stand out.  </P> <P> Designed by graphic designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, who redesigned The  Times' typography in 1981, Artcoast reverses the traditional 8 1/2-inch-wide by  11-inch-deep magazine measurements. This publication is 11 inches wide and 8  3/8 inches deep.  </P> <P> Besides accommodating the many new properties of magazine technology, the wider  design can symbolize the geographical view Californians have, Levrant de  Bretteville said, adding, "Californians can look out and across mountains and  oceans and to the Pacific Rim."  </P></p>

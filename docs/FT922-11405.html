			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Crafted by design I HAVE always suspected that many people nurture a lingering affection for things one-off, individual and quirky, but I have had no proof until now. Elsewhere on the page, I report how Robert Jenkins of the Blazer chain was fascinated to discover that some 26 per cent of the population had bought a craft item in the past year, and the same number had visited at least one exhibition. I am not a bit surprised. Whenever I go to them, I am always bowled over at the skills, the enterprise, the sheer creative talent on view. I am also nearly always amazed at the prices - how little each craftsman must be earning per working hour. Very often, what they do is grossly underpriced - women, in particular, often do not cost their time properly, and men and women alike are often afraid of losing a customer for fear of costing realistically. Not everything at craft fairs is wonderful and not everything will be to your taste. But at the best of the fairs, I guarantee that anybody who has never made the effort to go will be delighted by much of what they see. One of the best of them - Creative Eye  - is on at Chelsea Old Town Hall, King's Road, London SW3. There are about 100 exhibitors ranging from toymakers to jewellers, textile designers, glassblowers and ceramicists. Everybody there has been through the needle's eye test of scrutiny by the Crafts Council, so standards are guaranteed to be high. Although almost every kind of craft is there, this year seems to have encouraged a special emphasis on clocks and time-pieces. Marianne Forrest's wall clock (photographed here) - a marvellous piece, half useful, half sculptural - is just one of the many pieces. She also has a silver pocket watch, La Poche, darkened by oxidation, with bright gold detailing and inlay. Two jewellers, Kim Ellwood and Mike Abbott have combined to produce some hand-made, steel wall clocks which start at Pounds 40, Desmond Ryan has done some in wood while Louise Slater uses plastic laminates. The exhibition is on view, April 30-May 4, at Chelsea Old Town Hall, between 10am and 6pm. The Pounds 5 entry fee includes a colour catalogue.</p>

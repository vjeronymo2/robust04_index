The VJESNIK newspaper, controlled by the government, said  the  assassination of Yusuf Prazina was carried out by five members  of a commando unit called "Delta" and headed by Ismet Bajramovic  also known as Celo.    The paper said that three members of the Syrian-backed  Palestinian movement Saika [al-Sa'iqah] had Prazina under  surveillance for three weeks before one of them, acting as an  arms dealer, lured him into a trap in a car park along the main  highway between Liege in eastern Belgium and the German border  town of Aachen.    Prazina, 30, nicknamed Yuka, was missing early last month.  He was found Saturday with two bullet holes in the head.    "The necessary logistical means to carry out the operation  were provided by Bakir Izetbegovic, son of Alija Izetbegovic,  who left Sarajevo more than six months ago," VJESNIK said.    It added that Bakir Izetbegovic "often travels between  Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Baghdad, Tehran and Ankara, by using  Iraqi and Pakistani passports" and was in Belgium at the time of  the assassination.    Hasan Cengic, head of logistics for the army in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, was "personally involved in the  assassination of Yuka Prazina," the paper said.    "The day after the murder, those responsible fled via  Brussels and Paris to Cairo and then Khartoum. Bakir  Izetbegovic went to Baghdad and Hasan Cengic, according to  reliable information, went to Islamabad by using a fake  Pakistani passport," VJESNIK said.    Prazina, who had fought in Sarajevo and later in Mostar,  settled in Liege last August. He once headed Moslem troops on  Mount Igman overlooking Sarajevo and was praised for his defence  of the city in 1992.    But he later fell out with the Bosnian high command, was  termed a traitor and fled in the spring of 1993 to Herzegovina  where he joined rival HVO Bosnian Croat forces.</p>

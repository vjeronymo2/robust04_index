			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> CANYONS FINDS NEW LIFE WITH HART TRANSPLANT  </P> <P> It took all of seven games for the College of the Canyons women's basketball  team to exceed its win total from the past two seasons.  </P> <P> Canyons (7-1), the Baltimore Orioles of women's basketball, has won seven games  in a row, a marked improvement over the previous two seasons when it totaled  only five wins.  </P> <P> Two seasons ago, Canyons forfeited the last 10 games after the squad dropped to  four players.  </P> <P> Coach Jeff Dunlap took over last season and struggled to a 4-19 record with  only seven players, but this year he has a squad large enough to actually  scrimmage.  </P> <P> "It's a totally different look out there," said Dunlap, who attributes the  turnaround to "a lot of luck and a lot of hard work. We had a nice selection of  local players, which is fortunate."  </P> <P> Dunlap's players had heart, but what they really needed was Hart, specifically,  players from Hart High's Southern Section Division 4-A championship team.  </P> <P> Three former Hart players -- DeeDee Hinson, Kim Posey and Dominique Ice -- are  key contributors.  </P> <P> Sophomore Tressie Millender, the third-leading scorer in the state last season,  returned at forward and freshman point guard Keira Irwin of Simi Valley High  has been "the last piece of the puzzle."  </P> <P> With only two sophomores on the roster, Canyons will have to mature quickly  before beginning its Western State Conference schedule in early January.  </P> <P> "Right now, it's a pride factor," Dunlap said. "That's the goal. We want to  prove College of the Canyons basketball is for real."  </P> <P> Dublin their pleasure: Two former Valley-area high school football players will  be on opposing sides far from home today when Pittsburgh meets Rutgers in the  second Emerald Isle Classic football game.  </P> <P> Doug Kavulich, a redshirt freshman from Chaminade High, may see action for  Rutgers as a reserve offensive guard. Brian Greenfield, a junior from Notre  Dame High and Glendale College, is Pitt's punter.  </P> <P> Honor roll: Keira Middleton and Kathleen Dixon of Cal State Northridge have  been selected to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II  All-Southwest Region volleyball team.  </P> <P> Middleton is a senior outside hitter. Dixon is a junior middle blocker.  </P> <P> Staff writers Mike Hiserman and Brendan Healey contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Joint Military Exercises Will </F> Nonetheless Go Ahead. Only Not in Russia, But in the United  States"]    [Text] The joint Russian-U.S. military exercises that were  scheduled to be held in our country at Totskiy but were  ultimately canceled for political reasons will nonetheless go  ahead. But in the United States.    The proposal to hold the peacemaking forces' maneuvers  abroad  -- "in view of the domestic political situation in Russia" --  was made by Senator Sam Nunn, the influential chairman of the  Armed Services Committee, at a meeting with his Russian  colleagues in Moscow. His colleagues were enthusiastic about  the idea. It is now up to the executive branches -- in Russia  and the United States. Immediately on his return to Washington  Nunn will discuss his proposal with President Clinton and  Defense Secretary Perry. According to the senator, Americans  will "give the Russian troops a good reception on their  territory."    Admittedly, Russia will lose the $2 million that the United  States would have paid us had the maneuvers been held at  Totskiy. That would have been payment for the use of our  military installations, infrastructure, etc. We will hardly be  given any money if we send our servicemen to the United States.  What is more we will evidently have to ask the Americans to  fund the trip, which will undoubtedly be a costly one.    It is quite possible that if the maneuvers go well in the  United States and our soldiers do in actual fact receive a  cordial reception as if the Cold War had never taken place, the  guarded suspicion which frustrated the plans to hold the  exercises in Totskiy will ease and the next maneuvers will be  held in Russia.</p>

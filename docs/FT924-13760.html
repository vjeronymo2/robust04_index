			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Health food group fined Pounds 1,000 over 'IQ' pills LARKHALL Natural Health, a health food company, was fined Pounds 1,000 and ordered to pay Pounds 35,000 prosecution costs yesterday over claims that its vitamin pills could improve the intelligence of children. In a case brought by Shropshire trading standards officers, it was found guilty of three charges of making false claims on packaging and literature about Tandem IQ. Mr Harry Hatchard, Shrewsbury stipendiary magistrate, said he did not regard the marketing of the product as a deliberate hoax. He believed Dr Robert Woodward, Larkhall chairman, genuinely thought the pills could enhance the intelligence of children. The company's offence was in not taking sufficient care in limiting claims. The prosecution had alleged that labelling on the vitamin pill packets conveyed the impression that the product could increase the IQ of the vast majority of children. There was no indication that only some children would benefit, said the prosecution, which accepted that the claim could be true for a minority who had a poor diet. Mr Robin Spencer, for the trading standards department, said the letters 'IQ' on the front of the packaging were intended to convey 'intelligence quotient'. He said the company had tried to disguise that inference by stating on the back of the packets that IQ meant 'ideal quota'. The magistrate said he was satisfied there was reliable evidence that only children with a dietary deficiency were likely to benefit from vitamin and mineral supplements. He was also satisfied that a significant number of potential customers could be misled into thinking that the tablets were capable of a general and widespread effect in increasing the IQ of children.</p>

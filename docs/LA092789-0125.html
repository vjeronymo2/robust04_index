			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INTENSIVE CARE;  </P> <P> UNITED WESTERN MEDICAL CENTERS ON MEND AFTER DOSE OF COST-CUTTING  </P> <P> A United Western Medical Centers vice president was driving his BMW company car  into the parking lot of the organization's Santa Ana corporate headquarters  last December when he heard something that caused him to veer into a concrete  bumper.  </P> <P> He had been informed by one of the company's newly appointed administrators,  who was sitting next to him, that the fleet of 15 fancy company cars assigned  to hospital brass was about to be eliminated.  </P> <P> "He said, 'That's a great idea.' But his actions betrayed his real feelings,' "  recalled Charles S. Mack Jr., who had just become the hospital organization's  chief operating officer when he advised the executive of the new cost-cutting  policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recruited by Directors  </P> <P> Doing away with company cars was symbolic of many more far-ranging changes that  Mack and his partner, Douglas L. Drumwright, have initiated at United Western  since Dec. 6 when they took over the financially faltering operations of the  nonprofit organization.  </P> <P> Mack and Drumwright were recruited by United Western's board of directors to  replace Wayne Schroeder, who resigned after serving as president of United  Western for 21 years.  </P> <P> United Western directors said in recent interviews that late last year they  realized an immediate change in management was necessary to avert financial  disaster. Schroeder, they said, was an "optimist" and a "visionary" who had  been spending large sums of money on initiating new medical and advertising  programs at a time when the organization instead desperately needed to  retrench.  </P> <P> Schroeder, who runs a consulting business out of his home in Santa Ana, refuses  to directly address criticisms of his performance at United Western. He says  only that he is proud of his record. "At the time I left," he contends, "the  hospitals had a bright future."  </P> <P> Not so, said company officials. For the fiscal year ended March 31, the  hospital lost $30 million to $35 million and was on the brink of bankruptcy,  they said.  </P> <P> But the losses have slowed -- the company made a slight profit in July and  August -- and company officials say it will be in the black by the end of the  year.  </P> <P> The heroes of the turnaround are Mack and Drumwright, United Western's chief  executive officer. In just 10 months they have nursed United Western -- which  runs a 327-bed hospital in Santa Ana and a 248-bed hospital and 241-bed  skilled-nursing facility in Anaheim -- back to financial health.  </P> <P> "Things were pretty dismal when they got there and the turnaround has been  nothing short of phenomenal," said United Western director Thomas C. Hill.  </P> <P> And partly on the strength of United Western's recovery, Mack and Drumwright  recently got a contract to take over the administration of Care Enterprises  Inc., a Tustin nursing home chain, as it struggles to reorganize and emerge  from bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Like hospitals nationwide, United Western's have had their profit margins  squeezed by the cost-containment requirements of government and private medical  insurers. Last year 53% of California hospitals lost money, according to the  California Assn. of Hospitals.  </P> <P> At United Western the financial bleeding was a massive hemorrhage. "In December  and January bankruptcy was a real option and we told the employees that. We  think honesty is the best policy," said Drumwright.  </P> <P> During its last fiscal year, the organization suffered a huge loss. Drumwright  said the company had an operating loss of $20 million and another $10 million  from writedowns of hospital assets and of a bond refinancing for the Anaheim  hospital.  </P> <P> The financial deterioration did not happen overnight. Hill, who is an  accountant and member of United Western's finance committee, said the  organization would have posted a $4-million loss in fiscal 1988 had it not  overestimated the amount of receipts the hospital would receive from Medi-Cal  and Medicare. Instead, it posted net income of $600,000.  </P> <P> Until they came to United Western, Drumwright and Mack had no experience in  running a hospital. But they had other business experience that they thought  would apply. In their resumes, Drumwright said he prepared a turnaround plan  for Castle &amp; Cook, the giant Los Angeles-based international food company,  and Mack cited his stint as chief financial officer of a health-care company  during its transition from losing money to profitability.  </P> <P> Drumwright, 44, and Mack, 38, recall with humor that their first joint business  in 1983, a "doc-in-the-box" business in Northern California, was a flop. "It  was our first start-up and liquidation in the first year," Mack said.  </P> <P> But through it all, they contend, they have learned a lot about managing  troubled companies. A year ago they teamed up and formed Alpha Partners to work  with start-up and failing businesses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Financial Officer  </P> <P> Drumwright and Mack took the helm of United Western and abruptly changed its  course, the company's directors said. They hired a new chief financial officer  and restructured the organization's finance department.  </P> <P> Also, they changed management at all three facilities. And throughout the  organization they laid off about 300 people -- mostly management, professional  and clerical staff -- got agreements to delay payments to vendors, dropped a  money-losing Medi-Cal contract and generally quashed the previous management's  exuberant spending.  </P> <P> A monument to the spendthrift tendency of the former management, hospital  officials say, are the elaborate corporate offices, redecorated at great  expense several years ago in a modern gray and mauve motif.  </P> <P> Dr. Joseph Woo, chief of staff at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, credited  Schroeder, whom he described as "a charismatic dynamo," for greatly improving  the stature of United Western over the years. He praised Schroeder for helping  to establish the Santa Ana hospital's trauma and renal transplant programs.  "These are the things that put Western Medical on the map in Orange County,"  Woo said.  </P> <P> But he said that in the last year Schroeder had launched numerous costly new  projects, frequently with little support from the medical staff. These  programs, including plans for a 24-hour cancer center and high-tech "gamma  knife" radiation therapy to treat brain tumors, were intended to boost United  Western's image and future revenues.  </P> <P> "We were just spending too much money too fast," said United Western Chairman  Marven Howard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bankers 'Horrified'  </P> <P> Drumwright said banks that lend money to United Western were surprised by the  size of projected losses and "horrified" when the new management team talked  about scrapping some projects that Schroeder had touted. "Wayne was pumping  sunshine and his projections to the banks reflected that optimism," Drumwright  said.  </P> <P> The past management, Drumwright said, too often had fallen short in execution  of its proposals. For instance, he said, United Western had bought and  distributed 100 personal computers to staff doctors with the idea of forming a  computerized information exchange between the doctors' offices and the  hospitals. But the hospital linkup was never developed. The new management team  also closed an outpatient diagnostic imaging and surgical center that United  Western had opened in Irvine -- which Drumwright said was losing $1 million a  year.  </P> <P> And the very first day Drumwright and Mack took over, they said, they  eliminated a controversial newspaper advertising campaign costing $50,000 a  month that featured testimonials from the hospital's medical staff.  </P> <P> "Employees did not like those ads and were not unhappy to see them gone," said  Sandy Crawford, the Santa Ana hospital's director of nursing.  </P> <P> In an attempt to cut costs, the new management team canceled contracts with  outside companies for services such as accounting, computers, pharmacy and  engineering, and began performing the services in house.  </P> <P> While some new medical programs have been introduced at United Western  hospitals in the last 10 months, they are being kept to a minimum, Howard said.  Instead of installing expensive technology to attract patients, the new  management says it is trying to stress the basics of good service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Patient Pavilion' Plan  </P> <P> There are plans, for example, to create a "patient pavilion" on the first floor  of the Santa Ana hospital where all outpatient services will be grouped for  greater convenience.  </P> <P> Contrary to widespread speculation in the Orange County medical community, the  new management and directors of United Western insist that they have no plans  to sell any facility or close the Santa Ana hospital's trauma center as part of  their cost-cutting drive.  </P> <P> Those who operate United Western admit there still are problems.  </P> <P> The Anaheim hospital first edged into profitability only in August, in response  to stringent new cost controls. And Western Medical Center/Bartlett, the  skilled nursing facility in Santa Ana, continues to lose money.  </P> <P> Also, United Western officials acknowledged that this year the patient census  at the flagship Santa Ana hospital has slipped, a condition they blame partly  on the loss of Medi-Cal patients and partly on a countywide decline in hospital  business reflecting a trend toward more outpatient care.  </P> <P> So far this fiscal year, Drumwright said, United Western is $500,000 to $1  million in the red.  </P> <P> But there are clear signs of improvement. United Western officials say the  Santa Ana hospital has returned to profitability and in July and August --  traditionally slow business months for hospitals -- and United Western as a  whole has made a slight profit.  </P> <P> And United Western officials are confident that by staying the current course  the company will make a profit of $1 million to $2 million by the end of the  current fiscal year.  </P> <P> "We will concentrate more on nuts and bolts," director Hill said. "We are going  to mind the store."  </P></p>

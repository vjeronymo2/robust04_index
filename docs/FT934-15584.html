			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Coutts Consulting deal raises dividend hopes COUTTS Consulting Group, the career consultancy, outplacement and residential training company, has sidestepped objections by Mr Barry Topple, its former chief executive, and found a way of eliminating the deficit on its share premium account allowing dividends to be paid. Coutts hoped that as a result Mr Topple's compensation claim and their counter-claim for Pounds 3.4m damages would now reach a rapid conclusion. Eynsham Hall, Coutts' residential training offshoot, is acquiring Coutts Consultants, its outplacement business. The move releases merger reserves of Pounds 4.1m as well as showing a book profit of Pounds 2.9m. There are still arrears of Pounds 600,000 on the preference shares. The deal completes the reorganisation at Coutts Consulting, formerly DC Gardner. A previous attempt to reduce the share premium account had been blocked by Mr Topple. Mr Tim Inglefield, finance director, said the company would have preferred to achieve the result in front of the shareholders by going through the courts, but this had not been possible.</p>

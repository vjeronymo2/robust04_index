			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Houkang (0151 0624 1660) and Wang Jianhua </F> (3769 1696 5478): "A Survey of Shanghai's Commercial Enterprises  Piloting the Shareholding System"]    [Excerpt] In view of the importance of standardizing the  state's equity management to the perfection of the pilot  shareholding system, last June, we conducted a survey of  Shanghai Municipality's commercial enterprises piloting the  shareholding system. The following is our report:  <H5>  I. Development of Shanghai's Commercial Shareholding </H5> Enterprises    Shanghai is one of the cities with the largest number of  enterprises piloting the shareholding system. At the end of May  1993, it had 63 shareholding enterprises, with 12.66 billion  yuan in share capital. Of that, 13 were commercial shareholding  enterprises, with 914 million yuan in share capital; they  accounted for 20.6 percent and 7.2 percent of the municipality's  total number of shareholding enterprises and total share  capital, respectively.    The development of Shanghai's pilot commercial shareholding  enterprises can be divided into three stages: 1987-1990 marked  the first stage. Yuyuan Shopping Mall Shareholding Co. Ltd. and  New World Shareholding Trading Co. Ltd. were the municipality's  first experimental points. Constrained by the internal and  external conditions, besides converting the original assets into  shares, Yuyuan only absorbed 1.3 million yuan in personal shares  and New World absorbed only 390,000 yuan in legal person shares.  The two enterprises only had 6.5 million and 6.94 million yuan,  respectively, in share capital. Because of the lack of relevant  policies and laws and regulations, there were many conflicts  between the shareholding system and the original system, and  adding the fact that people had different ideas about the system  and because of inappropriate administrative intervention, it  made the pilot project even more difficult, and for some time,  no progress was made. The second stage began toward the end of  1990 and lasted until the first half of 1992. During this  period, the State Council officially allowed Shanghai to pilot  the system of issuing shares to the general public. China's  first securities exchange opened in Shanghai. The municipal  government introduced a series of policies and laws and  regulations pertaining to the pilot shareholding system. In  particular, Comrade Deng Xioaping's speech delivered during his  South China tour further increased the people's consciousness  about speeding up the reform. In the first six months of 1992,  development began to gather momentum. Some large- and  medium-sized commercial enterprises began to link the  shareholding system to the vitalization of Shanghai's businesses  and the goal of developing great circulation, big markets, and  big business. The nation's two largest departments  stores--Shanghai Number One Department Store and Shanghai  Hualian Business Building--and the municipality's largest food  store--Shanghai Number One Food Stores--proceeded to restructure  their enterprises under the shareholding system. Yuyuan Shopping  Mall Shareholding Co. Ltd. and 15 enterprises initiated a  reorganization and set up the Yuyuan Tourist City Shareholding  Company, Ltd. In March and April of 1992, New World Trading  Company, Ltd. took over five small state-owned shops as  determined by the district business commission and, upon  expanding the scope of state-owned assets, successfully went  public with their stock. In the first half of 1992, the  municipal commercial system set up eight public-offering  companies. They had total share capital of 487 million yuan and  raised more than 1.6 billion yuan by issuing shares at a  premium. The third stage began in the second half of 1992. After  the State Restructuring of the Economic System Commission and  other relevant departments promulgated a dozen or so laws and  regulations pertaining to the shareholding experimental points,  the pilot project's external conditions were further improved.  In the first half of 1993, the municipal commercial system set  up another five directional capital raising companies, among  them, New Asia (Group) Shareholding Company, Ltd. had as much as  230 million yuan in share capital and was Shanghai's largest  commercial shareholding enterprise. Because of the strong  guiding role of the policies and laws and regulations, the  organization and development of new shareholding enterprises  took another big step toward standardization.    Facts show that Shanghai's pilot commercial shareholding  enterprises have produced clear results. The pilot enterprises  have the initial mechanisms to make autonomous management  decisions and take care of their own profits and losses, and  they have quickened the pace of self-improvement and  self-development. Enterprises sold shares and used the funds  they raised first to transform and expand their original  operating facilities and build new business outlets. They  actively opened up new management territories and vigorously  developed the export-oriented economy and in turn greatly  increased their ability to compete in the market. They have had  good economic results. If we look at enterprises' realized  profits, from 1987 when Yuyuan Shopping Mall became a limited  liability company until 1991, in four years' time, its profit  had increased at an annual rate of 18 percent, and after  reorganizing, its average profit increased 1.2 fold in 1992 and  another 1.2 fold in the first six months of 1993 compared to the  same period a year earlier. Number One Department Store and  Hualian Business Building which converted to the shareholding  system in 1992 saw their profits grow 23 percent that year  compared to the previous year and another 51 percent and 68  percent, respectively, in the first half of 1993 compared to the  same period a year earlier. Currently, six of the municipality's  commercial shareholding companies are listed in the market.  Their very promising future has attracted many investors.  <H5>  II. Current Conditions of the State's Equity Management in </H5> Shanghai's Shareholding Commercial Enterprises    Of Shanghai's 63 shareholding enterprises, 37 were  originally  state-owned enterprises. The original state properties were  converted to state-owned shares in the shareholding enterprises.  The state owns 7.65 billion yuan's worth of stocks in the 37  enterprises, accounting for 70 percent of the share capital.    Of the 13 commercial shareholding enterprises, 10 have  state-owned stocks, and we looked into eight of those  enterprises. The state owns 342 million yuan worth of shares in  these eight enterprises, accounting for 49.9 percent of their  share capital.

Setup of the State's Equity Management    In the process of reorganizing state-owned enterprises into  shareholding enterprises, to protect the legal rights and  privileges of state properties, the Municipal Administration of  State Properties was put in charge of auditing the assessment of  state properties to verify the assessed value of state  properties and the number of state shares upon converting the  assets to share capital. This was the basic task of state equity  management. Prior to 1991, however, Shanghai did not have a  specialized department to manage state properties, and therefore  basically no one was looking after the state-owned shares in the  shareholding enterprises. Yuyuan and New World, the two  shareholding companies set up between 1987 and 1988, did not  have their properties appraised properly during reorganization  and only converted the book value of the state properties into  state shares. Since the actual value of the state properties was  higher than their book value, and since other shareholders had  purchased shares based on face value, the state shares were  compromised. In the first six months of 1992, these two  shareholding companies underwent reorganization and three other  state-owned enterprises--Number One Department Store, Hualian  Business Building, and Number One Food Stores--also converted to  the shareholding system. All five enterprises followed policies  effective at that time to entrust specialized organs to appraise  their assets. The assessed net asset values were all higher than  the book value. The assessed net asset values of the two  original shareholding companies were 39 percent and 33 percent,  respectively, higher, and the other three state-owned  enterprises' assets had appreciated 143 percent, 176 percent,  and 71 percent respectively. Amid the assessed net asset value,  the value of the intangible assets has appreciated the most, but  the book value of the original enterprises' properties did not  include intangible assets. The three state-owned enterprises'  assessed net assets became the state's share capital and added  to the shareholding companies' assets, but the state share  capital was still based on the original book value of the  assets, and the added value of the assessed net assets was used  only as one of the bases for determining the price premium when  issuing stocks. Enterprises did not readjust the book value, nor  did they record the added net asset value in the capital  accumulation fund. Only one enterprise readjusted the book value  of the tangible assets and recorded that in the capital  accumulation fund; however, intangible assets were still left  out of the books. The above situation means the value of the  state properties put into the shareholding companies is never  fully recognized; the appreciated value of the state properties  after the appraisal becomes the shareholding companies' unlisted  assets. Similar problems also cropped up during the  reorganization of Yuyuan and New World in 1992.    When appraising and converting state properties in the  course  of setting up the three directional fund-raising companies in  1993, a new way of handling the financial issues had already  been implemented: book value was readjusted according to the  appraised value of the net assets. Among the net assets, the  added values of the negotiable securities, long-term  investments, and intangible assets were recorded in the capital  accumulation fund; the remaining net assets were converted to  state-owned share capital. The converted net assets as a  percentage of all net assets were used as one of the bases for  determining the price premium when issuing shares. This is a  fairly standard approach. However, problems left behind by the  way the five companies that went public in 1992 appraised and  converted their original assets have yet to be addressed.    2. Exercising the State's Equity Rights    This includes selecting representative for the state's  equities, fulfilling the responsibilities, and restructuring the  state's equity rights. Currently, the only organs representing  the state's equity shares in Shanghai's shareholding companies  are the original enterprise management departments and the  administrations of state properties at the corresponding levels.  The department in charge of enterprises has substantial power in  deciding who represents the state's equity interests. It may  consult the administrations of state properties or act  independently on its own authority to choose the  representatives. Some shareholding enterprises have one person  assigned by the department in charge of enterprises and one by  the administration of state properties to represent the state's  interests, but the person assigned by the department in charge  of enterprises is always the first representative who also  serves as the company's board chairman. This in fact follows the  old state-owned enterprise cadre management system. The  department in charge only assigns someone to represent the  state's equity interests as a means to control enterprises and  does not actually exercise control over the equities, and as a  result, a set of management systems necessary to make sure that  the representatives are fulfilling their responsibilities--such  as the systems of equity representative's work report and of  supervision, examination, rewards and penalties--was never  formulated. Moreover, some government officials serving on  enterprises' boards of directors have created a new mechanism of  commingling government and enterprises, which hampers the change  in government functions and obstructs fair competition among  enterprises.    Another problem in the exercise of state equity rights is  that state shares cannot be traded in the market. This method of  freezing the state's equities hampers the readjustment of the  industrial structure and makes it impossible for the state  shareholders to make a profit by buying low and selling high.    3. Management of the State's Equity Profits    According to current policies and laws and regulations, the  municipal and district administrations of state properties  should collect share dividends from the shareholding enterprises  based on the number of state-owned shares. On the other hand,  share dividends collected must be put into the municipality's  and districts' separate budgets; however, the administrations of  state properties acting as state shareholders have no  independent right to determine the use of the share dividends,  and in addition, neither the state shares nor the share income  are transferrable, and therefore the administrations of state  properties cannot reinvest and cannot generate a benign cycle of  "input--output--reinvest," which seriously limit the propagation  of state assets in shareholding enterprises. In June 1963 Number  One Department Store decided to increase capital and bonus  shares. Each bonus share was priced at six yuan, 2.9 yuan below  the IPO price. Because the Municipal Administration of State  Properties had no money to reinvest, it had to give up its right  to buy additional shares, and as a result, the state's interest  in the company fell by 10 percentage points, bringing losses to  the state as shareholder.

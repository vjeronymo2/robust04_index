			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Key Expo '92 pavilion destroyed by blaze A FIRE yesterday destroyed one of the most eye-catching pavilions of the Seville Universal Exposition, which opens on April 20, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. Firemen fought a four-hour battle to extinguish the blaze at the 'Time Machine'. Conceived as a Time Machine that used a combination of visual effects to explain five centuries of discoveries, invention and technological applications, the pavilion was a key component of Expo '92's commemoration of Columbus' voyage to the New World 500 years ago. Although the fire's cause was not known last night, security experts have voiced fears that Expo '92, which groups some 90 pavilions representing nations and multinationals, would be a target for terrorist groups, including the Basque separatist organisation Eta. The destroyed complex, which consisted of eight modules spread over 12,000 sq metres, was officially known as the Discoveries Pavilion, and was expected to draw some 20,000 visitors a day.</p>

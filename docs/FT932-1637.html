			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Haiti's army leader offers talks NEW TALKS aimed at restoring exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti are expected to begin later this week following a 'positive' response from the country's military rulers, Mr Dante Caputo, the special UN mediator, said yesterday, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent, in New York. Mr Caputo said a letter from General Raoul Cedras, chief of Haiti's armed forces, saying he was willing to meet Fr Aristide, 'opens up possibilities for fruitful negotiations'. Gen Cedras led the September 1991 coup that ousted the president. However, a UN spokesman said sanctions against Haiti were still likely to go into effect today, despite the apparent progress. The Security Council last week ordered an oil and arms embargo against the Caribbean country but delayed its implementation pending new efforts to reinstate Fr Aristide.</p>

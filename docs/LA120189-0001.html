			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOLFGANG OTTO; ACQUITTED OF DEATH CAMP KILLING  </P> <P> Wolfgang Otto, 78, a former Nazi SS sergeant suspected of the 1944 death camp  execution of German communist leader Ernst Thaelmann. In 1986, Otto was found  guilty of complicity in the shooting death of Thaelmann at Buchenwald.  Thaelmann had been imprisoned when the Nazis took power in 1933. Otto was  sentenced to four years in prison but remained free pending an appeal.  Prosecutors had argued that Adolf Hitler had personally ordered Thaelmann's  execution and that Otto carried out the order, which Otto denied. The case was  appealed to West Germany's Supreme Court, which overturned the verdict because  of a legal error. Two years later, Otto was retried and acquitted of the murder  charge by a state court which said there was insufficient evidence. On Sunday  in Frankfurt, West Germany, of undisclosed causes.  </P></p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Coats cleared to bid for Tootal THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has cleared the way for Coats Viyella to pursue its Pounds 194m hostile takeover bid for Tootal, another of the UK's leading textile groups, by recommending that the bid should not be referred to the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission. The MMC conducted an investigation into the prospective merger between Coats and Tootal two years ago after the two companies agreed terms for a friendly merger. The Pounds 395m agreed bid lapsed during the MMC investigation. Coats waited until March this year to make another offer, this time on a hostile basis. The current bid was put on ice during the OFT's investigation. Tootal, which is fighting fiercely against the bid, now has two days - until Saturday - in which to issue any new information to its shareholders. Tootal plans to publish details of a profits forecast - covering profits before and after tax together with earnings per share - for the year to January 31. It will also release details of 'specific projects' for its core businesses intended to 'improve profitability significantly' in the next financial year. Coats, which already owns 29.4 per cent of Tootal, yesterday demanded that it produce a balance sheet and cashflow statement for the 1990-91 financial year. Coats also asked for further details of the Pounds 23m extraordinary restructuring costs that Tootal included in its recently released preliminary results. Tootal, which was forced by the timing of Coats' bid to bring forward the publication of its preliminary results so that it could include them in its defence document, said it would wait until its annual report came out at the usual time in May to produce the balance sheet and cashflow statement. For weeks the stock market has been speculating that Coats would make a second offer after Tootal has issued its profits forecast. Tootal's shares, which rose above Coats' original offer of 65p cash shortly after the bid in anticipation of a second offer, were unchanged at 76p yesterday. Coats' shares also ended the day unchanged at 140p.</p>

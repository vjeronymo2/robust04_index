			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / After the Cold War, economics is king Former President Richard Nixon's denunciation of the Bush administration's policies towards Russia as 'pathetically inadequate' captured headlines last week. But it forms only part of a much broader debate about the United States' post-Cold War role. The key question is whether the US will recognise the need to put economics at the heart of future national security policies - a strategy that Japan has quietly pursued for four decades. The power of the old diplomatic paradigm - which equates national security with military power - was visible last week in a leaked Pentagon policy paper. This argued that the US should seek to prevent any other nation or group of nations from challenging its role as the world's single superpower. The implication is clear: military spending should remain high enough to enable the US to serve as world policeman for the foreseeable future. An economically oriented foreign policy would justify far more generous aid for Russia, principally as a way to secure US access to a huge new market. But in a world of many rich nations, Mr Nixon's claim that the US has a unique responsibility to preserve Russia's fledgling democracy is diplomatic old-speak - as dated as the Pentagon's grandiose view of the future military role of the US. At a conference organised last week by the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think-tank, speakers seemed encouragingly aware of America's need to focus on the economic foundations of national security. How many great powers will there be in 2000, asked Mr Chalmers Johnson, the Japan scholar. The usual answer is three: Japan holding sway in Asia, Germany running Europe and the US pre-eminent in the Americas. The right answer, he joked, is two: Japan's Ministry of Finance and Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry. Mr Edward Luttwak, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, made a similar point more colourfully. Prussia, he claimed, had transformed 19th-century politics by inventing the first professional military general staff. In order to survive, other nations had to follow suit and professionalise their war machines. Japan was the modern economic counterpart of Prussia. By creating what amounted to an economic general staff, it had wiped the floor with nations that still relied mainly on laisser faire policies. Yet the US understood only the old geo-political rules. The secretary of defence still outranked the secretary of commerce, while General Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, was clueless on economics. The critics are making two separate points. The first is hardly controversial: the US's geo-political pretensions directly reduce its economic vitality because they cost so much. At the conference, Mr David Calleo, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, rammed this point home. The budget deficit, he said, was the central economic problem. The only credible way to reduce it was through deep defence cuts; but these would be sustainable only if the US radically revised its military commitments. It could not be world policeman and restore domestic prosperity. The second point will raise hackles. The reason that the US has nothing resembling Mr Luttwak's economic general staff is that the nation despises civil servants and has been ideologically committed to free markets for decades. With a few exceptions, such as semiconductors, it has avoided industrial policies because 'doing nothing' is seen as the best strategy. The question is whether Japan's post-war success, like Prussia's military success in the 19th century, will force a rethink. Last month, at a seminar run by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, Mr Karel van Wolferen, the Dutch author of The Enigma of Japanese Power, argued vigorously that Japan's strengths are badly misunderstood. Western economists attribute its economic success to market forces only because they think liberal policies are a pre-condition for prosperity. In reality, the network of formal and informal links between banks, industrial groups and bureaucrats had erased conventional divisions between the public and private sectors, raising the effectiveness of policies. Another Japan expert, Mr Leon Hollerman, a professor at the Claremont Graduate School, argued that a 'collusive oligopoly' of bureaucrats and businessmen ran the country and kept foreign policy firmly focused on economic rather than diplomatic goals. Tokyo had moved beyond the suppression of imports and promotion of exports and was now deliberately manipulating the multilateral trade system in a bid to make Japan the world's 'headquarters nation'. The goal was systematically to reduce other countries, including the US, to the role of satellite economies. Such fears may prove exaggerated. Much of the US's lack of competitiveness can be cured by domestic initiatives: principally more saving, better education and training and a surer application of commercial technology. But analysts are right to highlight structural differences: Japan may have evolved a form of managed capitalism that will steadily outperform the Anglo-Saxon model. The US will have to experiment with flexible forms of industrial policy - although it is unlikely ever to create an economic civil service of Japanese calibre. But it can learn one lesson from Japan: when the key policymakers - in foreign as well as domestic policy - are motivated mainly by economic considerations, the economy flourishes.</p>

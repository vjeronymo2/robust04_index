			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Man bites midge A pharmaceutical company is to launch a natural insect repellent for midges after a retired Scottish professor of pathology noticed that the troublesome insects avoided bog myrtle. Professor Angus Stuart found that oil from the leaves of bog myrtle - one of the least productive features of the Scottish highlands, and detailed on the right in our picture - repelled the midges - magnified left - which can drive people to distraction along the west coast of Scotland. Bog myrtle grows all over northern Scotland in bogs and other places unsuitable for grazing. Prof Stuart, who lived on Skye after his retirement, took his idea to Efamol, which makes drugs and dietary supplements based mainly on evening primrose oil. After 3 1/2 years of research Efamol has applied for patents on the oil extract, and is installing a pilot extraction plant on Skye. It has just received a Pounds 25,000 grant from Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise. It hopes to launch its product within about three years. Efamol obtains bog myrtle oil from leaves collected in Skye bogs by crofters but believes bog myrtle could eventually be grown in plantations and cropped like tea. Mr Iain Cloughley of Efamol says bog myrtle oil has shown itself effective against several insects, including mosquitoes in Belize. Older people on Skye recall using it against bed bugs, and laboratory work shows it kills house mites and aphids. He believes products based on bog myrtle, sold in roll-on form or in sprays, should be more long-lasting and effective than synthetic repellents. 'The oil contains so many different elements that midges may never get used to it.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 25 May (PL) -- The hasty dialogue held  this week between the Central American presidents and U.S. Vice  President Al Gore left a balance of conditions and promises that  were well below expectations.    In many respects, the topics discussed were more of interest  to the United States than to Central America, an area that is  still suffering from the effects of 10 years of civil war and  extreme poverty.    For the six heads of state who attended the event last  Tuesday, the dialogue with Gore was primarily aimed at  determining the White House's position on the possibility of  Central America gaining access to the NAFTA signed by the United  States, Mexico, and Canada, which has been in effect since 1  January.    The economic bloc with the most potential in the world  emerged from this agreement, and access to it has become a sort  of obsession for most governments in Latin America.    According to Gore, however, the Tegucigalpa mini-summit was  intended to prepare for the hemispheric summit to be convened by  President Bill Clinton in Miami in December.    Revived by Clinton, these types of meetings were suspended  by  Washington in the 1960's and are reemerging today, when  defensive and vindictive strategies for the Ibero-American  summit are being consolidated.    Predictions became realities in Tegucigalpa. Gore downplayed  any possibilities for short- or medium-term links between  Central American countries and NAFTA.    U.S. analysts commented a few weeks ago that countries with  key raw materials or with strategic geographical positions, like  Chile and Venezuela, would now be among the few nations with  which Washington would be willing to negotiate a link to the  agreement. Obviously, Central America does not fall into that  category.    Instead of access to NAFTA, the U.S. vice president offered  the Central American presidents "a program that would provide  similar NAFTA treatment for textile products coming from the  Caribbean basin that could comply with NAFTA regulations. Such  a prerogative would eliminate tariffs for some $3 billion in  Central American exports to the U.S. market per year.    Gore said, however, that for the countries to benefit from  this program, to be discussed in the U.S. Congress in the next  few days, the Central American nations would be forced to expand  their domestic markets for the entrance of U.S. textile products.    According to Gore, this plan is Clinton's reply to the  existing concerns in Central America regarding the economic  effects that could be brought about by NAFTA, and it definitely  dashes Central America's hopes of having closer ties to the  trade bloc.    The serious foreign debt problem, however, which has  absorbed  so many resources from Central America and prevented it from  undertaking sustainable development, was not analyzed in the  summit.    By the end of 1993, Central America and the Caribbean  accumulated a foreign debt totalling $36.56 billion. The  Central American region alone owes a total of $25.6 billion, 40  percent of which is Nicaragua's, one of the countries most  seriously affected by civil war.    As for this delicate matter, Vice President Gore only said  the United States would encourage international financial  institutions to cooperate with the region to overcome the  problem.    What absorbed Gore's attention the most was not the debt  problem but his interest in dictating the conduct of the  presidents of the region in matters of human rights, public  sector corruption, honest elections, and drug trafficking.    With a population of 30 million, the Central American  region,  so overwhelmed by social injustice and the impunity with which  the military continues to intrude on the civilian sector,  urgently needs specific projects that can lead to accelerated  development rather than political promises.    Economic expansion will be the key to consolidating peace  and  democracy in the region, but unfortunately, according to some  observers here, the meeting with Gore did not open wide any  opportunities for dealing with such urgencies.</p>

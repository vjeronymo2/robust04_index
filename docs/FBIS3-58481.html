There were no  victims or substantial property damage.    Iraultza, an extremist group not linked to ETA [Basque  Fatherland and Liberty Orgainzation] and which usually attacks  state organizations, claimed responsibility for the attack in a  call to the newspaper EGIN, the traditional mouthpiece of this  terrorist band.    An official spokesman said that only the bomb's "primer,"  which was homemade and had been placed at the Consulate's  entrance, exploded.    According to Vice Consul Jose Miguel Arechavala, nine days  ago a telephone call was made to the Consulate. The caller said  he was calling on behalf of Iraultza. He threatened to plant a  bomb to protest the Mexican Government's action in the armed  conflict in Chiapas State.    In recent days, demonstrations and rallies have been  organized in several places of Spain to protest the actions of  the Mexican Army in the insurrection of peasants and Indians in  Chiapas.</p>

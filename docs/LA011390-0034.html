			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE HELPS MAKE ECOLOGY A MAJOR CONCERN OF RELIGION  </P> <P> Organized religion has taken increasing note of environmental danger signals.  </P> <P> In a departure from usual themes for his annual peace message on New Year's  Day, Pope John Paul II issued a call for greater awareness of environmental  concerns, equating ecological destruction with a "genuine contempt" for  humanity.  </P> <P> The speech linked disregard for nature and plundering of natural resources to a  decline in the quality of life. That decline, he said, leads to a "sense of  precariousness and insecurity" that creates "a seedbed for collective  selfishness, disregard for others and dishonesty."  </P> <P> The Pope's address was warmly received by a number of environmental and  religious activists involved in the North American Conference on Religion and  Ecology. The group was founded in March, 1989, specifically "to help the North  American religious community enter into the environmental movement in the  1990s, with more informed understanding, deeper commitment and a dynamic sense  of environmental service."  </P> <P> "The Pope, for the first time, has given high priority to environmental  concerns," said Donald B. Conroy, conference president. "The theological and  ethical implications of this pontifical statement are enormous. In this one  statement, the Pope has raised major eco-justice questions underlying the  global search for peace."  </P> <P> Establishment of the group, based in Washington, is one of a number of  developments showing that concern for the environment is fast becoming a major  issue of the new decade for religious groups.  </P> <P> In addition to the religious-legislative "Global Forum on Environment and  Development" next week in Moscow, the World Council of Churches in March will  hold a worldwide gathering on "Justice, Peace and the Integrity of Creation" in  Seoul, South Korea, to consider an agenda heavy with environmental issues.  </P> <P> The papal message at the start of the year said depletion of the Earth's ozone  layer and the related "greenhouse effect" are the results of industrial  practices that have shown little regard for delicate ecological balances.  Redressing environmental damage will not be possible, the Pope said, without  "directly addressing the structural forms of poverty that exist throughout the  world."  </P> <P> The Pope said it is necessary for the religious community to address the  environmental effects of war, of a life style that embraces unbridled  consumerism and of "indiscriminate application of advances in science and  technology."  </P></p>

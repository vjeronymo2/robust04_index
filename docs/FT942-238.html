			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Fourth government in a year brings LDP back to power: With an eight-seat majority, the new coalition may be even less stable than its predecessors The old order of Japanese politics last night took its revenge on the new, in a twist to the past year's dismantling of the traditional structure of power. r The three-party alliance of the rightwing Liberal Democratic party, the left Social Democratic party and the New Harbinger party, an LDP splinter group, is extraordinary by any standards. The LDP and SDP were in government and opposition respectively for 38 stable years until the collapse of the LDP government just under a year ago. Since then, Japan has had two coalition governments dedicated to sweeping away the old order, in which policies where made on the whim of LDP factions, in favour of a new power structure closer to the electorate. This morning, a puzzled electorate will wake up to find that the LDP, a creature of the old system, is back in the fourth government in a year. The new coalition, with a slender eight-seat majority, may prove to be even less stable than its short-lived predecessors. In just over a week's time, at a Group of Seven summit, its prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, 70, will face US President Bill Clinton, who is anxious for evidence that Japan is moving to stimulate its convalescent economy. Yet Mr Murayama and his party are far out of line with the LDP on most issues, from defence to foreign affairs and tax. But the force that drew the old enemies together is clear. Both the LDP and SDP are dominated by conservatives with large factions which are reluctant to accept economic deregulation and political reform, the mainstays of the previous two coalition governments' policies. Both parties also fear that plans to change the present multi-seat constituency system into a mixture of single-seat and proportional representation will sweep away the support groups that kept them in parliament for nearly four decades. Mr Murayama has recently called for a snap general election under the existing political system, before new electoral boundaries can be prepared for the new one, by autumn. This could delay or even spell the end of political reform, officials of the former coalition fear. Mr Murayama last night appeared to soften his stance and maintained that the new government would pursue political reform, a sign - though not a conclusive one - of sensitivity to the support for political reform among Japan's electorate. The LDP and SDP are also united in their dislike for Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP secretary general who brought down the LDP government last June by leading a defection. The SDP's wish to take revenge on Mr Ozawa dates from his backing for the formation of a centre-right bloc in former prime minister Mr Tsutomu Hata's coalition in April. This excluded the SDP, causing it to storm out of the government. That deprived the coalition of its majority, making Mr Hata's resignation, last Saturday, a matter of time. Mr Koichi Kato, a member of parliament from the LDP's powerful Miyazawa faction, acknowledged the former rivals' common interests last night when he said his party shared a common thread of history with the SDP. The breakdown of Japan's traditional political order had eroded their ideological differences, he said. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the former prime minister who fought to push political reform through parliament earlier this year, saw it differently. 'This collusion is the last struggle of two parties trying to stick to their logrolling politics that dominated Japan since 1955,' he said. Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo, described it yesterday as 'a desperate marriage of the cold war warriors'. The marriage, however, will be under strain from today, when the LDP-SDP coalition is expected to try to form a cabinet, in which the numerically stronger LDP will demand most of the top jobs. Political analysts expect the LDP to push for Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former finance minister and fiscal conservative, to return to his old ministry. This will be controversial because Mr Hashimoto, like the mainstream of the LDP, supports plans for tax reform along the lines drawn up by the Finance Ministry, for a cut in income tax to be followed by a more than doubling of Japan's internationally low 3 per cent rate of sales tax. It was this very issue that forced the SDP to break off talks with the former coalition. The SDP, which bitterly opposed the introduction of sales tax in 1988 and campaigns on a promise to ban the tax, will not accept his appointment easily and will find it even harder to accept a decision on raising tax. The LDP and SDP were both internally divided before that made their grab for power last night. The drama may have shaken their unity even further, by forcing reform-minded members of the LDP and SDP to vote against their old parties. On the LDP side, they include Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a reform-minded former prime minister who broke away from his party ranks just 1 1/2 hours before the parliamentary vote, in order to stand against Mr Murayama with the backing of Mr Hata's coalition. Mr Kaifu had the support of two other LDP heavyweights, former prime minister Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone and former foreign minister Mr Michio Watanabe. Mr Kaifu, looking impassive after his defeat, said he would now leave the party. The others may be considering leading another round of defections. The cost of last night's grab for power could, for the LDP, be very high.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Pei Jianfeng: "Faint Hopes for Balancing </F> Trade"]    [Text] Even though the growth in exports accelerated in  the first two months of 1994, government experts are not  optimistic about the prospects of balancing China's foreign  trade this year.    Exports grew 13.6 percent during the first two months, 11.3  percentage points higher than the same period last year.  Imports, meanwhile jumped 20.5 percent, down 2.5 percentage  points from a year ago.    Still, this left a trade deficit of $1.24 billion.    "From past experience, the beginning of a year is usually a  period for more exports because commodities for export,  especially agriculture products, are abundant at the time," said  Wang Huaian, an economist with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation (Moftec).    At the same time, seasonal imports usually ebb because most  domestic units are still drawing up plans for the year's  imports, he said. Wang added that imports usually peak in the  latter half of the year.    "It will be difficult for China to achieve a 1O percent  growth in exports this year because there exist some  unfavourable factors," Wang said.    The domestic market will continue to be brisk this year, he  said, deterring enterprises from exporting their goods.  Domestic price hikes squeeze exports by making them more  expensive and trimming profit margins.    The devaluation of the renminbi, brought by the unification  of the dual-track exchange rate system, has also reduced its  purchasing power at home and pushed up the cost of exports, Wang  said.    He noted that the pressure for imports is still rather  strong  this year.    The government hopes to slow down the growth of the economy.  The official target this year is 9 percent growth in the gross  domestic product.    But many local authorities are staking their plans on higher  growth.    Such an economic expansion will surely stimulate the demand  for imports, he said.    China wishes to set up more foreign-funded enterprises to  bring in large quantities of imported equipment.    To improve its chances of re-entering the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said, China is opening its  markets wider to worldwide competition. The government has  lowered tariffs and cancelled import licenses and quotas for  numerous products.    Because of these factors, Wang said a trade deficit seems  inevitable this year.    But the deficit could be slashed from last year's $12.2  billion because of some positive factors, he said.    The rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production  will provide more products for export, and the convergence of  renminbi exchange rates can facilitate exports and curb imports.</p>

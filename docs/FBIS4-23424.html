			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 5 SAPA -- Political indemnity was  granted to several former security force members in accordance  with legal procedures in April, Deputy President FW de Klerk  said on Sunday [5 June].    Mr de Klerk was reacting to a SUNDAY TRIBUNE article  claiming  that he had granted indemnity to former Civil Co-operation  Bureau [CCB] member Maj-Gen Eddie Webb and three men implicated  in an ambush in which seven people were killed near KwaMashu in  1990.    In a statement, Mr de Klerk said: "There was no political  advantage to be gained for me or my party from any of these  decisions".    The decision was made in terms of an agreement reached with  major political parties that Mr de Klerk should continue  governing South Africa until a formal transfer of power. "A  large majority of the applicants were African National Congress  and Inkatha Freedom Party members. They also included an  application from Maj-Gen Webb. As with other applications I was  bound to grant indemnity to those who could comply with the  criteria set out in the (Further Indemnity) Act. This I did  without favour or prejudice," Mr de Klerk said.    It was not necessary to consult the Transitional Executive  Council on this matter as it did not affect the outcome of the  electoral process.    The SUNDAY TRIBUNE quoted "reliable sources in the new  government" saying the new administration was furious, but  Justice Minister Dullah Omar did not want to comment.    Lawyers for Human Rights Director Brian Currin said the  recent indemnities could be illegal.</p>

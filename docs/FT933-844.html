			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Schroders Schroders never really wanted to join the FT-SE 100 index, and last week's share performance shows why. A net fall of 5 per cent on minimal turnover and no news developments makes it an embarrassingly awkward member of such a prestigious club. Its price is particularly volatile because the founding family's controlling interest makes the stock chronically illiquid. On top of that, Schroders' appalling disclosure record leaves the shares impossible for even professional investors to value. Changes in EC disclosure rules will force Schroders to deal with the latter problem next year. Confronting the lack of liquidity is more difficult. It makes Schroders an unsuitable candidate for the index. Yet exclusion would smack of unfair discrimination - except as part of a general change to the index rules on liquidity. At present these simply follow the stock exchange listing requirement that 25 per cent of a company's shares be freely tradeable. It would be a bold step for the index committee to depart from this norm. And there is also the thorny problem of whether large institutional shareholdings should count as part of the freely traded float. A more subtle approach would be to exclude non-voting shares when market capitalisation is calculated for index eligibility purposes. Again, stock exchange rules do not discriminate in this way. But such an approach would not only exclude an illiquid issue like Schroders. It would also serve the socially useful purpose of putting additional pressure on others such as Whitbread which persist with this archaic form of structure.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Clara R. M. do Prado] </F>   [Text] Exchange operations on the financial market have  registered an $800 million deficit. Payments on external  obligations have heavily influenced Brazilian external accounts,  while no sufficient compensatory income came from the financial  sector.    Stock markets have continued to attract rather significant  amounts of foreign funds -- the balance is $251 million,  including investments in stocks and portfolios. Foreign funds  also have been attracted by fixed earning funds for foreign  capital, which were created at the end of 1993 for investment of  the debenture funds. The flow of income into these funds, which  used to stand at $80 million a month, rose to $122 million, with  the total value of fund capital standing at $1.631 billion on 30  March.    However, obtaining capital through bonds, notes, and  commercial papers [preceding two words in English] has been  rather slow. The balance in March was still positive -- income  reached $1.851 billion while the outflow stood at $1.6 billion  -- but the balance is expected to be smaller in March as a  result of the difficulties in selling securities abroad, which  Brazilian enterprises and banks already have felt.    Foreign currency operations tied to foreign debt obligations  -- this includes interest not only on the debt that was  contracted in the 1970's but also on the debt contracted in this  decade in bonds and other papers -- have increased: remittances  of $470 million went to pay interest, while $270 million went  for amortizing loans contracted within the terms of Resolution  No. 63 (contracting of external loans for domestic use).    Profits and dividends of $340 million also were paid, while  $300 million was paid to amortize funds that were used for  financing imports. The figures were released by the Central  Bank, whose technicians believe the financial sector performed  poorly because of the effects of the remittances and payments on  the external obligations.    From a strict viewpoint, the influence of such payments and  remittances should be inversely proportional to the country's  ability to contract new loans abroad. Last month, the inflow of  money into the stock markets was significant -- it reached  $1.851 billion -- but in this case it is volatile capital. In  the same month, the capital outflow reached $1.6 billion.    Actually, international reserves last month grew on the  basis  of the currency exchange operations involving foreign trade. At  the foreign currency level, exports yielded $4 billion  (effective cash inflow), repeating the performance of January.  As for imports, which since the beginning of last year have had  the same performance, they caused a foreign currency drain of  $1.8 billion. Last month, the net income from financial and  commercial operations stood at approximately $1.4 billion. This  will push the first quarter's net surplus to approximately $7  billion, well above the $2.3 billion net surplus registered in  the first quarter of 1993.    During the first days of April, the Central Bank has  observed  that export income remains high, standing at around $200 million  per day. In the financial sector, however, incoming and outgoing  flows still are registering a deficit. It is still early -- only  four workdays have passed -- to conclude that this is a trend,  but projections lead to the conclusion that April will also  register a deficit in the financial exchange market.</p>

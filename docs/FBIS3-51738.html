			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hugo Rius] </F>   [Text] Harare, 18 Jan (PL) -- Shortly before concluding his  official three-day visit to Zimbabwe, Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina stated today in this city that "we are leaving  Zimbabwe with more reasons than ever to feel like a part of  Africa."    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Robaina said that during the  short time he was here, he felt as if he had returned to Cuba's  cultural roots, in a fertile setting which would encourage to  flourish further the historical links of brotherhood.    At the airport terminal, Robaina was seen-off by his  Zimbabwean counterpart, Nathan Shamuyarira, with whom he met on  three occasions during the third and last day of his official  visit.    Their first meeting was for official talks, later for a  reception honoring the 35th anniversary of the Cuban revolution,  where both foreign ministers gave their respective speeches, and  finally for a dinner reception.    According to Robaina, on each occasion they both coincided  on  the international political situation and the willingness to  develop bilateral relations.    Shamuyarira told PRENSA LATINA that not just Zimbabwe but  all  of Africa was indebted to Cuba, a comment he repeated during  festivities commemorating the Cuban national holiday and  explained further today by making concrete propositions.    "Now it is up to us to support Cuba in its struggle against  the U.S. blockade and plans by the great powers to isolate it,  not only in the international organizations but in any other  possible sphere," he said.    He said one significant way to do so is by encouraging  mutual  trade--especially with those countries on the Atlantic part of  Africa that have more resources, for example, such as crude  oil--and by being more able to offer sea and air transportation  services.    After embracing at the foot of the aircraft which  transported  Robaina to Lusaka, Zambia, for the last stretch of a trip  through Africa, which will conclude in Namibia, the Zimbabwean  foreign minister said he shares the Cuban minister's  satisfaction with the meeting.    During an intense agenda, the Cuban visitor also held  meetings with the ministers of higher education and health, the  trade and industry deputy minister, the ministers of the  interior, agriculture and information, and the mayor of Harare,  who also participated in the reception commemorating the Cuban  revolution.    Likewise, Robaina also met with several Cubans who work and  live in this African country as well as with the board of  directors of the Zimbabwe-Cuba Friendship Association.    Undoubtedly, Robaina was able to explain that his country is  working with tremendous difficulty, but with an unflinching  spirit to preserve its independence and social accomplishments.</p>

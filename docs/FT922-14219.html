			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / World Trade News: Miti to probe US move over anti-trust laws Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) has established a working group to examine a US decision to apply anti-trust laws against foreign companies alleged to have unfairly blocked access for US exporters, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. The US decision on enforcement guidelines, viewed in Tokyo as a direct result of frustration with Japan, has confused Japanese officials, unsure whether the change is merely symbolic or will prompt a rush of actions against Japanese companies. 'We have several officials who are now studying this change very closely. We have heard that it is a symbolic change only and we have noted that this change was made in a US election year, but we are not certain exactly what will happen,' a senior Miti official said. The US has strongly condemned Japanese enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, and while the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has become more vigilant over the past two years, US companies still complain that exclusionary practices remain common in Japan. Under the new standard, the US justice department will be able to act against a range of collusive practices by foreign companies in their home markets, although court action would likely be taken against US subsidiaries of those companies.</p>

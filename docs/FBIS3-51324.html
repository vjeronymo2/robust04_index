Meta Department Governor Omar Armando Baquero asked the  national Navy command for an explanation of the task being  carried out by foreign soldiers in Puerto Lopez and why regional  and municipal authorities were not informed about this.    EL TIEMPO has learned that some 70 U.S. soldiers, guarded by  Colombian soldiers, have been in Puerto Lopez for one month,  apparently building a pier for the national Navy in Rio Meta. It  appears they are the soldiers who stayed six months in Guaviare  Department where, according to local authorities, they built a  naval base.    The U.S. troops are under the command of a lieutenant whose  identity could not be established, while Major Alvaro Rico,  commander of the Advanced River Port No. 63, is in command of  the national units.    The operations base is located only five minutes away from  the urban area of Puerto Lopez, near the road to Puerto Gaitan,  and is camouflaged by big trees in a place called Senar, on the  banks of Rio Meta. Some kind of camp and several shacks can be  observed at the site where the Colombian sentries stand guard.    So far, some land movement and flattening work has been  performed with heavy equipment such as backhoes, bulldozers,  cargo trucks, dump trucks, etc.    Puerto Lopez Mayor Hernan Saavedra stated he learned of the  foreign troops' presence some 20 days ago, not from an official  report from authorities but because he observed some soldiers in  the municipality's urban area.    The municipality residents explained it is customary to see  groups of Colombian soldiers escorting foreigners who come to  town to make telephone calls or to shop.    Brigadier General Luis Bernardo Urbina Sanchez, 7th Brigade  commander, admitted knowing about the troops' presence in Puerto  Lopez from early December. He added the U.S. soldiers will  conclude their works in mid-February and will then leave the  region.</p>

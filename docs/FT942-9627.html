			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Austrian privatisation terms set The flotation next week of 51 per cent of VA-Techonologie, Austria's largest engineering group, is expected to raise Sch6.9bn (Dollars 585m), almost Sch2bn more than anticipated when the company's privatisation was announced last November. Following strong interest from international institutional investors in Europe and the US, the 7.65m shares on offer have been priced at Sch900 per share - at the upper end of initial valuations. This would value the company at Sch13.5bn. 'Demand has been consistently strong across all markets,' the company said. VA-Tech's privatisation - the largest Austrian flotation - is part of a government programme to cut the state's role in industry which it hopes will raise about Sch20bn over the next 18 months. The company is owned 75 per cent by OIAG, the Austrian state holding company for the nationalised industries, and it has a 25 per cent cross shareholding with VA-Stahl, the steel group which is being restructured to prepare it for privatisation by 1996. The flotation on the Vienna stock exchange is set to start on Monday and run all of next week, but it is expected to close early due to high demand.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PROPOSAL WOULD CURB SPECIAL PROSECUTOR POWERS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is proposing to use its new ethics reform legislation  as a vehicle to reduce substantially the independence of the special  prosecutors appointed to investigate government wrongdoing.  </P> <P> The changes, some of which have been sought for years by executive branch  officials, are designed to give the Justice Department more control over the  prosecutors, known formally as independent counsels. Several members of the  Ronald Reagan Administration were investigated by independent counsels.  </P> <P> At the same time, Bush is proposing that special prosecutors, not the Justice  Department, investigate allegations of wrongdoing by members of Congress in the  same way that they investigate top executive branch officials. That decision  came despite serious reservations by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, who has argued  that his department's Public Integrity Section is fully able to handle  investigations of members of Congress.  </P> <P> The proposed changes could be highly controversial in Congress. In the past,  Congress has rejected repeated attempts by the executive branch to obtain more  control over the prosecutors, contending that independence is essential to  avoid conflicts of interest.  </P> <P> Among other changes, the Administration proposal would remove an independent  counsel's power to hire his own staff and would give the attorney general  substantial control over who could be appointed as an independent counsel. The  counsels are selected by a special judicial panel after the Justice Department  determines that an inquiry is warranted.  </P> <P> The special prosecutor law was passed after the Watergate scandal of the 1970s  because of concerns that the attorney general, appointed by the President,  could not always be counted on to investigate fully allegations against other  senior presidential appointees.  </P> <P> White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, in an analysis of the proposed legislation  that his office prepared, argued that "there is a comparable argument that  could be made that Department of Justice investigations of powerful individuals  in the legislature can be extremely awkward."  </P> <P> Thornburgh, by contrast, in a statement issued Wednesday, noted that the  "established system for handling allegations of wrongdoing by members of  Congress . . . has worked well for many years" and that 20 members of Congress,  including some powerful committee chairmen, have been convicted of criminal  offenses since the Public Integrity Section was established in 1976, when  Thornburgh headed the department's criminal division.  </P> <P> During the Reagan Administration, independent counsels twice were appointed to  investigate Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III, former White House aides Lynn Nofziger  and Michael K. Deaver, national security advisers Robert C. McFarlane and John  M. Poindexter and NSC aide Oliver L. North.  </P> <P> Meese, after the second investigation of his affairs, issued a regulation  shortly before he resigned extending the special prosecutor law to Congress.  Thornburgh revoked that rule Wednesday, saying that the issue should be left to  Congress to decide, now that Bush had made a legislative proposal.  </P> <P> The proposals to reduce the independence of the special prosecutors appear near  the end of Bush's 100-page ethics package. Among other changes, an independent  counsel would be barred from publicly releasing a report on an inquiry unless  the subject of his investigation is indicted. Meese reacted angrily last year  after independent counsel James C. McKay, while deciding against indicting the  then-attorney general, criticized him sharply in his report.  </P> <P> The proposed changes also would give the attorney general substantial power  over the scope of an independent counsel's investigation. Currently, that power  is held by the special judicial panel that appoints the prosecutors.  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration made several attempts to restrict the authority of  independent counsels, going as far as the Supreme Court in an attempt to have  the law establishing special prosecutors declared unconstitutional. And in the  Jimmy Carter Administration, then-Atty. Gen. Griffin Bell argued against the  prosecutors.  </P></p>

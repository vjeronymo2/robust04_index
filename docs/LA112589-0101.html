			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Dexter Manley, former Washington Redskins defensive end, probably will not  appeal his drug-related lifetime suspension by the NFL in court, his attorney  said.  </P> <P> Manley, 30, was banished from the league last week for a third violation of the  NFL's drug abuse policy. There was speculation that Manley would fight the  suspension in court, either by claiming that the drug test was faulty or by  questioning the authority of the commissioner or the rule itself.  </P> <P> Manley instead is leaning toward complying with the suspension and seeking  reinstatement in one year, a provision of the league's policy.  </P> <P> "I know that he has never really indicated to me that he was thinking in terms  of taking the league to court," said Bob Woolf, Manley's attorney.  </P></p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Technology: Compaq serves up a new PC range THREATENING to shake up the PC server market, Compaq Computer yesterday launched a range of aggressively priced PCs designed to work as 'file servers' on PC networks. File servers can enhance the performance of a PC network by providing data retrieval services to all of the PCs on the network. By undercutting the prices of comparable machines from its rivals in the PC market, Compaq hopes to accelerate the growth of network computing and lure customers away from competitors. Currently about 30 per cent of PCs in the US are linked to networks. Compaq's new ProSignia PC servers address the 'mainstream' of the PC server market with fully configured systems based upon Intel 486 microprocessors ranging in price from Dollars 4,500 (Pounds 2,500) to Dollars 8,800 (Pounds 5,000). In addition, Compaq introduced a new high-end multiprocessor PC server, the Systempro/XL, which the company claims is the world's fastest computer of its type. Prices for the XL range from Dollars 14,000 to Dollars 22,300. 'The ProSignia and Systempro/XL will shake up the server marketplace just as we shook up the desktop and notebook markets in June,' said Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive, referring to Compaq's launch of aggressively priced products that stimulated increased demand for PCs while fuelling a vicious price war among PC makers. With its lower-priced servers Compaq aims to attract buyers who would otherwise have 'made do by cobbling together desktop clones' to act as network servers, says Gary Stimac, senior vice president and general manager of Compaq's systems group. Compaq has previously not participated in this segment of the market, which represents about half of PC server sales, he acknowledges. The Systempro/XL represents Compaq's bid to participate in the trend towards corporate 'downsizing' in which minicomputers and mainframe computers are being replaced by networks of PCs.</p>

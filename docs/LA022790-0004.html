			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH URGED TO BAN MONTEREY BAY DRILLING;  </P> <P> RESOURCES: OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION IN THE MARINE SANCTUARY IS BEING DISCUSSED  BY THE ADMINISTRATION, REP. PANETTA SAYS. HE CALLS IT 'NUTS.'  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is debating whether to allow oil and gas drilling in  the newly established Monterey Bay national marine sanctuary, Rep. Leon Panetta  (D-Carmel Valley) charged Monday.  </P> <P> "I think it's nuts," Panetta said at a news conference where he appealed to  President Bush to support a ban on oil-gas exploration or development in the  highly sensitive waters, which includes parts of the Big Sur coastline and  breeding areas for seals and sea lions.  </P> <P> Congress passed legislation in 1988, signed into law by then-President Ronald  Reagan, requiring the designation of Monterey Bay as a sanctuary and setting a  Dec. 31, 1989, deadline for the executive branch to issue regulations for its  use.  </P> <P> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposed a ban on oil and  gas drilling as part of the proposed regulations, Panetta said, but the  departments of energy and interior objected.  </P> <P> As a result, the regulations have been delayed two months beyond the deadline  set by Congress and, Panetta said, raise the possibility that oil and gas  development may be allowed if there is nothing to forbid it in the federal  rules for Monterey Bay.  </P> <P> In a telegram to the President, the California lawmaker said: "Should the  decision of your Administration be to allow new drilling within a designated  marine sanctuary, this would constitute a major reversal of policies protecting  sanctuaries and a major violation of your own stated commitment to protecting  sensitive areas of our coastline."  </P> <P> Alluding to former Interior Secretary James Watt, known for his pro-industry  outlook, Panetta added: "If we got back to business as usual, as it was under  the Watt Administration, I think people (in California) will feel  double-crossed."  </P> <P> An environmental group, the Center for Marine Conservation, joined in the  criticism of the Bush Administration for postponing the issuance of a draft  environmental impact statement and management plan for the Monterey Bay  sanctuary.  </P> <P> "These new delays suggest a covert attempt to weaken protection against oil and  gas development within Monterey Bay," said Jack Sobel, an official of the  center. "This raises serious questions . . . of whether the (oil) industry's  influence is subverting the public process in designating national marine  sanctuaries."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Jean-Michel Cousteau of the Cousteau Society said oil drilling  in Monterey Bay "really makes no sense . . . in light of the problems we've had  recently."  </P> <P> "We know very well that we are not technologically equipped to face oil spills  without major damage to the environment," Cousteau said.  </P> <P> "I am for the concept of access in case of national defense needs," he said.  "But until then, we'd be much better off buying the oil from wherever we can  get it and preserving those finite resources that are dwindling in this  country."  </P> <P> Panetta said Bush's decision on Monterey Bay would send a signal on another  issue -- whether to allow oil-gas development in two other areas off the  California coast on the Outer Continental Shelf.  </P> <P> The news conference was called before the President departs Wednesday for a  trip to California. Bush has been asked to announce his decision on development  of Outer Continental Shelf areas off the Northern and Southern California  coasts during his trip this week. Administration sources, however, said White  House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu had requested additional information from  federal agencies on the issue and that an announcement of the drilling policy  will be delayed.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, California Gov. George Deukmejian, here for a national governors'  conference, criticized members of California's congressional delegation who  have successfully held off drilling in vast areas under state jurisdiction with  a series of legislated moratoriums.  </P> <P> Moratoriums, he said, serve not only to prevent drilling but also prevent the  kind of studies necessary for responsible development of oil and gas resources  in the future.  </P> <P> "When you have a moratorium, and you have an all-out ban, you are not going to  have any studies," Deukmejian told reporters. "And then a few years from now,  if we have another energy crisis where we want to get every bit of oil and gas  within our own jurisdiction developed, then we are not going to have the  benefit of the studies, and the outcome will be that we will go forward hastily  and that's the time when you can do great environmental damage."  </P> <P> Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), the likely GOP candidate for governor this year,  disagreed with his fellow Republican on the issue, however.  </P> <P> "I'll be willing to make him (Deukmejian) a small bet -- we've been able to  prevent drilling for a long time now and, if anything, recent events such as  the Exxon Valdez and Huntington Beach oil spills have shown it's just not worth  the risk," Wilson said.  </P> <P> Asked about the governor's remarks, Panetta said that he and others who  supported the moratoriums favored a balanced approach to oil drilling.  </P> <P> Times environmental writer Larry Stammer in Los Angeles contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

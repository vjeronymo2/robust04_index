			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> IMPOUNDED GUNS TO BE AUCTIONED  </P> <P> About 75 firearms impounded by Santa Paula authorities since last July will be  sold at public auction, rather than destroyed.  </P> <P> "My interest is in timesaving," Police Chief Walter Adair said. "The sale will  be more efficient."  </P> <P> While selling the guns will contribute little cash to the city, Adair said, the  new procedure will prove more economical for Santa Paula.  </P> <P> The City Council authorized the new procedures earlier this week.  </P> <P> Auctioneer Roger Ernst said the city can recoup 75% of the proceeds from guns  that are sold, usually to gunsmiths who use their parts for repair.

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (25): A battle between rival contenders - . . . For X-Windows THE coming together of six leading computer companies to produce the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) raises the significance of the X-Windows display management standard to the position of potential lead technology in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). As more computers are linked together in distributed systems, the need for a common interface to the services available on such systems, the prime objective of the COSE initiative, grows more pressing. The COSE members, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Santa Cruz Operation, Sun Microsystems, Univel and Unix Systems Laboratories, all have a vested interest in seeing the X-Windows standard prosper, for all either use it directly as the basis for their graphical user interfaces, or sell the operating environment on which it runs. The X-Windows standard itself started life over ten years ago as two separate research projects in the US. Project X at Stanford University in California was aimed at creating a windowing system, while Project Athena at MIT in Boston aimed at developing a network-independent graphics protocol that would provide cross-network services in a mixed-vendor environment. The two projects were closely complementary and the windowing system was soon absorbed into the cross-network graphics protocols to form what first appeared as X-Windows in 1986. It is now the broadly accepted standard for windowing and graphics management on Unix-based systems, with a pan-industry consortium of Unix suppliers and users supporting it. The key to its acceptance has been the underlying objective of making it vendor-independent. This has had some drawbacks in driving it through to universal adoption, however, particularly in the PC arena. Unlike Microsoft's Windows system, which has the specific PC platform as its sole target, X-Windows has had to be written as the underpinning specification: the method by which graphics such as an individual window are to be displayed and how user actions such as clicking on an icon are to be handled. Unlike Microsoft Windows, however, it does not specify the 'look and feel' of the system. This has led to the inevitable rise of different user interfaces. Following on from the Unix industry splitting in to two main camps: Unix International and the Open Software Foundation, the X-based GUI has been promoted in two different forms, respectively Open Look and OSF/Motif. These have been the subject of considerable marketing hype between the rival contenders. Sun Microsystems has been the leading proponent of Open Look, and because of the company's dominance in the workstation market (and the bundling of Open Look with its products) it justly claims that the system is the most widely sold X-based GUI. LEADING SUPPLIERS OSF/Motif, on the other hand, is specified by the largest number of Unix system suppliers, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment, and there is growing evidence that is the most likely version to be specified by users. The leading supplier of Motif-based windowing systems is IXI of Cambridge, whose X Desktop windowing system is specified by most of the leading suppliers. IXI was recently bought by the Santa Cruz Operation (which already integrates X Desktop into its own Unix) thus giving the company a significant seat on the councils of the COSE grouping. Perhaps the most important aspect of X-Windows as a standard is the fact that it has been specifically designed to work in a client-server environment. Windowing systems running on a stand-alone machine such as a PC are self-contained; the user takes an action within a window, and the application in question is there on the same machine. In a client/server environment, it is highly likely that the users actions on a workstation will affect or use an application running on a different system. The results of the action may, in turn, have to be passed to a different application on yet another system on the network. In this situation, there is a need for a management system which not only ensures that the users actions, and the results, are presented correctly on the workstation, but also ensures that the users' instructions to and demands upon the various applications running elsewhere on the network are correctly routed and acted on. The flexibility and vendor-independence of X-Windows can also be exploited to create wider distributed systems than those based solely on Unix platforms and applications. For example, a number of companies have developed software tools which allow X-Windows-compliant windows to be opened within a Microsoft Windows environment on a PC. The leading suppliers of this technology are UK companies such as VisionWare of Leeds and JSB Software of Macclesfield. Their tools allow users to work at a networked PC, using all the familiar applications and productivity tools of the Windows environment and, when required, open a X-compliant window on to a Unix server. This provides great flexibility, in that the users keep a familiar working environment on the PC and gain access to the wider, more comprehensive power of the distributed network through X-Windows. There is also the full cut-and-paste capabilities of Windows available between the PC applications and those X-compliant applications on the network.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Letter: Lloyd's: relief for Names only way forward to a bright future Sir, Anyone concerned with the future of Lloyd's and the contribution it can make to the financial well-being of the country, must welcome the new business plan for its realistic appraisal of needs for the future based on far greater frankness about the mistakes of the past ('The Lloyd's business plan', April 30). The tacit or explicit admission of those mistakes, however, highlights the need to address the problem of those who are already victims of them. While losses still mount, precise figures are impossible, but it appears that the 500 or so Lime Street Names now face losses in excess of Pounds 1.196bn for the years 1988-91. This is effectively 1.8 per cent of the membership carrying nearly 24 per cent of the losses. It is perhaps inevitable that, while the battle for survival rages, attention is more closely concentrated on the conduct of the fight than on care for the desperately wounded; nevertheless, it would be immoral for future prosperity to be built on lessons learned from the mistakes of the past without the consequences of those mistakes also being put right. On practical, as well as moral, grounds, the issue cannot be ducked either; it must become increasingly clear from each further revelation that the claims of much of the litigation are well founded and, anyway, most of the Lime Street losses (averaging Pounds 2.3m a Name) could not be met even if the Names were to abandon all claims. For every reason, therefore, Lloyd's cannot expect to march forward to a bright future over the bodies of those cut down without giving them proper relief.

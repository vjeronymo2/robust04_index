Urazov (Research Institute of Epidemiology,  Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Kazakhstan Ministry of  Health, and Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Kazakhstan  Academy of Sciences); first paragraph is IZVESTIYA AKADEMII NAUK  RESPUBLIKI KAZAKHSTANA introduction; UDC  616.921.5-036.22/574,51-201]    [Text]The influenza epidemics in Alma-Ata in 1985-1990 are  characterized according to age groups. It was shown that two of  the six epidemics were caused by serotype B influenza viruses  and four, by influenza A virus.    Influenza and ORZ [acute respiratory diseases] strike  primarily the child population. For this reason, it is  imperative to improve registration of incidence of ORVI [acute  respiratory viral infection] in children. The lack of such  registration makes it difficult to pinpoint promptly the start  of a flu epidemic due to their small share of the overall  population. For this reason, we kept a differentiated record of  incidence of influenza and ORZ in different age groups during  the flue epidemic in Alma-Ata in 1985-1990.    In 1985, an epidemic rise in incidence of influenza among  children began in the 46th week of the year (11-17 November) in  the 3-6 year age group. The following week (18-24 November) the  epidemic threshold was exceeded by morbidity among  schoolchildren 7-14 years old with a high rate of rise (to 40.3  percent). The epidemic flu outbreak among children was  characterized by low intensity, and it lasted for 6 weeks. In  this period, morbidity constituted 5.2 percent for children in  the 3-6 year age group, and 1.9 percent for children 7-14 years  old, which was not appreciably reflected in the incidence of  influenza in the adult population (Table 1).

Within the epidemic period a total of 80 nasopharyngeal  washings and 71 paired serum samples from patients with the  diagnosis of influenza and acute respiratory disease were  examined. Two strains of influenza virus were isolated from  material from a sick 3-year old child and 59-year adult;  identification with prototype sera revealed that they were of  the sero-subtype A(H1N1) influenza virus. Immunological analysis  carried out with a large set of immune rat serum samples  revealed that they were closely related to the drift variant  A/Chile/1/83 (H1N1). HIT [hemagglutination inhibition tests] on  paired patient serum samples revealed an increase in titers of  antibodies to influenza virus A(H1N1) in 14.1 percent of the  cases, to virus A(H3N2) in 5.6 percent, to virus B in 7.0  percent, and mixed influenza infection in 9.9 percent. When the  tested patients were distributed in age groups, influenza was  diagnosed in 37.5 percent of the children 3-6 years old and 22.2  percent in those 7-14 years old (Table 2).    Table 2.

One week later, children 3-6 years old  were included in the epidemic process with an increment rate of  41.4 percent. However, overall incidence of influenza among the  entire population of the city remained below the epidemic  threshold at this time. This indicator exceeded its limits only  3 weeks after the start of the epidemic. The flu epidemic lasted  7 weeks, and at its peak 0.9 percent of the population was  stricken. In this period, 19.9 percent of preschool children  were involved, 12.0 percent of schoolchildren and 1.3 percent of  adults. As a result, over the entire epidemic, 4.7 percent of  the city's inhabitants had contracted influenza (see Table 1).    As a result of virological tests performed in the first  quarter of 1986, 3 strains of influenza virus B were isolated  from 182 nasopharyngeal washings from patients (see Table 2).  Two strains were isolated from children 21 months and 10 years  old, and the third from a 34-year adult. The isolated strains  were closely related according to antigenic structure of  hemagglutinin to influenza virus B/Victoria/1/85, and they were  characterized by loss of relationship to virus  B/Singapore/222/79. Serological testing of paired serum samples  from patients identified influenza B in 23.2 percent of the  cases, A(H3N2) in 7.7 percent, and A(H1N1) in 1.6 percent. Mixed  influenza infection was diagnosed in 4.1 percent. On the whole,  influenza was demonstrated in 37.1 percent of the tested  individuals. Serological testing of age groups revealed  influenza in 21.2 percent of children up to 2 years old, 10.0  percent in those 3-6 years of age, 46.6 percent of children 7-14  years old, and 42.1 percent of adults.    In the 4th quarter of 1986, epidemic influenza in Alma-Ata  was characterized by involvement of all age groups (see Table  1). Rapid rates of increase in morbidity were recorded among  schoolchildren (39.1 percent) and adults (35.1 percent). A  dramatic rise in morbidity was noted in the 2d and 3d weeks  after the start of the influenza epidemic. Peak epidemic  morbidity occurred 2 weeks after onset of the epidemic in  infants (0-2 years) and schoolchildren (7-14 years), whereas it  occurred 3 weeks after the start in children 3-6 years old and  adults. The flu epidemic lasted 6 weeks in the city. In this  time, 2.1 percent of infants to 2 years old, 10.1 percent of  3-6-year children, 10.3 percent of those 7-14 years old and 2.7  percent of the adults had been stricken with the flu. Morbidity  among children 3-14 years of age exceed that of adults by 3.8  times during this flue epidemic.    A total of 176 patients were submitted to virological  testing  in order to make laboratory identification of the etiology of  influenza during the epidemic. We isolated three strains of  influenza virus A(H1N1) from children and one identical strain  from an adult. According to antigenic structure of  hemagglutinin, the epidemic viruses were closely related to the  drift variant A/Taiwan/1/86 (H1N1). The hemagglutination  neutralization test with antibody erythrocyte diagnosticum to  strain A/Taiwan/1/86 showed that isolates interacted to a full  homologous titer (1:5120), with A/Prague/1/84 to one-half titer,  and to A/USSR/090/77 to one-eighth titer. Serologically,  influenza A(H1N1) was demonstrated in 20.3 percent of those  tested and mixed influenza infection was found in 3.2 percent.  On the whole, influenza was diagnosed in 29.7 percent of the  tested cases.    Thus, in the first and fourth quarters of 1986, there were 2  flu epidemics in Alma-Ata, which were caused by serotype B and  sero-subtype A(H1N1) influenza viruses. The distinction of these  epidemics was predominant involvement of preschool and school  age children.    In the winter-spring period of 1987-1988, epidemic influenza  morbidity in Alma-Ata had a two-wave course, and was  characterized by dissimilar involvement of inhabitants in  different age groups. At the start, in the 50th week of 1987  (7-13 December), the epidemic threshold was exceeded by  schoolchildren, and after 3 weeks preschool children were  involved in the epidemic process. Among younger children, the  epidemic lasted 5 weeks, and in this time 6.7 percent of the  children up to 2 years old and 8.8 percent of those 3-6 years of  age were stricken. The epidemic had a continuous pattern in  children 7-14 years of age, and 15.6 percent of them were  stricken. The distinction of this epidemic was the fact that the  adult population of the city was virtually uninvolved in the  epidemic process. On the whole, 2.5 percent of the inhabitants  of Alma-Ata were stricken with influenza during the epidemic.    In the first wave of rise in incidence of influenza  (December  1987), we examined 159 nasopharyngeal washings from patients and  isolated 2 strains of influenza virus B. HIT of 89 paired serum  samples from stricken individuals revealed influenza B in 8.8  percent of the cases, A(H1N1) in 3.5 percent, and A(H3N) in 2.2  percent. In 10 percent of the cases, we diagnosed influenza  infection of mixed etiology. During the period of the second  rise in incidence of influenza (1st quarter of 1988), 22 strains  of the virus sero-subtype A(H3N2) were isolated from material  taken from 414 patients. The strains were characterized by  marked antigenic heterogeneity. One strain showed great  resemblance to the standard A/Si-Chwan/2/87, others to  A/Mississippi/1/85, and others yet to A/Philippines/2/82. HIT of  181 paired serum samples of patients demonstrated diagnostic  rise in antibody titer to virus A(H3N2) in 18.2 percent of the  cases, to A(H1N1) in 2.2 percent, and to B in 3.3 percent. In  March, testing of 69 pairs of blood serum samples revealed an  increase to 17.4 percent in seroconversions to influenza B  virus. During the period of epidemic rise in influenza,  serologically we established microcirculation of relic strains  of influenza A(H2N2) virus and A(H0N1) to 4.0 percent, as well  as active circulation of other groups of respiratory viruses:  parainfluenza, RS virus, and adenovirus, the share of which  ranged from 16.0 to 23.0 percent.    In 1989, the epidemic rise in incidence of influenza in  Alma-Ata started among 4-14-year school children in the 4th week  of the year (16-22 January). Two weeks later, the flu epidemic  struck preschool children 3-6 years of age and adults. The  epidemic lasted in the city for 7 weeks, and in this period 12.8  percent of the children 3-6 years old were stricken, 17.3  percent of those 7-14 years old and 1.1 percent of adults. On  the whole, 4.2 percent of the city's inhabitants were stricken  with the flu during the epidemic. The distinction of this  epidemic was also predominant involvement of the child  population; however, the youngest age group (0-2 years old) was  not involved in the flu epidemic process.    During the epidemic period, we examined virologically 364  samples of nasopharyngeal washings. We isolated 10  hemagglutinating agents, 6 of which were referable to influenza  A(H1N1) virus, 1 to A(H3N2), 1 to B, and 2 isolates were a  mixture of serovariants A(H1N1) and A(HSW1N1). Strains of  A(H1N1) showed antigenic resemblance to standard viruses  A/Prague/1/84 and A/Taiwan/1/86, and were neutralized by immune  sera to these viruses to a full and half homologous titer,  respectively. HIT of 151 paired serum samples from patients  revealed diagnostic increase in titers of antigens to A(H1N1) in  8.0 percent of the cases, to B in 11.2 percent, to A(H3N2) in  2.0 percent, and mixed influenza infection was found in 4.6  percent.    In January 1990, there was a new epidemic rise in influenza  in Alma-Ata. Unlike the preceding epidemics, it began among the  adult population in the 2d week of the year (8-14 January), and  a week later children became involved in the epidemic. Maximum  incidence of influenza was recorded only 3 weeks after the start  of the epidemic, when 2.5 percent of the inhabitants were  involved. On the whole, the epidemic lasted in the city for 6  weeks, and 4.7 percent of the inhabitants were stricken. Also,  in the period of the epidemic, 1.5 percent of children up to 2  years old, 11.4 percent of those 3-6 years old, 12.9 percent of  those 7-14 years of age and 2.4 percent of adults were stricken  with the flu. These findings indicate that in this epidemic too,  morbidity among preschool and schoolchildren exceeded that of  adults by 5.5 times (see Table 1).    Virological examination of 293 samples of nasopharyngeal  washings in the 1st quarter of 1990 resulted in isolation of 8  strains of influenza A(H3N2) virus, 4 of which were isolated  form children up to 14 years of age and the other 4, from  adults. The etiology of the epidemic was confirmed by  serological testing of 182 paired blood serum samples from  patients with the flu. Thus, influenza A(H3N2) was documented in  28.6 percent of the tested individuals.    Thus, in 1985-1990, there were 6 recorded influenza  epidemics  in Alma-Ata, 2 of which were caused by influenza virus serotype  B (1986, 1987) and the other 4, by influenza A virus. In  particular, there was prevalence among the public of strains of  variants of A(H1N1) in 1985, 1986 and 1989, and of influenza  A(H3N2) virus in 1988 and 1990.</p>

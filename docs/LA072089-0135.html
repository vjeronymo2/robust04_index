			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MULTIMEDIA 'NEVSKY': RUSSIAN CLASSIC GOES HIGH-TECH  </P> <P> High technology continues to find new application in the arts. Ten years ago,  the idea of synchronizing a live performance of Prokofiev's carefully written  music with a screening of Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 film masterpiece "Alexander  Nevsky" would have seemed an eccentric pipe dream.  </P> <P> Yet tonight at Hollywood Bowl, the Eisenstein-Prokofiev collaboration will be  presented just that way with Yuri Temirkanov conducting the Los Angeles  Philharmonic and Master Chorale. In addition, a sound track of Russian  dialogue, charging horses and clashing swords is supposed to be synchronized  with the film and music, as well as English subtitles.  </P> <P> Despite all the technical wizardry and previous success with the event, many  fingers are crossed because of the unique outdoor environment at the Bowl.  </P> <P> "The hardest part is the straitjacket of synchronizing the music with the  film," said Christine Cairns (pronounced with a long a) in the lobby of her  Hollywood hotel. The 30-year-old Scottish mezzo-soprano will sing the solo song  that occurs toward the end of the movie in the presentation tonight.  </P> <P> "We have to make sure everything fits and that sometimes prevents us from using  rubato or taking liberty with the tempos," she said. "If the music gets a  little bit behind the picture, we have to speed up and if we go ahead, we have  to slow down."  </P> <P> Cairns has sung the solo part of this version of "Alexander Nevsky" at every  performance since it was premiered in October of 1987 by the Los Angeles  Philharmonic under the baton of Andre Previn. That success led to several  subsequent presentations of the multimedia event in other cities with other  orchestras.  </P> <P> "But I get a little emotional when I am here in Los Angeles because this is  where it all started for me," she said. "John Currie (director of the Los  Angeles Master Chorale) first introduced me to Previn and suggested me for the  'Alexander Nevsky' solo when they were doing a concert version of the 'Nevsky'  cantata in 1986 and later, a recording. It was the first real break in my  career."  </P> <P> Cairns first met Temirkanov when she performed the work with him in  Philadelphia. Their collaboration there met with great critical success, one  critic describing it as a "pulsating, supercharged account of the score."  Another critic pointed out that Temirkanov "fit the playing so skillfully to  the pace of the film that the matter of synchronization did not loom, even  momentarily, as a hazard of performance."  </P> <P> Other performances in Cleveland with conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy tested the  waters for outdoor performances, adding a certain drive-in-movie-like  atmosphere to the event. If all goes well, Cairns plans to travel to London and  Pompeii with the production.  </P> <P> She is especially careful not to express favoritism for one conductor over the  other, but did mention that Previn's preliminary work on the score before the  1987 performance laid out the necessary groundwork for the other conductors.  </P> <P> "Previn's work as a film composer and conductor for so many years obviously  gave him insight into the process of putting something like this together," she  said. "But in addition to his film expertise, his interpretation of Prokofiev  is simply magical.  </P> <P> "The advantage that the Russian conductors (Temirkanov and Ashkenazy) have is  that they understand the dialogue and can therefore follow the movie better,"  said Cairns, who does not speak Russian. She learned her part phonetically and  now performs it from memory.  </P> <P> "Temirkanov's interpretation is also wonderful," she added carefully.  </P> <P> Another steadfast devotee to this project is producer John Goberman, who worked  on the original Los Angeles premiere as well as the performances in  Philadelphia and Cleveland.  </P> <P> "This has never been done before -- not like this," said Goberman. "There are  live scores performed to silent pictures all the time, but none like this with  a sound movie and great music like Prokofiev's."  </P> <P> Goberman explains that a four-track magnetic recording is used. Two of the  tracks are used for the dialogue and sound effects. Another track operates  slide machines which flash English subtitles below the screen, translating the  rapidly moving Russian dialogue. The final track operates a special clock  mounted to the conductor's music stand. A computer program controls these  various functions.  </P> <P> Prokofiev's re-orchestrated Cantata was used with supplemental orchestrations  and sequences added by William Brohn. The sound effects on the original sound  track were also enhanced.  </P> <P> "The necessity of this project rests on the special collaboration between  Eisenstein and Prokofiev," said Goberman. "It wasn't just a matter of Prokofiev  scoring the movie. Some parts of the film were made to follow Prokofiev's music  as well.  </P> <P> "Originally the sound track was very garbled, poorly recorded. That's why we  need to use a set-up like this to experience the work as it was originally  imagined."  </P></p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: 102% pay rise for electricity chairman MR JOHN HARRIS, chairman of East Midlands Electricity, the regional electricity company privatised two years ago, was awarded a 102 per cent pay increase last year. The rise, disclosed in the annual report published yesterday, lifted Mr Harris's remuneration from Pounds 114,476 to Pounds 230,969 for the year to March 1992. The increase is likely to reawaken the row over salaries in the privatised electricity industry. Prof Basil Weedeon, chairman of the East Midlands Electricity Consumers Committee, said: 'I am sure that the general public will be greatly concerned by such a massive pay increase at a time of recession.' The chairmen and chief executives of the 12 regional electricity companies were castigated by Labour politicians at this time last year, when they increased their salaries by as much as 200 per cent. Most were earning between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 70,000 before privatisation and between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000 a year later.</p>

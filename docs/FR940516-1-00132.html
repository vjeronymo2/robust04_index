			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 22. The Commission seeks comment on how to determine which type of provider should be considered ``small'' for purposes of further forbearance. The Commission asks interested parties to comment on whether any one or any combination of the options advanced below should be applied. Parties are invited to identify alternatives and to comment on how the Commission could draw on its experience in identifying small carriers in other contexts,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the exemption to the cable-telco cross-ownership rule. Finally, the Notice asks interested parties to provide their views on how the Commission might best implement and enforce any classification scheme. The Notice seeks comment on the advantages and disadvantages of the various options with respect to implementation by both the Commission and licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Measurement Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23. One possible standard for size of business operation is the Small Business Administration (SBA) definition of small entity: an entity with a net worth not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million. The Commission relied on this standard to define small businesses entitled to preferences under the spectrum auction rules. The Commission believes that these criteria are appropriate for identifying entities entitled to preferred entry into new business ventures, as in the spectrum auction context. The Commission tentatively finds, however, that this standard is too generous for purposes of determining which CMRS providers are entitled to relief from remaining title II obligations, many of which, as discussed above, are designed to protect consumers. The Notice thus asks whether the Commission should employ a more modest income and net worth standard. Those commenters that nevertheless advocate use of this approach should discuss how it would affect the different services comprising CMRS, providing as much data as possible on the number of providers in a particular service that would be eligible for further forbearance under this definition, and how it would affect consumer protection. The Commission might also measure size and scope by a number of objective factors, such as average revenues per subscriber or percentage of interconnected traffic, average number of customers or for part 90 licensees, number of mobile units, or average subscriber rate. Interested parties should provide data to demonstrate whether providers within their suggested definition would find the costs of complying with the title II regulatory obligations burdensome and how their recommended definition comports with the statutory factors set forth in section 332(c) governing forbearance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. The Commission also seeks comment on how, if standards applicable to individual providers are established, it should treat affiliated corporations or operators of systems in more than one geographic area or providers who own multiple small systems. In addition, the Notice seeks comment on whether the Commission should attribute ownership of systems that are operated pursuant to an exclusive management contract, and thus not forbear when management contracts are in force. Further, it seeks comment on the impact, if any, of industry mergers on application of a size standard. Should a small system's affiliation with a corporation that would yield greater vertical integration disqualify that system from further forbearance? Would a small mobile system necessarily enjoy benefits of scale and scope from an affiliation with, for example, a long distance provider? If so, would such a provider be ineligible for further forbearance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. Number of channels would provide an administratively straightforward means of identifying small CMRS entities. The Commission thus asks for comment on whether number of channels is a workable and rational approach to measuring size of CMRS licensees. Commenters should specify specific types of CMRS providers licensed under parts 22 and 90 of the Commission's Rules, and suggest numbers of channels that would identify small providers in each mobile radio service. In responding to these questions, commenters should consider the likelihood that channels can be aggregated to form systems that would no longer be operated by a small provider, and how transition to a different level of forbearance would be effectuated. Commenters should also address how licensees conforming to this approach would be affected by the remaining title II obligations discussed above, and whether their users or competitors would be adversely affected by further forbearance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. The character of a provider's customer base,_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> whether its customers subscribe to the service to meet their business communications requirements, or whether customers are primarily consumers with a personal need for mobile communications service_may be another possible factor to consider in determining whether to undertake further forbearance. To the extent that certain types of CMRS providers predominantly serve business customers._such as traditional SMR and business radio service,_rather than individual customers, such business customers may have relatively greater bargaining power and information concerning their telecommunications options. In addition, the Commission asks whether it should also distinguish between large and medium-sized and small business customers, on the assumption that small businesses may be more like individual consumers in their bargaining power over telecommunications services. The Commission accordingly seeks comment on (1) whether to apply an analysis of a CMRS provider's customer base and (2) what factors might contribute to this analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Case-by-Case Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 27. The Commission might also extend further forbearance to particular CMRS providers on a case-by-case basis. Under this approach, providers desiring further forbearance from the remaining provisions of title II that continue to apply could petition the Commission to forbear in individual circumstances. To qualify for further forbearance, petitioners would have to demonstrate that they meet the statutory test for forbearance, as implemented by the rules and policies established in this proceeding. The Notice seeks comment on this approach, which is consistent with the Commission's previous conclusion that the degree of forbearance adopted in the Second Report and Order should not be unduly burdensome for the vast majority of CMRS providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

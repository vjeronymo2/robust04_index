			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESEDA EXTENSION TO MULHOLLAND DRIVE  </P> <P> Reseda does not want Reseda Boulevard connected to Mulholland Drive.  </P> <P> It wants to keep commuter traffic out, and it fears that the unpaved portion of  Mulholland will eventually be paved, succumbing to ever-increasing traffic  pressure.  </P> <P> Encino wants Reseda Boulevard paved to alleviate its own horrendous  cross-mountain traffic and demands that Reseda share the burden of city  traffic.  </P> <P> Our Hollywood Hills community is fighting the proposed Mulholland Plan as it  will attract a projected 5,000 tourists' cars every day in addition to the  90,000 that cross at Laurel, Coldwater and Beverly Glen canyons.  </P> <P> Yet all three communities want the mountains to remain scenic, rural and free  of traffic.  </P> <P> The planners address the problem piecemeal, shifting the problem from the  loudest to the more laid-back communities under pressure from the politicians  who seek slogans for their campaigns with good-sounding "solutions" for the  naive.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Mountains are in desperate need of a comprehensive, regional  traffic plan with imaginative and real solutions.  </P> <P> Now that communities are fighting each other for environmental quality as if it  were food in days of hunger, people may finally realize that times are  desperate.  </P> <P> We are heading toward irreversible disaster unless the politicians and planners  can show us the leadership and visionary planning.  </P> <P> GEORGE CALOYANNIDIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Caloyannidis is president of Hands Off Mulholland, a community organization.  </P></p>

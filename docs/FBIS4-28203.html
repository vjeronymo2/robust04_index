			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ouk Kimseng: "Media Crisis Leads to </F> Instability"]    [Text] Phnom Penh -- Freedom of journalism does not mean  exclusive right or privilege to distort and slander as this  usually causes chaos.    "The nation needs political stability for national  development and rehabilitation through non-violence and national  reconciliation" said Ieng Muly, minister of Information, at his  audience with the common people last week. "As such, the Royal  Government requires support and assistance from the entire  people including the journalists," he added.    Since the advent of real democracy after the formation of  the  Royal Government, the nation has more than 30 print and  electronic media, most of which are newspapers.    The Khmer language newspapers especially, have been strongly  attacking the corrupted government officials and in the meantime  they have denounced each other on charges of supporting the  corrupted or being one-sided.    The battle of criticism against the so-called corrupted  appears in most columns of their traditional four-page  newspapers.    Stories of corruption usually look several years back when  the country was in the middle of the nightmare of war.    Ieng Muli demanded the media carefully consider all sources  and angles taken of a comment or story to be analysed.    Criticising the King is very sensitive to a minister who  said: "Only with King Norodom Sihanouk can peace and national  reconciliation be achieved."    Most politicians have begged journalists to be patient for  sometime until the fragile ship of this nation successfully  reaches the shore of real peace.    Dr. Barnett Baron, deputy director of Asia Foundation on his  recent visit here, said: "Journalistic professionalism must be  linked to responsibility in order to ensure accuracy, truth of  news reports."    He was surprised with the growing number of print and  electronic media which are on similar missions to build up and  promote free democracy here.    "San Francisco, where I am from, counts only three newspaper  organizations, while in New York there are five including the  New York Times, the national newspaper," Barnett said.    So far, two newspapers have been attacked by certain circles  in the government.    Editor of Damnoeng Pelproek or Morning News was detained for  48 hours on charges of ignoring court warrants with regard to a  clarification about a news report denouncing an official accused  of being corrupted.    Circulation of the 15th issue of Sakol or "Universal" was  interrupted and stopped for its news reports attacking King  Norodom Sihanouk.    The two newspapers are now operating their businesses as  usual.</p>

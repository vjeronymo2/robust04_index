			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / The Long View: Gold bug bites again THE PENETRATING voice was unmistakeable, the glint in the eyes undimmed. There was no escaping from the coffee lounge as he advanced. It was Fringe Freddie, doubtless promoting yet another esoteric investment theme. Was it my imagination, I wondered, or did the gold bracelet seem a little clunkier this time. Occasionally, I make the error of attending an investment seminar which is, shall I say, just outside the mainstream. It is not, you understand, that I really believe in Japanese candlestick charts, Professor Wheeler's 1000-year drought rhythm, or even the triple conjunction of the Kondratieff, Juglar and Kuznets cycles; but surely it does no harm to keep an open mind. The last time I ran into Freddie at one of these gatherings, he was heavily into the prophecies of Nostradamus. The International Harry Shultz Letter had admitted that its forecast of a disastrous Californian earthquake for May 8 1992 had been based upon a wrong interpretation of the mystic, but the event definitely was scheduled for May 8 1993 instead. This week, pointing out rudely that San Francisco seemed still to be there, I challenged Freddie over falling for yet another failed prediction; but, as usual, he had forgotten all about his past mistakes. He had been infected once more by the oldest fever of all, the gold bug. They were trying desperately to keep a lid on the gold price, he said, but it was hopeless. 'They,' I gathered, were the central banks, such as the one in Holland which dumped 400 tonnes at the end of last year at a price which certainly does not look too clever now the gold price is up 12 per cent from its low. Clearly, I was not going to escape without hearing about a global conspiracy. Did I not know this was the most fiscally irresponsible period in history? ranted Freddie. The Americans were running a deficit of 5 per cent of GDP and, despite the smokescreen of tax proposals, their national debt could reach 80 per cent of GDP soon. Already, net interest payments were at 15 per cent of federal spending and would soon spiral right out of control. Europe was just as bad, and the ERM finally was collapsing. Germany's public sector deficit was 8 per cent of GPD, the UK's ditto and even France, previously financially prudent, was heading the same way, having budgeted for a deficit of 4.5 per cent last Monday. The Japanese had been leant-on by the Americans to launch their own state spending binge. Just a minute, I protested: surely this could all be financed properly through the bond markets. With a recession on, there was no shortage of finance. Long-term interest rates had actually been falling around the world, at least until a few weeks ago. Of course, governments would need to raise taxes and cut their spending when the recovery began . . . Freddie began positively jingling with excitement (the reason, I noticed, being that he was actually wearing two gold bracelets). Britain's Newbury by-election showed just what happened to governments that raised taxes, he said. As for long-term interest rates, had I really failed totally to notice what the Americans were doing? They were cutting their sales of long bonds and shunting even more short-term debt into the banking system. By keeping deposit rates very low, the Federal Reserve was inducing the banks to hold vast quantities of short-term bonds on which they could make an easy profit - much more easily than by lending to real businesses that generated actual economic wealth. But a monumental re-financing problem was piling up for a few years out. Moreover, the low money market rates were undermining the dollar and helping to fuel inflation, which had started to go up again. It was true, I admitted, that the performance of the dollar had been disappointing this year. Meanwhile, the yen was looking wildly over-priced on fundamentals, sterling was dogged by a massive balance of payments problem, and the European continental currencies were threatened by tumbling German short-term interest rates. It was hard to see where to put your money. Precisely, said Freddie. We should get out of paper currencies altogether and into gold, which the politicians could not debauch. Even the equity markets were looking dangerous. The new record net inflow of Dollars 28.5bn into US equity mutual funds in the first quarter of 1993 was a classic contrarian signal. In the UK, there was a corresponding surge of Pounds 1.8bn into unit trusts, beating even the Pounds 1.7bn for the first quarter of 1987. Professionals were getting out and amateurs were getting in. I attempted to regain control of the conversation. It was true, I said, that the fall in real interest rates had cut the cost of owning gold. Also, surging demand from China had helped world bullion sales to jump nearly 25 per cent in the first quarter, year-on-year. But that was at very low price levels and, even at this week's prices, you were showing a total loss since 1980 of 57 per cent in dollars and 80 per cent in yen. Take into account the opportunity cost of interest foregone, plus the actual cost of storage and insurance, and gold would have lost you more than 90 per cent of your wealth. Freddie was jingling again. I talked, he said, like a blinkered bank manager, the sort who would be one of the very last holders of US Treasury bonds, too busy looking at the juicy yield spread to notice the coming default (just like at Olympia &amp; York). Governments were desperate to suppress the gold price bubble because it would focus attention on rickety banking systems and unsustainable fiscal deficits. But we were approaching the point of no return. With relief, I saw that a session on Fibonacci ratios was about to begin. But later, funnily enough, I felt quite glad I had run into Freddie. I might have heard the story from somebody else and taken it seriously.</p>

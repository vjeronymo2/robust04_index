			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORLY THING TO DO? SHOW A LITTLE HEART AND SOUL  </P> <P> Now I've heard everything! What happened to compassion and caring about one's  fellow men? No wonder this couple do not want their names used -- a human life  is not as important as the value of a home? If this couple don't have anything  else to do besides checking on what their neighbors are doing, give them a  cause. God knows, there are plenty of them to zero in on.  </P> <P> LOUISE OKEY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Guinness trial juror defends role of juries THE LEADER of the jury in the second Guinness trial, which collapsed recently, has rebutted widespread claims that the trial was too complicated for juries to understand. Mrs Edna Wijeratna, in an unusual public statement on the growing debate over the handling of complicated City trials, blames the length of the trial on the decision by Mr Roger Seelig, one of the defendants, to conduct his own case. She also reports that members of the jury wondered whether 'the consideration extended to Mr Seelig would have been forthcoming for a defendant in humbler circumstances'. The government is considering urgent reforms to English fraud law following the conclusion of a number of big City trials, including the Blue Arrow case, which cost an estimated Pounds 35m, the second Guiness trial and Barlow Clowes. Mrs Wijeratna's views are set out in a letter to the Financial Times. In it she asserts the jury had no undue difficulty in understanding the details of the case, contrary to the view of many legal experts. 'Members of the legal profession have a way of writing about juries as if it were universally recognised that they are composed of people vastly inferior in understanding to their august selves. 'This seems to bear no relation to reality, at least as far as Guinness II is concerned.' Mrs Wijeratna says it is unusual for a jury member to comment publicly about a case. But she was aware that people were arguing that it would be better to take fraud trials out of criminal law altogether. She writes: 'Surely the legal profession will have failed society if a thief ceases to be considered a thief, or a cheat a cheat, provided he operates with sufficient sophistication.' Mrs Wijeratna says the jury's main frustration was not with the complexity of the 4 1/2 -month trial, but with the slow rate of progress caused by the decision of one of the defendants, Mr Seelig, to conduct his own defence. The judge ended the trial on February 11 after psychiatrists reported that Mr Seelig was suffering from severe mental, physical and emotional strain. Letter, Page 15</p>

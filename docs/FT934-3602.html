			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Leading Article: A settlement at Lloyd's The wrangle at Lloyd's long ago ceased being an issue of fairness and became one of cold practicality. How much damage could lawsuits from Names caught up in the spiral of losses in the late 1980s do to the institution as a whole? How much was it worth to the rest of Lloyd's to buy them off? Yesterday's offer, of compensation worth some Pounds 900m, is an example of that chilly calculus at work. It is heavily skewed towards those Names with the strongest legal case and the greatest demonstrated determination to pursue it. On average, it amounts to just under a third of the total compensation claimed by the lossmaking Names to whom it is being made. But those with the strongest cases - members of action groups, heavily exposed to the 'spiral' of reinsurance, perhaps in syndicates managed by Gooda Walker - can expect average compensation of up to about 40 per cent of their losses. If they accept. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the proposed settlement, apart from its sheer complexity, is the way it will force each potential litigant to assess individually whether or not to accept the offer. Lloyd's new managers - Mr David Rowland, chairman and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive - have promised that the offer will go ahead only if it receives acceptance from a substantial majority of the 21,000 Names eligible for it. Despite the immediate hostile reaction of the Names' action groups, that is an open question. Finely balanced For some people, bankrupt two or three times over, entitled only to the lower end of the settlement's compensation scale, the question is a simple one: there is nothing to be gained from such modest terms. The offer 'leaves ruined Names ruined', as the leader of one action group put it yesterday. For others, particularly 'working' Names with limited exposure, earning a steady flow of income from the market, the issue is equally clear cut the other way. For most, though, the question is finely balanced. They must weigh the individual offer they will be receiving in the next few days against the chances of success in continued legal action. How much of their potential recoveries from such lawsuits will be gobbled up in lawyers' fees? How much of any award that a court makes will ever turn up in hard cash, paid not by now bankrupt Lloyd's agents but from the limited sums available from their errors and omissions insurers? For anyone contemplating such a difficult decision, the question would be simpler if Lloyd's could promise finality, the confidence that the nightmare was at last over. Alas, that is not what the settlement offers. It covers only current claims for the years up to - and in some cases including - 1990. Claims still to come in - especially the potentially devastating 'long-tail' claims over environmental and other damage in the United States  -are not included. Nor are losses in respect of later years, some of which will also be bad. Reinsurance vehicle Lloyd's is working on a device to provide the finality that the battered Names so desperately seek: a reinsurance vehicle which will shoulder the claims of the past and allow Names to escape from them once and for all. Even assuming that it works, however, it will come into existence only in 1996 - and it will probably require Names to make a further yet-to-be-specified contribution. The settlement proposed yesterday is thus an intermediate step, buying time from the point of view of Lloyd's new managers, providing some partial compensation from the point of view of the Names affected. It does not offer one thing the Names have sought: a sense of moral vindication, a recognition that they are innocents in a system that was at best mismanaged, at worst a scandal. For some people, especially those lured into Lloyd's by ties of family or friendship rather than investment decision, that will be enough to make it unacceptable. That such flawed judgments were common in the 1980s boom is a sad reflection on the market's leaders of the time. It is not, however, a reason to reject the proposed settlement. Names would be best advised to judge it in the light of a prudent, rational calculation of their own interests. If that is not enough to deliver the acceptance necessary, so much the worse for Lloyd's.</p>

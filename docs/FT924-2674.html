			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Technology: Banknotes that leap out at you Central banks are always trying to keep a step ahead of banknote counterfeiters by weaving metal strips into notes or cotton threads soaked in ultraviolet dye, and by the traditional - and most reliable - defence of watermark paper. But, from Austria to Australia, holograms or their sister-product, kinegrams, are beginning to make an appearance on banknotes, and could become more common if current efforts to overcome technical problems are successful. According to Stanley Kreitman, president of US Banknote, holograms have two advantages when used on banknotes. First, they are simply another anti-counterfeiting technique to make the forger's job harder. Second, they prevent the increasingly prevalent method of counterfeiting by colour-copier  -holograms are 3D, while a copier works in only one dimension. One of the first uses of a hologram on a banknote was in Australia, on the bicentennial Dollars 10 note. In Austria, the national bank began issuing a Sch5,000 note in 1990 using a stamp-sized kinegram in the shape of Mozart's head. The kinegram, developed by Switzerland's Landis &amp; Gyr Communications, changes position from left to right with movement of the note. Switzerland plans to use it in what will be the world's first full series of banknotes with kinegrams, now in development and due for issue in three or four years' time. Holograms and kinegrams are stamped on to the notes with a hot press. But while the holograms can be produced economically, says Kreitman, applying it to the note in exactly the same spot is difficult. US Banknote is experimenting with holograms in two ways: it is trying to put a true holographic strip in the note - current efforts do not give a 3D look; and it is working with one of the world's biggest chemical groups on a way of printing the hologram on the note as it is being produced. 'We're not too far away,' says Kreitman. Achieving this could well overcome the US Treasury's anxieties about wear and tear on the hologram when applied via hot stamping. But it is a bit too early to predict when the mighty greenback will bear a hologram, or who or what might appear on it.</p>

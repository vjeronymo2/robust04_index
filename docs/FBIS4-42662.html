			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today briefed  President Konstandinos Karamanlis on foreign policy issues,  particularly the progress of our national issues, as well as on  the results of his recent visit to Moscow. After the meeting,  Papoulias told correspondents that the president has a personal  interest in the issues they discussed.    Furthermore, Papoulias said the latest scenarios about a  double or triple name for Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM] are not realistic. He added that the  Greek side does not have any particular expectations from the  visit of U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz. The U.S.  President's special envoy, Papoulias said, came to Greece to  sound out the Greek Government and relay its views on the  national issue to Skopje. On Nimetz's visit, Papoulias said:  When there is a negotiation on some ideas, there should be an  effort by the negotiators. This is logical. If this effort  were at a standstill, then Nimetz would not have come to Athens.    Papoulias concluded by saying that he will be holding a news  conference after his meeting with Nimetz to provide more details  on the issue.</p>

It has also been decided to  form an organizing committee to collect the necessary signatures  to nominate Stanislav Shushkevich as candidate for Belarusian  president. The forming of the committee is expected to be  completed by the end of this week. Not a single member of  Spring-94 attending the session of the organizing committee,  opposed Stanislav Shushkevich's candidacy. As of 22 March, the  Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly, the United Democratic  Party, the Confederation of Labor, and the Independent Trade  Union have pledged support for Shushkevich. The National  Movement for Territorial Self-Rule and the Belarusian  Entrepreneurs' Association are ready to support Stanislav  Shushkevich, along with other democratic candidates.    Viktar Ivashkevich, secretary of the Belarusian Popular  Front  Headquarters, who was a guest at the session, spoke in favor of  civilized cooperation within the framework of the democratic  movement, and for correct behavior during the collection of  signatures and the election campaign. Coordinating committee  members agreed that these conditions should characterize the  election campaigns of democratic organizations.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THRIFTS;  </P> <P> AMENDMENTS HAMPER S&amp;L BAILOUT BILL  </P> <P> House members have flooded the Rules Committee with more than 100 proposed  amendments to savings and loan bailout legislation, dimming the chances of  floor action this week.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, which announced its S&amp;L proposal on Feb. 6 and  challenged Congress to act within 45 days, has shown increasing impatience with  the pace of action in the House.  </P> <P> The Rules Committee, chaired by Rep. Joe Moakley of Massachusetts, the ranking  Democrat after the death last week of former chairman Claude Pepper, is  scheduled to consider the S&amp;L legislation today. It will decide which  amendments will be considered by the full House when it takes up S&amp;L  legislation written by the Banking, Judiciary and Ways and Means panels.  </P> <P> House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, (D-Wash.), told Moakley last week that he  wants the Rules panel to finish work today so the House can take up the bill on  Wednesday.  </P> <P> However, nearly 50 House members have asked to speak to the Rules Committee and  the panel must wade through more than 109 amendments, a difficult task to  complete in one day.  </P> <P> If the Rules Committee finished work Wednesday, the full House could begin  debate on Thursday, but the chamber is out of session on Friday, so any vote  likely would be delayed until next week.  </P> <P> "The Senate passed this thing on April 19 and the losses (in S&amp;Ls) have  grown by over $500 million since that date," said Assistant Treasury Secretary  David W. Mullins.  </P> <P> The industry "is just hemorrhaging out there and every day they delay passage  costs at least $10 million," he said.  </P> <P> More than half a dozen of the amendments under consideration would weaken what  the Administration considers the key change in the bill -- a requirement that  S&amp;L owners invest at least $3 in tangible or "real money" capital for every  $100 in lending. A high capital level acts as a buffer, absorbing losses before  federal deposit insurance kicks in.  </P> <P> Rep. Frank Annunzio, (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Banking Subcommittee on  Financial Institutions, had planned to offer an amendment that would allow  regulators, at their discretion, to count "supervisory goodwill" as tangible  capital, but pulled back after the Administration decided to oppose it.  </P> <P> Supervisory goodwill is an accounting break offered by regulators in the early  1980s to institutions that took ailing S&amp;Ls off the government's hands.  </P> <P> Annunzio argued that it is unfair to penalize S&amp;Ls who took the accounting  break at the government's urging. However, the Administration argues that it is  unfair to taxpayers to allow the institutions with supervisory goodwill to  operate with none of their owners' money at risk.  </P> <P> Annunzio and other House members from Illinois, including Republican Leader  Robert Michel, met with Treasury and White House officials last Thursday in  attempt to secure the Administration's support for their compromise amendment.  However, Mullins said the proposal "is simply not acceptable to us."  </P> <P> As an alternate, Annunzio will back an amendment by Rep. Henry Hyde, (R-Ill.),  that would permit institutions with goodwill to use administrative appeals to  delay the imposition of tougher capital rules for up to 18 months.  </P> <P> Other proposed amendments would reopen virtually every major battle already  fought in the committees that wrote the bill.  </P> <P> Several amendments would delete provisions designed to help provide housing to  poor people. Others would weaken the requirement that the S&amp;L industry  contribute $300 million a year to pay interest on government bailout borrowing.  </P></p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Leading Article: End game in the Gatt OCTOBER IS likely to determine whether the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations will be completed by the multilaterally agreed deadline of December 15. During this month the outlines of a total deal on market access needs to be completed if the timetable set out by the Gatt's director-general, Mr Peter Sutherland, is to be met. This is achievable - and must be achieved. In deciding what to do, leaders of the few countries with a decisive say in the outcome should ask themselves three simple questions. Whether or not they accept the World Bank's estimate that success might raise world income by Dollars 213bn in 2002, do they doubt that the world economy would be in a healthier state with a successful round than without it? Do they deny that relations, particularly among the main economic powers, would rest on a more solid foundation if there were a credible trading system than if there were not? Do they doubt that the issues which divide them are trivial, set not only against the gains, but also against what has been agreed in the round? What then are the principal remaining issues? On market access, the most difficult ones include: US and EC demands for greater opening of the markets for financial services of developing countries and Japan, particularly in new financial products; the US demand for liberal access to the EC market for audio-visual services; demands for wider access to the US market for maritime services; demands from both the US and the Cairns group of agricultural exporters for access to the agricultural markets of the EC, Japan and the Republic of Korea; and developing country demands for lower textile tariffs, particularly in the US. French insistence Disagreements also remain over the new rules and procedures embodied in the Dunkel draft and modified, in the case of agriculture, by what was agreed at Blair House in November 1992. Mr Sutherland hopes that these issues can be dealt with in November, after conditional agreements over market access have been reached. On agriculture the EC has so far been rebuffed in trying to renegotiate, modify or reinterpret Blair House, at French insistence. The trickiest other issue may be anti-dumping, where the US demand for action against 'circumvention' of anti-dumping duties will be fiercely resisted. As for the multilateral trade organisation, many in the US loathe the name. But what it stands for, an integrated and effective dispute settlement regime, must be created at the end of the round, whatever it is to be called. These are all controversial issues. But compared with the chasm in 1986, what divides the EC and US in agriculture today is a centimetre. The US should really be able to agree to tariffs on textiles comparable to those of the EC. It should also be able to permit countries to subsidise domestic film production for cultural reasons. Hysterical opposition The biggest challenges now are those facing the US and the EC, simply because they are the most significant players. In the former, perhaps the greatest danger is spillover from the hysterical opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. The president made the great mistake of allowing opponents of Nafta to make all the running in the public debate for eight months. Now it may be too late. But if Nafta were to be voted down in congress, Mr Clinton would be gravely weakened, as would the cause of liberal trade. However ineptly trade has been handled by the administration thus far, Mr Clinton must now retrieve lost ground, by making the passing of Nafta and agreement on the Uruguay round his highest priorities over the next few months. As for the EC, its leaders need to recognise that the prime French demand in agriculture - to make the world safe for dumping of subsidised commodities - is not merely hypocritical, set against the EC's general stance on dumping, but is detested by many more countries than just the US. If refusal to accept what has been agreed at Blair House destroys the round, the EC will be universally blamed for the catastrophe. The outcome will not be a world divided into several trading blocks. It is far more likely to be one in which the EC is set against virtually everyone else.</p>

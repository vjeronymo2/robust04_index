			<p>BFN     [Text] Sources from the Cuban Attorney General's Office  have announced that conditions have been created to implement  Decree-Law 149 nationwide by means of which legal action will be  taken in cases of illegal accumulation of wealth.  Representatives from the Office of the Attorney General and the  public administration in every province will move against  hoarders by seizing their ill-gotten goods while confiscation,  which will be determined by the Finance and Prices Ministry, is  in process.    This launches a unique and vigorous endeavor that gives  continuity to the collective efforts of the revolutionary  process to preserve social discipline. Official sources have  announced that the population will be informed in a timely  manner of the fulfillment of this measure.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Gold It is tempting to see a connection between the Dollars 10 rise in the gold price in the last six weeks and the first mutterings about the inflationary consequences of recovery. Fighting inflation has taken second place to restoring growth as a priority of economic policy, not only in the US but also in the UK and in Japan. In theory that should be good for gold. The bullion market may be saying that the inflationary risk should be taken seriously. Over a slightly longer period, though, the signal is not very strong. Gold is still Dollars 20 short of its 1992 high and there are other reasons for its lustre, the latest being fresh political worries in South Africa. In the background is strong demand for jewellery use, particularly in Asia. The crisis in Russia also makes the D-Mark less attractive as a financial investment. Gold, like the Swiss franc, has increased in relative attraction as an alternative to the dollar. These factors might underpin its price without any discussion about inflation, but they are offset by the threat of sales by central banks. More striking is the trend in currencies other than the dollar. Take the commercial rand for instance. After averaging R980 an ounce last year, the price has risen to R1080, enough to make a significant impact on the margins of South African producers. As long as supply is not disrupted, mining stocks may continue to offer a better return than the metal itself.</p>

Chairman Cheng Kejie's work report was divided into two  parts, namely, "The 1993 Work Review" and "The 1994 Work Tasks."    In reviewing the 1993 work, Cheng Kejie pointed out: In  1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the  spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, people of all  nationalities in Guangxi closely adhered to the party's basic  line, further emancipated the mind, strengthened confidence, and  seized each and every opportunity to quickened the pace of  reform, opening up, and economic construction with the result  that we witnessed a regionwide economic boom, maintained  political stability, strengthened nationality solidarity, and  successfully promoted social progress. Guangxi's total  estimated gross national product for the year 1993 reached 77.3  billion yuan, up 18.7 percent over the previous year.    Cheng Kejie stated: Last year, under the leadership of the  regional CPC committee, we firmly adhered to economic  construction as the center and made every possible endeavor to  improve all types of work. First, we unfolded large-scale  discussions on building a socialist market economy, further  emancipated the mind, and successfully transformed ideological  concepts. Second, we quickened the pace of reform and made  substantial progress in many key fields. Third, we strengthened  agriculture as the foundation and comprehensively pressed ahead  with comprehensive rural economic growth with the result that  the region's total estimated agricultural output value for the  year 1993 reached 38.4 billion yuan, up 5.2 percent over the  previous year, and total estimated township and town enterprises  output value 60.1 billion yuan, up 1.15 percent over the  previous year. Fourth, we vigorously readjusted product mix in  light of market needs and brought about a high-rate industrial  growth with the result that the region's total estimated  industrial output value at and above township level for the year  1993 reached 69.6 billion yuan, up 22.6 percent over the  previous year. Fifth, we further expanded opening up to the  outside world and developed foreign economic and trade relations  by a large margin with the result that the region's foreign  trade witnessed a sustained growth with the total estimated  import and export volume standing at $1.9 billion, up 15.9  percent over the previous year. Sixth, we made more fruitful  investment in both infrastructure facilities and basic  industries with the result that the region's total estimated  social investment in fixed assets reached 23 billion yuan.  Seventh, we stepped up and improved macroeconomic regulation  and control with the result that the regional financial order  was improved and revenue increased. Eighth, we energetically  developed science, technology, and education and scored  gratifying results in developing various undertakings. Ninth,  we enlivened both urban and rural markets and improved people's  livelihood. Tenth, we firmly and simultaneously grasped two key  aspects of work with the result that we succeeded in  consolidating and developing a regionwide political situation of  stability and unity.    Speaking of the 1994 work tasks, Cheng Kejie stated in his  government work report: In 1994 we should follow such a  principle in all endeavors as comprehensively implementing the  spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress as well as the spirit  of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.  We should quicken the pace of reforms aimed at building a  socialist market economic structure, further expand opening up  to the outside world, strengthen and improve macroeconomic  regulation and control, vigorously readjust the economic  structure, maintain a sound regionwide development momentum,  energetically push the region's economic growth onto a new stage  on the basis of a sustained and rapid economic growth scored  over the past few years, create conditions for quadrupling the  region's total gross national product three years ahead of  schedule or even sooner, and constantly promote socialist  democracy and spiritual civilization building.    Speaking of the 1994 work arrangements, Cheng Kejie spelled  out the following three requirements:    1. To maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy regional  national economic growth. To this end, Cheng Kejie added, it  has been tentatively decided that the region's total gross  national product shall be raised by 12 percent, total  agricultural output value by 7 percent, total industrial output  value at and above township level by 15 percent, and total grain  output by 1 percent on the basis of last year's figures.  Moreover, efforts shall be made to secure a continued  development for all trades and professions in the region. To  attain these goals, Cheng Kejie noted, it is necessary to firmly  grasp the following 10 aspects of work: 1) To vigorously  develop the rural economy and increase peasants' income; 2) To  improve industrial and communications productions in a  down-to-earth manner with a view to increasing economic  efficiency; 3) To successfully build key projects and  continually accelerate ports construction; 4) To seize each and  every opportunity to develop an export- oriented economy; 5) To  make redoubled efforts to build a market system and invigorate  circulation; 6) To successfully build all help-the-poor  projects and help various poverty-stricken areas eradicate  poverty and achieve prosperity at a faster pace; 7) To increase  revenue, cut down on expenditure, and improve financial as well  as credit and loan work; 8) To curb excessive price hikes and  improve people's livelihood; 9) To continually attach strategic  priority to educational, scientific, and technological  development with an eye on achieving economic rejuvenation and  prosperity; 10) To strengthen and improve family planning work  in a down-to-earth manner and step up both land management and  environmental protection.    2. To quicken the pace of reforms aimed at building a  socialist market economic structure. This year's reforms should  be centered on the following six aspects: 1) To deepen the  rural economic structural reform so as to infuse rural economic  development with fresh vigor; 2) To shift the state-owned  enterprises operative mechanism in a down-to-earth manner and  create conditions for establishing a modern enterprise system;  3) To conscientiously organize activities of studying the state  policies on financial, revenue, banking, foreign trade, and  planning systems reforms; 4) To expedite circulation structural  reform and vigorously build and develop an essential production  means market; 5) To perfect a social security system and  accelerate urban housing system reform; 6) To vigorously and  steadily further institutional reform and practically transform  government functions.    3. To press ahead with socialist democracy and spiritual  civilization building.    To conclude, Cheng Kejie called on people of all  nationalities in the region to adhere to the party's basic line  and seize each and every excellent opportunity to speed up  development under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee  with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and to strive to score new  achievements and win new victories in 1994.

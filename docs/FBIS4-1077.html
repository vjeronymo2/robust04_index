			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shaun Johnson] </F>   [Text] Sam Shilowa is a big man, big enough to wear two  hats. He needs to be. The deceptively boyish-looking Congress  of South African Trade [COSATU] general secretary is in one of  transitional South Africa's more powerful and finely balanced  positions. The task at hand is no less than giving birth to a  new COSATU for a new South Africa. Unfortunately for him,  that's not all that's occupying his time at the moment, with  barely a week to go before South Africa's founding democratic  election.    Shilowa -- who took over from Jay Naidoo when the veteran  unionist accepted nomination to the National Assembly -- is  tackling two great tasks simultaneously: planning for a strong  COSATU under fundamentally altered political conditions, and  campaigning at full filt for the ANC in his Northern Transvaal  home base. It's not a straightforward role, as is evident from  recent prickly exchanges with ANC members on the TEC  [Transitional Executive Council].    First, the short-term task: Shilowa says COSATU has sent  teams into all 14 of the ANC's regions to bring their  organisational capacities to bear in the final electoral push.  This started some five weeks ago, it involves senior COSATU  people, and weak areas are receiving priority. As far as  possible, COSATU leaders are working in the regions from which  they hail -- Shilowa is stumping the Northern Transvaal and  wowing audiences with his home-boy-made-good, rollicking style  of delivery. How does this dovetail with the ANC?    "We agreed that COSATU's not running the election campaign,"  Shilowa says, "but we've got something to offer. We're  integrating our campaigning." He and other leaders have been  formally deployed by ANC headquarters. The COSATU teams are  checking the readiness of specific areas for next week's polling.    Shilowa says it's simply a fact that during this key period  of the transition, normal business is on hold for COSATU.  "We're totally caught up in the process of transformation, and  we're shedding leaders to the campaign and later to Parliament  and the public sector. No normal organisational work is  possible...The major task right now is to ensure an ANC victory."    The COSATU campaign initiative is a final push to translate  emotional support into actual crosses on ballot papers come next  Wednesday. Shilowa says it's all very well if other parties are  weak or non-existent in the region but "no shows" at the polls  would be tantamount to votes for the opposition. "So we're  doing all sorts of things, like addressing people on buses as  they travel from Seshego. It's kind of travelling people's  forum, where we answer questions. We're not going to just sit  and hope that people go and vote themselves." The blitz will  continue right up until the eve of the election, says Shilowa.    But that's the election, and much of Shilowa's thinking is  longer term. "It's not just a case of putting in an ANC  government. Then we've got to make a difference to people's  lives in his poor region."    All of which raises the really big question: having been  born in conditions of outright resistance to a hostile State,  how is COSATU going to relate to a government which it not only  supports, but has actively helped to shape? Aside from the  challenge of developing new layers of leadership to replace  those denuded by the defeat of apartheid (and the attendant  danger that individual unions' interests will begin to outweigh  the federation's), this is a profound question for COSATU. It  has to fit itself in somewhere between an antagonistic  relationship with a new government, and the sweetheart-union  syndrome.    Shilowa has presented to his organisation a document  entitled  "Towards developing a long-term strategy for COSATU", which  focuses on four key points.    -- What are the implications of operating under a  sympathetic  government? Shilowa points out that COSATU has been "skilled  into opposition politics, based on demands rather than joint  projects with the State. But the Reconstruction and Development  Programme is a joint document which carries obligations and  responsibilities for both government and us. We will not be  there opposing it clause by clause, we'll be working towards its  implementation."    -- How will COSATU's membership be fully serviced in the new  South Africa? Shilowa says that until now COSATU has attracted  members on two grounds -- its ability to win bread-and-butter  gains, and its political position. "The reality is that we'll  soon have a legitimate, democratic government, openly elected.  It has the legitimacy to take actions, although obviously in  consultation with other stakeholders. So the second, political,  role begins to fall away. We therefore have to concentrate on  servicing the needs of our membership, and already since 1992 we  have faced complaints about gaps developing between grassroots  membership and the various levels of leadership. If we can't  address that, we're doomed as an organisation." He adds that  the new COSATU will be confined to one constituency, and "won't  want to speak out on everything. We'll be alive to broader  political issues, of course, but it will be a more classical  trade union role."    -- How independent will COSATU be? Shilowa says many people  misunderstand trade union "independence": "It's not the same as  non-alignment -- we are aligned, but concerned that programmes  (to benefit our members) are implemented on their behalf.  There's a perception that our leadership is more politically  oriented than trade unionist, and that's unfair. Our political  involvement has benefited the union movement. COSATU must not  allow itself to become a conveyor belt or sweetheart. Now we  have put candidates in the ANC -- we don't take the non-aligned  view, but ask what they can do to implement the programmes."    -- Will COSATU overstretch itself? Shilowa says the  federation has become involved in "too many forums. That's been  necessary, but it's not for ever because we don't have the  capacity and the resources to sustain it. Our priorities are  the National Economic Forum and the National Manpower  Commission, and we think they could be combined. There'd be two  chambers, one macro-economic and the other dealing with labour  market issues. We'd be represented directly there, but not  necessarily in all the other forums. COSATU needs to conserve  and redirect its resources and energies in future."    I put the proposition directly: it's not just a new South  Africa we're going to have to develop, but a new COSATU too.  Shilowa's in full agreement.</p>

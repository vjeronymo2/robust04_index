			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the November 1990 Order, Mt. Airy and its former shareholders (1) paid the principal sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000.00), plus interest, in full and final settlement of all matters covered by the Order; and (2) agreed to retain (i) Mt. Airy's records evidencing sales volume data for each product subject to controls, during the period covered by the audit; and (ii) Mt. Airy's customers' names and addresses. The November 1990 Order requires Mt. Airy to retain the records described above for a period of thirty (30) days following DOE's final distribution of the Mt. Airy Consent Order funds or January 1, 2000, whichever occurs earlier. Mt. Airy shall make such information available to DOE, if so requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> III.

Crude Oil Refund Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The monies remitted by Mt. Airy and its former shareholders will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases (MSRP).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4, 1986). This policy has been utilized in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 Fed. Reg. 29689 (August 20, 1986) (the August 1986 Order).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the MSRP, 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be refunded to the federal government, another 40 percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may initially be reserved for the payment of claims by injured parties. The MSRP also specified that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid will be disbursed to the federal government and the states in equal amounts. See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> In re: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement) for a more detailed discussion of the MSRP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous comments received in response to the August 1986 Order. 52 Fed. Reg. 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). This Notice provided guidance to claimants that anticipated filing refund applications for crude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. In general, we stated that all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981, crude oil price control period; and (2) prove they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. End-users of petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry would be presumed to have been injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges and would not be required to submit proof of injury.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See City of Columbus, Georgia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  16 DOE &para;85,550 (1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> B. The Proposed Decision and Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On June 3, 1994, OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute the crude oil violation amount that had been obtained from Mt. Airy and its former shareholders. The amount of money covered by the PDO is $2,226,782.70, plus accrued interest. OHA tentatively concluded that the funds should be distributed in accordance with the MSRP and the April Notice. Pursuant to the MSRP, OHA proposed to reserve 20 percent of these funds ($445,357.00) for direct refunds to applicants who claim that they were injured by the crude oil violations. We stated that the remaining 80 percent of the funds would be distributed to the states and the federal government for indirect restitution. After all valid claims have been paid, any remaining funds in the claim reserve would also be divided between the states and the federal government. The federal government's share ultimately would be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We provided a period of 30 days from the date of the PDO's publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  in which the public could submit comments regarding the tentative refund procedures. More than 30 days have elapsed, and the OHA has received no comments concerning the proposed procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Leipzig trades its past for free-market future: The problems facing companies battling for a share of Europe's fastest-growing construction market The Pussycat Club in Leipzig comes as a crushing disappointment to the men from Tarmac, the UK construction group searching hard for profits where most British builders still fear to tread. Only when they are off the 7am flight from London do they realise that colleagues' tales of wild parties at the Pussycat are intended to poke gentle fun at the former East German city, not best known for the quality of its night-time entertainment. Neither the club, nor anything like it, yet exists. After a 12-hour day, the reality for the small team leading the British company's high-risk assault on a tough new market is dinner and a few drinks in 'digs' at number 8 Hoyerstrasse, a stylish, suburban house in an area once reserved for leading Communist party members. There are sitting tenants, with a heavy-footed teenage son on the second floor; one room at the top of the house is sub-let to Sir Frederick Snow, the British engineering company which is also keen to do business locally. Good accommodation is hard to find. Leipzig, whose status as a trade-fair centre had at least allowed capitalism across its threshold, is now open to anyone ready to help rebuild a city blackened by lignite dust and crumbling after four decades of neglect. As arrivals make their way along cobbled streets, past barracks where soldiers of the former Soviet Union buy battered Skoda cars for resale back home, they confront an entire city in desperate need of modernisation and renewal. But despite land-ownership disputes, contaminated sites and hidden arms dumps, the former east Germany is Europe's fastest-growing construction market - and Tarmac wants a piece of the action. Estimates suggest that building work in the former East German states worth more than DM2,000bn (Pounds 790bn) could be generated over the next 12 years. At home, Wolverhampton-based Tarmac is battling to stem the financial haemorrhaging inflicted by recession. It has recently announced interim losses of Pounds 15m, while profits for 1992, at about Pounds 25m, may barely match the figure notched up in just three weeks during the heady days of 1989. The Leipzig initiative, part of a strategy to broaden the construction group's base across an expanding market, is one which other companies must imitate if the political vision of a single European market is to be converted into commercial reality. Tarmac has set up a European division to embrace its continental ambitions. It has already bought a motorway construction business and a share of a building company in France, while Schal International, its management arm, is developing the first phase of a Pounds 500m business park in Berlin. An acquisition in Hungary may be next. In Leipzig the company's efforts to weld together two alien business cultures and to build a bridgehead to other eastern European markets will be closely watched by competitors. 'It's more like venturing into the third world than into a mature, western market. There are 'gold rush' towns sprouting up all over the place,' says Mr Steve Reding, managing director of the company's European operation. There is, as yet, little hint of any gold rush in the run-down yard of Bau Nord, the Leipzig building business which was on its knees when the hard-hats from Wolverhampton acquired it in March. So far, there are few outward changes at Bau Nord. There are a couple of new trucks with the Tarmac logo slapped on them. The car park which, until recently, housed the Trabant for which the last boss had waited 14 years, now boasts a Porsche owned by one of the carpenters. Inside, however, a revolution is under way among an 80-strong workforce which is technically competent but commercially at sea. 'We are only here for a while to implant our skills. It will be run by Germans as soon as possible,' says Mr John Thomson, the Stoke-born general manager who is trying to get by with his 'pigeon deutsche' in a company where only two of the non-British speak good English. With productivity levels estimated at less than half those in the west of Germany, the company has already tried a productivity bonus scheme, but it failed miserably. 'The men don't like pressure; they go sick. There is no 'go-for-it' mentality - but it will come,' says Mr Thomson. 'No one knew what deadlines or personal responsibility meant. Everyone would go around in pairs like Siamese twins so that no one individual could be held liable for anything.' Pay is still below levels in western Germany but, by government decree, is rising step by step, leaving many workers better off. They are now on about 77 per cent of the pay levels achieved in the west of the country. The company's employees, despite the challenge of adapting to foreign bosses, have welcomed British owners who saved them from certain redundancy. 'There is so much resentment against the west Germans who moved in quickly to our country to pick up the best work. Everything is seen to be for their benefit, not for ours,' says Janette Gothel, a former state interpreter and now the company's new marketing manager. 'We believe the English have come to put down roots. But the workforce now realises that western management does not just mean lots of new equipment which will do all the work for them. Now they know what is expected of them.' The more informal British management style has also come as a big shock to those weaned on formality. The newly arrived contract estimator could not pick up his pay because his work documents described him as Michael while his real name appeared to be Mike. 'We are surprised just how cool and calm the English can be. I sometimes get upset when problems arise but they don't seem to worry. They tell jokes in serious situations and it is beginning to catch on,' says Elke Hubner, the new finance director. The Leipzig city fathers are also pleased to see Tarmac. Hans-Jochen Richter, project co-ordinator for the local municipality, is thrilled at the challenge that commercial freedom and a rising state budget gives his department: 'We never dreamed we would be able to work with partners like this.' Tarmac's new acquisition has about DM20m of work on its books, a fragment of the potential business in an economy that has several decades of construction work to catch up on. It is a modest start and any prizes will be hard won; there is unlikely to be much time left for daydreaming about a night out at the Pussycat Club.</p>

Their deep-lying causes and roots are inaccessible to  an analysis within the framework of the customary approach and  require a serious and comprehensive philosophical  conceptualization. This field still awaits its thoughtful and  impartial researcher. At the same time, on the other hand, the  practical needs of the present day insistently demand a  determination of the pluses and minuses of Russia's present  position on the basis of the centuries-old majestic tradition.    So that we might, finally, stand with a "firm footing" on  the  native soil of the country's primordial national interests, it  is vitally necessary that we restore the natural historical  retrospective. And the formulation of such a most important  philosophical problem presupposes, in turn, the accomplishment  of the following tasks:    1. The formulation of a concept making it possible to reveal  and substantiate the "geopolitical invariants" of Russian  national interests, that is, the stable requirements pertaining  to the assurance of state security that guarantee us long-term  conditions of the country's peaceful and harmonious development.    2. The formulation of a procedure of the "ideological  correction" of our ailing society aimed at restoring the  historical continuity of Russian life in the national  self-consciousness, reviving the spiritual health of the people,  and ensuring the moral immunity of public opinion to relapses  into "foreign-mania."    3. Determination of a prospective model of Russia's social  and state development in the channel of its distinctive  traditions, spiritual reference points, and religious shrines.  <H5>  Two Approaches </H5>   A distinctive method making it possible to ascertain the  invariants of Russia's state interests is that of geopolitical  analysis. In terms of its content, geopolitics is a science  studying the normalities of the influence of geographical  factors on the role of states in world history and the formation  of political trends and the national-state interests of various  peoples and countries.    The basic propositions of this science were formulated back  at the end of the last century by the British political  scientist Halford Mackinder (1861-1947), whose studies formed  the basis of all subsequent geopolitical models of world  history. The term "geopolitics" itself, however, was first put  to use by the Swedish expert Rudolf Kjellen and immediately  taken up in Germany by Karl Haushofer, who became a most  important authority in this field.    A most important postulate of geopolitics is the assertion  that for formulation of the optimum strategy of state  development paramount significance should be attached not to  political or ideological predilections--short-term and rapidly  changing--but to stable factors of a country's  spatial-geographical position. Geopolitics attributes to such  primarily a state's location (continental, insular, or  littoral), the size of its territory, the prevailing type of  communications (sea or land), the predominant landscapes, and  similar parameters.    All the remaining aspects of state life, be they  commercial-economic or political-ideological, are deemed from  this viewpoint to be factors which are, although important,  nonetheless subordinate. It is believed here that it is the  permanency of the main "support characteristics" chosen as the  reference point that enable geopolitics to formulate with the  maximum efficiency the strategy of state development--be it in  the sphere of its foreign policy or defense.    In most general form the essence of geopolitical doctrine  may  be characterized by the following most important propositions:    Throughout human history two alternative, continuously  contending approaches to the conquest of the earth's surface  have formed the basis of constitutional development. They  may be designated the continental, land-expansionist, approach  characteristic of continental states and the "nautical" approach  basing the economic prosperity and state power of the metropolis  on the exploitation of overseas territories, which makes  domination on water lines of communication of fundamental  importance.    In recent European history the basic principles of  geopolitics are convincingly illustrated by the opposition of  the "ruler of the seas" of the British Empire to the states of  continental Europe that developed in the 16th-19th centuries  into a whole series of almost continuous wars and clashes both  in the European region and in the enemies' continental  possessions. America, which in the 20th century became Great  Britain's geopolitical successor, but no longer on a regional  but on a global, world scale, naturally inherited all the  fundamental features of this path of development. Throughout the  last century the scientific-technological revolution has  contributed and continues to contribute a number of essential  correctives connected with the modernization of the means of  information and communication, but there have nonetheless been  no fundamental changes here as yet.    Speaking in this connection of the molding of cultural and  world-outlook values, it should be stipulated that the complex  and mysterious sphere of the spiritual and religious-moral  development of the peoples cannot be adequately described in  terms of geopolitics concentrating their main attention on  outward, state-political forms of societal existence. But it can  be seen distinctly here that liberal-democratic ideology with  its cult of individualism and personal success serving the  commercial-economic mechanism of the "market" plunder of  continental sources of raw material and manpower becomes a most  important pillar of the trading "nautical" civilization. At the  same time, however, the traditional world outlook, with its  powerful communal roots presupposing the priority of solidary,  collective, conciliary forms of societal self-organization,  becomes the ideological foundation of "totalitarian" continental  culture and spirituality.    With reference to modern conditions what has been said above  signifies that the territories and regions lying on the  "continental periphery" of Eurasia and representing a connecting  link, as it were, between the inland expanses of the mainland  and the expanses of the oceans inevitably become an arena of  bitter and uncompromising opposition.    The "nautical" civilization endeavors to the utmost to  advance inside the mainland, turning the expanses which have  been won away from it into "forward-basing zones" and original  strong points for the defense of its global interests. In turn,  the representatives of the "continental" geopolitical tradition  have no choice but to make every effort to "throw into the sea"  their ocean adversary, having increased their own influence in  the littoral zone, creating in this way a barrier against his  expansion.    The United States expended colossal efforts to establish a  celebrated "arc of instability" on the external borders of the  USSR. Or we recall the well-known call of Zbigniew  Brzezinski--"to nibble at the Russian pie around the edges."  Truly something to think about.    In such a system the coordinate of the notorious "new  world order" appears to be nothing other than an attempt to  enshrine on a planetary scale the leading role of the "ocean  power" United States and its satellites by way of the power  imposition on the entire world community of the "liberal-market"  values of the trading nautical civilization.  <H5>  Elevation of the State </H5>   As a subject of geopolitics, the Russian state took shape  back in the ninth century as a result of the unification of  related East Slav tribes, the ancient cultural center of which  was the Middle Dnieper region headed by Kiev. Since the moment  of its formation Kievan Rus immediately became a most important  state of that era, and its statehood was of an unequivocally  continental nature. The basis of the material prosperity of  Kievan Rus determining to a considerable extent the burgeoning  of a very rich culture also was control over the inland mainland  expanses through which the celebrated trading route "from the  Varangians to the Greeks"--the most important communications  artery of Eurasia of those times--ran.    The development of Russian statehood was from the very  outset  filled with dramatic content, for that matter. A stern test  awaited the young state en route to prosperity: An insidious  steppe predator, the Khazar Khanate kept a jealous eye on its  strengthening rival. Their struggle, in the course of which it  sometimes appeared that the unenviable role of submissive vassal  had been prepared for Rus, until, finally, the valiant and  warlike Prince Svyatoslav smashed the khanate in the mid-10th  century, lasted several decades.    The first military encounters set a disturbing tone, as it  were, for all of subsequent Russian history. For 10 centuries  after this Russia had time after time--again and again--in  continuous rivalry with aggressive neighbors to prove its right  to distinctive existence, paying for this with the blood of its  best sons and daughters.    Just about the most fearful test on its historical path was  the Tatar-Mongol yoke. The immense empire of the Genghis  Khanites, which encompassed the entire mainland and stretched  from "the walls of immovable China" to the Baltic and from  Northern Siberia to Khorezm and Bukhara, was, by all accounts,  to have swallowed up as part of itself for good the "land of the  Rus" as a distant western province.    No one could have imagined that Rus, ravaged and  perishing in the turmoil of princely fratricidal strife, would  have taken over the baton from the empire of the Genghis  Khanites and at a price of incredible sacrificial efforts have  united within it the giant expanses of Eurasia, becoming forever  a guarantor and custodian of world geopolitical balance.    Nonetheless, this is precisely what happened.    Lost in the remoteness of impenetrable forests, the  downgraded hamlet of Moskova rose by the efforts of a long  succession of Russian princes--patient, consistent, and  single-minded builders of sovereign power--higher and higher,  becoming the visible center of all-Russian national-state unity.  It defended this role in the 14th-15th centuries by the  diplomatic skill of its rulers, the commercial aptitude of the  merchants, and the martial valor of the warriors, who fell in  countless numbers in 1380 on Kulikovo Field, paying the supreme  price for the independence of their country.    As a result of heroic efforts Russian statehood had acquired  a new quality by the mid-15th century under the scepter of Ioann  III.    Nonetheless, the true founder of the Russian geopolitical  state was Ioann the Terrible. First, he conquered the Kazan and  Astrakhan kingdoms--the last islets of the former Tatar-Mongol  might. Russia's second strategic breakthrough was the annexation  of Siberia. Altogether this process took several decades, its  decisive stage was the campaign of the Cossack chieftain Yermak  Timofeyevich, who was zealous for the security of the country's  eastern borders against the nomad raids.    The formidable tsar clearly understood the geopolitical  needs  of his state. It was no secret to him that the logic of Russia's  national-state interests insistently demanded control over the  maritime regions, and he began in the West an exhausting and  bloody war for the return of the country's sea boundaries--for  an outlet to the Baltic, which had come to be called the  Livonian Sea. For 12 years (1558-1583) Russia strained every  nerve in the struggle against four enemies--Poland, Sweden, the  Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Livonian Order. The cause  begun by Ioann was completed by another celebrated  sovereign--Peter I, the founder of the Russian Empire.    As distinct from the conventional opinion, in fighting  Sweden  (the strongest European power at that time) for the Baltic Peter  was not so much endeavoring "to carve out a window onto Europe"  as, on the contrary, to secure Russia against possible  aggression from the direction of the sea.    It was these same geopolitical considerations that dictated  many other famous undertakings of Peter--the building of the  navy, the decision to erect a new capital "on the shore of the  desert waves," and the close attention to European engineering  and military innovations. When the Northern War with Sweden  ended in 1721 with the Peace of Nystad (which annexed Ingria,  Estonia, and Livonia to Russia), this signified not only the  return of primordial Russian lands but a triumph of geopolitical  single-mindedness which ensured a regime of the maximum possible  tranquillity and peace for the population of the region,  incidentally, for the next 200 years (until the advent of those  who loved "to rectify injustice").    All of Russia's subsequent steps aimed at the discovery of  its natural geopolitical borders were dictated by its aspiration  to sovereign-state peacemaking. The closest confirmation of this  is the history of the annexation to Russia of the Crimean  peninsula. As of the 15th century the Crimean Khanate, the last  fragment of the once mighty Golden Horde, having consolidated  its position in Crimea and having become a vassal of the Turkish  sultan, became a pirate's nest regularly sending out its hordes,  which laid waste to everything around and reached the walls of  Moscow in their raids.    Russian troops attempted repeatedly to put an end to this  plunder, but their forces were insufficient, and the raids  continued. Finally, in the course of the 1768-1774 Russo-Turkish  War, in which Catherine II had been forced to act to secure the  country's southern strategic borders, Crimea was taken by  Potemkin's army. The center of aggression was suppressed, and  long-awaited peace was established on the vast expanses of the  Black Sea steppe, which lost, as a result of the Russian  Empire's single-minded pursuit of its geopolitical interests,  its border and "front-line" status.    A no less striking example of Russian peacemaking was its  decisive contribution to the victory over Napoleon. From the  viewpoint of the local European France-Britain opposition  Napoleon, with his "continental system," was undoubtedly the  main threat to the "nautical" geopolitical principle personified  by Great Britain. Nonetheless, on the scale of the immense  Eurasia this conflict was of a manifestly local, peripheral  nature, whereas Bonaparte's attempts to conquer Russia, having  disarticulated its giant expanses, contained a lethal threat to  the entire geopolitical balance of the mainland.    It is interesting that even so decidedly an anti-Russian  politician as Henry Kissinger was recently forced to acknowledge  in the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE that "the tsarist and Soviet  empires twice saved the European countries' independence  inasmuch as without their contribution Napoleon and Hitler would  have gained the ascendancy." A compliment from a highly dubious  source, of course, but nonetheless....    Following the victory over Bonaparte, it was thanks to the  efforts of Alexander I (with the active role of the Austrian  Chancellor Metternich) that the Holy Alliance of continental  states of Europe--Russia, Prussia, and Austria-Hungary--which  was one further attempt to establish stability and security in  the European part of the continent--was concluded. The  persevering attempts--completed by Nicholas I--to secure Russian  control over the strategically important region of the Caucasus  lay in this same direction.    The Caucasus War of 1817-1864, which ended with the  annexation to Russia of Chechnya, Highland Dagestan, and the  Northwest Caucasus, was not at all (like other Russian wars  also) an act of conquest or aggression. Following the voluntary  incorporation as part of Russia of the Kingdom of Georgia  (1801-1810) and Azerbaijan (1803-1813), the Northwest Caucasus  had become a springboard for Turkish and Iranian expansion in  the region engendering endless military conflicts and bringing  devastation to entire provinces, and grief and death to hundreds  of thousands of peaceful inhabitants.    This state of affairs was actively supported by Britain, for  which the strengthening of the continental power of Russia  contained a great threat. The results of the annexation of the  Caucasus may be judged if only by the fact that the endless  bloody wars that had been lacerating this region almost  continuously from century to century came to an end for a long  time under the Russian scepter. And now in our post-perestroyka  times, when the defenders of the fatherland are abandoning the  "independent states," blood is being shed in Chechnya and  Ingushetia, Ossetia, Abkhazia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan!  Does history never teach us anything?    Generally speaking, the leading politicians of Russia  understood full well that the empire's Eurasian interests could  not be secured exclusively by military power and always put the  emphasis on peaceful influence in regions where its vital  interests were concentrated. This, incidentally, makes for the  unique multinational nature of Russia, which has for many  centuries accepted as brothers all the peoples that have  reunited with it.    It seemed that this growing continental might of Russia had  become eternal and invincible. Nonetheless, the evidence to the  contrary, the 20th century has been for our country a period of  devastating social cataclysms, bloody wars, and geopolitical  catastrophes.    In order to understand why this became possible it is  essential to address the spiritual and world-outlook processes  that determined the inner strength of the Russian State.</p>

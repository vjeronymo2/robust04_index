			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Jardine lifts C&amp;C holding to near 25% JARDINE, the Hong Kong-based trading group controlled by the Keswick family and domiciled in Bermuda, has bought a further 8.6 per cent stake in Singapore's Cycle &amp; Carriage company for SDollars 160m (USDollars 99.3m). The purchase brings Jardine's total C&amp;C holding to a controlling 24.63 per cent, just short of the 25 per cent which would trigger a mandatory general offer. C&amp;C is involved in food, property and motor distribution. Analysts say the C&amp;C purchase is one of a number of moves Jardine is making into Singapore.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity The regional electricity companies have notably failed to gain ground since the regulator last week ruled in favour of the dash for gas. Southern Electric has an interest in three gas-fired power projects, yet its shares have fallen since Professor Littlechild went public. Since Southern's interim figures yesterday were nothing but solid, the obvious conclusion is that the good news was already in the price. Having drawn the scope of his inquiry so tightly, Professor Littlechild was indeed less likely to come down hard on Southern for backing gas. The nagging concern, though, is that the sector has only cleared the first hurdle of an arduous regulatory course. The government's energy review could still override the regulator's conclusions. That would make Professor Littlechild's position difficult, to say the least. Assuming the white paper leaves the regional companies unscathed, a review of electricity supply is not more than a few weeks behind. With the more important distribution review due to start in the autumn and only a sketchy outline of the regulator's thinking on the table, the market might be forgiven for keeping the champagne on ice. Since Professor Littlechild is investigating the generators' prices both in the proposed supply contracts and in the electricity pool, National Power and PowerGen still look more exposed. The promise of 12 per cent dividend growth from the regional companies this year and yields comfortably above the market average allow for a fair degree of risk. If too many regulatory chickens come home to roost, though, Welsh Water's decision to take profits on its South Wales Electricity holding yesterday may look rather canny.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> BEUERLEIN MIGHT START; CHRISTENSEN, LOFTON MIGHT BE CUT  </P> <P> There are rumbles of a shakeup in silver and blackdom, where the 0-3 Raiders  are preparing to cut their squad to 60 by Tuesday. They involve several of the  team's biggest names, who could be benched or waived.  </P> <P> Starting from the top:  </P> <P>  -- The Raiders might start Steve Beuerlein in Saturday's exhibition finale  against the Chicago Bears and bench Jay Schroeder.  </P> <P> Beuerlein has completed 59.5% of his passes and has looked sharp and  aggressive. Schroeder is at 43.4% and described by some team officials as  "tentative."  </P> <P> Coach Mike Shanahan, Schroeder's leading supporter and wary of starting a  quarterback controversy, was noncommittal Sunday, praising Beuerlein but  expressing confidence in Schroeder.  </P> <P> Schroeder has had the burden of trying to establish the Marcus Allen-less  running game, which has failed miserably. Beuerlein has had the advantage of  coming in second, by which time he knows it isn't working and can go for broke.  However, a growing number of Raider officials want to see what would happen if  Beuerlein starts.  </P> <P>  -- Todd Christensen and James Lofton could go in this, the first cut.  </P> <P> Neither played Saturday, although both were healthy.  </P> <P> Shanahan used Mike Dyal, Trey Junkin, Ethan Horton and Charles Henry at tight  end ahead of Christensen. Shanahan prefers bigger, blocker-type tight ends.  Christensen is 33, makes $750,000 and probably won't be retained if he doesn't  figure as a starter, which he doesn't. A five-time All-Pro, he is the team's  all-time leader at the position in receptions.  </P> <P> Lofton is 33, has been running third string in camp, has one catch in  exhibitions and has been eclipsed by second-year player Mike Alexander, a tall,  rangy receiver like himself. The Raiders have already paid Lofton a $400,000  reporting bonus, but remain on the hook for his $325,000 salary if he makes the  club. He is a seven-time All-Pro and a Hall of Fame candidate.  </P> <P>  -- Matt Millen is on his way out.  </P> <P> It could be today or next week, but he wasn't benched Saturday merely because  someone was curious about Jackie Shipp.  </P> <P> Shipp was unimpressive (the Oilers rushed for 198 yards, so who wasn't?), but  he was only a stand-in for the real candidate to take Millen's strong-side  inside linebacker spot, Jerry Robinson. Robinson, previously the weak-side  inside linebacker, has been sidelined because of a groin pull but is expected  back this week.  </P> <P> Millen has told friends that the coaches have already informed him that they  are trying to trade him.  </P> <P>  -- Mike Haynes is still up to his neck in competition.  </P> <P> Lionel Washington has performed well in exhibitions and might start on the  right side, with Mike Richardson or Terry McDaniel on the left side when the  season begins.  </P> <P> Haynes has veteran's disease: he is 36 and would make $825,000 this season. If  he doesn't start, the Raiders aren't likely to pay him that much to come off  the bench.  </P> <P> And which of the younger players are in trouble?  </P> <P>  -- All of the running backs. Vance Mueller, who wanted a chance to show what  he could do, has failed. Last week's boomlets for Derrick Gaynor and Kerry  Porter are over.  </P> <P> The coaching staff desperately wants Allen to return. Allen has said he yearns  to return. Until all this yearning is requited, the Raider running game (2.7  yards per carry) exists in theory only.  </P></p>

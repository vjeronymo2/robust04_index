			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Steetley adjourns EGM until after bid At yesterday's extraordinary general meeting, Steetley shareholders carried a resolution to adjourn the EGM, which had been called to approve the proposed joint venture agreement between the company and Tarmac. It was adjourned until Monday, February 24, which is one week after the final date by which Redland's bid for Steetley must lapse under the current timetable, unless it has by then become unconditional as to acceptances. Mr David Donne, Steetley chairman, continued to urge shareholders to reject Redland's 'inadequate' bid.</p>

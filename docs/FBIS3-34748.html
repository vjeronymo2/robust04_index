			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi--Sources in Abu Dhabi yesterday stated  that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will soon visit the UAE  [United Arab Emirates] capital on his first official visit since  August 1990.    'Arafat is expected to meet with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al  Nuhayyan, president of the UAE, and a number of senior officials  to inform them of the new developments on the Middle East peace  process and the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to conclude an  autonomy agreement for Gaza and Jericho. The sources did not  mention the date of 'Arafat's arrival in Abu Dhabi, but they  expect it to be after the end of his talks in Cairo with Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    They asserted that a high-level UAE official had informed a  delegation of the sons of the Palestinian colony in Abu Dhabi  that the UAE had agreed to 'Arafat's visit.    The Palestinian president stopped at Abu Dhabi International  Airport in October on the way from Indonesia to Turkey. He met  in the airport with Shaykh Sultan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan, the  deputy prime minister, and a number of senior UAE officials.    Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu Mazin), a member of the PLO executive  committee, is the highest Palestinian personality who has  visited the UAE officially since the Gulf war.    The sources state that 'Arafat will discuss with Shaykh  Zayid  the achievement of Arab interests and the PLO's relations with  the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states. It is expected that  he will discuss the PLO's financial situation and aid from the  Gulf states for Palestinian autonomy with the UAE officials.    Shaykh Zayid has asserted more than once the UAE's  continuing  support for the Palestinian people and its intifadah in the  occupied territories. The UAE has advocated offering financial  aid of some $50 million within the framework of the aid, which  will be offered to the autonomous areas in the occupied  territories.    The UAE and the other member states in the GCC have  supported  the Palestinian-Israeli agreement that was signed on 13  September in Washington, considering it a first steop toward the  return of the Palestinian people's rights and the establishment  of their independent state.</p>

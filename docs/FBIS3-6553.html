			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam voiced concern Thursday that international  sanctions against North Korea could be inevitable due to the  current nuclear row.    "It's a serious problem for the international community and  truly unfortunate that the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) inspection in North Korea was incomplete, and that it was  unable to inspect two important sites," Kim said in an interview  with NHK-TV broadcast here on the evening news.    "It's now heading toward a situation where international  sanctions cannot but be imposed on North Korea," he said.    The comments by South Korea's top executive came just hours  after the IAEA announced in Vienna that its inspectors, during  their two-week stay in North Korea, were denied access to  important sites that could determine whether the Stalinist state  diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses.    Kim's interview came a week before he heads to Tokyo on his  first outing this year. It was only last year that the Seoul  Government closed the book on the dark past with Tokyo from the  1910-45 colonial years.    On opening his country to Japanese cultural imports, Kim  said  the important thing is to open up naturally and gradually  through exchanges between the two peoples and their governments.    "The opening will have to wait until such time comes," he  said, predicting that this would occur during the remaining four  years of his presidency.    He also thought a visit to Korea by Japanese Emperor Akihito  was possible during the next four years, a step officials here  say is the last emotional door to close on the two countries'  past relations.    But it's important to create an atmosphere where the people  of both countries can sincerely welcome such a visit, he said.</p>

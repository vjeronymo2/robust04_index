			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Strike halts flights to Italy THE bulk of flights in and out of Italy were yesterday cancelled as a result of an air controllers' strike and further substantial disruptions are expected over the next four days affecting some 80,000 passengers, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Yesterday Alitalia said that only eight out of 90 national flights and a further eight out of 110 international flights were able to operate because of the air controllers' strike which lasted from 0900 to 1400. Foreign carriers operating to and from Italy were also badly affected.</p>

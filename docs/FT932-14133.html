			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (15): Marriage with complicated problems - . . . For Networks IT IS impossible to think of computers in modern business without also thinking about networks. The marriage of computers and telecommunications is at the very heart of information technology and networks are the 'circulatory' system which provides the mechanisms for moving data and messages from one computer to another. There is, however, a fundamental problem. Networks are becoming increasingly complex and need advanced software to control and manage them. The increased complexity is the result of broader scope of modern networking. Many different types of computer are being connected to networks to provide the power for new applications. In addition, the trend towards comprehensive digital networks - integrated services digital networks (ISDN), for example - means that modern networks must be capable of handling lots of different types of data simultaneously. The promise of innovative applications like video-conferencing, multimedia communications and workgroup computing will only come to fruition on the back of more complex communications networks. But this places greater demands on networking technology and makes it more difficult to manage and control. A survey of European businesses published last November by the networking specialist 3Com noted that companies had 'serious reservations about the value for money offered by their existing network investment.' At the same time, nearly half of those surveyed recognised that they would have continue expanding their networks to support the growth of their businesses. They cited a number of reasons for expansion, including: video-conferencing to save money on business travel; electronic mail to improve internal communications; and electronic data interchange (EDI). Management of network growth is seen as a big problem. About three-quarters of the network managers that 3Com surveyed said they expected problems in expanding networks - especially in finding compatible services across Europe. ADVANCED APPLICATIONS The increased use of networks for more advanced applications also poses a significant operational management problem. Increasingly networks include many different technologies and operating environments - each with its own priorities and ways of working. Monitoring network configuration and performance in this environment is a nightmare. It embraces issues such as security of access, integrity of shared data resources, disaster recovery and maintenance of systems response times. Most leading computer manufacturers have evolved products to control networks which include both their own products and those of other leading vendors. IBM's Netview and Hewlett Packard's Open view are examples. Broader industry standards for network management have also begun to emerge. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is one of the most prevalent. SNMP is closely linked to the Unix open systems movement and a networking protocol called TCP/IP. The TCP/IP protocol provides a language for systems to 'talk' to each other and SNMP sits on top of it. If a fault occurs or someone attempts to access the network without authority, the SNMP mechanisms inform the central network manager software. The International Standards Organisation (ISO) has devised a similar standard called Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP). This is not as popular as SNMP - although it has some advantages where communications between different networks are needed. Other efforts aimed at providing a comprehensive approach to network management include those from the Open Software Foundation (OSF) and Unix International. But the most comprehensive approach to enterprise-wide network management comes from the Network Management Forum (NMF), an industry body formed in 1988 which, unusually, includes computer users in addition to suppliers. NMF was formed to promote standards for network management right across the board from standard 'voice' telephone systems to high-speed digital data networks. It notes that standards bodies like ISO and the Consultative Committee for International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT) are only concerned with standards for specific types of network, whereas NMF is looking at the whole problem. NMF has published an Open Network Manager Architecture in an attempt to synthesize the requirements for managing different networks into a single specification. GAINING SUPPORT These specifications are gaining support from the industry and many suppliers incorporate them within their own network management products. NMP has also published a 'roadmap' showing the path that the development of network management standards should follow in the future. What is most likely to emerge from these efforts is a hybrid approach which allows for the various standards to co-operate. Only then will complex problems of network management begin to be solved.</p>

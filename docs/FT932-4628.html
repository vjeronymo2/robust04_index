			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Advance renewed in poor turnover VAGUE AND poorly sub-stantiated hopes for a reduction in UK base rates continued to sustain the London stock market yesterday as it opened the new trading account. Volume was unimpressive and, in spite of a 14.9 points gain, the FT-SE 100 Index was off the top at the close and still lowly placed in its latest trading range. The hope that a further cut in domestic interest rates might provide a stimulus for consumer spending lent support to the brewery and some other selected consumer sectors at first. But much of the encouragement to the UK stock market came from good company results. In early trading, which was helped by a somewhat technically inspired gain in stock index futures, the Footsie advanced by nearly 20 points to brush the 2,850 mark. Investment support, however, was not sufficient to breach the 2,850 level and the market softened towards the close as Wall Street came in with an early loss of 8 points on the Dow. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,844.8 for a net gain of 14.9. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index rebounded, finishing 9.8 ahead at 3,184.9, within seven points of the all-time high reached last week. But trading volume, at only 456m shares through the Seaq system, made a poor comparison with the 625.6m shares traded on Friday - although Friday's business was worth Pounds 1.27bn in retail, or customer, value and thus maintained the recovery in genuine investment activity of the past fortnight. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up around 64 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total, at the high end of recent daily averages. The speculation of a cut in UK base rates by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new UK chancellor of the exchequer, continued in spite of doubts expressed by several leading UK equity strategists. Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko commented that, while base rates may be cut by 0.5 percentage point 'as evidence accumulates' that the economic recovery is faltering, this may add only 50 points to the FT-SE 100 Index. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett warned that recent company results could prove highly significant. He points out that the price/earnings multiple on the FT-Actuaries 500-share Index is now around 19.3, raising queries once again over valuations of the London stock market. The debate over domestic interest rates was little affected by a further dip in sterling yesterday , nor by the modest improvement in government bond prices. The City of London has now accepted that developments on base rates may depend on the political outlook, and in particular upon the important speech in London next week by Mr Clarke. Speculation on interest rates is likely to focus on the May retail sales figures, which are due on June 16, just 24 hours before Mr Clarke delivers his Mansion House speech. The London market was helped yesterday by a pause in the US selling of pharmaceutical stocks. Although Zeneca remained out of favour, ICI again found the buyers. Oil shares, also important components of the Footsie, remained very firm, with some of the second line North Sea stocks finding buyers. Support for the domestic consumer issues appeared to be lightly based.</p>

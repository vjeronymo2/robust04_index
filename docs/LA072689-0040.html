			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A "considerable" number of Vietnamese refugees were hurt in weekend clashes  with police at a crowded Hong Kong detention center, said Robert Van Leeuwen,  U.N. high commissioner for refugees in the British colony. Officials said it is  unclear whether the death of a 59-year-old man was connected to the  disturbances, which broke out at the Sek Kong military base where about 7,200  boat people live in army tents pitched on a runway at a military airfield.  Vietnamese refugees later carried crude cardboard posters around the camp  saying in English: "Royal Hong Kong Police Kill Vietnamese Refugee."  </P></p>

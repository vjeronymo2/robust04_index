Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said this demand will  be included in the points that our side will outline on the  issues to be discussed at the proximity talks. Mr. Kasoulidhis  made the statement this afternoon after the meeting between  President Glavkos Kliridhis and UN official Gustave Feissel and  added that our side will submit a list of points which will  cover all the aspects of the confidence-building measures.    Mr. Feissel said after the meeting that he has not received  from President Kliridhis or from Rauf Denktas any list of such  points and expressed the hope that the clarification of these  points would be completed by the end of this week. Feissel also  noted: During his contacts, he will make efforts to foster  understanding and, in a wider sense, agreement between the two  leaders on the issues to be discussed. Mr. Feissel ruled out  redefining the Varosha area which will be placed under UN  control, and he denied reports that repairs have begun at  Nicosia Airport.    Mr. Feissel met with Rauf Denktas at noon today. He will  have a new meeting with Denktas on Wednesday [9 February], and  on Thursday he will meet again with President Kliridhis. The  proximity talks will be held under Joe Clark, who is expected in  Cyprus on Saturday.</p>

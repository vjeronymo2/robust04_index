			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Gold finds support after steep slide THE GOLD and platinum markets appeared to take a very relaxed view of the 'week of action' in South Africa, the biggest producer of both metals, and prices fell steadily for most of the week. But values steadied on the final day, encouraging the view that gold's recent technical uptrend was still intact. Dealers said US investment funds had been pulling out of gold, and with their evacuation virtually completed by Thursday market professionals were left yesterday to trade largely among themselves. Their reluctance to carry short positions into the weekend was evident and sentiment was supported early on by hopes, later justified, of moderately constructive monthly US employment figures. Also encouraging buying was renewed tension over Iraqi weapons inspection and relief that key support at Dollars 348 a troy ounce had withstood a severe test on Thursday. These factors combined to lift the gold price by Dollars 2.30 to Dollars 350.95 an ounce, but that was still Dollars 7 down on the week. Platinum responded to gold's advance to reach Dollars 377.25 an ounce at the afternoon fixing, up Dollars 3.25 on the day but down Dollars 8 on the week. Gold's earlier fall had been influenced, though not as much as might have been expected, by the Uruguayan central bank's announcement on Monday that it sold 50,000 ounces last month, having adopted a new reserve policy involving a switch out of the yellow metal and into fixed term deposits denominated in US dollars and D-marks. Among the base metals copper came under pressure from the beginning of the week as striking workers at Poland's KGHM combine, who had been threatening to intensify their action, suggested they might suspend the stoppage. But the fall was arrested on Tuesday after the London Metal Exchange announced that stocks of copper in its registered warehouses had fallen another 4,600 tonnes to a 15-month low of 246,750 tonnes. Copper stocks had been falling for several weeks but traders were expecting a reversal of that trend reflecting the normal slow-down in manufacturing activity during the northern hemisphere summer. They did not have long to wait, however. Yesterday's LME report showed a 1,750-tonne rise in copper stocks. In the interim copper's struggle to stay above the equivalent of Dollars 2,510 a tonne for three months delivery had been aided by the emergence of Chinese buying and the three months price had recovered from Monday's low of Pounds 1,318 a tonne to Pounds 1,339.50 a tonne, hepled by sterling's fall against the dollar. After yesterday's stocks news, and with sterling rallying, the price fell back to close at Pounds 1,326.50 a tonne, down Pounds 10 on the week. In dollar terms the three months price was down Dollars 6 on the week at Dollars 2,518 a tonne. A 3,036-tonne rise in LME stocks of nickel, taking the total to a fresh record of 38,022 tonnes, came as little surprise yesterday as traders had been expecting recent arrivals of Russian metal to appear in the figure once they had been cut into shape. The cash nickel price closed at Dollars 7,347.50 a tonne, up Dollars 20 on the day and down Dollars 2.50 on the week, but traders said further falls were to be expected following the three months position's failure to break resistance at Dollars 7,450 a tonne earlier in the week. The London Futures and Options Exchange's cocoa market began the week in something of a quandary, with the return of Ivory Coast selling supporting a bearish view and concern about continuing dryness in west Africa arguing for a price rise. In the end the New York bulls won the day and despite reports of further Ivorian sales, plus some from Ghana, the December price ended the week Pounds 29 higher at Pounds 667 a tonne. 'Everyone knows (the producing countries) have done a fair bit earlier this week, so I don't see them wanting to come back in until around Dollars 20 to Dollars 30 above here,' one trader told the Reuter news agency. The depressed state of the world rubber market prompted the buffer stock of the International Natural Rubber Organisation to make support purchases yesterday for the first time in eight months. As a result prices steadied a little in Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo. But there were doubts that the upturn could be sustained, especially as the buffer stock manager had admitted that he could only afford to buy 20,000 tonnes. Some traders thought it odd that he should choose to reveal how limited his resources were as that clearly reduced the impact of his intervention in the market.  ----------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium    +400    to  1,318,650 Copper       +1,750  to  248,500 Lead         -25     to  150,375 Nickel       +3,036  to  38,022 Zinc         +3,550  to  344,350 Tin          -220    to  14,760  -----------------------------------</p>

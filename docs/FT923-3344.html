			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Tourism deal on disputed islands Russia has made its first territorial 'concession' over the disputed South Kurile Islands by leasing 378 hectares to a Hong Kong company which wants to build a tourist complex, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow. Mr Viktor Sirenko, deputy governor of the Sakhalin and Kurile region, who is trying to develop the four islands' economic potential despite the row with Japan, said a company called Carlson and Kaplan had paid Rbs200m for the 50-year lease. They had promised to equip Shikotan island with hotels, a casino, and riding, cycling and shooting facilities - and its first proper road. The concession could further strain relations with Japan, which has withheld any finance for the islands until they are returned to it - a hope that took a major blow this week when President Boris Yeltsin cancelled his visit to Tokyo.</p>

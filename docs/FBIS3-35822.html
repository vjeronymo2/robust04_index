			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev have agreed on the need to withdraw warships from  Kronshtadt, a Russian naval stronghold since the 18th century,  Mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak told Interfax.    Governor of Kronshtadt Viktor Surikov gave two reasons to  explain the move.    On the one hand, part of the warships appear to find  themselves in a trap after the construction of a dam in the Bay  of Finland left them with only one outlet to the Baltic Sea.    On the other, there are plans to promote tourist business  following a decision to set up a Free Economic Zone [FEZ] in  Kronshtadt whose status of a closed city hampers the project.    The FEZ project provides for the construction of a sea port  at Kronshtadt with an annual capacity of 8.5 Mn tons to be  increased to 12-13 Mn tons later which can bring about $15 Mn in  annual revenues.    The local authorities are also keen to re-commission a  facility for cleaning oil-containing waste dumped secretly by  Russian and foreign ships in the Baltic Sea. The withdrawal of  Russian warships from Kronshtadt will be taken in stages.    In the meantime, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is expected  to visit the base in mid-February to discuss all problems in  detail. It is not ruled out that the Russian Navy may deploy its  own training center and ships at Kronshtadt to train navy  personnel for Russia and other countries.    Russian units deployed at the Leningrad navy base are  expected to be redeployed at the town of Primorsk and elsewhere.    A special working group including officials of the Defence  Ministry, Navy, Leningrad navy base and the administration of  St. Petersburg and Kronshtadt will meet to discuss the schedule  of the Navy's withdrawal from the Kotlin Island.</p>

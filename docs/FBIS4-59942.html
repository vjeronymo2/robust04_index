			<p>BFN     [Text] The Saudi Arabian ambassador in our country was  summoned to the Foreign Ministry today, where the Islamic  Republic of Iran's strong protest to the Saudi Arabian  Government was conveyed to him concerning the siege of the  exalted leadership's mission in Mecca by Saudi police and  security forces.    During the meeting, Ha'eri-Fumani, adviser to the foreign  minister and general director for the Persian Gulf [title as  heard], referred to the cancellation of the ceremony marking the  disavowal of the infidels by the supervisor of the Islamic  Republic of Iran's mission. This is as a result of the  difficulties brought about made by the recent Saudi actions,  which are considered to be contrary to diplomatic -- and even  humanitarian -- conduct, and as being disruptive to bilateral  relations.    The Saudi Arabian ambassador said that he will convey the  raised matters to his country's authorities. He claimed that  the security measures were envisaged in order to safeguard the  security and health of the hajj pilgrims.</p>

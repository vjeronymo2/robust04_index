			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Celsis names chief executive Celsis International, the biotechnology company, has ended six months of management uncertainty by appointing a new chief executive to replace Mr Tony Martin, who was dismissed in April on the grounds that he was 'ineffectual'. The Cambridge-based company, which specialises in contamination detection equipment, has recruited Mr Arthur Holden from Baxter International, the US medical supplies group, where he was global marketing vice-president in the renal division. Mr Holden signed a two-year rolling contract on Friday, some four months after he was first approached by Celsis. The company, however, declined to disclose the value of his package or whether his annual salary would exceed the Pounds 85,000 paid to Mr Martin. It has yet to reach a settlement with its former chief executive, who still holds shares worth more than Pounds 1.53m after leaving with almost two and a half years of his three-year contract to run. Mr Mark Clements, finance director, said Mr Holden would help to build shareholder value in the company, which earlier this year announced increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 460,000) following a sharp rise in research and development spending from Pounds 156,000 to Pounds 984,000 in the year to March 31. That spending - using funds from last year's Pounds 12.4m flotation and income from collaborative ventures with companies such as Wellcome and Merck  -has been used to develop a range of hygiene monitoring products. Mr Holden, who joins the company on October 10, said he was determined to exploit commercial applications of Celsis' technology. 'I will be conducting a review of the overall strategy and will see if this side of the business can be developed more rapidly,' he added. In the latest commercial agreement, Celsis said it had signed a deal with Colgate-Palmolive to use its bioluminescence kits to monitor personal care products such as shampoos and body lotions. The company declined to reveal how much the deal was worth, but predicted that similar manufacturers would follow Colgate's lead.</p>

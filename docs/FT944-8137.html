			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / EU urged to push green issues Environmental policies should become an integrated part of all European Union policies, including agriculture, energy, transport, industry, regional and structural policies and relations with east Europe, says the EU's incoming commissioner for the environment, Ms Ritt Bjerregaard, a Danish Social Democrat. 'My opinion is that it could and will have negative consequences for the environment if the environment is not taken into consideration when we are discussing all these other areas,' she said yesterday. She sees environmental policy as a way for the EU to respond more to public opinion and therefore to make the EU more popular. 'I think there are in general high expectations from the citizens of Europe. The environment is one of the very big issues in which a lot of people all over Europe are interested, and I shall try to meet these expectations,' said Ms Bjerregaard.</p>

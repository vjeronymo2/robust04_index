			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: FOOD;  </P> <P> USER-FRIENDLY GARLIC  </P> <P> COOKS HAVE been using garlic for more than 5,000 years; and its  heart-protecting, bacteria-fighting properties have become as well known as its  flavor. Just as notable is garlic's aromatic calling card -- though garlic  breath does not, in fact, originate in the mouth.  </P> <P> The odor-producing components of the vegetable, called allicins, are carried by  blood stream to the lungs, where they are expelled in the act of breathing.  </P> <P> The sacrifice of social intercourse for flavor is no longer necessary. A new  line of condiments renders the pungent plant socially benign without  compromising culinary and healthful attributes. "We have simply added things so  the allicins are neutralized in the digestive process before being circulated  to the lungs," says Mr. Garlic products inventor Zain Sheriff.  </P> <P>  Mr. Garlic products, which contain no chemicals or preservatives, are  available at some Ralphs, Gelson's, Mayfair and Westward Ho markets.  </P> <P> ELLEN ALPERSTEIN  </P></p>

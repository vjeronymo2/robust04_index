			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann set back by a third on operating level HIGH start-up costs for Mannesmann's new venture in mobile telephones and weak demand for its traditional plant and engineering products reduced the German engineering and technology group's operating profits by more than a third last year. The expected downturn was confirmed yesterday at a supervisory board meeting in Dusseldorf, which also agreed to recommend payment of an unchanged DM9 dividend at the annual meeting on July 3. While sales rose 1 per cent to DM24.3bn (Dollars 14.9bn), operating profits slumped from DM1bn to DM625m, and the group's surplus fell 43 per cent from DM464m to DM263m. The group, which has been largely restructured from an old-style steel and engineering specialist, has diversified extensively, particularly into motor components. This division, which has grown rapidly to become the group's second biggest core business after plant and engineering, has been especially hard-hit by falling demand in the domestic market and persistent weakness in overseas orders for new cars. While the group's new D2 cellular telephones business is due for launch in the summer, there is some uncertainty over its initial prospects because of economic stagnation in Germany. In spite of the continuing problems of recession abroad and stagnation at home, Mr Werner Dieter, chairman, said recently that he was 'not pessimistic' about prospects for this year. He expected sales on a like-for-like basis to match those in 1991, and that new purchases, including VDO and Boge in components, would bring in an additional DM4bn turnover. In the first two months of the year order intake was about 36 per cent up on the same period in 1991. Turnover had been 29 per cent higher, at DM3.8bn, Mr Dieter said.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Riding on a wave of change - Radio Criticised since its inception in 1990 as a station without an identity, BBC Radio 5 re-launched on Monday after undergoing major surgery. Gone was the eccentric, eclectic brew of chat, sports coverage, youth music and high-grade children's drama. In came a more integrated but thinner soup of rolling news and sport, thickened with middlebrow magazine-format items. It seems safe to say that Radio 5 has shucked off the 'Radio bloke' tag afforded its remit of sport and user-friendly news. But the repeated, exclamation mark laden reminders that 'you're listening to FIVE LIVE]' only underscore the sense of a station still desperately seeking an identity. With sport, 5 Live is on solid ground: the sports news and features are impressively diverse and confidently presented. This week, there have been reports that the rights for high-profile sporting events may become prohibitively expensive for BBC Radio, as Premier League football became for BBC Television in the face of bidding from BSkyB. For now, though, 5 Live sport looks safe, although it's unfortunate that the station should relaunch during the third cricket Test against the West Indies. With comprehensive coverage firmly ensconced on Radio 4, only token reports are left for 5 Live, a cruel reminder that Radio 5 was always a poor relation. It was Radio 5, remember, that was sacrificed to save Radio 4's Long Wave from becoming a rolling news network. The revamped station, however, may have its revenge. 5 Live reportedly has first refusal on any news items or exclusives that come to its sister stations: in short, it can poach Radio 4's scoops. In the first days of the new station, though, there seemed to be precious few scoops around. Long touted, the term rolling news proves misleading, implying as it does something progressive or cumulative. Rolling news gathers little: listen to 5 Live for more than an hour and you'll hear the same reports, the same soundbites, the same chunks of actuality endlessly repeated, until you begin to doubt their validity as 'news'. While never becoming actually bloke-ish, it's during the news that 5 Live becomes distinctly matey. The station's Controller, Jenny Abramsky, has strenuously denied that 5 Live's news coverage will be downmarket, so it might have been an aberration when the trailer for one bulletin on Wednesday promised coverage of the aftermath of the Hall Garth School stabbings, John Major's alleged leadership crisis . . . and the fact that The Mousetrap was still running in London. Generally the regular bulletins are relaxed and clear in content, covering the main stories chattily but in depth. They seem perfectly gauged to meet the terms of John Birt's mission to explain. The only difference from your average report on Radio 3 or 4 is in tone. It's not just the surging theme tune that heralds the appearance of another report, nor the urgent pace of the headlines, nor the constant emphasis on reporters' names. The tone of the news is eager, snappy, almost frantic at times. It's probably what Abramsky was referring to when she promised 5 Live would be 'younger, vibrant and slightly rough'. What this means in practice is that 5 Live sounds rather like a commercial radio station, without the music or advertisements. The air of pep and pace is fostered by the constant trailers for amusing items later in the day (odd things from the BBC Sound Archives, people who want to export birdwatching to Ethiopia). Of the presenters, old Radio 5 hand John Inverdale accomplishes the balancing act of making sport, news and wacky items sound equally important and enticing. Elsehwere, the blend goes wrong. 'Coming up, Prime Minister's Question Time with JOHN MAJOR]' said Sybil Ruscoe in her Tuesday programme, giving the PM the kind of build-up usually reserved for the likes of Cilla Black. The subsequent report had an intrusive commentary ('John Smith there, having another go') which made it sound uncomfortably like a football match. The same breathless excitement characterised the trailers for 5 Live's flagship programmes. Frances Edmond's anti-bloke sports programme Women on Top, John Diamond's newspaper review Stop Press, the first national gay news programme Out This Week and the heavy-duty weekend sports coverage are all yet to come. They will play a big part in establishing the identity of a station which at present makes for easy listening 24 hours a day. And once established, maybe they'll drop the exclamation marks.</p>

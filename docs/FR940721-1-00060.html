In enacting Section 8 of RESPA in 1974, Congress prohibited all fees, kickbacks, or things of value for the referral of settlement service business. The statute, as originally enacted, did not address referrals of business to affiliated companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1980, the case of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coldwell Banker  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department of Insurance  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (102 Cal.App.3d 381 (2d. Dist. 1980)) reached the courts. In that case the California Insurance Commissioner refused to grant a license to a wholly owned subsidiary of a real estate company to act as a title insurer. The denial was based on a concept of restriction of trade. This case drew HUD and congressional attention to whether this or similar controlled business arrangements might violate Federal law. On July 24, 1980, HUD issued an Interpretive Rule (subsequently withdrawn) that stated that ``controlled business arrangements may be a violation of Section 8.'' (49 FR 49360; withdrawn on May 18, 1982, 47 FR 21304.). Two days of congressional hearings were held on September 15 and 16, 1981, and, in 1983, Congress enacted the ``controlled business arrangement'' amendment to RESPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1983 controlled business arrangement amendment represented a compromise between those who wanted no restrictions on the ability of real estate settlement service professionals to refer settlement service business to entities with which they had an ownership interest and those who wanted a blanket prohibition against such referrals. The compromise (see H.R. Report 97&hyph;532, at page 52) made clear that controlled business arrangements do not violate RESPA_allowing affiliated entities, such as real estate professionals, to refer settlement business to related entities_provided that specified disclosure requirements and safeguards are satisfied, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A requirement that the relationship between the provider of settlement services and the person making the referral be disclosed, along with the estimated charges of the provider; (2) a bar against the required use of a particular provider, except under certain specified exceptions under Section 8; and (3) a bar against anything of value being received by the referring party, beyond a return on ownership interest or franchise relationship or payments otherwise permissible under Section 8(c) of RESPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Between the enactment of the 1983 amendments to RESPA and the issuance of the 1992 final rule, HUD had issued several informal legal opinions concerning the extent to which employers could pay referral fees to employees. The opinions made clear that bona fide full-time employees could be compensated for generating business for their own employers, as this would be within the scope of their employment. These opinions also made clear that uncompensated referrals to affiliated companies were not prohibited. These opinions did  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , however, broadly approve compensation to all employees for referrals to affiliated companies. In the circumstances addressed by HUD informal opinions prior to the final rule, the permissibility of compensation of employees for referral related activities depended upon the structure of the affiliated companies or on whether the employees were acting within the scope of their employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1992 final rule went beyond any of these previous positions and created an exemption for any and all employer payments to its own employees for referrals of business, including referrals to affiliated companies. The final rule only retained the stricture that the company receiving the settlement business could not directly or indirectly compensate anyone for such business. Although the rule did not limit this exemption to controlled businesses, the exemption has little utility for entities other than affiliated companies, since it is unlikely that an employer would pay its own employees for making referrals to unrelated individuals or companies. The preamble of the final rule set forth the position that payments from an employer for referrals were exempt from Section 8 because a business entity acts through its employees; the action of the employees is not sufficiently distinct from the action of the employer to provide the requisite plurality of actors needed to violate Section 8. Although the rule permitted an employer to compensate its own employees for referrals, it indicated that if the company receiving the referral reimbursed the employer or the referring employees, Section 8 of RESPA would be violated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entities critical of the 1992 final rule have characterized the provision permitting employers' payments to their own employees for referrals as broadly sanctioning referral payments. Trade and business press have frequently restated this position without examination. Also, the Department's attention has been drawn to a number of advertisements and mailings in which various companies have cited RESPA as authority for bogus or sham programs under which fees may be paid to individuals who will become ``employees.'' While the final rule did not permit sham arrangements, neither did it adequately clarify the extent of the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

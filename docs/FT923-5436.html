			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Anxiety for the Ecu There must be some doubt as to whether the Ecu bond market will ever fully recover following a second liquidity seizure inside a month. Agreement among market makers on wider dealing spreads restored a fragile equilibrium the first time around, but the imbalance of buyers and sellers last week risked inflicting damage beyond repair. Institutional investors will be slow to forgive. Having watched market makers pile into Ecu bonds and launch a record volume of new issues last year, it can hardly be edifying to see them now refusing to trade. To be fair, extreme volatility has always been a feature of the Ecu market. Yields are not anchored to any set of domestic economic fundamentals, so shifts in sentiment have a disproportionate effect. Mathematics dictate that Ecu bonds offer value when the yield rises above a theoretical level, calculated from the underlying bond markets of countries which make up the Ecu currency basket. But this complex method of valuation has counted for little since the future of European monetary union was called into question by the Danish referendum. At the 10-year maturity, Ecu bonds now yield a full  1/2 percentage point more than theory suggests they should. The future now turns on the outcome of the French vote. One might argue that monetary union has already been factored out of Ecu bond prices, but a 'non' vote will cast doubt on the future of the Ecu as a financial medium. Ecu bonds will retain some value as a natural currency hedge, but the market could be relegated to little more than a curiosity. Perhaps the biggest hope is that European central banks - ironically, the Bank of France is chief among them - have invested a great deal of credibility in the Ecu market. If the French vote 'oui' on September 20, there will be some powerful interests vested in restoring order.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Letter: A role for all in UK economic forecasting Sir, There are three issues of importance raised in the letters from Jeremy Bray MP (April 7) and Wynne Godley (April 14). First, should the Treasury 'farm out' (to non-public service suppliers) some of its present modelling and forecasting activity? Here, I believe that government must retain, close to senior officials, ministers and parliament, a small team of experts who can understand, interpret and 'play' the model, above all for policy analysis and simulation. Provided this is done, it may be possible to contract out some of the underlying technical work. The second issue is whether the UK should continue to maintain, outside Whitehall, but largely on public money, a high-grade technical capability for this sort of work, using what are widely regarded as state-of-the-art 'scientific' methods. This has always been a matter of some controversy, but I believe a very convincing set of arguments can be adduced in favour. The benefit is not only for proper public debate on issues of government policy, but also for the advance of our scholarly understanding of the way modern economies work. Third, there is the question of the proper balance between orthodoxy and heresy, between fairly large 'teams' and more traditional scholars in the privacy of their own garrets. There is no doubt that the orthodox scientific establishment can sometimes be as ruthless as its political counterpart in the excommunicatory scorn they pour on non-believers; it is splendid that Wynne Godley (and others of the wise men) have survived this experience, and those who helped sustain them deserve praise. But heretics can sometimes display the same undesirable zealotry as their orthodox opponents, and I detect some flavour of this in Wynne Godley's letter. Insight, experience, courage, originality are very valuable in this, as in all fields of scientific investigation. But we also must pursue rigorous testing, meticulous attention to detail, the normal rather dreary routines of conventional scientific endeavour. We cannot afford to cultivate 'a thousand flowers' in this field, but we should be able to afford substantial contributions from both Wynne Godley and those he chose to attack.

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEEDS OF CHINESE NATIONALISM;  </P> <P> CHINA JOURNAL 1889-1990: AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY FAMILY DURING THE BOXER  REBELLION WITH THE LETTERS AND DIARIES OF EVA JANE PRICE AND HER FAMILY;  FOREWORD BY HARRISON E. SALISBURY; INTRODUCTORY NOTES AND ANNOTATIONS BY ROBERT  H. FELSING PH.D. (SCRIBNER'S: $22.50; 289 PP.)  </P> <P> When my mother, an unmarried woman of 22, arrived in Shanghai in 1904, the  memory of the Boxer Rebellion and its martyrs was still green. During her first  month of teaching at Miss Jewell's School in the International Settlement, she  was wakened one night to what she thought was the sound of gunfire, and running  out into the hall of the dormitory was met by some other teachers, one of whom  exclaimed, "The Boxers!" A few moments later a servant appeared to reassure  them, saying that it was only firecrackers in a street procession. Nothing so  dramatic as this ever happened to me during my boyhood, but those who had been  under siege and had survived were still looked on with awe, and the (possibly  inaccurate) number of martyrs -- 242 -- was easy to remember for its symmetry.  Growing up in Chinese territory, I knew that many Chinese still sympathized  with the Boxers in their effort to get rid of the foreigners and, being  somewhat Chinese myself, I understood that feeling, though I had sense enough  not to express it to my Presbyterian father.  </P> <P> In his foreword to this remarkably full record of one missionary family's  experience in China, Harrison Salisbury notes that approval of the Boxers still  survives in China and aptly draws a parallel between the events of the  rebellion and the essence of Greek tragedy. With the missionary's concern for  the saving of immortal souls set against pride of a totally different cultural  inheritance, disaster was inevitable.  </P> <P> The Prices were not quite the typical mission family. They heard the call a  little late in life, went to Oberlin College, as devout Congregationalists, to  prepare themselves for carrying out their duty, and arrived finally in an  inland station. Eva Jane Price wrote lively letters home; her husband, Charlie,  rather dull, formal ones. With the birth of children they became, like most  Protestant mission families, doubly vulnerable, torn between carrying out what  they saw as their divinely appointed duty and their human feeling as loving  parents. Some of the most moving passages of these letters -- rescued by Eva's  grandnieces from a wicker basket that had been passed from generation to  generation -- are Eva's assurances to her family and herself that she and  Charlie are grateful to God for taking their two young sons to himself so early  in their lives. Beneath these sincere assurances of faith, one feels the aching  arms and heart of a loving mother, who now has special reasons to cherish their  third child, a daughter, remaining with them to the end.  </P> <P> But not everything is tragic here. Indeed, through Eva's eyes we get a vivid,  often humorous, picture of what it was like to live in a remote mission station  in China in those years, struggling to learn a tonal language without gender,  number, or tense. Like most American families in China, the Prices maintained a  non-Chinese household and style of living. "Home" remained across the ocean,  and this record is broken by a furlough period in America. By this time, at  least one reader had so closely identified with the Prices that he felt like  crying out against their return, knowing how truly reluctant Eva was to go,  though understanding her sense of duty, and knowing as well what lay ahead for  them.  </P> <P> But return they must, and their final days make engrossing reading, involving  all the suspense of a popular thriller, with a sympathetic Chinese official  doing his best to protect them, their efforts to escape to the coast coming  close to success, only to be. . . . But the record and letters themselves must  be read to get a full sense of who Eva and Charlie Price were and what they  believed in and what they meant to China and China to them. And with the book  read, this reviewer found it sobering to consider that millions of the Earth's  inhabitants continue to believe in one or another revealed religion as truth  apart from the culture that fostered it and, like the members of the mission  movement, are willing to die for it.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA held a public hearing on September 26 and 27, 1991, and public comments were received for 30 days thereafter. After reviewing these comments, EPA continued its consultation with NHTSA. Based on the outcome of the consultation, EPA determined that ORVR controls should not be required at that time. The Agency took this step because it concluded, after consultation with NHTSA and after considering the conclusions of NHTSA's safety study, that ORVR controls posed ``unreasonable'' safety risks relative to Stage II systems. A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice detailing the decision and the supporting rationale was published on April 15, 1992 (57 FR 13220).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's action was challenged by representatives of the petroleum refining, gasoline marketing, environmental and consumer auto safety communities. They argued that section 202(a)(6) of the CAA created a non-discretionary duty to promulgate ORVR standards for LDVs. The court agreed, holding that EPA had no choice but to promulgate such standards, and that the entire safety analysis in the April 15, 1992 notice was flawed because of the comparison with Stage II technology, a comparison not allowed by the text of the statute.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 983 F. 2d 259, 261, 269&hyph;71 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The court stated further, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> dicta <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that the record did not establish that all ORVR systems present inherent and unreasonable safety risks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . at 261, 270. The court set aside the April 15, 1992 Agency action, and ordered EPA to promulgate regulations requiring vehicle-based refueling controls on LDVs in accordance with the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners further moved the court for an order requiring EPA to issue ORVR requirements by a particular date. Before the court ruled, EPA and the petitioners entered into a settlement agreement whereby the Agency agreed to promulgate such rules by January 22, 1994 (58 FR 33813, June 21, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to the court's decision, EPA published two  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices (May 27, 1993, 58 FR 30731 and June 17, 1993, 58 FR 33418) seeking public comment on the key issues that had changed since the last public comment period. EPA also held a public hearing on these issues on July 22, 1993, and solicited comments for 30 days thereafter. EPA has analyzed these additional comments, and has revised its proposed regulations accordingly. To support this rule, two key documents, a Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and a Summary and Analysis of Comments have been completed and are available for review in the public docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remainder of the document is divided into sections. Section II describes the various aspects of the rule as listed in the Table of Contents above, and provides rationale for the approaches being implemented. Section III describes the long and extended public participation in the rulemaking process and previous study. Section IV summarizes the Regulatory Impact Analysis. Finally, sections V through X describe various aspects of the rule with regard to compliance with various administrative requirements such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of the Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Application of the Refueling Emission Standard to LDVs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 202(a)(6) of the Act mandates that EPA promulgate requirements for new light-duty vehicles (LDVs) to be equipped with ORVR systems. In the August 1987 NPRM, EPA proposed that ORVR requirements apply to LDVs and, in this rule, is finalizing that LDV portion of the original NPRM, consistent with the statutory requirements. The model year, phase-in, certification and other requirements for LDVs are discussed in sections B through F, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Extension of the ORVR Requirement to LDTs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the authority provided in Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA is applying the ORVR requirement to light-duty trucks (LDTs). EPA is finalizing portions of that proposal in today's rules. Each manufacturer's LDTs will have to meet the refueling emission requirements under the phase-in schedule and compliance program for trucks described in the Implementation section below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reaching this decision, EPA has conducted a detailed analysis of the need for and desirability of extending the requirement beyond the LDV class. The analysis is detailed in the supporting Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) available in the public docket. The key points are summarized below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

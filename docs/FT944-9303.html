			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Observer: Richter scaled Heaving Helmut Kohl back on to his throne as German chancellor yesterday was easier said than done. In order to avoid any last-minute slip-ups, deputies were ordered to report at 9am sharp, an hour before the Bundestag vote. Six erstwhile missing deputies made it in time for the vote. One almost didn't. A pale Roland Richter, a new CDU deputy, careered into the Bundestag at 10.44 - two minutes before voting ended. He apparently looked a good deal paler after Wolfgang Schauble, the party's parliamentary leader, had finished with him.</p>

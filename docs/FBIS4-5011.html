			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] Federation of Bankers' Association of Japan  President Okuda Responds to BOJ Governor's Criticism About  "Imitating"--"Innovative Services Could Be Established If  Controls Did Not Exist"    In response to BOJ Governor Mieno's criticism of financial  institutions' tendencies to imitate each other, Federation of  Bankers' Association of Japan President and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank  President Masashi Okuda in a press conference on the 29th [of  March] said, "Banks have exercised commensurate creativity  amidst limited freedom under a variety of controls." President  Okuda also pointed out that "If management's options are  expanded by the decontrol of financial systems, competition  should increase above previous levels and we should witness the  creation of innovative services which are peculiar to Japan."    In his speech on the 24th [of March], Governor Mieno stated,  "The reason why it is difficult for Japanese financial  institutions to create financial innovations is that there is a  relative lack of a tendency to utilize competitive market  principles." When asked for his thoughts on this statement,  President Okuda said, "Banks have been restricted by a variety  of controls such as licensing systems from the standpoint of  protection for depositors and maintenance of confidence and  order," in pointing out that regulation by banking authorities  prevented the creation of innovative services. Finally, he  stated that the "industry would like to enhance the quality of  financial services by challenging themselves to offer new  services" through such actions as review of bank operations and  decontrol of interest rates.</p>

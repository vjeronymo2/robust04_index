			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1425 GMT on 7 April broadcasts a  15-minute program entitled "The Korean Knot" presented by  Vitaliy Ilyashenko. The program includes a factual account by  the correspondent on the crisis around the DPRK's non-observance  of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. A studio discussion is  chaired by Ilyashenko with Aleksandr Panov, deputy minister of  foreign affairs and Professor Anatoliy Torkunov, rector of the  Institute of International Relations.    Panov says that in view of the high troop concentration on  the border between the Korean states the situation is very  volatile there. He goes on to call for a multilateral  international conference on the problem, saying: "We believe  that we should, that it is right to use the channels in  existence -- the Security Council, certainly -- but since the  bilateral variant is not working, let us then go back to the  idea of a multilateral conference. It should be said that no  one has yet -- but we have only just put this idea forward -- no  one has yet, as they say, swept it aside -- even the DPRK,  although when I explained this initiative to the North Korean  ambassador in Moscow he already knew about the initiative and  did not react negatively to it.    "Other countries are also studying it. The United States  have come out and said that in principle they believe that such  a conference should be well prepared -- and we agree -- and they  have already put forward a set of positions that should be  reinforced during the conference. These are the unconditional  and full return of the DPRK to the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty and inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency,  and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. All of this  coincides with our policy. But we need to go further. We need  to give some sort of guarantee to North Korea and ensure the  non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula and the sovereignty  of the Korean states and nonintervention in their internal  affairs. So, there is a complex of measures to go through  before we can solve this problem."    Asked what the treaty between Russia and the DPRK would mean  in the event of a deterioration in the military situation on the  Korean peninsula, Panov says: "As the legal successor of the  Soviet Union, Russia continues to fulfill the commitments of  that treaty. It has not been denounced and the only thing, of  course, is that the situation has changed, and therefore we have  made a statement of which the DPRK has been informed: How we  interpret the article that stipulates assistance and support for  the DPRK in the event of an emergency situation of the kind.    "It was stated that assistance would be given only in the  event of an unsanctioned aggression against the DPRK. We  ourselves will analyze the situation on the basis of our own  sources of information and how the problems are dealt with. We  will assess the degree of threat, the degree of aggression and  its character, and we will operate within our legislation and  our Constitution, and we will certainly take into account  Russia's international obligations -- for instance those under  the International Atomic Energy Agency Treaty and the UN  Charter. So our position here is quite clear."    When the discussion turned to the possibility of UN  sanctions  against the DPRK, Panov says: "We believe that matters should  not be brought to the level of sanctions and that if it is  impossible to solve this within the framework of the Security  Council, then there is the option of a conference. That is to  say, there is quite a way to go before we arrive at sanctions.  We need to use every option."</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / People: Sykes not floored by Mosaic Mosaic Investments, the West-Midlands-based mini-conglomerate which last week suspended its shares, has hired Yorkshire entrepreneur Hugh Sykes as executive chairman. Greg Hutchings, the chief executive of Tomkins, who owns around 9 per cent of Mosaic, had been acting chairman after Brian Disbury, the previous chairman and chief executive, was dismissed in July. Hutchings, who has been on the board since 1987, remains as a non-executive director. Sykes, 60, built up high temperature vacuum furnace maker Thermal Scientific, which he floated on the USM in 1983 at a value of just over Pounds 3m, to sell it to TI five years later for Pounds 72.5m. He is chairman of Sheffield Development Corporation, set up in 1988 to regenerate the Lower Don valley. It is understood Sykes will continue with this non-executive role, but he was unavailable for comment yesterday. The shares of Mosaic, which has sold its engineering business, and been refocusing on marketing services ranging from plastic coat-hangers to merchandising cartoon characters, were suspended at 60p after the company failed to agree terms with its bankers for a borrowing facility to redeem Pounds 2.99m of preference shares from Rodney Day, who sold his design and marketing company to Mosaic in 1988. Group managing director Leon Angrave was also not available yesterday. Mosaic said in a statement that Sykes would conduct 'a thorough examination' of the group, see through the completion of the budget review, and hold discussions with the company's bankers 'as soon as possible'.</p>

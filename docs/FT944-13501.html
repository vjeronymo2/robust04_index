			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / France lights matchfor tobacco sell-off: David Buchan sees Seita stubbing out foreign hopes The French government yesterday lit the match for an eventual sale of Seita, the French state tobacco company - but privatisation of the 183-year-old concern may, like one of its own Gauloise cigarettes, be a slow burn. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday he was opening the tendering for French and foreign banks to advise the government on the sale of Seita, which has already chosen Credit Commercial de France and Societe Generale to advise it. Seita has thrown cold water on the enthusiasm of the world's tobacco giants by saying it wanted 'no foreign tobacco maker' to take a stake. It confirmed that it would like the state to keep nearly 10 per cent of its 100 per cent stake, leave about the same for its employees, and award 25-30 per cent to a core group of stable shareholders who might include foreign institutions. Foreign tobacco groups would otherwise be keen to take a stake in a Seita, which distributes other companies' cigarettes and has the added cashflow bonus of being a collector of taxes. In particular, BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco conglomerate, appeared to see its 1993 'financial' investment in the Banque Nationale de Paris privatisation as smoothing its path politically to an 'industrial' investment in Seita. The decision to keep foreign manufacturers out is not just because Seita considers itself, with its Gauloises, Gitanes, its Alain Delon brand of cigarette and its Johnny Hallyday lighter, as much part of the French heritage as camembert cheese. With privatisation, Seita will lose its legal monopoly on tobacco manufacture in France, a right that has become meaningless with the free entry into France of cigarettes made in other European countries. But it intends to keep its de facto monopoly on distribution of cigarettes in France to the country's 36,500 tabacs, or tobacconists. Allowing foreign cigarette makers into its capital would jeopardise the neutrality of its distribution system, says Seita, while adding nothing in terms of external expansion. Seita already has production and marketing agreements with BAT in Germany, with Reemstma of Germany in several markets in western Europe and now in eastern Europe, and with Japan Tobacco in Japan. But Philip Morris, the US tobacco giant, recently threatened to break its distribution agreement with Seita if the latter took in another foreign tobacco company as a shareholder. Seita denies ceding under such pressure, but some industry analysts believe that Philip Morris, which has 29 per cent of the French market (behind Seita's 45 per cent), could have carried out its threat. Distribution is certainly a money-spinner for Seita, whose profits rose from FFr447m in 1992 to FFr585m (Pounds 70m) last year on turnover that increased from FFr13.9bn to FFr14.1bn. Seita also collects the 75 per cent rate of state tax levied on total tobacco sales - FFr63bn last year - passing it on to the state with a two to three-week delay. The privilege of playing with the taxpayer's money for that period accounted for FFr200m of Seita's profit last year.</p>

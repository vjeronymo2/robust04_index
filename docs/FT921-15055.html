			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / MPs voice fears over investment A SUBSTANTIAL percentage of backbench MPs believes that planned levels of infrastructural investment are inadequate, according to a poll of 100 MPs carried out for the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors. Asked about investment plans over the next three years, 58 MPs thought spending plans for railway infrastructure were inadequate, and 44 believed the same for road spending plans. Sewage treatment and water supply investment plans were classed as inadequate by 47 and 39 MPs respectively, while 35 thought energy infrastructure plans were insufficient for Britain's needs. The survey was carried out by Access Opinions in November and December, and based on the standing of the parties in the present House of Commons - 58 Conservatives, 35 Labour and seven others. Spending plans in all categories were regarded with less concern on the government's backbenches than on the opposition's. Even so, one-third of the Tory MPs polled thought planned investment in railway infrastructure was inadequate for Britain's needs.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (10): Clear skies, at a cost - Western Europe is gradually sorting out its air traffic control A big improvement in the overall pattern of delays to air traffic throughout western Europe has been seen over the past few years. However, much remains to be done to ensure that the region can cope with the anticipated doubling of passenger traffic in the next five to 10 years. Forecasts that the cost to the European economy of air traffic delays would rise to Dollars 10bn anually by the end of the decade if nothing was done, have been revised downwards to Dollars 6bn. But at that level, continued government attention is still needed throughout Europe, especially in air traffic control, with the work that has been done barely keeping up with increased demand. In the UK alone, the National Air Traffic Services (Nats), operating under the aegis of the Civil Aviation Authority, handles 1.5m aircraft movements in controlled airspace annually, involving more than 100m passengers. In addition, the ATC system has to cater for much traffic overflying the UK, mainly between continental Europe and North America. UK airports have experienced a sharp drop in the number of delayed departures, despite an increase in aircraft movements, with delays at London airports down from 28 minutes on average to eight minutes over the past three years. This is largely due to the increase in ATC capacity resulting from the introduction of the Central Control Function (CCF) at West Drayton, near Heathrow, which helps to increase the volume of traffic handled. To ensure its operations not only keep pace with traffic growth but also move ahead of it NATS is investing in new facilities at the rate of Pounds 150m a year, compared with Pounds 20m a decade ago. Privatisation of Nats, now under consideration, will be likely to make it much easier for Nats to gain access to private capital markets to help finance its expansion programme. Important elements in Nats' current development programme include: The new Pounds 350m en route air traffic control centre, under construction at Swanwick, Hampshire, which enters operational service in late 1996, enabling ATC capacity to be expanded in line with traffic growth; Completion of the CCF project, to provide capacity in line with growing demand in the London terminal area, by end-1995; The Scottish radar replacement programme, including a new radar installation north of Aberdeen for helicopter operations in the northern North Sea, and the re-equipping of existing sites, one near Aberdeen and one at Lowther Hill, by late 1995 and 1996 respectively; and A proposed new Scottish and Oceanic air traffic control centre, adjacent to the existing one at Prestwick, for completion by about 2000. Much is also being done to upgrade existing infrastructures to increase efficiency, cut costs and meet international commitments, especially to Eurocontrol, the pan-European body based in Maastricht which is master-minding the region-wide improvement of ATC called Eatchip - the European ATC Harmonisation and Integration Programme. Nats' own infrastructure improvements include: A new ground-to-ground communications system comprising a core network of digital links to meet both CAA and Nats requirements; UK-wide replacement of radio-station control and monitoring equipment which is becoming increasingly expensive to maintain; and A new radar data transmission network to cope with increasing air traffic volumes and to cater for the needs of the new en route centre. On the wider European scene, Eurocontrol's Eatchip programme was created by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC, representing the governments of more than 30 countries) in 1990. Eatchip is aimed at creating a seamless Europe-wide ATC system to replace the present motley collection of individual national systems, so that as far as possible all European air traffic can flow smoothly. The core of the problem is that overall air traffic in Europe is handled by more than 50 control centres, using more than 30 different (and sometimes incompatible) ATC systems, involving many different computer operating systems and programming 'languages'. It is impossible start again, so the task is one of updating, renewing, harmonising and integrating these myriad systems. Broad targets for Eatchip include: Implementing a Central Flow Management Unit (CFMU) in Brussels by the end of 1995, supported by comprehensive radar usage throughout continental Europe; En-route radar separation of five nautical miles between aircraft in high-density traffic areas, and of 10 nautical sizes elsewhere by 1995; The progressive integration of ATC systems, after harsonisation, in high-density areas by 1995, and elsewhere not later than 1998; and Introduction of operational 'Mode S' secondary-surveillance radar air/ground data-links in high-density areas from 1998 onwards. Last June, the ECAC transport ministers reaffirmed their unqualified support for Eatchip at a meeting in Copenhagen, and undertook to make the necessary investments in each country to achieve the required convergence of individual national systems. The latter will involve the investment of more than Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.33bn) over the next three years. Eurocontrol is also preparing a 'Concept of the Flexible Use of Airspace', to ensure that European airspace is available for all users by reducing or eliminating areas currently reserved for military aviation. Further ahead is the controversial issue of which all-weather landing-aid system to adopt before the end of the century to replace the currently widely-used Instrument Landing System which is under threat from increasing use of commercial radio broadcasting signals. The alternatives are either to adopt a Microwave Landing System or move to the US-developed satellite-based Global Positioning System. Opinions differ widely throughout world aviation on the best system to adopt. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has called a conference for next March, with the aim of settling the matter.</p>

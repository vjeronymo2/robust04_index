			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> NEW POOL URGED FOR HIGH SCHOOL  </P> <P> The swimming pool at Ventura High School, closed last spring after it was  discovered to be cracked and sinking into the shifting ground beneath it,  should be replaced, an engineering study has found.  </P> <P> Staff members of the Ventura Unified School District recommended to the school  board Tuesday night that the district take the suggestion of Aquatic  Engineering Inc. and build a new pool, costing between $456,000 and $518,000.  </P> <P> The only other option is to repair cracks in the pool shell, one of which runs  nearly half the width of the pool, and to repair leaky underground pipes, said  Eric Fraer, assistant project manager with the firm.  </P> <P> Repairing the pool could cost as much as $190,000, the report found.  </P> <P> "There's no guarantee how long those repairs would last," Assistant Supt.  Richard Welcher said. "We could do it and five days later it could crack  again."  </P> <P> At its next meeting, the board will consider the district staff's  recommendation to remove the pool and build a new 12-foot-deep diving pool for  an estimated $518,000.  </P> <P> The major obstacle is that the district lacks funding for a new pool and must  find a way to pay for the facility.  </P> <P> The staff recommended that school officials meet with Ventura city officials to  discuss construction of a community aquatics center that would be available to  students for competitive training and would also be open to the public.

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Shell links to Italian group in chemicals venture Royal Dutch Shell and Montedison, the industrial arm of the collapsed Ferruzzi empire, yesterday agreed to form a Dollars 6.6bn (Pounds 4.5bn) joint venture, merging part of their chemicals businesses. The venture will bring together most of the two companies' polyolefin activities to form the world's largest polypropylene producer. Shell estimated that the joint venture, which will operate as a stand-alone company, would have polypropylene capacity of about 3.3m tonnes, nearly a fifth of global capacity. At 700,000 tonnes, its polyethelene capacity will represent only a few per cent of worldwide capacity. Both companies have been hit by the recession in Europe's over-extended petrochemical industry, although Montedison's problems are more pressing. Polypropylene prices have more than halved in the past three years. The companies said the agreement offered important benefits. Montedison's chemicals subsidiaries possessed world-leading technology, while Shell had extensive raw materials. Shell had a strong market presence in northern Europe and Asia, and Montedison in southern Europe and America. The venture will account for about a tenth of the turnover of Shell's loss-making chemicals divisions. Last month the division reported a third-quarter loss of Pounds 168m, against a Pounds 41m loss for the same period last year. The deal has been under discussion between Shell and Montedison's wholly-owned subsidiary, Himont, since September 1992. But it was delayed by the collapse in May of the Ferruzzi family's business empire and the subsequent need for creditors to accept a restructuring of L28,000bn (Pounds 11bn) of debt. Just before Christmas, the second phase of the Ferruzzi restructuring plan was agreed and this cleared the barriers to the Shell deal. The deal has been structured to avoid anti-trust objections both in Europe and the US and involves no financial outlays by either side. Montedison will be transferring all its productive operations in these sectors held by Himont and Moplefan with an estimated book value of Dollars 4.4bn, as well as Dollars 2bn worth of debt. The latter is important for Montedison's balance sheet because this debt will be de-consolidated. This was not calculated in the Ferruzzi-Montedison restructuring plan that envisages cutting Montedison's net debt from L14,000bn to L4,900bn by 1996. For its part Shell will be transfering Dollars 2.2bn worth of polyolefin assets but no debt. The assets include the majority of its worldwide operations in this sector. Specifically excluded are Shell operations in Germany (Rheinische Olefinwerke, a joint venture with BASF); Singapore (TPC, a venture in which Shell holds 30 per cent); and Japan (Mitsubishi Yuka KK, in which Shell has 20 per cent). Each partner will appoint four board members but the choice of chief executive is likely to fall to Shell. The head office will be in the Netherlands, but research - an important element with Himont's Spheriline technology coming on stream - will be in Ferrara, Italy. In 1992 Himont had sales of L2,082bn and operating profits of L237bn. This year's sales are forecast at about L3,000bn, almost double those of Shell's operations to be included in the new company.</p>

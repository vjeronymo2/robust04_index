			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: On the trash heap I WAS not a happy chimpanzee this week. I was Mr Sad of Sad City sad beyond endurance that Norway and Japan are up to their tricks again with their barbarous keenness to restart commercial whaling. I thought we had finished with whaling. I thought we had agreed that the time was long gone when we should be firing explosives into the backs and flanks of our greatest mammals so that Norway and Japan could continue to eat whalemeat and light their street lamps with blubber-oil to perpetuate an aboriginal lifestyle. The madness of humans is not something that shocks me. The thing that shocks me is our naked stupidity. If you count them up, there are about 40m ways in which we are trashing our planet and the lifeforms we share it with. Yet the moment we seem to be making progress we slam into reverse and grab our harpoons. I laugh at people who believe that humans are special or superior - citing, usually, nothing more impressive than the Sistine Chapel or our moon-landings or religions as evidence of this superiority. They are wrong. In the history of human evolution, the Sistine Chapel will be seen as a daub, the moon-landings as child's-play and our religions . . . don't tempt me. In the meantime, we keep trashing the planet. Apart from the whales, the reason I was Mr Sad of Sad City this week was because I was reminded how swiftly and thoroughly we set about this trashing when we really try. The reminder came in an article in Earthwatch magazine by Fred Hill, a writer based in Idaho, in which he describes how a high-desert valley in south-eastern Arizona, where he grew up, was trashed by modern farming methods. The valley was opened to white settlement in the 1930s by the Army and rancher-pioneers, who drove the native Americans back into the hills and eventually onto reservations. The valley wasn't particularly desirable land. But his family and their neighbours were good at what they did. 'My stepfather could read the crops; he knew the precise amount of fertiliser and water they needed and when they would be ripe for harvest. He could read the weather and know to the hour when the rains would hit. He knew exactly when to cut the hay so that it could be raked and baled and put up without being rained on . . . He knew when to pick the cotton so that it was fully developed but not so mature that it would fall from its boll and be lost on the ground. He loved the land and crops and cattle, and treated them all with the deference that was their due.' It wasn't enough. As time went on, farmers had to learn new ways. They had to become mechanics. To be good businessmen and keep full records. To understand markets. Understand investment terms. Manipulate tax positions. Develop strategic plans. Experiment with new crops. Almost overnight they had to become experts in lubricants, fuels, pesticides, herbicides and soil analysis. Few could learn the new ways fast enough. And of course the water ran out. The water in the aquifers was 10,000 years old, so even had there been rain it could not have been replenished. 'We were ignorant of the harm we were doing and ignorant of different choices that we could have made,' writes Hill. 'We were also greedy, some of us . . . Radio and especially television made us yearn for that radiant easy life, but did not show us the value of what we scorned and were leaving behind. 'We put too many cattle on the native grass, even during dry years. We overgrazed . . . and destroyed the water that we needed. We stripped the land of every scrap of sellable product . . . We poured on the fertilisers and herbicides and fungicides and pesticides in ever-increasing volume and variety, and beat the living soil into lifeless clay. We ploughed and disked and baled and levelled, pounding the soil into a hardpan impervious to water. The alkali salts leached to the top and poisoned the crops.' Sometimes intentionally, sometimes not, they killed coyotes, badgers, snakes, turtles, rabbits, ants - every living creature that they deemed superfluous to their own narrow interests. They were driven off the land. In time, says Hill, all that will be left of the fierce battles of three generations will be memories lying restlessly in the minds of their children. Norway and Japan - watch out.</p>

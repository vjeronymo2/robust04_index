			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley For the next few days the shares of Redland, Steetley and Tarmac - worth Pounds 3bn combined - should be left to political insiders. Sharp price movements in all three seem likely next week when Brussels gives its verdict on whether the proposed Tarmac-Steetley joint venture in building materials should be dealt with under EC or UK law. This is the first time London has asked to handle a case which, strictly speaking, comes within the scope of EC merger rules. The outcome looks finely balanced, though slightly tilted in favour of the UK. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, is on solid ground given that the activities to be put into the joint venture are all based in the UK. But when sensitive questions of Brussels competence are concerned, one can never be sure. The most intriguing question, though, is the implication for Redland's Pounds 600m bid for Steetley, which is too small to be referred to Brussels in the first place. Redland has made most of the early running and, subject to any trump cards Steetley has up its sleeve, looks the probable winner. But since the competitive issues in the two bids are broadly similar, it obviously matters a good deal whether they are dealt with in the same jurisdiction, namely the UK. If so, it is equally crucial whether they are referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission without disposal conditions, or whether they are allowed to give undertakings to dispose of clay roof tile and/or brick plants in a way that makes their deals acceptable. In both cases it is possible to make a regional case for and against excessive concentration in bricks. But it is hardly strong. Continued overcapacity and record stockpiles mean that there is little danger of big price jumps even in the medium term. Given the chance, the OFT's outgoing director general, Sir Gordon Borrie, should for once set aside his suspicions of the building materials industry and let both deals be decided by shareholders.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva] </F>   [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- The security guarantees  which all countries neighbouring on Yugoslavia need is a  question crucial for Bulgaria, too, and it was raised at a  meeting between President Zhelyu Zhelev and the two  international mediators on the Yugoslav crisis, Lord David Owen  and Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg, who arrived here today. Their  session with the president lasted nearly an hour and a half.    According to the president's advisor on foreign political  affairs, Dr. Zhelev set forth the principled Bulgarian position  on the Yugo-crisis, stressing that right from the outset  Bulgaria expressly stated its refusal to take advantage in any  way whatsoever of the difficulties experienced by disintegrating  Yugoslavia and to look for benefits other than guarantees of its  own national security. "We are convinced that recognizing the  four former Yugoslav republics was a move which strengthens the  situation in the region. By its act of recognition, Bulgaria  reaffirmed the right to independent and sovereign existence, as  well as those countries' right to arrange and choose a form of  government which suits them best," the presidential advisor  said, briefing the press on Dr. Zhelev's meeting with the two  mediators.    Dr. Zhelev called attention to the need of the European  Union, once it failed to take vigorous action and adopt a  categorical position and thus halt the escalation of the  conflict into open warfare, should learn a lesson and apply it  in its present actions and encourage all those factors which  could contribute to the security guarantees of the neighbouring  countries.    Earlier in the day, Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg had nearly  an hour's long talk with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov, which Lord Owen described as "a very full discussion."  "The European Union's plan of action has the full support of  the government here, which is good to hear," Lord Owen noted.  The chief Bulgarian diplomat described as "inaccurate" a REUTER  report yesterday, which quoted a senior government official as  saying that "Bulgaria would support a unified Bosnia" and "is  against the model of ethnically clean formations which we see as  unacceptable for the situation in the Balkans."    Answering reporters' questions after his session with Mr.  Daskalov, Lord Owen said that "the experience of this country of  being able to settle disputes between minorities and different  religions and different ethnic communities must be the model,"  he said. "Muslims have been part of Europe's history all  throughout history.... There is no objection in principle  whatever from the European Union, if that is the wish of the  people, for there to be a Muslim republic out of Bosnia and  Herzegovina. This has never been a problem to us," the mediator  said. He also mentioned the danger of the Bosnian conflict  spreading to Sandjak, Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia.  "Containment of the fighting has been an important part (of the  crisis management effort)," Lord Owen said, stressing the  importance of the support which can come from the countries in  the region that neighbour on the former Yugoslavia. "I believe  that the role of Bulgaria is part of the regional response," he  went on to say. "You are paying a very heavy price for  sanctions. Sadly, the rest of the world has not come up with  adequate compensation for that (the embargo losses). It is  making your task of moving towards a market economy and  deepening your commitment to democracy much harder," Lord Owen  said.</p>

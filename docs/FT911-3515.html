			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / E Midlands companies cut training COMPANIES IN the East Midlands, one of the UK's fastest-growing regions, are cutting their investment in training and fixed assets such as machinery and plant as the recession affects them more severely. That emerges from a survey of 940 companies in the region carried out by Price Waterhouse, consultants, and Nottingham Polytechnic, and published today. Investment cuts are taking place against an expectation in two thirds of the companies that business conditions will worsen over the next six months. Although the results of the survey do not reflect either the end of the Gulf war or the most recent cuts in interest rates, they offer broadly the same picture of the harsh commercial climate as other recent regional surveys. The chambers of commerce in Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, north Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire reported in their sample that 43 per cent of companies had smaller home order books and 30 per cent were finding that the number of export orders was declining. Price Waterhouse found that the worst-performing sector in the regional economy was construction, followed by textiles and clothing. The downturn in sales and profits had been most acute among Northamptonshire companies, reflecting, Price Waterhouse said, 'the county's sensitivity to the deeper recession being experienced in the south-east' of England. In Derbyshire, where last year business confidence was higher than elsewhere in the region, sales growth forecasts are now lower than for the rest of the region. Nearly half the companies in the survey expect a reduction in their capital expenditure over the next six months. Financial difficulties are now having a knock-on effect on employment prospects. Nearly 30 per cent of companies are forecasting lay-offs. The majority of wage settlements, however, are still in excess of 7.5 per cent. East Midlands Business Survey, spring 1991.

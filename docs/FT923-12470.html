			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: Busy week leaves Dow in a tizzy - Wall Street IT HAS almost been too much to take in. This week we have had to contend with the Democratic convention in New York, Ross Perot's stunning withdrawal from the US presidential election race, an unwelcome increase in German interest rates, another set of bad trade figures, the shock resignation of the chairman of one of the country's biggest computer groups, a mixed batch of second quarter corporate earnings announcements . . . and the All-Star baseball game to boot. It was no surprise, therefore, that the Dow Jones index behaved like a demented chicken during the week. Up six points on Monday, then up 21, then down 13, then up 16, then (by noon yesterday) down 35 points. The net result was slightly lower stock prices and a lot of confused investors. Taking things one at a time, the Democratic convention did what it was supposed to do. It presented a (nearly) united party and, as party managers had hoped, gave Bill Clinton's poll ratings a quick boost. Given Wall Street's preference for a Bush victory in November, the success of the Democrats' jamboree left the stocks markets feeling a little unsettled. At least the departure of Ross Perot provided some cheer. The the 12-point gain on Thursday was not so much a gleeful celebration of the Texan billionaire's demise - Perot had his supporters on Wall Street - but more a reflection of the relief that the presidential race had reverted to a traditional head-to-head contest and that a large element of uncertainty had been removed from the domestic political scene. The market's greatest fear had not been a Perot presidency, but an undecided election being sent to the House of Representatives for settlement - a politically confusing and ambiguous outcome that would probably have sent financial markets in the US and worldwide into a mild panic. The jump in shares on the Perot news also suggested that the market believed that the Texan's camp was made up of more discontented Republicans than unhappy Democrats, deserters who may return, however grudgingly, to the fold by polling day. The collapse of the independent ticket, therefore, was seen as a fillip to President Bush's chances of winning re-election on November 3. Thursday's advance in stock prices would have been bigger had it not been for the rise in German interest rates. Although the Bundesbank's rate cut could have been worse - it chose to lower the discount rate, not the more markets-sensitive Lombard rate - it still spelt trouble for the already vulnerable US dollar, which is now flirting with record lows against the German currency. Some analysts on Wall Street said that the German rate cut meant that the US Federal Reserve has less room to cut domestic interest rates again. With the dollar so weak, the Fed may be reluctant to ease monetary policy further for fear of triggering a fresh depreciation in the dollar's value. At least a weak dollar makes it easier for US exporters to sell their goods abroad, and judging by yesterday's news of a wider-than-expected Dollars 7.38bn May trade deficit, they need all the help they can get. The trade report revealed a 2.5 per cent decline in export sales during May, the third consecutive monthly fall, a worrying trend for those who had hoped that the export sector would be a big contributor to the economic recovery this year. It must be galling to a corporate executive to see his company's share price jump on the news of his resignation, but that is what happened this week to Kenneth Olsen, the founder and president of Digital Equipment, the big computer maker. Shares in Digital climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 42 3/4 in busy trading yesterday as investors welcomed the departure of the 66-year-old Olsen, who had been under pressure from his board to improve performance in the wake of big losses. Analysts said that with Olsen gone, it would be easier for Digital to accelerate its cost-cutting programme, including shedding more jobs from the 112,000 workforce. Digital's gains stood in contrast to IBM's fortunes yesterday. Like many other companies reporting second quarter earnings, IBM announced an increase in profits, but still disappointed investors who had expected better. Consequently, shares in the country's biggest computer maker fell Dollars 4- 1/4 to Dollars 96, a decline that contributed to the Dow's 35-point loss by midday yesterday. Monday       3337.31  +  6.75 Tuesday      3358.39  + 21.08 Wednesday    3345.42  - 12.97 Thursday     3361.63  + 16.21 Friday       3331.64  - 29.99</p>

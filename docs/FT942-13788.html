			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (14): Vivid history underfoot - A look at Alexandria's entrepreneurial flair The city of Alexandria is restaking its claim to be recognised as a business centre of primary importance - particularly for the private sector - after years of playing second fiddle to Cairo. Its business community never deserved the position of relative obscurity which has dogged it for the last 35 years, since the late President Nasser's brand of socialism, which meant wholesale nationalisation, effectively choked off the entrepreneurial flair of Alexandria's people. It has the largest port in Africa, capable of handling the biggest containers. Through this passes 80 per cent of Egypt's foreign trade. Winds blowing year round from the Mediterranean ensure pollution-free air - a great relief after Cairo. Alexandria has good road and rail connections to Cairo and the Canal Zone. A 1,000-acre free-zone at Amyria, 25 kms south-west of Alexandria on the road to the new city of Borg El-Arab, offers 10-year renewable tax holidays to investors. Five-year tax holidays are also on offer to investors in some areas on-shore. Alexandria should have an international airport worthy of the name, but the air force is reported to be reluctant to give up any of its military facilities to more profitable commercial traffic. At present, regular flights to Europe are limited to Athens and Frankfurt, and to Jeddah and Kuwait in the Middle East. Sooner or later - more likely, later, given the central government's ponderous decision-making process  - Alexandria will get the airport its business community deserves. It is a far easier city than Cairo to move around in, except in the July-August holiday season, when its population increases by 2m-3m, mostly tourists from Egypt itself and from other Arab countries. In its latest heyday (in the 19th century and early part of the 20th), Greeks, Italians, French, Austro-Hungarians and British flocked here in their thousands to live. That all ended in the 1950s. 'We took far too long to throw you British out,' says Mrs Amal Hamdi, the government's information under-secretary for Alexandria and Lower Egypt, smiling. Now western visitors, including British, are gradually coming back in hundreds rather than thousands, drawn by the city's extraordinary historical legacy rather than by the city beaches. Recent sun-and-sea tourism development is the only distressing feature of the city and its coastline. For some 10 kms either side of the old city centre at Saad Zaghloul square, facing the eastern harbour, the authorities seem to have abandoned all restraint in allowing construction of hideous sea-front apartment blocks, devoid of any attempt at landscaping. The result is one gaunt breeze-block and cement high-rise after another  - a visual mixture of dilapidated war-torn Beirut, Tashkent after the 1965 earthquake and Naples ribbon development at its most shabby. Cement pill-boxes on one area of the beach (an area several kilometres long) masquerade as beach-huts. There is neither a tree nor a flower in sight. There is, as there has to be, an economic reason for the shattered appearance of many buildings and the lack of maintenance in many parts of the city. Since President Nasser imposed rent controls in the 1950s, no landlord has been willing to spend more than the bare essentials on upkeep. And since they sold plots to property developers, many Alexandrians are no longer as poor as they were. In any case, this strip development is an aberration. The British regret their soul-destroying 1960s high-rise architecture; Alexandrians shrug off the mistakes of the past in favour of Mediterranean skies and making money. They do so with a measure of success and a sense of humour. Fifteen of the city's most prominent businessmen are also honorary consuls, and enjoy the extra status their diplomatic positions give them. This, too, does no harm when it comes to selling Alexandria abroad; they are all members not only of the official chamber of commerce, but also of the highly efficient and successful Alexandria Businessmen's Association (ABA: see article opposite). As in the rest of Egypt, the local economy is relatively depressed. High interest rates and the government's tight monetary policy have restricted corporate growth. But several western companies have set up packaging and assembly plants, taking advantage of the local pool of cheap, skilled labour. Braun of Germany has a joint-venture assembly plant for its electric razors; Unilever is in partnership with the local Fine Foods, packaging tea and instant foods. The owner of Fine Foods, Mr Mohamed El-Rachid, does official duties as the honorary consul for Mexico. Another prominent figure, Mr Mustafa El-Naggar, whose meat import business includes a company in Eastbourne, England, does the honours for Norway, while his nephew looks after official Danish interests. Alexandria's business community is led by entrepreneurs whose multilingual talents reflect the cosmopolitan years of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These business leaders are less interested in grandiose plans to privatise debt-ridden public-sector companies than in encouraging the small - and very small - companies which give Alexandria its commercial impetus. They have the advantage that Alexandria has, so far at least, been untouched by the violence of Islamic activists which has marked Cairo and upper Egypt. Communities in Alexandria are homogeneous enough for militant outsiders (or anyone doing anything out of the ordinary) to be quickly spotted by residents themselves - even before the police, who are regarded as rather efficient, might be called in. Visitors with a sense of history have the bonus of knowing that wherever they put their feet, they are almost certainly standing on a thousand-year-old underground tunnel or catacomb, which could date from the Ptolemaic period of Alexander the Great's successors after 330 BC. Wherever you go, well-hidden for the most part in the general clutter of buildings, are relics of the city's Ptolemaic, Byzantine, Graeco-Roman, Arab and Turkish pasts. There are also many reminders from the last century, reflecting the regimes of Mehmet Ali and his descendants. Antique shops, 100 year-old Greek and French pastry shops and cafes (some with splendid art nouveau murals), and the faded but still resplendent Cecil Hotel are all going concerns. But a visitor would be well advised to make sure that his feet are on solid ground. Freak accidents seem to be an important source of inspiration for local archaeologists. The best known Graeco-Roman catacombs at Kom El Shogafa were found by chance in 1900, when a donkey disappeared through the earth into an unknown shaft. In the 1960s a young woman, coming out of a cinema with her newly married husband, vanished through the pavement in the central Hurriya Street, the Bond Street of Alexandria. More recently, an employee of the Russian consulate, nosing around a subterranean passage, is reputed to have stumbled across a crowned head inside a crystal sarcophagus in a cavern, also below Hurriya street. Neither was ever seen again. You might call it the Byzantine version of a joint venture.</p>

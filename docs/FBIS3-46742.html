			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- A Diet member accused Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [5 January] of spending  the 100 million yen he accepted in 1982 from the scandal-ridden  Sagawa Kyubin trucking group to bribe his way into the  governorship of Kumamoto Prefecture.    Japanese Communist Party legislator Masaharu Udo said former  aides of the prime minister have told him that Hosokawa bribed  Kumamoto prefectural assembly legislators from the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] with the Sagawa money to secure LDP  endorsement of his candidacy for the governorship. He made the  accusation at a question and answer session of the House of  Councillors' special committee on political reform which resumed  debate after an eight-day recess.    Udo quoted one of Hosokawa's election campaign managers as  stating Hosokawa used the money he accepted from Sagawa to bribe  prefectural assembly legislators to secure LDP endorsement of  his candidacy. He said his investigation showed that the 100  million yen was handed over to Hosokawa "in three installments"  from October to December of 1982, when a few politicians were  vying with each other to get LDP support. Hosokawa won the  party's endorsement and went on to secure the governorship.    In reply, Hosokawa denied the allegations, saying the loan  had nothing to do with his political activities related to the  gubernatorial election.    In Japanese gubernatorial elections, candidates often have  to  grease the palms of LDP prefectural assembly legislators to win  the local chapter's recommendation as an LDP candidate.    The LDP's Tokyo headquarters often approves the local  chapter's recommendation. An LDP endorsement is considered  crucial in winning over conservative voters used to perceiving  the LDP as the most reliable provider of stability and pork  barrel projects.    Hosokawa earlier acknowledged that he had borrowed 100  million yen from Kiyoshi Sagawa, then chairman of the Sagawa  Kyubin trucking conglomerate, but said he had already repaid the  loan.    Udo renewed the opposition camp's demand that the ruling  coalition allow the Diet to question Sagawa and Hosokawa's  former political secretary Masatoshi Miyama by having them  testify as sworn witnesses.    Hosokawa has said he is not aware of the details of the  deal,  as it was handled by Miyama who was his secretary when he was a  House of Councillors legislator in the LDP faction led by the  late ex- premier Kakuei Tanaka.    Udo questioned the truthfulness of Hosokawa's explanation  that he borrowed the Sagawa money in October 1982, to buy a  Tokyo condominium and fix the front gate and earthen wall of his  spacious residence in Kumamoto.    The legislator said such an explanation is irrational  because  evidence shows that Hosokawa bought the condominium three months  before the loan and fixed the gate and wall long after receiving  it.    The long time lag between the loan and the repair is  "irrational in view of the fact that Hosokawa would have had to  pay interest of 1.8 million yen on the loan annually (if it were  a loan)," he said.    Hosokawa replied, "I borrowed the money one year before the  gubernatorial election, so it has nothing to do with the  election."</p>

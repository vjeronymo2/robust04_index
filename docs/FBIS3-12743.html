Delegation member Marwan Dudin said the delegation's  return came in the wake of a Jordanian decision, in coordination  with the other Arab parties, on suspending the current round of  negotiations as part of the manifestations of protest and anger  that prevailed among the official and popular circles in Jordan  following the savage massacre against the worshipers at the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque last Friday.    The decision to suspend the negotiations was made at the  government's instructions after holding intensive Arab contacts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Survey compiled by Sergei Strokan: "Russia, USA: Way to </F> Businesslike Partnership"; Survey of trade and economic  relations between the two countries]    [Text]  <H5>  State of affairs </H5>   During 11 months of 1993 trade turnover between Russia and  the USA comprised 2,426 million dollars, including Russia's  export--1,007.2 million, and import--1,418.8 million.    In the structure of export to the USA the main commodity  groups consist of precious metals and articles from these  metals, rare earth and nonferrous metals, chemical goods, oil  products, foodstuffs and agricultural raw materials.    Import is mainly represented by food products (wheat, maize,  barley, butter, soy beans, etc.), machines, equipment and  transport facilities.    Russian-American trade is traditionally characterized by a  considerable deficit of the balance of trade. In 1992, for  instance, import exceeded export 4.2 times. The volume and  structure of Russia's export, especially that of finished  articles, has been adversely affected by the long absence (from  1951 to 1992) of the most-favoured-nation treatment. For a whole  number of goods likely to be exported the duties imposed on us  were two to ten times higher than the level of customs duties  for countries enjoying this treatment. Among other reasons  mention can be made of low competitive capacity, the barriers  kept alive in the USA for the import into the country of  high-technology goods, and antidumping legislation. As a result,  the possibilities of exporting uranium products to the USA were  considerably limited in the past, and an antidumping duty was  imposed on ferrosilicium from Russia. Until recently there has  been a threat of antidumping proceedings being instituted in  relation to the sale of chlorinated potassium, aluminium and  steel.    As in the past, last year goods turnover was mainly  determined by our import of grain. A favourable balance of trade  in the first half-year arose partly in virtue of the fact that  due to the unsettled problem of debt Russia could still not use  credits for the purchase of grain. However, four new agreements  were concluded in June in the framework of the Food for Progress  programme, shipments of which commenced in September. In this  way Russia's import in October exceeded export, the latter  growing at a higher rate than in 1992.  <H5>  Treaty rights and legal status </H5>   The key document is the Agreement on Trade on Trade  Relations  signed between the USSR and the USA in 1990. In relation to  Russia it was put in force on June 17, 1992, during the summit  meeting in Washington.    The document makes provision for measures aimed at  encouraging commercial contacts and boosting the mutual  deliveries of goods and services, and assists in expanding trade  in equipment and technologies. The agreement regulates the  financial aspect of trade between the two countries, the  questions of protecting intellectual property, and formalizes  cooperation in the spheres of statistics and standards.  Provision is made for facilitating the transit of goods across  the territories of our countries. Agreements have been reached  on measures for the eventuality of the "market being violated"  (damage being inflicted on national industry by import), and on  the settlement of disputes through arbitration.    In June 1992 there was an exchange of notes on giving effect  to the Agreement on Assisting Investments signed on April 3,  1992. It envisages the possibility for American investors to use  the services of the U.S. Government's specialized insurance  agency known at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  (OPIC).    The Treaty on the Encouragement and Mutual Protection of  Investments (not yet ratified by the Russian side) and the  Treaty on Avoiding Dual Taxation (the exchange of ratification  instruments took place in December 1993) have also been signed  with a view to attracting investments.  <H5>  Organizational basis </H5>   In previous decades the Joint Soviet-American Commission on  Trade (in 1980-1985 its activities were unilaterally frozen by  the USA in connection with the war in Afghanistan) had a  considerable part to play in promoting economic contacts.    In 1992, on the American side's initiative, the US-Russian  Business Council was instituted in Washington as a lobbyist  organization speaking for the interests of the U.S. business  circles. On the part of the CIS there is the Council for Trade  Cooperation Between the Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the CIS  and the USA.    An Intergovernmental Russian-American Committee for the  Development of Business Cooperation was instituted in 1992 for  the purpose of promoting cooperation in the economy at a  governmental level.    Last April, at the summit meeting in Vancouver, it was  decided to set up an Intergovernmental Commission on Economic  and Technological Cooperation. The range of its interests  comprises joint activities in areas such as science, energy,  space, conversion and environmental protection. The commission  has held two sittings: in Washington (September) and in Moscow  (December). It is headed by the Chairman of the RF Government  and the Vice-President of the USA.  <H5>  Trade and political situation </H5>   In the late 1980s, after a partial embargo on the export of  agricultural products to the USSR, the US administration took a  number of positive steps. Since 1987 the United States had been  granting us subsidies for the purchase of wheat.    In April 1992 the US Congress eliminated one of the key  obstacles to Russian-American trade and economic relations--the  Byrd-Stevenson amendments fixing a ceiling of 300 million  dollars on the total volume of credits to Russia on the part of  the US Eximbank and 40 million on credits for energy projects.    As a result of the Agreement on Trade Relations Between the  USSR and the USA being brought into force (June 1992) Russia has  been granted the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade with  the United States. Incidentally, contrary to the provisions of  the Agreement's Article 1 on the unconditional provision of such  treatment, the USA extended it on the basis of an annual  waiver--temporary suspension of the Jackson-Vanik amendment  (this suspension can be unilaterally cancelled at any moment).    The Act on Support for Freedom in Russia and Nascent  Euro-Asian Democracies and Support for Open Markets, better  known as the Freedom Support Act, came into force in October  1992. It envisages the repeal of a number of legislative  restrictions of the Cold War times, but does not affect Section  IV of the 1974 US Trade Act (Jackson-Vanik amendment).    Thanks to the Vancouver accords between the two presidents  two agreements were signed in June of last year on the free  supplies of food products and two intergovernmental credit  agreements under the Food for Progress programme. The total cost  of supplies is 500 million dollars, including 71.5 million on an  unrepayable basis. Another 200 million dollars will be used to  compensate transport expenses. The term of the credit is 15  years. The interest rate is 3 percent in the course of easy-term  seven years and 4 percent in subsequent years.    In July 1993 a framework agreement was signed with the US  Eximbank on the provision of credits and credit guarantees for  the Russian oil and gas industry to the tune of more than two  billion dollars.    Last August President Clinton signed a bill on the budget  and  taxation, which also speaks about the need to extend to Russia  the benefits of the General System of Preferences.    In December 1993, on the administration's initiative, the US  Congress passed a Law on Assisting the Reform in New Democratic  Countries and on Rendering Aid and Support with a View to  Improving Partnership with Russia, Ukraine and Other  Newly-Independent States, whereby more than 70 legislative  restrictions have been lifted. This number does not include the  Jackson-Vanik amendment.  <H5>  Prospects </H5>   The creation of a treaty rights basis, the establishment of  the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade between the two  countries, the extension to Russia of the US General System of  Preferences and, lastly, the new programmes of economic aid  provide real prerequisites for increasing mutual trade.  Cooperation in investments has a special part to play. US firms  already take the lead among Western investors in the creation of  joint ventures in Russia (as many as 1,400 JVs have been set up  with their participation). American investments in our country  total c.400 million dollars. More than 300 firms have opened  their representation missions.    Work is also underway to implement a whole number of  projects  aimed at the creation of companies on US territory with the  participation of Russian capital, including those on the basis  of our advanced technology.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 2-AA;  </P> <P> WHITTIER CHRISTIAN KEEPS ITS COMPOSURE IN VICTORY  </P> <P> Whittier Christian High School remained cool during a few heated moments Friday  and relied on the hot shooting of Scott Ferguson to beat El Segundo, 71-57, and  advance to the Southern Section 2-AA final.  </P> <P> Whittier Christian will play Banning for the championship.  </P> <P> Ferguson, who was double-teamed and pushed around inside, scored 20 points and  grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the Heralds.  </P> <P> "I was expecting them to double-team me to get me frustrated," said Ferguson, a  6-foot-7 center. "Coach told me just to keep cool.  </P> <P> "I thought they would be glued to me. I didn't expect to score a lot. I thought  the perimeter shooters would have the big nights."  </P> <P> But the Heralds' transition game was working, meaning the ball found its way  inside to Ferguson.  </P> <P> It also meant a physical game that resulted in El Segundo being awarded three  technicals and losing one player, Shawn Foster, who was ejected after he was  called for one of the technicals.  </P> <P> "I was expecting that," Whittier Christian Coach Bob Brown said. "I knew they  would be physical on the boards. But I was surprised at how physical it got in  some of the other areas."  </P> <P> El Segundo Coach Rick Sabosky received two technicals, the second for walking  on the court to request a timeout after two players collided on the way to the  basket and remained on the floor. No one was injured on the play.  </P> <P> But by that point in the third quarter, Whittier Christian had built a 30-point  lead thanks, in part, to forward Paul McKinley, who sank five of five free  throws in the third quarter on the way to 19 points.  </P> <P> But El Segundo went on a 17-4 run to close out the quarter and pull within  57-38.  </P> <P> "Give them credit," Brown said. "They started taking advantage when we slowed  down. They made a run at us. But ultimately it didn't make a difference."  </P> <P> The Eagles threatened early in the first quarter, opening a 7-2 lead, but the  Heralds picked up the tempo and went on a 24-1 run throughout the rest of the  quarter.  </P> <P> The Heralds' dominance continued into the second quarter and was on a 34-5 run  before El Segundo managed seven of the final nine points to make the score  38-19 at halftime.  </P> <P> "We got the fast break going. We got the ball pushed up the floor and scored  well out of that," Brown said.  </P></p>

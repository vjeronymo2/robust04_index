If you want to  blast around town for a while, store your excess cash in the suite's  burglar-proof vault and make your way downstairs. The limousine's at your  disposal.  </P> <P> If you want to hang around, though, you won't lack for diversions. There are  four television sets. If you're feeling more civilized, though, pour a brandy  from the fully stocked bar, grab a snack from the tray of complimentary  California-grown fruits and slip into the two-story circular library with domed  ceiling. Or maybe a tour of your digs, with its original art by contemporary  American artists, would be more enjoyable. Considering you have more than 6,300  square feet to roam around in, it'll take a minute or two.  </P> <P> Too contemplative, you say? Nip into the game room, with its Persian-tiled  walls and stained-glass skylight, or knock out a few tunes on the grand piano  in the drawing room.  </P> <P> But you don't want to lavish all this just on yourself, do you? If you bring  along 20 of your closest friends, you can all partake of several wines and an  elaborate dinner prepared by the hotel's French or Chinese chefs.  </P> <P> Seems like a crowd? Not to worry. The dining room accommodates up to 50. And if  some of your crowd need to improve their table manners, exile them to the full  eat-in kitchen. It's not a hardship sentence, though, for they too can use the  special silver and china.  </P> <P> After dinner, they won't even have to leave the city. There are overnight  accommodations for 14 in the adjoining Fairmont Tower. Six of them will have to  make due in your suite's second and third bedrooms, each with two double beds  and private bath.  </P> <P> Once the gang's dispatched, take a seat in front of one of the four  wood-burning fireplaces, inlaid with lapis lazuli and marble, and enjoy the  feeling. This is, after all, a spot usually home to royalty, diplomats,  celebrities and top corporate executives. In fact, Secretary of State Edward  Stettinius used the place as his headquarters when he was helping draft the  United Nations charter in 1945. And don't forget to take in the killer view of  the city lights from your private outdoor terrace.  </P> <P> And so, finally, to bed. In your case, to the master bedroom with its king-size  bed. The pillows are 100% down, with goose feathers imported exclusively from  Ireland. Sample the bedside tray of petit fours. And if there's a problem, ring  the butler or maid; they're available round the clock.  </P> <P> In the morning, after breakfast in bed for you and your guests, all of them,  bomb down to the health club for a workout. When you get back, step into your  private bath with separate shower and marble tub with 24-karat gold-plated  fixtures.  </P> <P> By that time, your limousine back to the airport will be ready to leave, even  if you're not.  </P> <P> Oh yes, the bill. For your one night, $20,000.  </P> <P> Reservations: (415) 772-5000.  </P> <P> Source: Individual hotels  </P></p>

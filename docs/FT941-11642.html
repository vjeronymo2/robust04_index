			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Observer: The wisdom of Salomon Long-Term Capital Management, the new high-tech US money management firm led by ex-Salomon bond trading chief John Meriwether, has bagged a big fish in David Mullins, the Federal Reserve's vice-chairman. LTCM is currently trying to raise several billion dollars from investors to start trading complex financial instruments, using fancy computer-driven arbitrage strategies. At LTCM, Mullins will be working with a team of ex-Salomon mathematical geniuses, who earned vast salaries during the late 1980s and early 1990s, while generating huge profits for their employer. Vastness of salary is believed to be one of LTCM's attractions for Mullins; he clearly needs a raise after surviving on his meagre Dollars 123,100 Fed annual salary. The Mullins recruitment has nevertheless raised some Wall Street eyebrows. The reason is that Meriwether was one of the top managers at Salomon forced to resign in 1991 for failing immediately to report to the authorities that they knew their traders had been falsifying bids in billion-dollar Treasury bond auctions. Among those authorities not informed was the Fed - where Mullins was already working. Maybe Mullins has jumped prematurely - LTCM has yet to open for business. It's hoping to have raised its first Dollars 1bn package by the end of February provided that it can reassure potential investors that it can justify its reportedly generous fees.</p>

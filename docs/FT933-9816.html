			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Cheap money is no bargain: US visitors are not attracted by cheaper currencies Buckingham Palace opens its doors to the public today, providing London with a new attraction which the UK tourist industry hopes will help bring back the Americans. All of Europe's main tourist centres are waiting to see whether high summer will provide proof that US visitor numbers are on the increase. Some European hoteliers say they have had more US visitors this year than last. But despite the depreciation of the pound, the franc and the Italian lira against the dollar over the past year, and further currency turmoil this week, Americans have generally been slow to take advantage of cheaper prices. The British Tourist Authority says 1.1m North Americans visited the UK in the first five months of this year, slightly down on last year's 1.2m and still below the level of 1990, the year before the Gulf War. Visitor numbers to the UK from the rest of Europe are far healthier. Leisure consultants Pannell Kerr Forster say that occupancy in London's hotels rose 4.3 percentage points to 69.3 per cent in the first half of 1993, compared with the same period last year. North Americans, however, accounted for only 21 per cent of hotel guests in the capital, compared with 22.8 per cent in 1992. In France, the Regional Committee for Tourism said it was too early to provide any firm statistics, but added that US tourism to Paris has 'definitely fallen' so far in 1993. Precisely how many Americans are visiting Italy is difficult to determine, as the tourism ministry closed permanently this week, following a popular referendum decision in April to devolve its powers to the prime minister's office and regional governments. Although Alitalia, the Italian state airline, says passenger traffic from the US has risen by about 4 per cent this year, some analysts had been expecting a sharper increase. Many European tourism officials have been puzzled by the failure of the Americans to arrive in large numbers. US visitors to the UK, France and Italy can now get more local currency for their dollars than a year ago. On the first Monday in August this year, a US dollar would have bought 64p, FFr5.60 and L1,574 at Thomas Cook branches in the UK, France and Italy respectively. On the first Monday in August 1992, a dollar would have bought 49p, FFr4.65 and L1,088. Mr Robert Franklin, marketing director of the BTA in the US, says the authority, along with airlines and other travel companies, has spent Dollars 750,000 spreading the message that Britain is now a cheaper destination, with full-page advertisements in the American press. The authority has also sent out 'an awful lot of press releases to papers in the US'. The message has taken a long time to get through. 'It's a bit depressing,' he says. Surprisingly, terrorist bomb attacks in Europe do not appear to be the reason American visitor numbers have been disappointing. After each IRA attack in the UK, Mr Franklin says his staff have 'sat braced, waiting for the phones to ring. They haven't' Although Florence, Rome and Milan have been rocked by bombs, local hotels report few cancellations by Americans. That contrasts with US reactions in the mid-1980s, when terrorist incidents at Rome airport and on the Achille Lauro cruise ship provoked a huge wave of cancellations. Many in the travel industry point out that the price of holidays in Europe is only one factor Americans consider when deciding whether to venture abroad. Among the reasons cited for the disappointing numbers of Americans in Europe are that the US economy is recovering only fitfully, that many still fear unemployment, that they are worried about possible tax increases, and that much of the optimism generated by President Bill Clinton's election last year has dissipated. The picture has not been uniformly gloomy. Some companies that have marketed themselves heavily in the US say they have had a healthy increase in American visitors. Forte, the UK's largest hotel group, says American visitor numbers have increased significantly since the start of the year, although it declined to give specific figures. Forte says US visitors are still looking for value for money; the group's three-star hotels have had bigger increases in American visitors than its five-star establishments. Ciga, the luxury hotel chain controlled by the Aga Khan, says US guest numbers at its 19 Italian hotels climbed by 20 per cent in the first six months of 1993. At the group's three Venetian hotels, the figures increased by 35 per cent. In Rome, the figure rose 25 per cent. Ciga, which is facing a severe financial crisis, has marketed heavily to US tourists, with special offers such as sightseeing tours included in room prices. There are signs of optimism elsewhere. Mr Franklin says that a recent meeting in New York of companies selling holidays to the UK brought evidence that business had improved over the past month. Travel managers throughout Europe concur. Mr Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy Hotel group in London, says the number of Americans staying at the Savoy in July was 15 per cent up on last year. He says: 'I feel positive for the first time in 18 months.' Madame Tussauds, the London waxworks museum which is owned by Pearson, publisher of the FT, says the number of US visitors rose 12 per cent in the second quarter of this year after falling 23 per cent in the first quarter. In Paris, the tourist office on the Champs-Elysees reports a recent rise in inquiries from Americans. The exclusive Hotel de Crillon has also detected a slight increase in bookings from the US. 'Our American clients have always taken advantage of better prices when the dollar has strengthened in the past, so we should see an improvement over the next few months,' the Crillon says, adding that the FFr26,000 bill for a night in the its presidential suite would come to just Dollars 4,375 this weekend - a snip compared with Dollars 4,655 a month ago. Mr Henry Blinder, marketing vice- president at Thomas Cook Travel in the US, says that Americans returning home with tales of their travels will encourage others in the US to holiday in Europe. 'Travellers will come back and pass on the word that the value and the bargains are there,' he says. The problem is that even with newly strengthened dollars in their money belts, many Americans still find Europe too expensive. Ms Cynthia Belcher, a recent law graduate from Indiana University, has spent the past few weeks travelling in France and the UK. On her first visit to Europe, she has enjoyed the cafes of Paris, and London's mixture of bustling streets and quiet parks and squares. She has, however, been astonished by the prices. 'Food, gasoline, beer, entertainment, everything. I don't think people in the US realise how expensive it is over here.' Is she aware that she would have found Europe even more expensive a year ago? 'I can't believe that,' she says.</p>

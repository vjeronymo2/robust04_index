			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hao Hsueh-ching and Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Jerusalem, March 16 (CNA) -- The Taiwan delegation  to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species  (CITES) Asian region meeting Wednesday [16 March] distributed  pamphlets to conference delegates detailing Taiwan's  environmental protection efforts.    The pamphlets featured a report published in the US magazine  THE EARTH TIMES which came out in support of Taiwan's  environmental protection programs and raised the ire of British  Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) official Peter Knights.    Knights argued that the report, which quoted a Taiwan  Government official as saying the EIA has misrepresented  Taiwan's trade in endangered species parts, was written without  consultations with his organization.    Knights added that the EIA would call for sanctions against  Taiwan for its alleged trade in rhino horns and tiger parts  during the forthcoming CITES Standing Committee meeting.    Li San-wei, deputy director of the Taiwan Council of  Agriculture's Forestry Department and leader of the Taiwan  delegation to the CITES regional meeting, said that the threats  by EIA will increase the pressure on Taiwan.    The CITES Asian region meeting opened in Jerusalem on March  15. It will be followed by a CITES Standing Committee meeting in  Geneva on March 21 during which Standing Committee members will  vote on whether to impose sanctions against Taiwan and other  countries.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Salomon faces charge after office shake-up Salomon, the parent company of Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers, announced yesterday that it may have to take a charge against its earnings in the fourth quarter because of 'unreconciled balances' in its books that were discovered during a reorganisation of the company's back-office systems. In its filing of third quarter results with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Salomon said the charge might affect its operating results, but would 'not be material to the company's financial condition' - an indication that the company believed the problem would not seriously affect its finances. Although Salomon would not elaborate on a brief statement which said that any net after-tax impact of any charges related to the unreconciled balances would be 'insignificant,' sources close to the company said there was no indication that the discrepancies resulted from fraud. The imbalances were said to have been discovered while the company was shifting its back-office technology from overloaded central processing mainframe computers to a more flexible network of powerful personal computers. The bookkeeping mix-up comes at a difficult time for Salomon, which has been hit by large losses on its investment banking and trading business this year. In the first nine months of 1994, the parent company lost Dollars 242m.</p>

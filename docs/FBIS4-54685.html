			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, 3 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the republic of Srpska, said in Pale today that the  Serbian side has offered a truce in the Brcko area and added  that the cease-fire would be implemented unilaterally, even if  the Muslims refuse to accept it. [passage omitted]    "We also discussed the situation in Sarajevo and agreed on  the need for the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] neutrality and  restraint, and the warring sides' self-control. We included  this in the discussion on a global cease-fire which the Serb  side underlined as being in its interest -- something I also  discussed with Haris Silajdzic," Akashi said. The UN secretary  general's special envoy assessed today's talks as "a good basis  for making progress in the peace process," adding that he  thought "progress might be achieved in the near future."    In reply to a reporter's remark that the Muslim side is  complaining about the presence of the Serbian militia in the  Gorazde exclusion zone, Karadzic said that the United Nations  will be controlling the militia and that UNPROFOR has already  assumed responsibility for the job. This was confirmed by  Yasushi Akashi. We agreed that the police will be performing  its tasks under the supervision of UNPROFOR and our civilian  police, Akashi explained.    Replying to questions about a recent armed clash between  UNPROFOR and the republic of Srpska army near Tuzla, Akashi said  that this incident was discussed in great detail.    "We presented our version of the event and heard the Serbian  version, agreeing that similar situations should be avoided in  the future and that things should be resolved at the local  level," Akashi said. It was also agreed at the Pale meeting  that members of UNPROFOR's British battalion -- who have been  stranded in Rogatica for several days now -- should be allowed  through to Gorazde under conditions acceptable to both sides.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BIDDERS BATTLE FOR BRITAIN'S GATEWAY  </P> <P> Rival British and U.S. bidders today raised the stakes in the takeover fight  for Gateway Corp. PLC, Britain's third-biggest supermarket chain.  </P> <P> British investor group Isosceles PLC lifted its hostile bid for Gateway by 31  cents to $3.60 a share, valuing the company at $3.2 billion.  </P> <P> But rival bidder Newgateway, which includes U.S. investment banker Wasserstein  Perella &amp; Co., struck back within hours, raising its own friendly offer to  $3.67 a share from the $3.51 it offered earlier. The new offer is worth about  $3.26 billion.  </P> <P> Isosceles, which includes former Gateway managers, also disclosed today that it  has bought a key 15.1% stake in Gateway from another British food group,  bringing its stake in the food retailer to 41.9%. Newgateway said Wednesday  that it holds just 0.56%.  </P></p>

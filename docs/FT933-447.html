			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Fresh battle looms over social chapter THE Labour party yesterday warned that it plans to re-open wounds in the Conservative party over the Maastricht treaty by forcing a new Westminster battle over Britain's contributions to the European Community. Mr George Robertson, the party's European Affairs spokesman, said that Labour planned to link its support for legislation to increase the EC's 'own resources' ceiling with government acceptance of Maastricht's social chapter. The strategy raises the possibility of a re-run at Westminster of the final stages of the Maastricht debate, in which the opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics took Mr John Major's government to the brink of defeat on the social chapter. A parliamentary battle over financing would also threaten to keep Conservative divisions over Europe in the spotlight as next summer's elections for the European parliament approach. The government has to bring forward legislation to allow increased contributions to Brussels following an agreement at last December's to raise the allowed ceiling on the Community's expenditure. But some of the Tory Euro-sceptics who were forced into line over Maastricht by Mr Major's threat of a general election have indicated privately they are ready to oppose the legislation. Mr Robertson said that, as with the legislation to implement Maastricht, Labour would not seek to 'wreck' the passage of the financial bill. But it would 'tie its conclusion to signature of the social chapter'. Mr Robertson said: 'I am sure it will be possible to devise an amendment which will tie the government's hands'. Adding that Labour would table other amendments to the proposed bill to secure more European funding for regional and social spending, Mr Robertson said: 'This bill must get through but it is already in trouble. The government simply does not have a majority'. Whitehall officials indicated yesterday that they were relaxed about such a possibility, suggesting that only a handful of Tory Euro-sceptics would be ready to oppose the government. Mr Major would also hope to be able to secure the tacit support of the Liberal Democrats and, possibly, the Ulster Unionists. But one leading Tory Euro-sceptic said yesterday that the issue of increased funding for Brussels could well provide another battleground with the government. Many of the opponents of Maastricht remain unconvinced of the more sceptical stance towards Europe adopted by Mr Major in his declared approach to the EC's medium-term agenda. Lord Tebbit, one of the fiercest opponents of the treaty, is expected to call for a much tougher stance against integration at next week's Conservative party conference in Blackpool.</p>

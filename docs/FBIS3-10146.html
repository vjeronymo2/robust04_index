Following two days of negotiations with Paraguayan Customs  Director General Miguel Angel Britos, who had been sent to  Brasilia to find a solution to the problem, top officials of the  Brazilian Federal Revenue (the office in charge of collecting  custom taxes) announced on 25 February that the 300-percent bond  on all Paraguayan imports through the port of Santos has been  eliminated.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] President Arapd Goncz is of the view that the aim of  the coalition talks between the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is national  reconciliation. The president of the Republic gave an interview  to Kossuth Radio just before our program. Regarding the  elections, the head of state said that they took place in an  orderly manner and that the people voted for changes.    [Goncz] ``The election result is obvious. The country's  political will is clearly revealed. It cannot be questioned;  its legality cannot be questioned. If we wish to analyze the  reasons, such as whether the country voted for or against  something, the debate on this will probably last for a while.  It is a difficult test of conscience for everybody.    ``The country wanted modernization, progress. It wanted to  move toward security of existence. I am convinced that the  country wanted a change in style, which is by all means positive.    ``The country disliked something very much. I think that the  country did not like the style, because we consequently forgot,  or were inclined to forget, that the bourgeois mentality of the  country had progressed, under the surface, even during the 40  years of communist rule in spite of their intentions. So a  society with a rather bourgeois and secular character came into  existence, and its system of values in essence differed from the  system of values and symbols of the previous four years. It can  be understood that all the parties are currently battling with  the problem of self-definition.    ``The SZDSZ, as the second winner in my opinion, must decide  whether to join a coalition or not. And the greatest winner,  the MSZP, must clarify how much it will dare and how much it  will have to accept from its past and how much it can reject  from its past, and with whom and to what extent it can become a  modern social democratic party within the four-year cycle.''    [Announcer] Regarding his talks with the six parties in  parliament, Arpad Goncz said that in his view not all of the  organizations have yet managed to find a new identity.    [Goncz] "I saw the intention to be in the opposition and to  face the facts. [sentence as heard] I saw the difficulty of  facing the facts, and in some cases I saw the intention of  escaping from reality."    [Announcer] The head of state also evaluated the coalition  talks up to now.    [Goncz] "National reconciliation is definitely an aim. A  Hungarian is not another Hungarian's enemy. If we do not try to  keep selecting who is and who is not Hungarian, then I think  there will be room for everybody here, and it is in our commom  interest to build the country for everyone's benefit."    [Announcer] Arpad Goncz described the fact that Socialist  Party Chairman Gyula Horn laid a wreath together with Erzsebet  Nagy, daughter of Imre Nagy, as one of the first signs of  national reconciliation.    [Goncz] "If Gyula Horn wanted to pay tribute and express  feelings of this kind, then with the gesture of laying a wreath  at the symbolic grave of the 1956-ers and at the grave of Imre  Nagy, together with Erzsebet Nagy, daughter of Imre Nagy, he  simply expressed something without words."    [Announcer] In conclusion, Arpad Goncz cautioned against the  new goverment laying its hands on the press because, according  to the president, this affair could explode at any time.</p>

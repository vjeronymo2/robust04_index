			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (11): Recovery is delayed by a sick economy - Japan's Stock Market THE TOKYO stock market has suffered a heavy fall since reaching its peak just before the close of 1989. Since then, it has dropped by about 57 per cent, compared with a rise of about 12 per cent for the UK stock market and an 18 per cent rise in US equities. Since the start of 1990, the Nikkei average has underperformed the Dow Jones and the FT-SE 100 by more than 60 per cent. But despite this underperformance, analysts and fund managers do not believe that Tokyo's long-awaited recovery has begun. Poor earnings growth, a slowing economy, falling property prices and an increase in bad loans outweigh the potential benefits of a further cut in interest rates this year and last year's official measures to support the stock market. The state of the Japanese economy is the main reason for investors to be cautious. In mid-January, Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister at the ministry of international trade and industry and one of the country's top economic policymakers, warned that the economy would only begin to recover in the autumn at the earliest. Mr Rod Birkett, fund manager of Flemings Japanese Investment Trust, believes that the Japanese economy may not show signs of a sustained recovery until possibly 1994. Furthermore, the stock market will have difficulty in pre-empting a recovery in the economy, because of the loss of confidence among investors. However, he believes that 1993 might still provide a good opportunity to buy Japanese equities, especially for investors prepared to take a longer-term view of the market. He would hope to be fully invested later on this year - the cash position of his Pounds 180m trust is just under 5 per cent at present. Mr Robert Hook, a senior fund manager of Japanese equities at Prolific Asset Management, is wary of the market at present, because it is being artificially supported by public money, as a result of the government's package to help the stock market. He also finds it difficult to find value in a market which he believes does not yet reflect the fundamentals of the economy. The views of fund managers are broadly in line with the forecasts of brokers. SG Warburg, in its 1993 outlook, says that the potential rewards in overweighting the Japanese market at current levels seem rather meagre, while the risks remain high. Furthermore the stock market's valuations (for example, it is trading on a prospective price/earnings ratio of more than 50, compared with around 16 for the US, about 13 for the UK and just under 9 for Hong Kong) do not appear inviting to the broker, unless there is a more rapid pick-up in profits than it thinks likely. Warburg agrees that the declared buying interest of public funds is playing a blocking role, but this cannot provide a new impetus for equities on its own. Therefore the broker forecasts a decline in the market indices of 20-25 per cent over the first four to six months of 1993, and looks for the market to bottom in the second quarter. James Capel is more positive about Japan than other brokers. In its 1993 outlook, it believes that, after a dismal 1992, the market may already have seen the bottom. The broker expects further gains in 1993, with a target of about 20,000 on the Nikkei for the year-end, and about 1,540 on the Topix index. The indices currently stand at 16,500 and 1,270 respectively. Capel agrees that the market's supply-and-demand problems are not yet behind it, and expects continued selling by tokkin, or specified money trusts, this year, although not as heavy as in the first quarter of 1992. Nevertheless, Capel believes the gradual recovery of the Japanese economy, combined with a more tangible improvement in the US, will make 1993 a good year for the electrical sector. Warburg also sees some pockets of optimism in the Tokyo market. For example, it believes that the ratings of non-financial shares, such as capital goods producers and consumer product manufacturers, are not too demanding. Prolific's Mr Hook believes the restructuring of the Japanese economy, as manufacturing companies turn away from a policy of making wafer-thin profit margins on high-volume sales towards one of greater profitability and competitiveness, will provide a longer-term investment theme for investors. Fleming's Mr Birkett says an improvement in Japanese companies' return on equity over the 1990s will feed through into better profits, which will in turn reduce the p/e ratios of individual stocks. At the beginning of this year, return on equity in Japan was a low 4.5 per cent, compared with 15 per cent in the US.</p>

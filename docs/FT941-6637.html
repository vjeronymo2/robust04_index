			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: Businesses seek compensation fund - In a Nutshell Should companies investigated, but cleared, by the Inland Revenue, receive compensation for their costs? Companies in this situation are calling for a central fund to help alleviate what can be a damaging experience for smaller companies. During an investigation, they are often required to produce large numbers of historic statements, for which banks charge. Even if there is no direct cost, the loss of key management time can extract a very high price in time and wasted opportunities. Ironically, as the law stands, companies might be better off going to court to clear their name. If they won the case, costs would normally be awarded against the Inland Revenue and would include costs for preparing the case.</p>

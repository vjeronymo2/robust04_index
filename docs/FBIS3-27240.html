			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 20 (XINHUA correspondent Zhang  Chengzhi) [dateline as received] -- To his total disappointment,  through the entire morning Zhang Guoquan found only ten people  coming to him to apply for jobs at a major subsidiary of the  state-run Capital Iron and Steel Company in Beijing.    Zhang, an official in the personnel section of the No. 1  steel-rolling plant under the company, began hiring new workers  at the western district labor placement center on February 18.    "My plant plans to hire 100 new workers this year, as many  as  in 1993. We spent all of 1993 hiring these 100 people," he said.    Gone are the days when his plant was a popular workplace for  young people, although it still offers high pay and fringe  benefits, he said.    In the same center, however, a Beijing-based bicycle store  found 20 people applying in the same morning for five jobs it is  offering.    The store sells bikes built by the Zhonghua Bicycle (group)  Company in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, with annual sales  reaching 35 million yuan.    Some 100 businesses open hiring stands in the center on  Wednesday and Friday mornings, receiving more than 2,000  job-seekers.    Wang Zhenliang, manager of the center, said, "With the  two-way choice available, the competition between employers and  job-seekers is becoming increasingly fierce."    Using computerized information, the center serves as a  go-between for employers and prospective employees, he said.    To date, Beijing has set up 63 job placement agencies like  the western district center. Seeking jobs in these agencies are  young people, workers from bankrupt companies, workers in  state-owned enterprises who want to move to better-paying  companies, retirees and farmers.    An official from the Chinese Labor Ministry said that  China's  labor system is undergoing a "sweeping change" as a result of  the establishment and improvement of labor markets.    The change is characterized primarily by the abandonment of  job assignment by the government and a two-way choice between  employers and job-seekers, he said.    Zhao Zhiqiang, chief of the labor market section of the  ministry, described the establishment of labor markets as an  "important link" in establishing a market economic structure in  China.    "The establishment of labor markets requires the reform of  the distribution system in enterprises and the establishment of  a social security system," he said.    These markets include job placement agencies, job training  centers and unemployment insurance companies, he said.    According to Zhao, 15,000 job placement agencies in major  cities and rural townships provide jobs for eight million people  a year.    China currently has 2,100 unemployment insurance companies  providing services to 73 million workers and 200,000 labor  service companies employing a total of nine million people.    Economists in Beijing agreed that labor markets are still in  the making in China because enterprises have not been granted  the authority to fire workers and set wages according to  workers' performance.    The Chinese Government plans to carry out a series of new  reforms in the near future, in an effort to cultivate labor  markets, one economist said.    These will include measures to enable non-state-owned  businesses to set wages through management-labor negotiations  and to permit state-run companies to set performance-based wages.    Furthermore, the government will also set minimum wages as a  measure to regulate distribution and grant state-run enterprises  the authority to decide on how many people they need to employ,  he said.</p>

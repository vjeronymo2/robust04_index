			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sviltana Viktorova on former parliamentary </F> speaker Ivan Plyushch's meeting with journalists; place and date  not given: "To Organize or Disorganize Elections?"]    [Text] An assessment of the first week of work of  Ukraine's new Supreme Council, legislative collisions, the  course of the presidential election campaign as well as of the  campaign for the election of local bodies of government and  self-government, and interrelations between branches of power --  these and other questions were discussed by Ivan Plyushch,  Ukraine's people's deputy and chairman of Ukraine's Supreme  Council of the preceding convocation, during a meeting with  journalists.    "Of course, Ukraine's Supreme Council has demonstrated its  striving to proceed, as soon as possible, to considering topical  problems in the life of our society in order to open up a wide  road for economic reforms." This is the general assessment of  the beginning of the work of the session given by Ivan Plyushch.  "However, no matter how much we would want to separate politics  from the economy and the economy from politics, it is impossible  because it is meaningless to expect that economic reforms will  be implemented before political reforms are completed."    Nor can we bypass organizational questions. One of them, in  the opinion of Ivan Plyushch, is the approval of powers of the  deputies by the credentials committee, as is stipulated by the  Constitution. It is only after the mandates of the deputies are  approved that decrees and laws adopted by the parliament may be  considered valid. I. Plyushch stressed that the provisional  credentials committee acted in conformity with the current  legislation and in conformity with the constitution. It made a  proposal, but the discussion and voting did not proceed quite  consistently. As Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch] pointed out, it  was not quite ethical either. It would have been correct if,  after recognizing the powers of the 331 deputies, the parliament  had resolved to adopt the decree as a foundation and put its  every item to the vote. The deviations from the procedure and  procedural violations led to an ethical failure. The voting  results could be the same, but the procedures would be observed.  However, it so happened that the results were not achieved in  the best possible way, and the parliament could be accused of  excessive politicization, settlement of accounts, and  unconstitutional character. However, on the last day of the  past working week, the parliament adopted the right decision,  having authorized the provisional credentials committee to  continue clarifying the reasons why elections in electoral  districts Nos. 367 and 300 were considered to be valid or  invalid and then adopt an ultimate decision.    As regards those clauses in the Ukrainian presidential  message to the parliament where the inexpediency of holding  elections of local power bodies and presidential elections is  argued, Ivan Plyushch, in his talk with the journalists,  chronologically accounted for the course of arriving at the  decision on holding parliamentary, local council, and  presidential elections. He recalled, in particular, L.  Kravchuk's statement on the need for such elections. L.  Kravchuk said the following: My opinion is that, taking into  account the difficult situation and the fact that all branches  of power do not have sufficient authority and, one can even say,  that they have a very low prestige, it is necessary to hold  elections at all levels. It is normal. That is why, to resolve  this question, we must adopt, in this audience, a decree on  early elections to all branches of power, including the  president. Let us not waste time and not make allusions as to  who is to blame and who is not to blame. People themselves will  make a choice: If they elect left-wingers, the left wing will  come to power; if they elect right-wingers, the right wing will  come to power; if they elect centrists, then centrists will come  to power and will govern Ukraine. The main thing is to have a  state.    There were also the following words by the Ukrainian  president: "Before my voters and before the whole nation, I  declare from the Supreme Council's podium that, on the day when  the new parliament convenes for its first session, I will turn  to it with a request to organize Ukrainian presidential  elections."    Now, stressed I. Plyushch, read Leonid Makarovych  [Kravchuk]'s appeal to the parliament and you will see whether  he seeks to organize or rather disorganize elections, something  that he has been doing for the last three months. In January,  when the Supreme Council discussed the question on holding a  referendum on the main constitutional principles of organizing  the state power and Leonid Makarovych was already at the Supreme  Council's podium, a deputy asked him a question: "Will you  agree to being re-elected as president in June?" L. Kravchuk:  "The Supreme Council has adopted a decree." Voices from the  audience: "Will there be presidential elections?" L. Kravchuk:  "This is not up to me to decide, this question has already been  resolved. The Supreme Council adopted a decree. Why are you  asking me? The question has been resolved." I remind you that  that was on 25 January. Now, I will tell you that in his recent  interview, Leonid Makarovych pointed out that, over one or one  and one-half years he had been hearing demands at the Supreme  Council that powers be divided among the president and the head  of government. So, I did everything in order to have a single  head of executive power. If there had been 300 votes in favor  of making the prime minister head of executive power, something  that I hoped would happen by 12 April, I wouldn't have cared  about presidential elections at all. However, after 12 April, I  became firmly convinced that this would not be approved by 300  votes. That is why presidential elections will take place.  Taking into account those contestants who were on the list, I  believed that I also had reasons to be an alternative to them.    Asked whether he thought about a future state model, Ivan  Plyushch pointed out that he considered the question  inappropriate and referred the journalists to materials of the  session of the 11th convocation that was held in February 1990;  they are included in the book "Who Are We and Where Are We  Going?" That far back, Ivan Plyushch was in favor of further  democratization and glasnost in our life; he insisted upon  putting an end to violation of objective economic laws, adopting  state acts on land and on property, investing our sovereignty  with real content, and building relations within a free union of  states.    "We are not Germany, not France, not the United States, and  not Canada. We are Ukraine with its own specific  characteristics, mentality, people, and consciousness,"  continued Plyushch. "However, if we say that success lies in  federalization, this will be incorrect as also incorrect is the  statement that success lies in a unitary state. L. Kravchuk  said that the Union was a federation, and look what it led to.  I do not share his opinion, since had the Union been a  federation, as was stipulated in the 1922 agreement, it would,  perhaps, never disintegrate. In accordance with that agreement,  Ukraine had the right to have its own armed forces, not to  mention other things. However, are we, today, ready for a  federation? We are not ready. The development of productive  forces and the structure of production are such that they will  not make it possible to have a federation in its classical form.  However, this does not mean that we should never strive to  achieve normal development of productive forces in regions or  should not cultivate attitudes of masters and citizens among the  population. All of our misfortunes are due to the fact that,  instead of the Moscow center, we have created a Kiev one and  that we are trying to copy everything. Why are we afraid of  regional initiative or of delegating powers? It is necessary to  grant such powers at a legislative level within oblasts with the  help of which it would be possible to resolve an overwhelming  majority of local problems and not to go to Kiev for that. I  worked as head of an oblast executive committee for six years.  At that time, the oblast annually transferred millions  [monetary unit not specified] to the republican budget, and  then, over a year, we received less than 10 percent of that  money. It took me a lot of time to beg the authorities for  those funds."    I. Plyushch expressed a conviction that [presidential]  elections will be held:    "Four or five persons have been nominated as candidates for  council chairmen at various levels. There are five persons for  every deputy seat. That is why there is no logic in postponing  the elections. Besides, presidential representatives are ready  to run for council chairmen. Therefore, it is already  impossible to disrupt elections, also presidential ones. I have  proposed my candidacy, so that my conscience before Ukraine  would be clear, since there are citizens who share my opinions,  and I cannot betray them. I do not undertake to forecast the  outcome of the elections. No matter whom I will have to contend,  I will fight to the very end."    During the meeting, Ivan Plyushch also detailed his thoughts  on other problems of the state -- economic, political, and  ecological.</p>

"The IAEA did not say anything specific on that part," Ham  Myong-chol, director-general of the International Organizations  Bureau, said when asked if IAEA safeguards in North Korea had  been compromised.    "The agency only concluded that it could not verify the  diversion, but it seems that there wasn't a problem on that part  (continuity of safeguards) of the issue," he said.    If true, the international community would still have room  for diplomatic negotiations with North Korea on resolving the  inspection issue before taking it to the Security Council for  punitive measures.    The IAEA issued a statement from its Vienna headquarters  that  its inspectors were not allowed full access to the North Korean  radiochemical laboratory, regarded by the agency as a nuclear  reprocessing plant and the key part of Pyongyang's covert  weapons program.    The U.N. agency has decided to convene a special Board of  Governors meeting on March 21.    Ham said the inspectors saw all but a few important parts of  the radiochemical laboratory. "The question of diversion will  be the key issue at the March 21 meeting," he said.    The results of the meeting will be reported automatically to  the U.N. Security Council, which alone must decide on whether to  intervene, Ham said.    The IAEA board is expected to adopt a resolution expressing  concern and regret over the restricted inspections and demanding  immediate access to relevant areas, he said.</p>

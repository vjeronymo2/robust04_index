			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: EFG sets meeting date EFG has set May 9 as the date for an extraordinary general meeting called by dissenting shareholders who object to the group's divestment from the forestry management business, writes Steven Watkins. The agenda for the EGM includes motions calling for the removal of Mr Alan Joynes, chief executive, and the declaration of a dividend. Cazenove, EFG's advisers, said the dissenting shareholders were lead by Mr Michael Chambers, who controls 6 per cent of the company's stock, personally and through his company New Forest Holdings. It is believed that Mr Chambers' supporters account for another 4 per cent of EFG's stock. Mr Joynes said the EGM motions cover the same ground as was considered at the AGM.</p>

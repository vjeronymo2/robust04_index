			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Big PVC maker to lift prices by 10% EVC, the joint-venture between Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK and the Italian group Enichem, has announced a 10 per cent increase in polyvinyl chloride prices. The western European PVC industry has been losing DM1bn (Pounds 400m) a year, says EVC, Europe's largest PVC manufacturer. EVC said it was raising the price of grades for pipes to a minimum of DM1.20 a kilogramme, and DM1.25 for other grades from October 1. Prices of pipe grade PVC slumped from DM1.75 in 1991 to below DM1 last year. The industry reckons its needs prices of about DM1.45 to break even. Attempts by west European manufacturers to increase prices by about 30 per cent last year not only failed but led to a cartel investigation by the European Commission. The company justified the latest increase by arguing low European prices had driven imports away to non-European markets. This had led to an increase in demand for EVC's products during the summer, it claimed. The PVC market has been swamped by falling demand and increased imports from eastern Europe.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KITCHEN CABINET: COOK'S TOUR OF WHAT'S SELLING IN TRADITIONAL, MODERN METAL  BAKEWARE  </P> <P> A few pieces of banged-up metal bakeware are not an uncommon sight in the  kitchen. Occasionally, people buy new pans but won't give up scratched, warped  and rusty tin pans, distorted sheets and jellyroll trays, or corroding and  grease-stained loaf pans.  </P> <P> True, these metal baking utensils may last for years, but rarely do they look  new and in perfect shape. Pans made of tinned steel, for instance, darken upon  constant use but improve baking performance. But it's hard to give up old  bakeware, particularly if it has served you well.  </P> <P> For cooks pondering the upgrading of pans for new or remodeled kitchens -- or  for those getting ready for holiday baking -- here's a shopping list of what's  currently available in the world of metal bakeware:  </P> <P> Shapes and function have not changed much, but modern baking utensils offer new  finishes or coatings that conduct heat better and prevent sticking. Today,  you'll find a greater variety of muffin pans, from maxi to mini to micro-mini  sizes, as well as various types of bread and tart pans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sturdy and Sleek  </P> <P> Ever since it first came out a few years ago, the La Forme selection of  bakeware from Kaiser has caught my eye for its sturdy look and sleek dark-gray  finish. Produced in West Germany, the smooth bakeware is made of heavy-gauge  steel with a double silicon nonstick coating (inside and out) that is lead and  cadmium free.  </P> <P> Although it is almost three times thicker than other bakeware, La Forme has  excellent conductivity and produces even heating. When using the pans, it is  best to check for doneness before the suggested time in the recipe is up  because the dark pan tends to cook slightly faster than light-colored pans.  </P> <P> Aside from the traditional shapes, such as heart, flan and springform pans,  Kaiser's La Forme includes pans that produce pretty forms in cakes.  </P> <P> The 11-inch round baking pan called Celebration Cake Tin and the Daisy Cake Pan  have embossed slices and ragged edging. The radiating fanlike effect obtained  in the finished cake is so attractive that it doesn't need to be frosted or  decorated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fancy Bread Mold  </P> <P> Another product, called the half-round loaf tin, is a 12-inch-long ribbed mold  that can be used for making the Austrian rehrucken cake or fancy breads. The  only drawback with La Forme is that its springform pan with smooth, removable  base does not have an inner lip. We baked a cheesecake in it beautifully, but  experienced a slight leaking of the melted butter from the crust while baking.  </P> <P> The newest from La Forme (available by next month) is the La Forme Duo. The  line includes baking and roasting pans in two sizes -- a large baking sheet and  a square cake pan. What's attractive and different about these heavy-gauge pans  is that they are super-glossy and smooth. With a silicate-magnum surface, the  pans are protected from cutting scratches and acidic foods.  </P> <P> If you insist on having tinned steel because you believe in "the more you use  it, the better it becomes," Chicago Metallic produces a whole line of  commercial-weight tinned steel bakeware called Village Baker. The pans season  with use, meaning the tin and steel fuse and turn bluish-gray. The only  disadvantage with the tin pans is that they cannot be placed in the dishwasher  because they rust.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Perforated Pans  </P> <P> Chicago Metallic offers two new perforated pans that prevent sogginess in baked  goods: a double French Bread Pan ($17) that is similar to those used by  commercial bakeries, and a shallow baking tray ($17) for rolls and croissants.  Another new item from Chicago Metallic is the dishwasher-safe Sure-Bake Cookie  Sheet ($20), a 16x14-inch baking sheet which is three layers thick. The  thermal-layered feature insures even baking and prevents burned cookies.  </P> <P> Not new but advantageous for weight watchers is the Village Baker lean meat  loaf pan set ($9.95). The set consists of two meat-loaf pans; the inner pan is  lined with holes that allow meat drippings to drain into an outer pan. This is  also available in SilverStone finish for nonstick baking.  </P> <P> Extremely well-known in Europe, Dr. Oetker products have finally hit the  culinary shelves of local stores. Distributed by Leifheit of West Germany, Dr.  Oetker is a bakeware manufacturer that represents three lines: Profi, Tradition  and Bakita.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traditional Shapes  </P> <P> The top of the line is Profi, a high-grade nonstick-coated group that is  protected against fruit acids and features a six-year guarantee. Next in line  is Tradition with its nonstick black coating and three-year guarantee. The  third group is Bakita in rustproof tin with an electrolytic coating. Like other  brands, the Dr. Oetker pans offer traditional shapes, including the gugelhupf  mold.  </P> <P>  The beauty of pewterware in bakeware is captured in Wilton Armetale's  Lasagna/Open Roaster ($79.95). The 5-quart pan measures 14 1/2x10 1/4x3 1/4 and  is pretty enough to serve from at the table. Wilton Armetale features excellent  heat and cold retention.  </P> <P> The Chicago Metallic Bakeware and Kaiser La Forme Bakeware are available at  better cookware shops and by telephone order through Chef's Catalog: (800)  338-3232, and Williams-Sonoma: (415) 421-4242.  </P> <P>  The Wilton Armetale Lasagna/Open Roaster soon will be available in department  stores and specialty cook stores and is presently available by telephone order  through Chef's Catalog.  </P> <P>  Dr. Oetker's bakeware are available at Montana Mercantile, Lets Get Cookin'  (Westlake Village), Barbara's (Ventura) and Ingrid's Gourmet (Ventura).  </P></p>

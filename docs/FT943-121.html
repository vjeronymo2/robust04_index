			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: UBS claims Ebner seeks control Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, last night said it had strong reason to believe that a concert party was being formed to acquire control of the bank on the cheap. That is why the bank earlier yesterday proposed the conversion of all its registered shares into bearer shares, thereby diluting their voting power. UBS made clear that it believed Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group was behind the effort to gain control. BK Vision, an investment company controlled by BZ, is UBS's largest shareholder, and has built up an 18 per cent stake in the registered shares worth about SFr1.2bn (Dollars 930m). The UBS move would considerably dilute the voting power of this class of shares. The registered shares have a par value of SFr20. In effect, they have five times the voting power of SFr100 bearer shares. Mr Ulrich Grete, UBS deputy chief executive, said officials of BK Vision had met bank directors recently and indicated they wanted to win enough support from shareholders to make significant alterations to the board of the directors and orient the bank's strategy to maximise return on equity. The bank said the registered shares were created in 1975 to prevent foreign control of the bank. At the time, money from the Middle East was pouring into Swiss securities. 'It is evident that the registered shares with restricted transferability are today used by some shareholders to get an influence on UBS's strategy which is far beyond their financial involvement'. It said the spread between the recent prices of the registered shares and bearer shares had 'resulted in complaints by large private and institutional investors'. Mr Ebner said the UBS move to dilute registered shareholders' voting rights appeared to be a serious attack on Swiss securities law. He was confident it would not succeed. At yesterday's closing prices, the registered shares were at a 34 per cent premium to the bearer shares. BK Vision has had several skirmishes with UBS in the past two years. Last week, the Zurich commercial court ruled in favour of a BK suit claiming that UBS had illegally violated shareholder rights by creating pools of capital that could be used at the board's discretion for acquisitions or convertible bond issues. Earlier this year, a BK motion to the UBS annual meeting proposing a cut in board membership from 22 to a maximum of nine attracted about 40 per cent of the votes. A year ago, BK complained about the bank's decision to sack Mr Christoph Blocher, a BK ally, from the board. Two weeks ago it criticised the bank for becoming too dependent on volatile securities trading activity for its profits.</p>

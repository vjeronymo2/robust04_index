			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Redland better than expected with Pounds 279m Pre-tax profits of Redland, one of Britain's biggest building material groups, jumped by 40 per cent last year from Pounds 199m to to Pounds 279m. Comparisons between the two years were distorted by profits and losses on the disposal of businesses and properties. A better guide to performance was a 28 per cent rise in operating profits, after interest payments, to Pounds 267m (Pounds 208m). The shares, following the better than expected results published on Thursday, rose 15p to 539p. The market was also encouraged by the company's comments about the continuing strength of the German housing market and rising UK building material prices. The company said it had generated Pounds 297m of cash during 1993, compared with an outflow of Pounds 369m in 1992. This had enabled it to reduce net borrowings from Pounds 661m to Pounds 384m and gearing from 67 per cent to 43 per cent, including auction market preferred stock as debt. Turnover rose from Pounds 2.09bn to Pounds 2.47bn. Earnings per share rose to 26.1p (23.7p), adjusted for the loss on the disposal of an investment in an associate. The maintained final dividend of 16.75p makes a same-again total for the year of 25p. Mr Robert Napier, chief executive said: 'In the UK prospects do at last look more encouraging, with the housing market improving. After many years of decline, building material prices and margins are now recovering. The changes to the road programme announced by the government are unlikely to have any adverse impact in 1994 and 1995.' UK operating profits in 1993, excluding Pounds 6m for the costs on plant closures, rose from Pounds 24.8m to Pounds 28.8m. Trading remained strong in Germany. Housing permits issued in eastern Germany more than doubled and over the country as a whole the rise was 22 per cent. German operating profits increased from Pounds 115m to Pounds 150m. Profits from the US more than doubled to Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 26.7m) assisted by increased sales in Florida following Hurricane Andrew and the completion of Denver's new international airport. These special factors may not be repeated, but the company was encouraged by rising US construction activity as the economy continued to improve. Mr Napier said that elsewhere in Europe the outlook was mixed, with the Netherlands steady but little sign of improvement in France. Australia and the Far East were trading well. Overseas profits, in total, rose from Pounds 209m to Pounds 281m. See Lex</p>

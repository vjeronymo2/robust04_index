			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Starters' orders for three London racecourses EPSOM, home of the Derby, came under starters orders yesterday as the Horserace Betting Levy Board put it up for sale along with Kempton Park and Sandown Park. The board  - a statutory body which collects a levy from bookmakers for the benefit of the racing industry  - acquired the three courses more than 20 years ago. Together they comprise almost 1,000 acres of land inside the M25, and were considered to be in danger from property developers. Estimates of their value now range between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m. Mr Rodney Brack, chairman of the Levy Board, said yesterday that the privatisation of the courses, which traded profitably last year, had been under consideration for the past two years. Racecourse Holdings Trust, a subsidiary of the Jockey Club, immediately said it would be making an offer. The trust owns nine courses, including Cheltenham and Newmarket, and ploughs all its profits back into racing. Mr David Hillyard, managing director, said the value would have to be based on the possible returns from racing, and dismissed a figure of Pounds 50m as 'fanciful.' Mr Tim Neligan, managing director of United Racecourses, said that the trust seems to be the favourite.</p>

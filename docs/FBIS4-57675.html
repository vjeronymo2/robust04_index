			<p>BFN     [Text] Enrique Ter Horst, chief of ONUSAL [UN Observers for  El Salvador], said he believes the peace agreements could be  mostly implemented by 1 June so as to "clear the table" for the  next president. Ter Horst said hard work is being done to  conclude this week the rescheduling of the agreements, the  fulfillment of which have been delayed. "Efforts are being made  to finish the discussion of the topics that are still pending,"  he said. "The effort to reschedule the implementation of the  agreements between the government and the FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front] is aimed at clearing the table. We  have made great progress and we hope to finish this week," he  said.    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, in his report to  the Security Council that was revealed on Monday, made reference  to the situation. He said he was concerned because some aspects  of the peace agreements require special "urgent attention."  Butrus-Ghali made specific reference to the topics of public  security, return of former fighters to civilian life, and land  transfers.    In view of the negotiation of dates, Ter Horst said that  once  an agreement is reached the only thing pending would be the  operation mechanism, which will be up to the government of  Armando Calderon Sol, who will be sworn in on 1 June and who has  expressed his commitment to the agreements. The ONUSAL chief  admitted the delays and said "much remains to be done," but said  "great progress" has been made and that the parties involved are  willing to fulfill their obligations.    The viewpoint of the ONUSAL chief contrasts with the report  released by Butrus-Ghali, which points out that after 1 June  "much will remain to be done" to complete the implementation of  the agreements. In the report, Butrus-Ghali lists the topics  that are still pending such as the complete deployment of the  National Civilian Police (PNC) and the demobilization of the  National Police; land transfers; the program for the return of  the former fighters to civilian life; and the implementation of  the recommendations of the Truth Commission.    Butrus-Ghali said the agreements called for the complete  deployment of the PNC by the end of September 1994, but the  government said the National Police will not disappear until  March 1995 because the new police corps cannot yet face the high  crime rate. Butrus-Ghali also said there are imbalances within  the PNC that violate the letter and spirit of the peace  agreements because military as well as former National Police  officers were included in numbers that were higher than what had  been agreed.    As for land transfers, Ter Horst said important progress has  been made and that the second phase has already begun, which  will allow the authorities to hand out land title deeds by the  end of the month. This phase also saw the incorporation to the  program of another 7,200 beneficiaries for a total of nearly  25,000 persons.    Likewise, Ter Horst praised the progress made in applying  the  Truth Commission recommendations, especially regarding judicial  reform matters, even though he regretted, on behalf of  Butrus-Ghali, that the duties of the Supreme Court have not been  decentralized.    As for public security, the ONUSAL chief coincided with  Butrus- Ghali's report when he confirmed that irregularities  have been detected in the hiring and transfer of personnel to  the PNC.</p>

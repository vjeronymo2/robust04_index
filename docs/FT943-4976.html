			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria in search for international partners Bank Austria is looking for international strategic financial partners following the announcement by the government that it wants to sell its 22.8 per cent voting stake in the country's largest bank. Mr Hans Mayr, deputy mayor of Vienna, said in a newspaper interview that he was already in discussions with 'a number of large international banks' about buying parts of the government's shareholding and becoming strategic partners. The City of Vienna controls 51.8 per cent of the votes and 45.6 per cent of the capital in Bank Austria. Although the bank already has relations with Westdeutsche Landesbank, Mr Mayr told Vienna's Der Standard that the discussions were mainly with banks from Anglo-Saxon countries, and he would rather bring in three or four partners than just one. Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Austrian finance minister, confirmed last week that the federal government wanted to sell its stake in Bank Austria, but added: 'We are not in a hurry and don't want to be pressurised.' The market value of the federal government stake in Bank Austria is about Sch11.1bn (Dollars 1bn). As so often in Austria, the stances of both Mr Lacina and Mr Mayr probably reflect, at least in part, short-term political interests. Mr Lacina is in the throes of a general election campaign and his Democratic Socialist Party is trying to win over middle-of-the-road voters. Mr Mayr, who is also a socialist, is trying to fend off a claim by the public auditor, who happens to be a Conservative appointee, to the right to scrutinise Bank Austria's books. If the federal government were no longer a shareholder, the auditor's claim would become weaker. Mr Mayr also said the city would let its shareholding in Bank Austria drop below 50 per cent in the near future by not participating in the bank's rights issues. Meanwhile, Mr Lacina said yesterday that he had engaged JP Morgan, the US investment bank, to assess bids for parts of the government's 70 per cent voting stake in Creditanstalt, the country's second largest bank. CS Holding, the financial services group built around Credit Suisse, and a consortium drawn from mainly from Conservative business circles in Austria have made competing bids. Mr Lacina has said that Allianz, the German insurance group, has also shown interest in the bank and some Viennese bankers suspect that the Raiffeisen group of banking co-operatives, which last year made an aborted bid to merge with Creditanstalt, may try again.</p>

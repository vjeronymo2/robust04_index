			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Markets: Shareholders suffer from dirty tricks - London SO FAR, it seems to be shareholders rather than airline executives who have paid the price for British Airways' shoddy behaviour towards Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic. On Thursday, the BA board exonerated its own members; it remains to be seen whether less senior members of the airline's staff face disciplinary action. Shareholders' punishment has been swifter. Since late December, when rumours of a settlement in the case with Virgin first began to circulate, British Airways has under-performed the FT-Actuaries All-Share index by 13 per cent. Perhaps more revealing is a comparison with three publicly traded European airlines, KLM, Swissair and Lufthansa. During 1992, British Airways outperformed all of them by more than 100 per cent; since late December, it has done worse than all of them, underperforming Swissair and and Lufthansa by over 20 per cent. Had BA shares moved in line with the rest of the UK market since late December, they would today be selling at something like 306p, compared with the closing price of 265p on Thursday, just before the board released its statement of self-exculpation. If that figure is a guide to the damage caused by the scandal, it means that shareholders, collectively, are worse off by around Pounds 300m - a figure that dwarfs the Pounds 2m or so paid to Branson in costs and settlement. On Friday, as institutional investors digested the fact that BA did not plan to follow their advice to keep separate the roles of chairman and chief executive, the share price rose 4 1/2 p on the week, closing at 275p. The BA board might be forgiven for feeling that this particular piece of advice has a one-size-fits-all quality. Whenever there is a set-back at a company, regardless of its cause, institutional investors call for a separation of powers. This week, their advice prevailed in the case of Barclays. Andrew Buxton, who this month became chairman as well as chief executive, sent a letter to the bank's senior managers. 'I have taken notice of what our shareholders think,' he wrote, 'and I will be taking steps to split the responsibilities.' The move will happen 'at a time of our choosing', thought to be later this year. As if to reward him, Barclays shares rose 39p during the week, closing at 413p. The rise probably stems, however, from a growing belief among analysts that Barclays' dividend is safe. That view was clinched, for Terry Smith of the stockbrokers Collins Stewart, by some of the small print in Andrew Buxton's letter. This year, said the chairman, would be one for recovery rather than prosperity. 'I am completely confident, however, that we will recover well,' and there would be good profits in the future. 'We have a strong capital base that is amply sufficient to absorb the problems we have suffered.' Short of desperation, companies do not usually trim dividends if earnings recovery can be expected in the foreseeable future. If the Barclays board takes that approach, the wording of the letter is the strongest evidence yet for the view that the dividend is safe. The letter summed up another theme of the week. 'Even the most optimistic economic forecasters are now predicting only a slow and difficult climb out of the current world-wide recession,' wrote Buxton. As if on cue, poor economic statistics were released. On Wednesday, retail sales for December fell disappointingly short of expectations fuelled by all those reports of last-minute pre and post-Christmas buying. On Thursday, a fresh batch of gloomy figures appeared. Unemployment, seasonally adjusted, rose by 60,800 in the month to December, nearly twice as fast as City economists had expected. Industrial production figures for November showed a 0.5 per cent drop in manufacturing output, to a level 0.2 per cent lower than a year before. The markets, which had already been toying with the expectation of an early cut in interest rates, took the numbers as further pressure on the government to act. The futures market's short sterling contract closed the week at a level implying base rates of 6 1/2 per cent or less by March, down from their current 7 per cent. Sterling weakened sharply on Thursday, and closed the week at DM 2.44, down 6 1/4 pfennigs from the previous Friday. Equities, which had fallen on Monday and Tuesday, recovered strongly as the market absorbed the economic statistics, and the FT-SE 100 index closed the week at 2781.2 up 16.1p. Shorter- and medium-term gilts followed the same pattern, influenced by base-rate expectations. Long-term gilts, more influenced by Tuesday's announcement that there had been a sharp rise in public-sector borrowing in December, moved the other way, however. The economists at Goldman Sachs, previously rather bullish on the outlook for gilts, announced themselves more pessimistic, partly as a result of a study of the way budget deficits affect bond yields. Although it is hard to detect a strong relationship between the two in the chart above, Goldman Sachs's Jeremy Hale calculates that 'a 1 per cent increase in the budget deficit as a percentage of gdp will tend to increase gilt yields by 0.33 per cent . . .' The Goldman economists forecast public sector borrowing to rise by just over 2 percentage points of gdp by the 1993-4 financial year. That means, they say, that after adjusting for a few offsetting factors, the equilibrium yield on 10-year gilts this year should be between 9 and 9.3 per cent, compared with just under 8 1/2 per cent today. Using this method, they add, 'the gilt market currently appears as one of the least attractive of the world's government bond markets.' A chilly welcome, you might think, for Eddie George, the new governor of the Bank of England.</p>

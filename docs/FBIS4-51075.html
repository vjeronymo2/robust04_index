			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Viewpoint" column by Li Yining, head of Beijing </F> University's Department of Economics and Management, member of  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress:  "Rising Grain Prices Put Neglected Agriculture in the  Spotlight"]    [Text] The rise in grain purchase prices in urban areas  since the last quarter of last year has caused unrest among  residents and has become a cause of serious concern for the  government.    During the annual plenary session of the National People's  Congress in March city and provincial representatives demanded a  guaranteed increase in grain production.    The representatives have also demanded balanced supply and  demand in the grain market, in a highly publicised campaign.    The rise in the grain price is a complicated issue.    Although consumers are paying more when buying grain,  peasants' incomes have not increased as a result.    Even though the price of grain has increased, the extent of  the increase has been unable to match that of agricultural raw  materials and equipment such as fertiliser, diesel, farm  machinery and components.    While there is a surplus of agricultural workers, there is a  serious shortage of people who actually work the land. Most of  those who work the land are elderly people and women.    As such, grain production can by no means be neglected.    The primary reason for the soaring price of grain in recent  years is that little emphasis has been placed on farming.    This is because farming offers very low profit margins.    It has been suggested that the annual consumption of grain  per capita is falling, against an increase in overall grain  production in China.    Moreover, the pricing of grain in China is mainly affected  by  the distribution system. An inefficient distribution system  will result in a lack of grain supply in some areas and this  means that both consumers and peasants will suffer.    To a certain extent, the suggestion that grain consumption  is  falling against an increase in production is correct. But it  does not pinpoint the central issue.    In fact, the problem lies more on the production side than  in  the distribution system.    Annual grain consumption per capita among the rural  population has not dropped significantly. It is because grain  consumption by urban residents has fallen, against soaring  consumption of pork, poultry and eggs.    But how will the production of pork and poultry increase if  there is no feed for the animals? If grain production is not  increased, no balance can be fixed between supply and demand in  the grain market.    Eventually, it will be difficult to stabilise the grain  price  even if the efficiency of distribution is improved.    Boosting the efficiency of the distribution process is  imperative, to ensure that both peasants and consumers are  protected.    Devoting more emphasis to agricultural production to ensure  growth in grain production will be an immediate move towards  stabilising the pricing of grain.    This could be done in three ways.    --The government should take on the role of building  facilities to conserve water, to increase the area under  irrigation and bolster precautionary measures against natural  disasters.    --The government should offer incentives for farmers to  devote more time to farming through its agricultural policy.    --The government should rely on town and village enterprises  in a move to increase agricultural production.    Finally, I would like to elaborate on stabilising grain  prices. There are two ways this can be done: either the  government fixes prices under a planned economy or the prices  are left to market forces.    Previous experience has shown that pricing under a market  economy has not worked in China.    Accordingly, stabilising grain prices through government  mechanisms would not necessarily mean the country was returning  to a planned economy.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Forint devalued in Hungary Hungary has abandoned its policy of gradual currency depreciation by ordering an 8 per cent devaluation of the forint, effective today. The authorities said the devaluation, the largest in more than three years, was to compensate for the loss of competitiveness. The central bank had maintained a policy of appreciation in real terms of the forint to damp inflation but the strong currency, compounded by drought and west European recession, led to an export drop of 17 per cent in 1993 and a current account deficit of Dollars 3.46bn (Pounds 2.23bn), or 10 per cent of GDP. Many banks, particularly western-owned ones, have braved out the central bank's increase of the key overnight repo rate to 31 per cent. Foreign exchange dealers estimate that banks maintained open positions of about Ft20bn-Ft25bn (Pounds 127.5m-Pounds 159.4m) on which they now stand to make windfall profits at the expense of the central bank. Western joint ventures which swapped hard-currency into forint borrowings and advanced imports are also well-placed to gain.</p>

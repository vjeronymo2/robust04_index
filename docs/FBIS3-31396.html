Later on Wednesday the committee is  expected to vote on the amendments.    Head of the Finance Ministry Henryk Chmielak told newsmen  the  cabinet was ready to present amendments to the budget law in the  first half of the year, but the time would show the direction of  changes.    "We are open to deputies' suggestions. We declared readiness  to come to the parliament with corrections of the budget law in  mid- 1994 if the premise on which deputies base a growth of  incomes would be more justified and specified. It would be too  early today to have any increases," Chmielak said.    Chmielak said that the deputies accepted the prime  minister's  explanation with understanding and added that the coalition  would vote for the cabinet version of the budget.    Next, Chmielak said possible talks concerning his  appointment  as finance minister would be held after the return of leader of  the Social Democratic Alliance (SLD) Aleksander Kwasniewski from  Lillehammer.</p>

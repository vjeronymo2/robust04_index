			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau 1 June TASS -- Russia said on Wednesday [1  June] that from now on it will supply gas to Moldavia [Moldova]  only on the basis of advance payments.    The decision announced by Russia's gas supplying concern  Gazprom followed Moldavia's failure to pay for earlier gas  supplies.    Moldavian gas industry head Boris Karandyuk said that  Moldavia's debt to Russia is estimated at 257 billion roubles.  About 107 billion roubles of that sum is owed by the break-away  Dniester republic which is seeking economic and political  independence from Moldavia.    About 70 per cent of the debt belongs to the Moldovenergo  Association which supplies the republic with electricity and  heat.    Karandyuk said that Moldavia has so far paid only 40 billion  roubles and is ready to send a large shipment of food and  industrial products worth 16 billion roubles to pay part of the  remaining sum.    "We are seeking ways to pay the debt and intend to resort to  foreign credits," Karandyuk said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- The Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will adopt a joint  communique Wednesday [8 June] proposing an agenda for the next  round of world trade talks and urging stronger links with other  countries, Japanese officials said.    The OECD will also sign on an agreement with Russia on  cooperation to help its transformation to a market economy after  the annual meeting ends around noon, they said.    In the communique, the OECD will call for reinforcing the  global free trading system and a new role for the Paris-based  organization in the rapidly changing world, according to the  officials.    As a possible theme for the next round of multilateral  global  trade negotiations, which will succeed the Uruguay Round of  talks concluded in December, the communique will propose linking  trade and environment, investment, labor and competition  policies, they said.    The proposed new role of the OECD should be built through  strengthening its links with countries such as South Korea,  which wants to join the OECD, China and other Asian countries,  they said.    Mexico was admitted in the OECD last month as the first  newcomer to the 33-year-old organization since 1973, and many  other countries, mostly in the former Soviet-dominated bloc, are  reportedly hoping to follow suit.    Jobs crisis strategy, agreed by the 25 member states  Tuesday,  will also form part of the joint statement, the officials said.    The more than 60 detailed job-creation steps in the strategy  were drawn up after a two-year study. The number of jobless  people of working age in the 25 countries is heading for a  record 35 million.    In addition, the communique will include an agreement to  prevent bribery -- especially in developing nations -- by  companies in the member countries.    The United States proposed that corrupt practices be  included  because a U.S. law banning international bribery puts its  enterprises at a disadvantage with firms in other countries that  have no such legislation.    The planned assistance to Russia, to be signed by the OECD  and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, will focus on aid  in the legal and statistical fields.    The aid package will be reviewed every year in annual  cooperation programs that the two sides will map out jointly.    The signing will be followed by a meeting of OECD and  Russian  ministers to exchange views on the organization's support for  the ongoing conversion in Russia of military industries to  commercial ones.    Nobuo Matsunaga, who represented Japan at the OECD sessions,  is scheduled to separately meet Kozyrev on Wednesday morning,  the officials said.    The bilateral talks, the first in two and a half months  since  then Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata met the Russian foreign  minister, will include discussion of how to deal with the North  Korean nuclear issue, they said.</p>

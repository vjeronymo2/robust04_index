			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Inside Politics" column, by Danny Gittings: "Britain </F> Finally Returning China's Shots on Accord"]    [Text] After years of China repeatedly accusing Britain of  breaking the Joint Declaration, London is beginning to respond  with charges of its own. Governor Chris Patten last week came  closer than ever to hinting that China was potentially in breach  of the Sino-British accord, although he stopped short of saying  so directly. But in contrast to Mr Patten, the recent report  from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee pulls no  punches. "We conclude that Articles 18 and 158 of the Basic Law  are grave potential threats to the autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR  [special administrative region] after 1997 and to the  implementation of the Joint Declaration," it says.    Both clauses drew fire during the drafting of the Basic Law.  Article 18 effectively gives Beijing, through the rubber-stamp  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the power  to do what it wants in Hong Kong after 1997 by declaring a  "state of emergency". Article 158 undermines the Joint  Declaration's promise that the proposed Court of Final Appeal  will have the power "of final adjudication", by giving the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress the right  to interpret the Basic Law, and even issue rulings that the  [sentence incomplete as published]    Despite quiet lobbying during the drafting process, Britain  failed to have both provisions scrapped, and subsequently tried  to paper over the shortcomings of the Basic Law. "The  Government of the United Kingdom had satisfied itself that the  Basic Law was, on the whole, consistent with the basic  principles enshrined in the Joint Declaration," a British  spokesman told a United Nations Human Rights Commission hearing  in 1991. The most the Foreign Office would admit was that there  were a few articles in the Basic Law it "would have preferred to  see drafted differently".    But that was before Mr Patten's arrival, when a U-turn in  British policy towards political reform in the territory  prompted a torrent of accusations from Beijing that London was  breaching the Joint Declaration. Now there are signs Britain is  prepared to respond in kind. Whitehall officials claimed in  evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee that any significant  foot-dragging by Beijing in the Joint Liaison Group amounted to  a failure to "fulfil the terms of the (Joint) Declaration".  Foreign Office Deputy Legal Adviser Kevin Chamberlain went one  step further suggesting China's record of abiding by  international agreements was "very mixed" -- although he later  retracted the remark in a clear attempt to avoid angering  Beijing.    Mr Patten also chose his words with care, when answering  questions on the issue in the Legislative Council last week.  But he did concede what no governor had made so plain before:  that Articles 18 and 158 were potentially in breach of the  Sino-British accord. "If Articles 18 or 158 of the Basic Law  were used to undermine the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, that would be in contravention of the  Joint Declaration," he said. Resorting to diplomatic  doublespeak, Mr Patten then insisted there was no danger of  that, adding somewhat tenuously that since Beijing had promised  to stick to the terms of the Sino-British accord, the offending  articles would never be used in the wrong way. But, even  accepting such a circular argument, the Governor's remarks were  the first clear statement that China had put in place powers  which could be used to break the Joint Declaration.    Now that Britain has overcome this psychological hurdle,  perhaps it is time to study China's record on other Hong  Kong-related accords. The Memorandum of Understanding over the  new airport is a case in point. In 1992, then Secretary for  Economic Services Anson Chan Fang On-sang warned Beijing that it  had only 30 days to respond to Britain's airport funding  proposals under the terms of that accord. Beijing told her to  shut up, claiming, implausibly, that the month-long consultation  timetable, unequivocally laid down in the memorandum, applied to  specific airport contracts only, rather than the overall funding  package. Two years on, despite the lack of agreement on the  airport, no one has dared repeat that charge. But, in the light  of Britain's latest shift of policy, now may be the right time.  Mrs Chan, now Chief Secretary, will be in Washington this week.  It will be interesting to hear her response to any questions on  China's record of abiding by international agreements about Hong  Kong.</p>

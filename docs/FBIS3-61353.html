			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuleba, editor in chief of </F> NEZAVISIMOST, under the rubric "Politics": "Choice"]    [Text]  <H5>  Results </H5>   It is customary to look back on the path traveled and sum up  what has been done on the eve of the New Year. The results of  the two years following the gaining of independence by Ukraine  and the election of Leonid Kravchuk to the presidency are  joyless, sad, and in many ways tragic. The country that set out  on an "unrestricted cruise" with dignity and integrity is now  increasingly reminiscent of a wagon rolling downhill whose  wheels and shocks are breaking off and speeding every which way  as it rolls. It appears that we will no longer be able to stop  and that the wagon, and all of us with it, will end up in an  abyss.    This is what Ukraine has today: a paralyzed economy and  financial system, a most profound crisis in all spheres of life;  inflationary processes have already turned into  superhyperinflationary processes (on this score we are next only  to Serbia where, unfortunately, a war is on). The pace of  destruction is far greater than that of our creative activities,  which makes it possible to refer not only to Ukraine turning  into a Latin American banana appendage, but also to conclude  that the threat of the nation dying off is very real.    How could this happen? Who is to blame? First of all, the  state authorities, which have taken care to preserve the old  system of the nomenklatura-Soviet-communist monopoly behind the  new attributes. Monopoly has become a reliable barrier in the  path of all reforms. Thus, Ukraine was perhaps the only European  country to successfully maintain the old system "safely and  entirely," and to neutralize political forces of a democratic  persuasion by way of their splintering and elementary graft,  which has made it possible for the turncoat party nomenklatura  to not just hold onto its complete power but to also to  reinforce it.    In this instance, the role of the parliament is instructive.  For the first time, democratic forces have appeared within it;  they accounted for one-third of deputies, which sufficed to  assert differences of political opinion and create a  constructive opposition to the Communist Party bosses, kolkhoz  and sovkhoz estate owners, the "Red directors," and other  representatives of the "aggressively obedient" majority.  However, L. Kravchuk, I. Plyushch, and V. Durdynets, who cut  their teeth on nomenklatura intrigues and honed their skills for  many years in the "golden cage" on Ordzhonikidze Street,  together with the died-in-the wool fraternity of oblast  committee secretaries, did everything to block the operation of  the parliament. This was executed masterfully. Pitting the Reds,  the yellow-and-blues, the rosy, and the just plain sickly  people's deputies against one another, the ruling nomenklatura  undertook to sell out Ukraine and its wealth against the  background of a political struggle. The deputies and the people  were fooled in a classical manner--governments and programs for  overcoming the crisis changed; "tame" political parties were  created; the president proclaimed himself the guarantor of  Ukrainian independence; from time to time the attention of the  public was diverted toward "white brothers and sisters" or the  Russian threat. At the same time, everything possible was  exported from Ukraine, plundered, and "grab-it-ized." The mafia,  corruption, and oligarchy, or in simpler terms, the fusion of  the criminal underworld with the powers that be, permeated the  entire societal pyramid, beginning with its very apex and on  down to the least of the officials issuing export licenses.  Graft and bribery are reaching a zenith--bribes are given and  taken not only in "green envelopes" but in entire files and  attache cases stuffed with dollars. The expression "bribe  suitcases" has taken root in the vernacular.    A colleague told me on one occasion: I was flying in from  Asia; there are no direct flights; you have to change planes in  Zurich. I took a look: Everyone on the plane was ours: some  ministers, bankers, prominent merchants--a well-known company. I  asked a friend: "What are you returning from--some kind of  symposium?" "No, everyone was there on business. I for one flew  to visit a bank and checked on my accounts." Not having a  personal foreign exchange account abroad is now considered bad  form in the milieu of those who govern us.  <H5>  Prospects </H5>   Having successfully "done in" a referendum on confidence in  the president and the Supreme Council, L. Kravchuk and I.  Plyushch began to seriously prepare for new elections. As a  result of very refined, jesuitically sophisticated, and crafty  efforts the Law on Elections appeared, which caused the whole  civilized world to laugh. First of all, it is majority-based,  i.e. the kind we got used to during the years of Soviet power.  Second, candidates for deputies will be nominated by labor  collectives, while political parties will be virtually unable to  influence the course of elections and the qualitative  composition of deputies. Third, the practice of electing  deputies who are not responsible for their actions to anybody or  anything, except the "mythical" voters, will continue. All of  this means the collapse of illusions concerning the formation of  a professional, reformist parliament. That is to say, the  political and economic situation which has emerged in the  country will be preserved for a few years to come, which, of  course, is advantageous for the forces that hold power at  present. As before, they count on "making it" as deputies in  remote rural districts, exploiting the oppressed and confused  condition of the people.    The composition of the Central Electoral Commission, which  consists mainly of people loyal to the president and the  speaker, headed by Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission  I. Yemets, who worked on the president's staff, testifies to how  seriously and actively the party of power of L. Kravchuk and I.  Plyushch is preparing for the elections. Methodological  recommendations have been distributed to the localities and  regions through the channels of both the soviets and  presidential structures, which contain an analysis of the array  of forces, recommendations on how to act in particular cases,  who to nominate, who to block, and precisely how to do it. One  such study which originated in the recesses of the  administration of the president was printed in NEZAVISIMOST  toward the end of last year with a view to familiarizing the  voters with methods used by the representatives of the party of  power.    The special services have also been drawn into the effort.  They have been charged with monitoring, through all operational  and informant techniques, the receipt of assistance from abroad  by democratic candidates. Finally, the special services will  embark on carrying out their principal mission: looking for  spies.    The editorial office has learned of the establishment of a  special, independent division for discrediting future  "particularly dangerous" candidates for deputies and  presidential candidates, which does not depend on either the  Security Service of Ukraine or the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Techniques of political investigation, surveillance, and a  thorough study of the "subject" will be used to this end. When  compiling a character profile, one should answer these  questions: Does the contender have a family? Where does his wife  work? Does he have an official or personal car (the make is  indicated)? What is his standing in the office? Does he  celebrate holidays together with fellow workers? What does he  drink--prestigious drinks, or does it make no difference to him?  What are his hobbies? Does he have a mistress? What does he do  in the evening? And so on, and so forth. There are grounds to  believe that all this information will be used against  democratic candidates by way of producing special leaflets which  will be dropped in every mailbox, as is now the case with some  newspapers.    Incidentally, about the newspapers. As the election draws  closer they are thinking about newspapers more often than usual.  According to available information, appropriate work has already  been done with a number of publications; they have been geared  toward candidates who are "ours"; they have received  instructions and motives to use in refusing to publish democrats  or let them speak. This was stated recently by V. Pavlyuk,  editor in chief of the disgraced Hart Studio. Here is an  altogether amusing piece of information. S. Kichigin, the former  president of the Dovira company and the former president of the  newspaper (?) KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, became the editor in chief  of this publication, having single-handedly fired from the job  the well-known journalist A. Shvets. Understandably, this could  happen only in a highly independent and democratic newspaper.  However, something else is of the essence. As it became known,  the dismissal of A. Shvets was the second condition which  representatives of the administration of the president set for  S. Kichigin. The first and key condition was to change the  political line of the newspaper and unconditionally support all  candidates of the party of power during the elections. In  return, S. Kichigin was granted an "indulgence" in the form of a  prolongation of credit and debt (totalling over 10 billion  karbovantsy) until the end of March of this year, that is, until  the elections. Subsequently, it will be possible to forgive the  debt altogether if the newspaper fulfills its obligations and  everything ends well for the current inhabitants of the "golden  cage."    This is how the party of power operates. What about the  opposition, the national-democratic forces, organizations of  state and market orientation? Alas, they are splintered and  disjointed due to their own ambitions, intrigues, offenses,  pride, and their own delusions of grandeur. It appears that they  will still be unsuccessful in creating or contrasting anything  of value. Besides, in the eyes of the people they are quite  compromised, due to the care that was taken by yesterday's  Communists. It is not surprising that in independent  sociological surveys they hold between 5 and 8 percent of the  vote. The Communists lead in these projections, who, in tandem  with the Socialists, are capable of getting up to 55 percent in  the new parliament. It is noteworthy that up to 23 percent of  the vote goes to so-called "pure" and "independent" candidates  whose names are known to few. However, having "made it" to the  parliament, they will turn out to be closely tied to mafia  structures, as well as to banking and entrepreneurial  structures. However, the scenarios whereby homegrown  communist-fascists come to power or still the same Communist  Party nomenklatura survives are not ruled out.    I do not doubt that many familiar individuals from the  current parliament will be among the contenders. Many of them  have come to like the comfortably sated existence built on using  the erstwhile privileges of the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of Ukraine and meeting the mercenary interests  of the present-day commercial structures, and they are not  averse to extending it. I have repeatedly heard cynical  narratives of people's deputies who have already "staked out"  their districts. Using money wheedled out in advance for future  services (for example, familiarization with the drafts of new  laws), the deputies "bend over" for the voters every which way  they can--they hand out sops to families with many children, lay  the foundations of kindergartens and hospitals, open free  cafeterias, and so on, and so forth. I for one have no  particular doubt that they will be reelected.    Alas, we have to talk about the imperfection and even  fallaciousness of the very procedure of elections under the  current economic conditions, whereby people reduced to the  extreme stages of poverty and hunger are prepared to give  everything away for crumbs from their master's table; they are  prepared to give not only their votes but the shirts off their  backs so that their children will not end up without clothes and  barefoot in the snow on the street. Besides, the results of the  elections in Russia confirm it: Zhirinovskiy's fascists and  Zyuganov's Communists are in power. I will venture to predict  their close rapprochement in the parliament; after all, the  objectives of both are the same--totalitarianism, dictatorship,  monopoly on power.    The election struggle is going to be cruel. The political  melee will shatter a great many careers and lives. The striving  of genuine intellectuals, of people with integrity and honesty  to not get involved in the dirty free-for-all, to keep their  souls pure, and to distance themselves from lies and  provocations is natural. This is why I for one have difficulty  imagining that the new deputies coming to power will be better  than the current owners of credentials. That is to say, the  elections will hardly be able to change the situation radically.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   The results are joyless, the prospects are hazy, and the  conclusions are sad. As of now there is no force in Ukraine that  is capable of winning the elections, forming the government, and  averting a catastrophe. There is chaos in the economy; in  politics, the party of power holds sway, and people are  demoralized. This is why, to my mind, the coming elections  cannot do anything good for the democratic forces; their outcome  has been predetermined in favor of the nomenklatura. The threat  of resuscitation of the Communist regime or the establishment of  an authoritarian dictatorship is real. The situation is being  complicated by the syndrome of the regions "pulling apart," the  symptoms of which--attempts to withhold payment of taxes,  creation of free economic zones, presidential elections in the  Crimea, fuelling of tension in the Donbass, etc.--are apparent.    In a situation in which all power belongs to the president  (although he and his clique are trying to shift onto others  responsibility for the current condition of Ukraine on various  pretexts), his proposal to adopt a law on power acquires a  menacingly ominous coloring. In the future, we will remain  hostages to L. Kravchuk's ambitions; after all, if such a law is  passed, he will still decide the fate of Ukraine  single-handedly. In turn, if the new parliament adopts a new  Constitution, the separation of powers will be codified in it.  This is why it appears that at present elections to the Supreme  Council are not the priority task. The elections will resolve  nothing. Only an early election of the president of Ukraine and  the formation of a reformist government from among  professionals, proponents of the market economy such as V.  Lanovyy, A. Savchenko, and V. Chernyak, can change the situation  and influence it fundamentally. As I see it, there is just no  other way out for Ukraine at present. The only issue is just how  blind the current parliament is in failing to see that which  lies on the surface.</p>

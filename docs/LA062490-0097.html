			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: IN AGE OF SUPER-BRATS -- TENNIS, ANYONE?  </P> <P> In 1905, May Sutton, the first non-English Wimbledon champion, caused a flap  when she rolled up her shirt sleeves on the court because she was "too hot."  The corset and the petticoats she was wearing probably had a lot to do with it.  </P> <P> A few years later, Billie Tapscott played Wimbledon without stockings. Get  outta here! From there on, the dress code got out of control. Alice Marble wore  short tennis shorts, Gussie Moran revealed lace-edged panties, and Billie Jean  King, in her famous match against Bobby Riggs in 1973, wore a mint-green tennis  dress with sky-blue collar decorated with a band of rhinestones and green  sequins.  </P> <P> Tennis court apparel was destined to change. Andre Agassi, from Las Vegas, came  head to head with the French Tennis Federation because he is a forerunner of  the hot lava Spandex Age. When he appeared on the court recently dressed in  glowing pink and black shirt, black denim shorts, pink cycling tights  underneath and matching shoes and headband, the federation screamed "ban" and  suggested a dress code for tennis players to be adopted by the United States  and Australia.  </P> <P> When our young son was 8 years old, I entered him in a local tennis tournament  because it would keep him busy for an hour while I went to the supermarket. The  fact that he had never played a tennis game in his entire life was irrelevant.  He drove me nuts at the store.  </P> <P> His court attire was plaid shorts down to his knees, a pair of black high-tops  and a sweat shirt. His opponent was in white, had a headband and ("We are in  deep trouble, kid!") a sweatband on his wrist. He probably squeezed a tennis  ball in his sleep to strengthen his forearm. He had to tell my son where to  stand to serve and when to change sides. I couldn't watch.  </P> <P> When I returned from the store, my son was sitting on the curb with a new can  of tennis balls. His opponent told him he had won.  </P> <P> It's hard to get excited over what tennis players choose to wear on court. Good  tennis is good tennis no matter how you dress it. What we should be getting  excited about are the lack of manners and the foul language. It is not  tolerated in any other sports event. Yet these super-brats are allowed to throw  rackets, challenge decisions with profanities and make obscene gestures to the  fans.  </P> <P> They can glow in the dark if they want to. Just knock it off with the theatrics  and play tennis!  </P></p>

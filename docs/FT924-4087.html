			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Weak D-Mark lifts French franc FEARS that the French franc would have to be devalued retreated yesterday after a much weaker D-Mark gave the currency a temporary reprieve. A string of gloomy economic figures from Germany, and news that the steel workers had agreed on a low wage settlement, sent the D-Mark sharply lower against other European currencies and the dollar. In London yesterday, the pound benefited from its position outside the ERM to gain heavily against the D-Mark and the dollar. It ended the day almost 4 pfennigs stronger against the German currency at DM2.475, its highest close for almost six weeks, slipping only slightly to DM2.4745 in New York. Against the dollar it closed in London at Dollars 1.5665, just under two cents stronger on the day. In New York it fell back slightly to Dollars 1.564. Ireland arranged to borrow up to DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) from German banks to support the punt, which has been under strain within the European exchange rate mechanism. Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency organised the loans with a group of German banks, including the country's three largest, Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank. Dublin's strategy to defend the currency resembles the UK's Ecu10bn (Pounds 8.1bn) borrowing programme announced on September 3 in an effort - which was ultimately unsuccessful in Britain's case - to hold sterling above its ERM floor. The franc was buoyed early in the day by a statement from Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, that France and Germany would do all they could, jointly, to preserve the parity of the franc and D-Mark. His statement, together with small amounts of intervention by the French central bank, pushed the franc higher against the D-Mark to close at FFr3.404, comfortably above its ERM floor of FFr 3.4305. The D-Mark's loss was the pound's gain as investors switched funds. 'I think the pound is benefiting from the fact that it has formed a solid base at around DM2.40 and is outside the turmoil of the ERM,' said Mr Stephen Hannah, head of research at IBJ International. Mr Brian Hilliard, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said it showed there was 'at least some floor under sterling'.

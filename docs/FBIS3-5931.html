			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japanese Government has decided to launch a  project to help the SRV in developing an industrial zone in  Hanoi, the country's capital in its northern area, in an effort  to rectify an economic imbalance between its southern and  northern regions. The government plans to embark on making  preparations for the construction project, starting off with  sending a preliminary mission to the SRV on 20 March. It also  plans to extend yen loans to help fund the construction of the  Hanoi industrial zone, which is scheduled to begin as early as  in 1996.    Investments in the SRV by foreign private firms have  concentrated in the southern part of the country, primarily  around Ho Chi Minh City. This has further widened the economic  gap between the thriving southern regions and the underdeveloped  northern regions -- a factor which has begun to cause  instability in the country.    The government mission, consisting mainly of members of the  Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), plans to work  with the Hanoi People's Committee to finalize details on such  points as the following: 1) the current situation in the Hanoi  area and future outlook; 2) selecting prospective industries; 3)  investment demands; 4) determining the location of the  industrial zone; and 5) the schedule for construction of the  industrial zone. The government mission plans to begin actual  investigations in June. It hopes to draw up a basic outline of  the project by January 1996 and present it to the SRV.    The SRV Government has sounded out the Japanese Government  for its support in funding the construction of the industrial  zone. The Japanese Government plans to respond favorably to  this request. Construction costs are expected to total around  $100 million.    In terms of total cost, the project, including construction  of ancillary facilities, is expected to be of the greatest scale  for a single project among projects for which Japan has decided  to apply its yen loan program for the SRV. Japan resumed this  program in 1992 after suspending it for about 14 years.    There has traditionally been an economic imbalance between  the northern and southern regions of the SRV. The per capita  annual national income in Ho Chi Minh City is $350, while it is  only $250 in Hanoi. A worker in Ho Chi Minh City earns an  average monthly salary of $38.80, while a worker in Hanoi makes  only $22.40, or only about two-thirds of his counterpart in the  south. Moreover, ever since the country enacted its Foreign  Investment Act in 1988, over 70 percent of foreign investment in  the SRV has concentrated in its southern regions, primarily  around Ho Chi Minh City. If left unattended, the situation  could turn out to be like as it was before the country's  unification in 1975 when "the south prospered and the north  remained poor."    In early February 1994, the United States decided to lift  economic sanctions it had imposed against the SRV. As a result,  there are now hardly any barriers against direct foreign  investment. Although the SRV is expected to make rapid growth  among the East Asian countries, along with the PRC, its leaders  are faced with the problem of an economic imbalance between its  northern and southern regions. The Japanese Government  considers that "the promotion of development in the northern  regions is urgent for a well-balanced economic growth," (as  stated by a Foreign Ministry source). Therefore, in carrying out  its economic aid program for the SRV, the government has decided  to hammer out a plan to place priority on the development of the  country's northern regions, primarily around Hanoi.</p>

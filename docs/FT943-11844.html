			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tragic waste of skills Sir, The inflationary rises in construction pay you reported on July 22 ('Shortages push construction pay 'above 1980s level' ') are an alarming but predictable result of the short-termism that has bedevilled the industry for many years. The RICS quarterly construction survey to be released this week will show that more than 50 per cent of respondents expect to encounter skills shortages in the next three months. We do not advocate a return to the total planning that suffocates initiative. But it must be clear that only long-term commitment by government and the institutions will allow contractors and professional firms to build teams and nurture essential skills. To have to shed staff just as they are about to realise their potential is soul-destroying at a human level and a tragic waste of investment in any industry. In a sector as important as construction, it threatens the price stability which has been so hard won.

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (16): Not as bad as it might have been - France, the banks lose enthusiasm The recession in France has left a varied trail of damage in the leveraged buy-out business. The worst of the economic downturn may be over, but caution remains the watchword for investors, banks and sellers. Some analysts estimate that total transactions are about 20 per cent down on two years ago, and that only four or five large banks are now active in the sector. Average gearing for new leveraged deals, or debt-to-equity ratio, has fallen to between 1.5:1 and 1:1 from up to 5:1, according to Mr Dominique Peninon, director of Alpha Associates and president of the French Venture Capital Association (AFIC). Some deals put together in the late 1980s are now shaky, even though the gearing never reached the spectacular heights of that in the US. Meanwhile, there has been a shake-out of operators in the field, with a number of bank subsidiaries having pulled out altogether. LBO France, which is known as leader for large transactions, has concluded no deals this year, because asking prices are too high, said its chairman, Mr Gilles Cahen-Salvadore. 'Prices must come down or French economic growth must pick up,' he added. Others take a brighter view. A team consisting of the Credit Agricole subsidiary (Unicredit), Banque Nationale de Paris and Lazard's Partenaires fund has closed three large leveraged management buy-outs this year, all with an expected return on equity of more than 20 per cent, said Mr Eric Licoys, general manager of Lazard Freres' Fonds Partenaires Gestion. This is less than the 30 per cent achieved in the past, but it is still healthy because French long-term interest rates are now at a record low, he pointed out. Overall, the sector has not suffered as much as it might have done. 'Despite high real interest rates in the past few years, the recession and stricter bank lending terms, French leveraged buy-outs have held up reasonably well,' added Marc Bradford, manager of Unicredit's structured finance division. The market for medium-sized companies is 'still fundamentally expansionary,' and many family enterprises will need a solution to handover problems in the next decade, commented Mr Charles Diehl, director of Barclays Capital Developpement. Prices in the middle range are now 'more reasonable', because potential outlets are fewer. German and other European corporations that were looking for a foothold in France have other priorities, and the Paris second market for smaller stocks has been 'a disappointment,' Mr Diehl said. The picture for the buy-out/buy-in balance is mixed. For some operators, buy-outs are still in the majority, while for others buy-ins have taken the lead. For Financiere Saint Dominique, buy-ins are between 10 per cent and 20 per cent ahead, explained the firm's chairman Denis Mortier. Whichever the case, perhaps more significant is the fact that tougher cash demands mean that it is the financiers rather than management who often end up controlling the enterprise. One company that has carved out a niche in buy-ins, or rather in taking long-term minority stakes in family firms, is 3i. Each year, between 100 and 150 candidate bosses of about 40 years of age come forward. About 10 are selected, who then usually find the target companies themselves. Where 3i comes in is in putting the financial package together and in negotiating the deal, explained 3i director Mr Guy Zarzavatjian. What has changed in the company's steady flow of deals is that the ranks of potential bosses have increased sharply over the past few years, as lay-offs because of corporate mergers and dwindling profits have hit more senior managers, Mr Zarzavatjian said. Another change is that only about 3,000 or 4,000 family firms are now healthy enough for 3i criteria, about half that of two years ago. Even so, Barclays' Mr Diehl is 'astonished by the number of very profitable medium-sized enterprises in France.' This is because they have kept most wage increases at the rate of inflation or below, and have raised productivity. On a positive note, there is plenty of venture capital around waiting for the right investment, and more spin-offs of healthy subsidiaries are expected to permit corporations to concentrate on core business. However, AFIC's Mr Peninon says that, instead of being sold directly, more firms could and should be spun-off in leveraged deals. On the fiscal side, the industry may soon be given the flexibility it has been seeking in exoneration of capital gains tax on venture capital firms' and funds' investments, provided that more than 50 per cent are held in non-listed companies. At the moment, this applies only if the target is the direct holding company of the operating subsidiary and holds less than 40 per cent of the voting rights. But this is rarely the case, as corporate holding structures are often two or three tiers deep, explained Mr Jean- Francois Court, chairman of AFIC's fiscal and legislation committee. Hopes are now pinned on an amendment to the 1994 draft budget that will allow exoneration for gains on shares in any tier of the structure, provided that the 40 per cent rule is respected, he said. A number of other technical aspects of venture capital operations should be ironed out soon. 'This will not revolutionise the sector,' but should promote buy-outs by making the venture capital business more 'attractive and profitable,' Mr Court added. He welcomed proposals just issued by the CNPF, the employers' organisation, to promote the handover of companies. Part of this would be to relax the rules on staff buy-outs, which are known in France as RESs. Announcing the proposals, CNPF vice-president Ernest-Antoine Seilliere said that RES deals had lost their appeal, causing the market to come to a standstill. Budget minister Nicolas Sarkozy will be looking at the whole question of companies changing hands when the government's 1995 budget is prepared, and may include measures then. The government has a continuing policy of encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises, in order to create jobs. The MBO business may not be booming for all, but at least the recession seems to be bottoming out, and regulations look as though they are going in the right direction.</p>

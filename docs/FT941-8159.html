			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Former London head of CSFB quits parent board Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff, long-time head of Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) in London, has left the Swiss CS Holding financial group 'to pursue personal and family business interests', according to CS. Mr Rudloff was one of the leading figures in London's international capital markets throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He joined CSFB in 1980 and kept it among the top Eurobond and equity houses in the City. CS said it 'very much regretted' Mr Rudloff's resignation. No replacement for him was announced. His sudden move last March to Zurich to the executive board of CS Holding, parent company of the whole financial group built around Credit Suisse, took the financial community by surprise. He too seemed surprised, saying: 'You can never pre-judge a board in Switzerland.' His move came amid a drive by CS Holding to eliminate fierce rivalry between its US and UK investment banking subsidiaries. Mr David Mulford, a former US Treasury official and a vice-chairman of CS First Boston in New York, replaced Mr Rudloff as chief executive of CSFB. Three months later, Mr Archibald Cox, chief executive of the US operations of CS First Boston, also resigned 'to seek other personal interests'. It was also a time when the traditional Euromarkets business at CSFB in London was being eclipsed by that of its thrusting derivatives affiliate, Credit Suisse Financial Products, run by Mr Allen Wheat. Mr Rudloff's only responsibility at the CS Holding board was to help Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, with strategic planning. Friends suggested that while he was a brilliant strategist, this was an assignment, not a job, and would not satisfy a man with his energy. A former CSFB colleague said that he would be very surprised if Mr Rudloff, who is 53, was about to retire. Mr Rainer Gut is to retire from the board of Elektrowatt, a Swiss electrical generating company controlled by CS. Elektrowatt said that Mr Gut wanted to concentrate on the group's core financial businesses.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Drought slows down SA chemical group AECI. the South African chemicals group in which ICI of the UK and Anglo-American Industrial have large share stakes, reports lower profits for 1992 but plans to maintain its dividend. Earnings per share fell to 106 cents from 121 cents and compare with the 203 cents achieved in 1989. The dividend is being held at 58 cents. Mr Mike Sander, managing director, said 1992 had been a worse year than originally predicted for two reasons: the lack of growth in world economies and the very severe drought in South Africa. Exports make up a significant portion of AECI's business. About 20 per cent of its turnover goes directly to the agriculture sector. Turnover for the year rose by 1 per cent to R5.36bn (Dollars 1.7bn) and net trading income was unchanged at R403m. Cost controls saw margins maintained in most sectors, though at low levels. A slightly higher tax bill and a decline to R16m from R28m in investment income saw attributable income drop to R164m from R187m. Exports rose by 28 per cent to R643m (R502m), accounting for 12 per cent of turnover.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low prices force Greek producer to follow suit LARCO, THE troubled Greek ferronickel producer, is to cut output of refined nickel by 40 per cent from next week in response to falling international prices. Production at Larco's plant in central Greece will drop from about 1,400 tonnes to 800 tonnes a month. The cuts are to be maintained for at least five months, the company said. 'Prices have gone so low that we have no alternative but to follow the big international producers and reduce output," said Mr Nikos Kalles, Larco's president. 'There should be no problem in fulfilling contracts in time this year, in spite of the cutbacks, but we'll have to review the outlook for 1993 with our customers,' he added. Larco, a state-owned company which operates the only nickel mine in the European Community, accounts for about a quarter of European output of refined nickel. The company is due to be offered for sale in the next few months under the Greek government's privatisation programme. Credit Suisse First Boston, the merchant bank, has been appointed to handle the disposal.</p>

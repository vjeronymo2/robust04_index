			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- Former South African  Defence Force [SADF] Chief General Georg Meiring has been  appointed chief of the new South African National Defence Force  [SANDF].    Announcing the five-year appointment on Tuesday, Minister of  Defence Mr Joe Modise said that the task of building a  legitimate, credible and fully representative NDF that would  enjoy the support and co-operation of all South Africans would  rest on the general's shoulders.    Mr Modise warned that the defence force would become  "inadequate" if it faced any further cuts, and said a regional  defence accord could play an important role in discouraging  internal instability, such as that now troubling Lesotho. "It  is my sincere wish that under the command of Gen Meiring the  SANDF will do its best towards reconciliation, upliftment,  prosperity and peace in our country."    The government was also looking at forming a veterans'  brigade to absorb people who had left the armed forces as a  result of rationalisation.    Mr Modise said the final size of a rationalised defence  force  would be between 67,000 and 70,000 people. This would be  adequate to defend the country, but South Africa would "also be  looking at the region", and to becoming part of defence and  security arrangements on the subcontinent.    Integration of non-statutory forces such as former Umkhonto  we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] guerrillas  would have some effect on the coming budget. "I think initially  the budget will have to accept this group that's coming, but  after rationalisation -- because rationalisation also takes into  account an affordable army -- there has to be a ceiling  somewhere. The core we have got is the barest we could arrive  at. Below that it will be inadequate."    It had to be remembered that the defence force would play a  major role in the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Plan]  through job creation in concerns such as weapons manufacturers.    One of the defence force's major concerns would be social  upliftment. It had the capacity and knowhow to play a  meaningful role in the RDP. "So money coming into the defence  force is money well spent," he said.    Asked when South Africa would start to take part in  organisation of African unity peacekeeping exercises, he said  this was difficult to say. The defence force would "start at  home" and see what the needs of the region -- rather than the  continent -- were.    It would want to reassure its neighbours that they were  looking at security and defence in the same light, and that they  should not feel threatened by the size of South Africa's army.    Problems in neighbouring states such as Angola and  Mozambique  would hopefully be resolved in the near future: Mozambique was  preparing for an election, and there were signals that Angolan  negotiators might sign an accord by early June. "We think this  will provide the climate to address regional security end  defence," he said.    South Africa would avoid being drawn into other countries'  internal problems, but "those who are inclined to be  problematic" would have to know they were dealing with a much  wider form of defence.    He was not suggesting South Africa would go poking its nose  into its neighbours' affairs, but those who wanted to create  instability -- such as that affecting Lesotho -- would have to  think twice in future because such instability could affect the  entire region.    The non-statutory forces absorbed into the NDF would start  training in the next few days. These forces had not enjoyed the  privileges and modern facilities of former SADF troops, and  would have to be empowered before they could compete as equals.    The fact that the training would be overseen by neutral  British advisers would ensure that the final product would  satisfy all parties.    Asked to comment on the possible prosecution of white South  Africans who were called up for service over the election period  and did not report for duty, he replied: "Why do you want to  start off with controversial questions? Do you want to set me  against the old system?"    ANC policy was very clear: The organisation was opposed to  conscription and would prefer a voluntary defence force.    In times of war, when the security of the entire nation was  affected, things were different and necessary steps would be  taken to ensure the nation was protected.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Howard defends jail chief's bonus Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday defended a Pounds 35,000 bonus paid to Mr Derek Lewis, head of the prison service, rejecting suggestions that it was 'a reward for incompetence' in the wake of a number of jail breakouts and security blunders. He said any future payments would depend on the Prison Service's continuing to achieve and maintain its targets. The service had 'largely achieved' goals for improving performance. The contract under which Mr Lewis was recruited made clear the circumstances in which he was entitled to a bonus - 28 per cent on top of his Pounds 125,000 salary. Mr Lewis said the bonus related to the relatively incident-free year to March 1994. He added: 'It was paid very much earlier in the year and announced at the time. There has been no secret about it.' Mr Howard - campaigning in the Dudley West by-election - said the number of escapes had been cut significantly and the amount of time prisoners spent out of their cells had risen. Mr John Prescott, Labour deputy leader, said the bonus was 'an absurdity of the moment - paying bonuses to people while at the same time cutting back on the police service. If the home secretary prefers to reward someone in these circumstances it seems to me to be the wrong priority'. Inquiries are still going on into the discovery of Semtex explosive and the attempted break-out at Whitemoor prison by IRA inmates. Guns have been found at other jails and the service has been accused of political gaffes, such as the decision to transfer Brighton bomber Mr Patrick Magee back to Ulster the day after the IRA declared its ceasefire. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat deputy leader, said: 'The public will find it impossible to understand how someone on a pretty high salary should get a massive bonus when there has been so much going on in the prisons.' Sir Ivan Lawrence, Commons home affairs committee chairman, said top salaries had to be paid to attract top people.</p>

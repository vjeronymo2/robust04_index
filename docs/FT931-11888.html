			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Trident Dock Contest: Rifkind in firing line of nuclear dockyard battle THE GOVERNMENT intends to delay a final decision on the future of the naval dockyards at Rosyth, Fife, and Devonport, Plymouth, in an effort to avoid a repeat of the fiasco over coal pit closures. The initial announcement by Mr Malcom Rifkind, the defence secretary, is expected to set out the government's 'preferred' course of action for the yards, including the choice of which should become the sole site for refitting the Royal Navy's nuclear-powered submarines. Whitehall officials say this will be followed by three months of formal consultations. A decision on where to concentrate submarine refitting had been expected last month, after being postponed from December. It is not now expected before mid-February. Both yards, which have been under separate private-sector management since 1987, regard the submarine work as vital for their survival in the business of servicing a reduced fleet. They have been trying to undercut each other's proposals to win government-financed facilities big enough for the Trident submarines which are to replace Polaris. A refit facility for Trident needs to be completed by about 1998. Rosyth has so far handled Britain's four Polaris missile submarines and has shared work on other submarines with Devonport. Devonport Management, a private-sector consortium, proposed a scheme involving the conversion of old battleship dockyards as an alternative to a revised plan by Rosyth for completing the new docks. Rosyth, operated by Babcock Thorn, countered in December with its own dock-conversion proposal, estimated at Pounds 147m. Devonport said this was a more limited scheme than its own and it could provide equivalent docks for Pounds 131m. Rosyth in turn claims that the cheaper Devonport scheme would lack essential emergency docking facilities. Apart from the capital costs, Devonport has argued that the submarine work would enable it to achieve economies of scale and save the MoD hundreds of millions of pounds over the next decade in refitting frigates and other surface ships. Defence officials believe the greatest long-term savings would have been made by closing one of the royal dockyards and making the survivor compete with private shipbuilding yards for work on surface ships. But this is now recognised as being politically unacceptable. If Devonport wins the contest, Rosyth will be allocated a guaranteed workload on surface ships, possibly for 10 years. This would be designed to prevent the larger yard from cornering virtually all the navy's Pounds 400m-a-year refit programme. Both yards have up to now relied on a 'core' programme of allocated work, competing for other naval and commercial contracts. Once a choice is made, the government must decide whether, after expiry of the current contracts, it will press ahead with full privatisation of the yards. The 1987 contracts were originally to be resubmitted to competition after seven years but are due to be extended to 1995. Last August the MoD invited potential bidders to register interest in buying one or both yards, which have remained under MoD ownership. About 12 companies are understood to have replied, including the two incumbent groups. Others are thought to include British Aerospace, General Electric Company, Rolls-Royce and VSEL, the submarine-builder. VSEL is also anxious to compete for refitting of frigates in order to sustain activity at its Barrow-in-Furness yard. The MoD could not go ahead with inviting tenders before making clear which of the yards would have the new submarine-refitting facilities. The MoD would be expected to retain a 'golden share' in these facilities. However, the privatisation plan could now be called into question if, as expected, the government decides to allocate work to the losing yard in order to minimise job losses, instead of leaving surface ship work to open competition. Some officials argue that the MoD would be better able to exert competitive pressures through a fixed-term leasing contract, as at present.</p>

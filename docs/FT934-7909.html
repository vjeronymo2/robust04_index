			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Salmon farmers angered SCOTTISH salmon farmers yesterday expressed dismay at the response of the government to the crisis in the salmon industry, where a surge in production of salmon by Norway has led to a 60 per cent fall in prices. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has written to the European Commission urging 'appropriate measures' to deal with the problems of Scottish salmon producers. But he did not request 'safeguard action' under which the Commission would be obliged to consider measures to restrict imports of Norwegian salmon, such as setting a minimum import price or limiting volumes that can be imported. Mr Lang's more modest request for 'appropriate measures' is believed to be the result of the Scottish Office and the Ministry of Agriculture being overruled by Treasury ministers, who oppose trade protection measures. The Scottish Office said yesterday that since the Irish Republic, another salmon producer, had already requested safeguard action, a further request was not needed.</p>

Boyarsky for the past 11 years has been chief of  The Times' city-county bureau. He also has reported from Sacramento and  Washington and is the author of the books "Ronald Reagan: His Life and Rise to  the Presidency" and, with Nancy Boyarsky, "Backroom Politics."  </P> <P> Boyarsky's column will appear Fridays on Page 2 of the Metro section.  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / German car output on road to recovery THE German motor industry is starting to recover from its year-long slump, despite a 32 per cent fall in output during July, the VDA industry association said yesterday. The improvement will be slow, and hampered by increases in German petrol taxes, but car production could increase next year by as much as 6 per cent, according to Mr Achim Diekmann, association director. Domestic deliveries could rise by around 100,000 during 1994 after tumbling an estimated 800,000 this year to around 3.1m, while foreign demand, especially in the UK, might increase exports by 200,000 from this year's expected level of 2.2m. Ms Erika Emmerich, association president, said the fall in new orders had stopped earlier this year. A modest increase in demand detected since then should start showing up in increased deliveries within six months. However, in the medium term the association expects global demand for cars to increase by an average of only 2 per cent a year. Its annual report, published yesterday, said sales in western Europe, the US and Japan would grow only 1.5 per cent annually for the rest of the century. Meanwhile, the German industry was pressing ahead with restructuring. 'Sleeves are being rolled up everywhere, costs are being reduced and the pace of innovation speeded up,' Ms Emmerich said. Since July 1991 the industry had shed 100,000 jobs and its current workforce of 687,000 was heading down towards 600,000. Wage costs account for around 70 per cent of the total production cost of a German car. Vehicle makers and suppliers were determined to reduce costs by between 20-30 per cent in the next two years, she added. Last month's 32 per cent production slump, exaggerated by the traditional holiday season shutdowns, brought the cumulative decline in output for the first seven months of the year to 26 per cent, the association said. For the full year it expected a 20 per cent drop in production of cars, trucks and buses to just over 4m, compared with 5.2m in 1992. New car registrations in Germany for 1993 are likely to fall 21 per cent to 3.1m, while commercial vehicle registrations will drop almost 8 per cent to 250,000 units.</p>

NGT states that the proposed tariff sheets reflect an annual overall jurisdictional rate increase of approximately $42.5 million, described on Statement G, based on the twelve month period ending April 30, 1994, as adjusted. NGT also states that the filing reflects rate design changes required to implement Commission policy, as set forth in the Commission's Rate Design Policy Statement and in Order No. 636. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGT states that in this filing it establishes additive zone rates for its throughway system and a market lateral surcharge to be charged to shippers with delivery points on market laterals. NGT establishes in this filing a new pooling rate schedule that establishes a pooling service that complements the zone rate proposal. NGT proposes in this filing to recover in its rates the costs associated with Line AC, and requests removal of the ``at-risk'' condition imposed with respect to Line AC. The filing also includes certain miscellaneous tariff changes including modifications to Rate Schedules FSS and NNTS, and to NGT's imbalance resolution mechanism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGT states that copies of the filing were served on NGT's jurisdictional customers and interested state public service commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214).

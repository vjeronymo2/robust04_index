			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Calm returns after volatile months - Taiwan led emerging market gains in April CALM returned to most of the world's emerging markets in April, after two months of diverse and wide movements in the country indices. Only four of the 17 developing markets covered by the International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank, showed double-digit percentage changes on the month in dollar terms. Of these four, Taiwan and Mexico moved sharply higher, while Turkey and Greece were the worst performers. Mr Peter Bristowe of Hoare Govett comments: 'Taiwan has had a good run, but there have been ups and downs within that. The market could now be at the peak of its rally, because calls on liquidity are growing.' He cites the announcement this week of the flotation of part of the government's stake in Chinese Petroleum, and a government bond issue to raise TDollars 45bn (USDollars 1.65bn). Last month's optimism was based on the government's plans to raise infrastructure spending over the next few years, and the potential establishment of direct trading links between Taiwan and mainland China, says Mr Bristowe. April's other winner, Mexico, has been rising steadily for most of this year. Baring Securities provided a long list of reasons in its Latin American summary in mid-April. 'Factors contributing to the market's strong performance,' said Baring, 'include improved company financial results, the fall in interest rates, the massive inflow of foreign investment, the imminent bank privatisations and the sale of the remaining shares in Telmex, combined with widespread optimism about the country's economic prospects.' Optimism about the free trade agreement with the US and strong demand for shares of oil company Telmex in the New York and Mexican markets also lifted the index. Telmex has risen 91 per cent over the first four months of 1991. The picture was less bright in Europe. Turkey continued to be the year's most depressed emerging market. Mr Kaya Didman of Turk Economi Bank in Istanbul says there are several reasons for the decline. In the last 2 1/2 months, he says, short-term interest rates have risen sharply, with overnight rates of 100 per cent, against about 60 per cent in the previous 10 to 12 months. This is an indication of the country's severe cash shortage, which has forced the banks  -the main institutional investors in Turkey - to sell equities. There has also been a fast depreciation of the Turkish lira against the dollar and other major currencies, causing retail investors to turn to the foreign exchange market. The sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate, in turn, have produced volatile movements in the stock market. Investors have also been beset by economic and political worries, says Mr Didman, although he points out that the fundamentals look good, with corporate earnings growth of 10 per cent expected this year. The decline in Greece came as no surprise. The New York-based Kleiman International Consultants in its latest Emerging Markets Briefing says: 'After the 'casino euphoria' of the past year, investors have come to recognise that the country's deep-seated economic difficulties will not be resolved so quickly or easily and setbacks are inevitable.' THE Sao Paulo Bovespa index in Brazil jumped 5.3 per cent by midday yesterday to 74,014, up 3,728. The rise followed the naming of a new economy minister.</p>

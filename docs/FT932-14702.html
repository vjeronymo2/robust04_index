			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Tougher rules for insurance brokers urged THE CONSUMERS' Asso-ciation yesterday called for tougher rules for insurance brokers. It said advice offered to people buying policies was of poor quality and sometimes 'abysmal'. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the association, described the incompetence of some brokers and agents as 'truly alarming'. The criticism follows a Consumers' Association survey published today which revealed flagrant breaches of industry codes of practice governing the activities of brokers and agents. Anonymous researchers visited a random selection of 82 intermediaries in six towns and cities. They found that intermediaries frequently failed to disclose the amount of commission payments or to provide customers with copies of insurance policies. Many intermediaries also failed to give details of their status when requested. More than half the intermediaries recommended 'clearly inappropriate policies'. Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the Association of British Insurers, said he believed the survey overstated the problem. 'I don't think it's as bad as that. Most people have perfectly satisfactory policies. It's always possible to pick holes in a system.' Ms Ruth Rooley, director-general of the British Insurance and Investment Brokers Association, which represents 3,000 brokers, said the conclusions underlined the need for greater investment in training and acknowledged the need for regulatory reform. She said the association's inability to enforce its code of practice was a weakness in the system. The Consumers' Association is recommending that the insurance brokers' registration council or a new independent body should enforce regulations more actively. It says the association 'has no effective sanctions' and 'has neither the will nor the motivation' to fill the dual role of trade association and regulator. It is also recommending the introduction of minimum standards of professional competence and better training. Weekend Page IV</p>

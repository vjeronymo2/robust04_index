			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer If the defensive qualities of Marks and Spencer were ever in question, its full-year figures provide the final rebuttal. The 1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits and earnings per share means it has got through yet another recession - a particularly savage one for the retail trade - with its growth record since the Korean War intact. Although Marks sees no upturn in demand, its UK profits growth and margins were better in last year's second half than in the first. In the current year, it says, the cost-cutting measures already undertaken mean it can increase profits further on unchanged volume. The one caveat is pricing. Marks is notably silent on the question of volume versus prices last year, although the fact that its UK sales were down one per cent on some 5 per cent extra space is telling enough. The issue is particularly sensitive for Marks, whose reputation owes much to the notion of fair value. In clothing, as elsewhere in the retail trade, discounting is now so prevalent that shoppers may have some difficulty in deciding what constitutes a fair offer. But it does not do to quibble. At yesterday's 331p, Marks's shares are on a historic multiple of 22 times, compared with a market average of 17. If the prospect were one of a sharp bounce in retail spending, that would look expensive by comparison with Marks's more bombed-out peers. But in the past couple of weeks, the market's faith in a post-election retail boom has weakened perceptibly. In uncertain times, there is much to be said for quality.</p>

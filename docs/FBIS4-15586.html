			<p>BFN     [Text] Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze told  parliament Friday that he would take over the talks on the  settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. He called on the deputies  not to weaken the position of the Georgian side in the talks by  continuous fault finding. "If parliament thinks that my action  is wrong, let us have a vote of confidence," he said. He also  said that he would probably attend the CIS summit in Moscow next  week.    The Georgian parliament did not approve Tamaz Kvachantiradze  as education minister. Tedo Ninidze was approved as justice  minister when Shevardnadze nominated him for a second time.</p>

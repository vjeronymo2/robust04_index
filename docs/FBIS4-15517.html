			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/4/1994 -- The Moldovan  Parliament ratified on 8 April 1994, with a majority of votes  (80 pros and 18 cons) the Agreement on Creating the CIS and the  Agreement on Creating the CIS Economic Union. [Parliament  Speaker] Petru Lucinschi proposed to examine this issue  reminding that these agreements were examined by the former  parliament and that only 4 votes lacked to their ratification.  That is why the former parliamentary presidium took into  account all economic problems and restrictions caused by Russia  and asked the president to sign all the agreements of joining  the CIS and CIS Economic Union to Moldova's benefit. A number  of 17 deputies have opposed on 8 April the proposal to examine  the agreements. The faction of Peasants and Intellectuals  noticed that the parliamentary regulations are violated.  According to it, the documents to be adopted have to be  presented three days beforehand for their examination. PDAM  [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova -- ruling party]  representatives and in particular Andrei Diaconu, retorted that  the problem is well known and was examined on August 4th, and  therefore it would not be reasonable to start a new discussion.  Valeriu Matei, from the faction of Peasants and Intellectuals,  stated that the documents have a series of stipulations  contradicting Moldova's current policy and several legislative  documents. Dumitru Motpan, PDAM leader and vice speaker of  parliament, replied that the commissions that should ensure the  fulfillment of the regulations is only being created. He said  that this problem had been examined for two years and the delay  in ratifying the CIS agreements would represent a blockage.  Dumitru Diacov presented the notification of the Parliamentary  Commission of Foreign Relations regarding these documents. He  argued that Moldova should join the CIS and mentioned that seven  of the nine members of the commission were in favor of  ratification, while the other two representing the FPCDM  [Christian- Democratic Popular Front -- opposition] Alliance  and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals opposed it. Premier  Andrei Sangheli made a report noting that the CIS agreements  should be ratified as soon as possible. He added that after the  former parliament rejected them, serious damage was caused to  Moldovan economy. In 1993, this sum amounted to 40 billion  rubles. Sangheli asserted that the government in its 7 April  session agreed to the ratification of the CIS agreements.  During the debates, Vlad Clubreacov, from the FPCDM faction,  mentioned "the disastrous economic consequences of ratifying the  CIS agreements and the danger to which Moldova's independence is  unjustifiably exposed." He said that "it is strictly necessary  that beside the two agreements presented to us, we should have  at our disposal over 200 agreements signed by Moldovan  officials. The agreements are only partial and insufficient  information, which disguise the real purposes of the previous  agreements." Vasile Nedelciuc, faction of Peasants and  Intellectuals, analyzed several economic articles of the  agreements. He pointed out that Moldova has other alternatives,  including the ones in the West, which could help overcome the  current difficulties. He said that joining the CIS would  negatively influence many areas. One of the consequences is  that the legislation must be adjusted to the conditions of the  CIS economic community. Speaker Petru Lucinschi said that the  decision to join the CIS is not made forever and with new  realities coming in power it could be revised. At present, when  there is no other alternative but the Eastern market, parliament  welcomes the adherence to the CIS.</p>

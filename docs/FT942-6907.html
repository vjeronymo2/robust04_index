			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Austrian consortium bids for Creditanstalt stake The struggle to privatise Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, moved into a decisive phase yesterday as a consortium of leading Austrian financial and industrial companies offered Sch7.2bn (Dollars 622m) for just over half of the government's 70 per cent voting stake in the bank. The consortium came together in recent weeks to counter a bid by the Swiss CS Holding financial group that had the apparent support of Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Socialist finance minister. Mr Lacina has argued that Creditanstalt needs a strong strategic partner. But politicians and business leaders close to the conservative Austrian People's Party have reacted angrily to the prospect that the bank that once bestrode an empire fall into foreign hands. Mrs Maria Schaumayer, the widely-respected president of the Austrian National Bank, said in an interview last week that Creditanstalt 'must sail under the Austrian flag, not the Swiss one'. The consortium is led by EA-Generali, the insurance group and First Austrian, a large Vienna savings bank, and includes 18 blue chip industrial companies, such as Brau-Union, Porsche, Radex, Swarovski and Constantia, as well as some unidentified private individuals. The consortium immediately nailed its nationalist colours to the mast, stating that the presence of several domestic companies 'would guarantee an essentially Austrian underpinning for the bank's further development'. It argued that in the light of the increasing openness of the Austrian economy and the country's plan to join the European Union, 'the presence of an Austrian bank in the whole of Europe, both in the EU and in eastern Europe, is necessary'. The consortium would buy more than half of the government's Creditanstalt shares at the current market price of about Sch675, and would undertake to place the rest in financial markets 'as soon as possible'. Socialists snicker that the 'so-called Austrian consortium' contains several non-Austrian owned companies, including Generali and Banca Commerciale Italiana of Italy and the Austrian subsidiary of Siemens and Commerzbank of Germany. Terms of the CS offer have not been revealed, but Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of the group built around Credit Suisse, said in an interview with an Austrian magazine last week that CS would buy a 20 to 30 per cent stake as a first step and insist on first refusal on further sales of the finance ministry's holding. Ideally, Mr Gut said, CS would ultimately want to hold 100 per cent. He said Creditanstalt under CS control would retain its own identity but follow CS strategies. It would also benefit from CS strength in international financial markets.</p>

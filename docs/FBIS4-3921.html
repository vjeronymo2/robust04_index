			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 24 (XINHUA) -- A four-day national  commodity trade fair has closed in north China's port city of  Tianjin, with an estimated trade volume of over 6.3 billion  yuan, topping last fall's record in Shanghai, an internal trade  official said.    He Jihai, vice-minister of internal trade, spoke at the  opening of the trade fair, saying that from now on a national  commodity trade fair will be held every spring and fall in both  Tianjin and Shanghai.    The official said that there are many reasons to choose  these  two big cities to host the nationwide trade fairs.    Tianjin and Shanghai were China's trade centers in the past,  he said, adding that, being locating at the mouths of big  rivers, they both had developed good transport systems by air,  land and water.    He said that over the past few years both municipal  governments have taken many forceful steps to restore their  prestige as business centers. A number of large-sized markets  and modern trade centers have been built in these two cities.    In Tianjin there are now 22 trading centers for production  necessities, with a trade volume of 35.4 billion yuan in the  first quarter this year, a sturdy 65 percent rise over the total  last year, the official said.    In contrast, he said, Shanghai's total commodity retail  sales  last year reached 65.35 billion yuan, increasing 33.5 percent  over the previous year.    National commodity trade fairs were staged in Shanghai in  the  fall of 1992 and 1993. This has laid the groundwork for the  city to be a business center for the country, he said.    But there is a need to build another such trade center in  north China around Bohai Bay, he said, adding that Tianjin  appears to be the ideal choice.</p>

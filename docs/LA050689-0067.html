			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VISTANS BITE BACK AGAINST BUG INVASION  </P> <P> As in a suburban nightmare, a Vista neighborhood has mobilized itself against  an invasion of billions of little bugs from a nearby field that have swarmed  over their patios, driveways, lawns and gardens and in some cases gotten into  homes.  </P> <P> The bug invasion is evoking references to Alfred Hitchcock's "Birds" and a  Stephen King horror novel.  </P> <P> The insects, identified by authorities as vegetation-eating false chinch bugs,  pose no threat to humans or animals but are causing restless nights among some  children and concern among gardeners about what will be left of their  vegetation in a week or two.  </P> <P> Bernard Ellebrecht, who lives on Sequoia Crest in southwestern Vista, near  Shadowridge and Melrose Drives, estimated that 50 homes in his neighborhood  have been invaded by the pests and said not much seems to stop them.  </P> <P> "You can kill them with insecticide, but more keep on coming," he said. "It's  like a river of insects. You spray and they die, but more just come. It's like  something you'd see in the movies."  </P> <P> Added Edward Nickles, who lives on nearby Applewood Lane: "There are billions  of them, and I'm not kidding. I sprayed a retaining wall with (insecticide) and  killed them, and 15 minutes later more were climbing over it. I swept up dead  ones, and it looked like a shovel of dirt."  </P> <P> Most neighbors are spraying the perimeters of their property with insecticide  or washing down their driveways and patios with water. But there are some  reports of the bugs getting into the homes of residents who are gone during the  day and word that at least one family has retreated to a nearby motel so their  children can sleep at night without worrying about bedbugs -- imagined or  otherwise.  </P> <P> Source of the problem is a 55-acre, uncultivated, weedy field to the west of  their neighborhood that is owned by the Carlsbad Municipal Water District for a  water reservoir. Until about a year ago, the field was irrigated and planted in  tomatoes by a farmer who leased the land, but the land has since gone to seed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ditch Was Dug  </P> <P> Neighbors first started complaining about the bugs about 10 days ago, unsure of  the source. It was eventually traced to the water district property, and as  soon as district officials realized the problem, they disked the property, dug  a ditch along the perimeter and have used hand-spraying and a small, hand-held  torch to kill the bugs as they enter the ditch. Neighbors say the work seems to  be paying off -- although countless numbers already inched their way to freedom  before the barriers were set up.  </P> <P> David Kellum, the county entomologist, said outbreaks of the false chinch bug  are not uncommon, especially from once-fertile fields that have gone unwatered  and uncultivated for a year or more. The bugs abandon their host in search,  literally, of greener pastures, like some endless wagon train as wide as the  field itself.  </P> <P> "The field dried up and their food source was depleted, so they're looking for  new food," Kellum said. In this case, their target was the Ellebrecht's and  Nickles' neighborhood, which is about 1 1/2 years old.  </P> <P> "As more and more people infringe into rural neighborhoods, they'll see this,"  he said. "There have probably been outbreaks like this before, but nobody was  around then to complain."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crawl Up the Body  </P> <P> The bugs are darkish brown and about an eighth of an inch long. "You wonder  where their legs are, they're so small, and how they move so fast," Nickles  said. "It's almost comical to watch them. But then, if they get on your shoes,  they start crawling up on you and get on your neck and arms."  </P> <P> Kellum and Keith MacBarron, the county's vector ecologist, suggest that  residents simply abate the problem as best they can with streams of water. Many  will simply drown.  </P></p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Letter: Conditions right for new funding policy Sir, It appears to be received wisdom that underfunding the public sector borrowing requirement would result in a rise in short-rates, owing to the increased supply of Treasury bills, and a fall in gilts yields, owing to the reduced supply of gilts. It is true that gilts yields would fall, in so far as UK bond prices reflect domestic supply and demand conditions as well as conditions in the international capital markets. And higher gilts prices could be expected to support UK equities and improve conditions in the new issue market - all of which would help to speed up recovery from the recession. But the notion that short-term rates would have to rise is false. These are determined by Bank of England policy, enforced through its control of the supply of 'cash', at levels governed at present by exchange rate considerations. There is no reason why an increased supply of Treasury bills (or more probably a reduction in the Bank's holding of commercial bills) should cause the Bank to increase its dealing rates in the market. Only if monetary expansion warranted interest rates higher than those required to support sterling in the ERM would the Bank want to raise its rates. It follows that underfunding need have no ill effects for the building societies or mortgage rates. In current conditions, when broad money is growing too slowly, the government's full funding policy should be replaced by a policy of funding only as much as is necessary to ensure an acceptable rate of monetary growth.

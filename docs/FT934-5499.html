			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Religious test for US court The US Supreme Court yesterday accepted for judgment next year a controversial case which appears to cut to the heart of the US constitutional division between church and state. The case concerns the establishment in 1989 by the New York State legislature of a special school district in Orange County, 40 miles from New York city, catering to the needs of the disabled children of an Hasidic Jewish sect which makes up most of the population of a local village. Most of the children attend private religious schools but about 220 physically handicapped children were taught at a local state school. However, their parents withdrew them on the grounds that their lessons were incompatible with their strict religious beliefs, leading the legislature to create a special district. This was challenged by the state board of education on the grounds that government thus violated the constitutional separation of church and state. State courts upheld this argument, but lawyers for the Hasidic sect, backed by the New York attorney general, Mr Robert Abrams, petitioned the Supreme Court for a review. Mr Abrams's brief maintains the creation of a special school district had no wider impact.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In examining data from Power Systems Research (PSR), <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has identified a relationship between total displacement and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rated power which suggests that a one-liter total displacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutoff would affect nearly an identical group of engines as a 19  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kW cutoff. However, using such a cutoff would cause a limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of engines to be included that would not be included using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a 19 kW cutoff (that is, engines above 19 kW but less than one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liter displacement). Examples include larger two-stroke engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A limited number of engines would also go unregulated under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario (that is, engines under 19 kW but greater than one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liter). Examples include larger industrial four-stroke engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Power Systems Research (PSR),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Engindata North America and Parts Link Aftermarket <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 1992, St. Paul-Minneapolis, Minnesota.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the differences in applicability between a power-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and displacement-based cutoff, EPA has chosen to propose the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> former despite the potential advantages of the latter. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on the appropriateness of instead limiting this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation to engines under one-liter total displacement (or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different displacement limit), or limiting the applicability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines that are below displacement or power cutoffs. Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should address the relative market and environmental impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the alternative approaches, as well as the relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Exclusion of Compression-ignition Engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is not proposing to regulate small CI engines in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action. As part of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sierra Club  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Browner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> settlement, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will determine by November 1996 whether to undertake a rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which targets emissions from small CI engines. CI engines have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different emission characteristics from the engines addressed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposal, emitting much lower levels of HC and considerably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher levels of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> than small SI engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast to the current proposal, which is focused on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieving reductions in emissions of HC, a regulation addressing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CI engines would likely focus on NOx. EPA lacks sufficient data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding baseline emissions and control technologies for nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CI engines in this power range to determine appropriate standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at this time. Therefore EPA has chosen to exclude these engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the current proposal, which is aimed at achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant reductions in small engine HC emissions on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expedited basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is raising this as an issue because of the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that unregulated CI engines could be substituted for post-control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SI engines. In EPA's view, while this may occur in some cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (for example, small agricultural tractors), the most price-sensitive products such as string trimmers and lawnmowers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlikely to shift significantly toward CI engines due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological limitations, consumer preference, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency solicits comment on the exclusion of compression- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignition engines, and on the appropriate test procedure and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that should be applied to CI engines if they were to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead be covered by this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Exclusion of Recreational Propulsion Engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to exclude engines used in recreational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, examples of which include snowmobiles, off-road  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycles, and all-terrain vehicles. Golf carts do not qualify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as recreational vehicles under this proposal, and they would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the emission standards of this rule. Engines used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such recreational vehicles are defined by the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics: Use of a continuously variable throttle (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to a governor), rated engine speeds in excess of 5,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RPM, and wide variations in both engine load and speed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's primary reason for this exclusion is the extremely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transient operation of the products in which these engines are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used, which limits the ability of the proposed steady state test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure to adequately represent exhaust emissions. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion is not based on a determination that these engines do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not contribute to air pollution and therefore need not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled. EPA has chosen to exclude engines used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recreational vehicles in order that it may proceed quickly with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for other small SI engines.

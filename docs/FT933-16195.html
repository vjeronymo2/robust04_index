			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: RWE maintains earnings and dividend payout RWE, the German energy-based conglomerate, expects to pay an unchanged DM12 per share dividend this year after holding annual profits at DM877m (Dollars 516m), around the same level as in 1991-92. The group, which forecast an unchanged result last autumn, said it also expected 'stable developments' in turnover for the current year to June 1994. Sales in the year under review rose by just 1.2 per cent to DM52.4bn, including DM19bn from energy and DM21bn from oil and chemicals, the company said at the weekend. Improved profits from energy, construction, mining and raw materials combined to offset declines, especially in the printing machinery and oil and chemicals divisions. RWE, based in Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia, enjoys a strong position as a monopoly power supplier in some of the most heavily industrialised regions of Germany. While pursuing an aggressive global diversification programme, the company is still basically an energy group. It is strongly represented in the eastern German mining and energy sectors, and recently announced a plan to take a 4 to 5 per cent stake in Endesa, Spain's state-controlled electricity concern.</p>

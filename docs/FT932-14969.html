			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / No early end to bloodshed: Proposals for outside military intervention all have their risks OUTSIDE military intervention to stop the bombardment of civilians in Bosnia is a daunting prospect for a number of reasons, but the sophistication of Bosnian Serb forces is certainly not among them. Strong on heavy weapons but low on manpower, they have lacked the infantry strength for decisive territorial advances. Their numbers, reckoned to have shrunk in the past year, are put at 40,000-60,000, against about 40,000 Moslem and 45,000 Croat forces. Serb positions are stretched over a long front, with long lines of communications. The morale of the average soldier is questionable. Western military experts see the evidence of high-quality officer training dwindling below senior levels. Local commanders are loosely controlled. With crude siege tactics focusing on civilian targets, Serb units have generally had to do little but protect their gun positions. Their M84 tanks, versions of Russian T-72s, are employed less in their intended role than as artillery pieces. Using high positions, Serb gunners can maintain terror even with a low rate of fire. This dismal picture fuels the widespread frustration felt by UN troops now involved in relief efforts. But none of the proposals for more forceful military engagement under UN authority promises an early end to the bloodshed. The main proposals are: Tighter enforcement of sanctions. This is feasible but would not directly affect Serb forces' firepower. They have no shortage of weapons or munitions, even though parts of the former Yugoslav arms industry are in Moslem or Croat-areas of Bosnia. Current stockpiles could sustain the war at least through this year and some experts say up to six years. Air strikes. Among others, Lord Owen, the EC mediator, has said air power should be considered as a means of pressure on the Serbs. However, the demonstration of western technology in 1991 Gulf war has led to exaggerated expectations. Conditions there were ideal: open country, good visibility, large targets, wide international backing. Bosnia presents a very different picture. Strikes on artillery positions would destroy some weapons and force the Serbs to move others. But the wooded mountain terrain would make identifying targets difficult. Munitions are not kept in huge dumps like Iraq's. The risks are that air strikes would force the UN to call off the humanitarian supply effort - which has arguably saved more lives than have been lost in the fighting - and would stiffen Serb determination. To meet Russian objections, the recently-launched Operation Deny Flight, enforcing the no-fly zone, precludes attacks on ground targets, except in self-defence. The flight ban is generally seen as more political than military inpurpose. If it succeeds in stopping the use of Mi-8 Hip and Gazelle helicopters to support forward Serb positions it will hamper current Serb tactics. Nato aircraft could also be given authority to attack anti-aircraft facilities. Safe havens. Broadly modelled on the successful initiative in northern Iraq, this would again be more complex in the Bosnian context, and would require substantial forces. The risk is creating Moslem ghettoes and abetting Serb war aims. A full-scale peacekeeping force. Nato has provisional plans for putting together a force of perhaps 65,000-75,000, with air support, which could be sent once a genuine ceasefire was established. Going beyond traditional lightly-armed UN peacekeeping, it would be prepared to tackle flare-ups, but not a total ceasefire breakdown. Nato commanders believe Russian participation alongside the main US, French and British contingents could be crucial to the success of such an operation, both for even-handedness and as means of exercising a moderating influence on Serbs. Tasks would include ensuring the withdrawal, demilitarisation and disarming of warring militias and the establishment of an effective police. But the record of UN forces trying to do just this in Serb-controlled parts of Croatia does not augur well. It is also a role in which the US, which would be relied on to provide up to 25,000 of the troops, has relatively little experience.</p>

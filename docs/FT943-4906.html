			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Corruption proposals open split in Rome Proposals by the Milan judiciary to introduce new laws to cope with corruption are causing serious divisions within Italy's right-wing coalition government. Yesterday Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the government spokesman and minister in charge of relations with parliament, dismissed the action of the Milan judiciary as an unconstitutional interference in the role of the legislature. This brought an immediate reply from Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister. He claimed Milan magistrates had every right to contribute to solving a delicate national problem. Mr Ferrara, he claimed with some irony, was speaking as government spokesman but not for the government which had yet to pronounce on the matter. Later, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, weighed in to prevent the matter getting out of hand. He said he understood the motives prompting the anti-corruption magistrates in Milan to suggest new laws; but he shared the reserves of several of his colleagues over the judiciary's direct involvement in politics. The proposals were advanced by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Milan's best known anti-corruption magistrate, with the backing of his colleagues at an annual meeting of businessmen over the weekend. The suggestions centre on providing greater incentives, through plea-bargaining, for people to confess to corruption. The incentives are counter-balanced by stiffer penalties to deter people from being involved in corruption. The immediate reaction among politicians appeared to be one of relief. Finding a solution to the problem of apparently endless prosecutions for corruption has been a most sensitive issue for more than a year. All attempts have foundered over public unease that the politicians were being too lenient to their colleagues, businessmen and civil servants under investigation. The Milan judiciary has also exercised an effective veto over any legislation it did not endorse. The move seems to be a neat way of sidestepping these hurdles. The approach was welcomed by the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, two components of the coalition. Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia was also supportive. The magistrates' supporters underestimated the strength of those who felt the move overstepped the institutional role of the judiciary. Mr Ferrara said: 'The Milan public prosecutors' office cannot become an agency for making laws. The Milan magistrature has enormous merit but this should not permit its members to exceed their role.' The government is unlikely to take a formal position until the judiciary presents its proposals to the government. Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

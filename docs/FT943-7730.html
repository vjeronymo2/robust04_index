			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Cubans in Florida accept policy switch The Cuban-American community in Florida appears to acknowledge the need to stem the flow of would-be immigrants to the US as refugees from the Caribbean island. Even so, the community is showing a mixture of outrage and resignation, as well as relief, at Washington's decision to change its policy. Now those fleeing Cuba are apt to find themselves back on the island - in detention at the US base of Guantanamo. The change in US policy to Cuban refugees, which until last Thursday was welcoming those fleeing the Castro regime and offering them the possibility of permanent residence status after one year, did little to deter those launching their rafts from Cuba's northern shore to cross the Florida Strait. The US Coast Guard in Florida reported it had picked up a further 1,189 people on Saturday, the highest one-day total so far this year and nearly three times the number of such Cuban refugees who arrived in the whole of 1990. As the US administration continued to refine its policy, on Cuba, President Bill Clinton seems to have won support in both Florida's non-hispanic and established Cuban-American communities for closing the door on refugees. A survey of 240 Florida citizens, by the Miami Herald, showed 66 per cent support for Clinton's decision and 43 per cent not wanting detained refugees given a chance to apply for asylum. Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida and all rivals likely to challenge his bid for re-election in November approved a tough stance on Cuban refugees, an indication of how they judge the attitude of non-hispanic voters in Florida. Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban-American National Foundation, the community's most powerful lobby, endorsed the Clinton administration's decision. Fears of second-generation Cuban-Americans well established in Floridaw ere put clearly by Eduardo, a student of dentistry from Miami, who said: 'The people coming over are Cuba's garbage. They give Cubans who have come over here and worked their way up a bad name.' The Transit Centre for Cuban Refugees at Key West, on the southern tip of Florida,was empty of would-be immigrants by Saturday morning, but full of disappointed relatives who had come down from Miami hoping to be reunited with family and friends newly picked up at sea and brought ashore. There was an angry demonstration. Mr Lincoln Daz Balart, a Miami Republican and one of three Cuban-Americans in the US Congress, said that Mr Clinton's reversal of policy on Cuban refugee immigration demanded an equivalent change towards a tougher approach to dealing with President Fidel Castro of Cuba. 'If you're going to have a Haitian-style immigration policy for Cubans, you should also have a Haitian-style foreign policy for Cuba,' Mr Daz Balart said. One of the fiercest critics of the long-standing US embargo on trade with Cuba is Mr Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, director of Cambio Cubano (Cuban Change) in Miami. He advocates a 'good-neighbour policy with Cuba', involving negotiations with Mr Castro to bring political democracy to the island in return for a gradual opening of trade. See Editorial Comment</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Moriyasu Okazaki; received via Nikkei </F> Telecom Database]    [Text] A bureau chief of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry who recently visited Taiwan has spoken of his  intention to effect visits by cabinet members to Taiwan, and  moves concerning this are afoot in Japan to invigorate  intergovernmental exchanges between Japan and Taiwan.  Commenting on 25 December on these moves in Japan, a top  Chinese Foreign Ministry official expressed unhappiness with the  moves, saying, "Some forces in Japan are instigating matters."  The same Chinese official also asked Japan to deal with the  issue of promoting exchanges with Taiwan "solemnly, cautiously,  and properly," in line with the principle established by China  and Japan when they normalized their diplomatic relations.    Some Japanese Government officials are bitterly complaining  about Japan's restrictions on travel by high-ranking government  officials to Taiwan, citing visits by high-ranking European and  U.S. government officials to Taiwan. Touching on the bitter  complaints, the top Chinese Foreign Ministry official said: 1)  France and the United States have gone beyond the limit, thereby  adversely affecting their relations with China, and their  excesses have become a diplomatic issue. Japanese-Chinese  relations are now extremely good, and there is no need for the  two countries to do anything that could adversely affect their  relations, and 2) There are the issues of exchanges between  Japan and Taiwan and the past history between Japan and China.  Japan's expansion of exchanges with Taiwan may hurt the  feelings of the Chinese people.    The same PRC official said that China is looking forward to  the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata to  China for two days from 8 to 9 January, and he expressed the  hope that Prime Minister Hosokawa will visit China as soon as  possible next year. The PRC official also added that China is  examining the possibility of having one or two party and  government leaders visit Japan next year.</p>

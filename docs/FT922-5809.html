			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: US phone companies in Dollars 2.85bn merger SPRINT, the third largest US long distance telephone company, and Centel, a large Chicago-based local telephone company, last night announced plans to merge through an exchange of shares which values Centel at Dollars 2.85bn. The deal, announced after the New York Stock Exchange closed for the day, is the latest example of a wave of consolidation sweeping through the US telecommunications industry. Centel announced last January that it would consider putting itself up for sale as part of a review of strategy options. But the nature of last night's deal, and the price put on the Chicago company, took the market by surprise. The merger, which is expected to be tax free to shareholders of both companies, involves the conversion of each share of Centel's common stock into 1.37 shares of Sprint stock. Sprint's closing price of Dollars 24 1/2 values each Centel share at Dollars 33.56 and the whole company at Dollars 2.85bn. Centel shares closed at Dollars 42 1/2 , up Dollars  3/4 . The combined group, of which Centel will own 35 per cent, will retain the Sprint name and will have an asset book value of nearly Dollars 14bn. Mr William Esrey, Sprint's chairman and chief executive, will retain these titles while Mr Jack Frazee, chairman of Centel, will become president and chief operating officer. Mr Esrey pointed out that the combined company would be the only one in the US which operated in all three large telecommunications markets. The three markets are: long distance, which provides Sprint with Dollars 5.5bn of its Dollars 8.8bn annual revenues; local services, where Sprint serves 4m lines in 17 states and Centel has 1.6m lines in six states, four of them common to Sprint; and cellular communications, where Centel operates in more than 40 metropolitan areas and over 50 rural ones.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Shamir speaks out amid hope of deal with PLO MR Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's former right-wing prime minister, yesterday accused the government of rushing to give away land to Palestinians and demanded elections, in a bid to dampen recent excitement about an imminent peace deal. Mr Shamir was reacting to statements by Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, and senior officials of the Palestine Liberation Organisation that the two sides were close to a self-rule deal which would be agreed at next week's peace talks in Washington. Mr Shamir said the issue was too important to be left to the government alone in a country divided over the peace process. 'If someone wants to decide on changing borders he has to go to the people,' he said. Leading Israeli newspapers said yesterday that Mr Peres had met senior PLO officials during a recent visit to Scandinavia to hammer out the plan for self-rule in the Israeli-occupied territories. Since his return Mr Peres has been making upbeat statements saying Israel is prepared to withdraw troops from the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho - a scheme dubbed Gaza-Jericho First - as part of a comprehensive peace agreement with Palestinians. His optimism has been shared by several PLO officials. On Thursday Mr Saleh Ra'afat, a PLO central council member, said Israel and the PLO had finalised a provisional accord on partial Palestinian control in the occupied territories after secret high-level contacts. Mr Ra'afat said the agreement centres on the Gaza-Jericho First plan combined with an interim phase of self-rule throughout the rest of the territories. However, political analysts believe the optimism may be misplaced. The Gaza-Jericho idea is understood differently by both sides and has caused a major revolt inside the PLO by hardliners who are against making any concessions to Israel that would leave any part of the occupied-territories under Israeli control, even during an interim phase. Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, was yesterday holding emergency talks in Tunis aimed at diffusing the revolt, also driven by criticism about his leadership style and the PLO's financial crisis. In addition neither side has so far outlined any breakthrough in the fundamental obstacle in the peace talks - who should control occupied Arab East Jerusalem and the Israeli settlements in the territories during an interim phase of self-rule.</p>

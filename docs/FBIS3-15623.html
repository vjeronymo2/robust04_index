The agreement on friendship and cooperation was signed by  Iliescu and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas.  Agreements on investment protection and promotion, and  commercial cooperation in 1994 were signed by Lithuanian  Industry and Trade Minister Kazimieras Klimasauskas and Romanian  Trade Minister Cristian Ionescu.    "The signing of the friendship and cooperation treaty with  Romania expands Lithuania's relations with Black sea countries,"  the Lithuanian president said.    In his words, Lithuania uses every opportunity to improve  its  ties with both "next-door" and more distant neighbors.  Lithuania and Romania should make use of their geographical  location to strengthen economic and commercial relations, he  said.    Iliescu said Romania welcomes every initiative that enhances  security and stability. The Romanian leader said a positive  thing is that security zones are created around both the Baltic  and the Black sea, but it is "hard to speak" about a union of  these zones.    Both presidents said their countries pay much attention to  safeguarding security. Brazauskas pointed out that both  countries signed up for NATO's Partnership for Peace program.  The Lithuanian president expressed hope that Russia will join  the program in the near future. "The problem of creating blocs  in Europe would then disappear," he said.    In Iliescu's words, Lithuania and Romania seek to join  different European and international cooperation structures, and  "this should not be hindered by any economic or political  barriers."    Commenting on the commercial cooperation agreement, Minister  Klimasauskas said it is very democratic, allowing to choose  goods and to set prices without any restrictions.    The Romanian delegation completes its two-day visit to  Lithuania Tuesday. Before departure, Iliescu will visit Vilnius  University.</p>

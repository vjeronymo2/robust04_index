			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTHORITIES HOLD BOY, 2, WHO WANDERED FROM CARSON HOME  </P> <P> A 2-year-old boy found alone on a park bench Sunday will not be reunited with  his mother until today so that child welfare workers can determine why the boy  wandered away from his Carson home, authorities said.  </P> <P> The toddler, Filipo Talosaga, walked out the back door of his family's  condominium sometime after 9 a.m., according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Deputy Chris Wahla. His mother had left him in the care of a 14-year-old niece  who was also watching three other children.  </P> <P> An hour later, Filipo was found two blocks away by a passing motorist who  spotted the boy sitting alone on a bench at Avalon and Sepulveda boulevards,  Wahla said. The unidentified motorist took the boy to a guard's station at a  condominium complex, where sheriff's deputies picked him up.  </P> <P> The child's mother, Taumalatou K. Talosaga, 22, arrived at the station about 2  p.m. to pick up her son, but was told that he would be kept at MacLaren  Juvenile Hall in El Monte until today, when caseworkers from the Los Angeles  County Department of Children's Services will try to determine why Filipo left  home.  </P> <P> Wahla said that before children who leave home can be returned to their  families, the children's services department must conduct an investigation.  </P></p>

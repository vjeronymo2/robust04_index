			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Accountancy Column: Accountants are challenged to vote wisely WHILE FEW accountants in the UK can be unaware of the upcoming general election, none of the politicians drafting their parties' manifestos seems to be much aware of accountancy. Statements behind the policies, however, show that the issues have not been entirely neglected. Nothing in the Liberal Democrats' 'Changing Britain for good' document nor Labour's 'It's time to get Britain working again' even hint at proposals related to the profession or wider issues of corporate governance. The Conservative manifesto, 'The best future for Britain', gets just slightly nearer with a single sweeping statement: 'We will back the regulators of the financial services industry in their efforts to achieve high standards while keeping the rule books down to manageable size'. A different story has emerged from interviews during the past few days with Mr John Redwood, the most recent Conservative minister for corporate affairs, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour City spokeswoman, and Mr Alex Carlile, trade and industry spokesman for the Liberal Democrats. Mr Redwood is cautiously optimistic about many of the changes that have been taking place in accounting - some as a result of legislation driven by his department, some generated by EC requirements. 'I've done what I can do, with the 1989 Companies Act and the development of the generous canopy of self-regulatory bodies created under that,' he says. 'We don't think the next phase of development is primarily a legislative one. It is the evolution of good practice. Government's role is to provide leadership.' He sees his job as encouraging better corporate governance, through practices such as the creation of audit and remuneration committees and the presence of non-executive directors. He says that legislation would be impractical: 'You can't stop non-executive directors being the chairman's friends.' He also rules out preventing accountants from offering other services to their audit clients. He says simply that he has chosen disclosure as an alternative, referring to the existing requirement for audit fees to be published in company accounts, and the new demand from this year to show the fees from non-audit work conducted by the auditor. Redwood resists the suggestion that he is satisfied with the mechanisms for regulation that are now in place. 'We don't want to upheave all the structures again,' he says. 'We're happy to give self-regulation a run. I don't think we've seen the structures working long enough yet to judge. In a year's time we'll have a better idea of how it's working.' He does not rule out a rejection of self-regulation if it is judged to be not working, and says he has his eye on tightening discipline and review arrangements. 'There need to be improvements in timeliness and incisiveness,' he says. 'In my own mind, there is no reason to suppose it will fail. There is always the threat of parliamentary intervention if it does.' He stresses that there is 'work still to be done', of which the most important issue is the detection of fraud. He argues that the prime responsibility for corporate failure rests with directors. He also says that he would consider 'tip-off' legislation to protect auditors and to encourage them to notify regulators if they detect fraud. Ms Mowlam, for Labour, has a cautious agenda, which clearly separates the party's official line from that of her honourable friend on the backbenches, Mr Austin Mitchell, who has been outspoken in his recent calls for the reform of the profession. 'Changes in accounting and auditing are central and very important,' Ms Mowlem says. 'There are serious problems that do need looking at. But you can't walk in and change everything in two weeks.' She says that her views have been formed through discussions she has held 'given the limited time and resources you have in opposition'. She questions Mitchell's calls for the rotation of auditors, the separation of audit and consulting work, and government regulation of the profession. She wants to wait for the outcome of several reviews, including the first year of self-regulation of auditing, and the report of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance. On improvements to the quality of financial reporting, she says she is happy with the work of the Accounting Standards Board and 'quite keen to give a chance' to Mr David Tweedie, its chairman. 'The ASB as it stands is independent and beginning to work,' she says. 'I have no doubt of David Tweedie's independence and determination to improve the profession. I have doubts whether the profession is sensible enough to let him do it.' She argues that the independence of accountancy firms is important, but questions the effectiveness of rotating firms of auditors. She says there is little evidence that it reduces fraud and is considering instead periodic rotation of partners within a firm working on any audit client. She is also unconvinced of the value of 'quarantining' audit firms to prevent them conducting non-audit work for clients. She argues that it would narrow the focus of the profession, which could harm its ability to attract recruits and affect its competitiveness in the market for advisory services. She adds: 'I am not going to be cornered into saying I am satisfied with the present system. If things don't change some of (Austin Mitchell's) suggestions will have to be implemented.' What she wants is a review of the definition of fraud, of auditors' liability for its detection and their responsibilities to notify the regulators when it is discovered. She is also considering a requirement for a public statement on a company's internal control systems. She also calls for compulsory audit committees, greater openness among the professional bodies and the presentation of accounts in a way that is compatible with government statistical requirements. Mowlam stresses that many issues of corporate governance essentially require a cultural shift, which presents no easy solution and cannot be dealt with through legislation. The Liberal Democrats' Mr Carlile is keen to spell out his party's concerns. 'We are determined to have a business sector in which people do not have to look for hidden, sinister aspects all the time. We need to clean up accounting. Fraud is not good for business.' He sees a need to improve accountancy standards, and is particularly critical of historical cost accounting. 'The methods can be very misleading,' he says. 'They are full of fiction. Accounts tend to be short on explanatory notes.' He questions the wisdom of rotating auditors, and says his party would prefer self-regulation work of the profession. 'But we are not convinced it is working terribly well,' he says. The law on auditors' liability needs clarifying, he suggests. 'It should be clarified to impose statutory duty to take reasonable care in the preparation of the audit,' he says. 'Failure to detect detectable fraud should lead to compensation for shareholders and creditors.' Perhaps most significantly, he says: 'I would favour an (Office of Fair Trading) examination of the way accountancy is developing.' He questions whether the mergers between the accountancy firms have been in the public interest, and whether pending law suits threaten their viability. 'Accountancy is now concentrated in far too few hands,' he says. The three major party manifestos may ignore accountancy, but the politicians do not. Accountants clearly fail to vote at their peril.</p>

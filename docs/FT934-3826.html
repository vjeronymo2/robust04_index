			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Increase in revenues for CBS CBS expects its network broadcast revenues to rise by 5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, said Mr David Poltrack, senior vice-president of planning and research for the US group, Reuter reports from New York. At a conference, Mr Poltrack said he expected network revenue for all of 1994 to grow by 4 per cent to 5 per cent. He cited three factors for the 1994 forecast: a strong market for scatter advertising, expected growth of 15 per cent in the audience for late-night programming, and added revenues in the first quarter from the Winter Olympics. The scatter market is for advertising sold currently as opposed to before a season begins. Mr Poltrack also estimated that revenues for the Big Three TV networks would rise 6 to 7 per cent in 1994, 'with more upside than downside to that forecast.' He said his forecast did not include Fox Network, a unit of News Corp.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Vodusek: "Unfounded Criticisms of the </F> `Policization' of the Army"]    [Text] News conference of Defense Minister Jelko  Kacin and State Secretary Boris Znidaric    Ljubljana, 31 May--The ministers of defense and internal  affairs will sign a protocol next week, a document on  cooperation between the two ministries. A coordinating group  that will settle unresolved issues in the area of preparing  systemic legislation and derivative legal acts and in the area  of education on an ongoing basis will meet for the first time in  May, according to a statement at today's news conference by  Defense Minister Jelko Kacin and State Secretary Boris Znidaric.    The protocol will delineate precisely the areas of operation  and confirm agreements on closer mutual cooperation, ongoing  notification, and mutual assistance in coordinating tasks and  operations.    Both Znidaric and Kacin rejected criticisms of the  "policization" of the army as unfounded. Regarding those  criticisms by former Defense Minister Janez Jansa, made nine  days after the appearance of the new state secretary, Jelko  Kacin said that it was not possible to policize any system in  such a short time, especially not a military one.    The results of an internal investigation within the Defense  Ministry regarding the Smolnikar scandal have been sent to the  prime minister, Kacin said. The internal commission, which is  headed by Miran Bogataj, will function as long as there is a  possibility of discovering new aspects of the background of the  event in the village of Depala.    The investigation of the attack on Mitja Kunstelj and the  Krkovic-Blagojevic case are in the hands of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs. The defense minister did not confirm the  suspicions that organized dark forces, which might threaten the  lives of the chief witnesses in the case, might be behind the  incident (except that "the events happened in the dark"). The  Defense Ministry learned about the attack against Mitja Kunstelj  only late in the afternoon, whereas the attack happened at  midnight. Kunstelj, judging by the defense minister's answers,  evaded the protection of the bodyguard assigned to him by the  Defense Ministry, Jelko Kacin also said.    The news conference was otherwise devoted primarily to the  Defense Ministry's foreign policy activities. Defense Minister  Jelko Kacin cited numerous meetings with the defense ministers  of foreign countries during the Brussels conference. In the  final documents of that conference, Slovenia, in addition to  neutral Sweden and Finland, is also mentioned as a signatory of  the Partnership for Peace. In Kacin's opinion, admission to the  Western European Union will only be possible after Slovenia  obtains associate membership in the European Union.    Jelko Kacin also mentioned as important his talks with the  U.S. and Italian defense ministers. With the U.S. secretary of  defense, Kacin talked about the possibility of lifting the  embargo against Slovenia, while the subject of the talks with  the Italian defense minister was a document on cooperation in  the military area. Italy will be the third country with which we  have signed such an agreement.    Tomorrow, Austrian President Thomas Klestil will also be  accompanied by the Austrian defense minister, the Czech defense  minister is coming to Slovenia in September, and also during  that month a Slovene delegation will visit the NATO base in  Avignan.    At the news conference, Miran Bogataj assessed the Defense  Ministry's participation in an international conference on  reducing natural disasters, at which there was a discussion of  the global threat and of a strategy until the year 2000.</p>

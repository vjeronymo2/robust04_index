			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISH COMMISSION  </P> <P> Your editorial "Commission Should Go Fishing" (Jan. 27) suggests that the  Legislature should abolish the state Fish and Game Commission and assign all  fish and wildlife decisions to Fish and Game Department administrators who will  "make decisions based primarily on scientific evidence and environmental good  sense." The naivete of your position overwhelms.  </P> <P> Speaking for those of us who have worked with both agencies for many years, let  me say that the good old American system of checks and balances -- in this case  between administrators and policy-makers -- is crucial. Each agency has its  strengths and weaknesses.  </P> <P> Granted, the Fish and Game Commission can be improved in structure and  operation. But abolish it? Dumb. Very dumb.  </P> <P> RICHARD H.

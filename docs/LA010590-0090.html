			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-JERUSALEM POST STAFF PLANS A NEW PAPER  </P> <P> Senior editors and reporters dismissed from the Jerusalem Post said Thursday  they will launch a new English-language newspaper backed by Israeli and foreign  investors.  </P> <P> About 30 Post staff members were let go this week at their request after  failing to oust publisher Yehuda Levy.  </P> <P> They had argued that he impeded editorial freedom and intended to alter the  dovish line of the Post, a prominent liberal Zionist institution.  </P> <P> "The idea is to re-embody the spirit of the Jerusalem Post," said former  Managing Editor David Landau. "We are the spirit, and people are telling us  that there can be a new body. We are looking for it."  </P> <P> The dismissed staff included top news editors and political reporters and the  entire economics department, sparking concern about the demise of the Post.  Conrad Black's Toronto-based Hollinger Inc. bought the paper last year.  </P></p>

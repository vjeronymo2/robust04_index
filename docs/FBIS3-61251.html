			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Horbulin, general director, Ukrainian </F> National Space Agency, and Oleksandr Zhyvkov, division chief,  NKAU: "Satellite Communications Links in Ukraine"]    [Text] It is a matter of common knowledge that the  state-of-the art development of industry, transportation, the  banking and finance system, as well as the mass media, require  reliable, multi-channel, and frequently mobile communications  links.    To a considerable extent, these needs can be met and  provided  for by means of creating and developing satellite-link systems.  The practical experience gained by other states in this sector  attests to the fact that what works in creating national  satellite-link systems is either based on the share-type  participation of state and commercial structures, or leasing  satellite-link channels from other countries. There are  sufficient grounds for considering that Ukraine's scientific,  technical, and industrial potential--as well as its geopolitical  position--will enable us to solve this problem in a  comprehensive manner.    In accordance with the directive issued by the president of  Ukraine, dated 3 October 1992 and entitled "On a National System  of Communications Links," as well as Decree No. 92 issued by the  Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, dated 4 February 1993 and  entitled "On Measures Regarding the Creation of a Unified,  National System of Communications Links," the Ukrainian National  Space Agency (NKAU) has developed a Program for Creating a  Ukrainian Satellite-Link System.    Primary attention in this program was accorded to the  following four services, which we will briefly discuss below in  order to inform the readers of URYADOVYY KURYER.  <H6>  A satellite-link system for general use </H6>   This has the task of providing and ensuring an international  liknk, as well as additional (reserve) communications channels  within our country at times of overloading and accidents on the  radio-relay lines and cable links. At present international  telephone links have been provided to the United States, Canada,  and Southeast Asia by the satellite-link station in the city of  Zolochev (there are approximately 500 telephone cables here);  this is done via satellites of the international consortium  known as Eutelsat. To Western Europe communications links have  been provided via Eutelsat's European satellite by a station set  up at the Kiev International Telephone Exchange (120 channels).  Further development of this service will be carried out by way  of modernizing the Zolochev Station (its potential throughput  capacity is close to 1000 telephone channels), and the station  at the KMTS [Kiev International Telephone Exchange] (with close  to 500 channels). Provisions have also been made to build  satellite stations in oblast centers.  <H6>  2. A system of satellite television viewing </H6>   As of today, the territory of Ukraine has no broadcasting  stations within a network for distributing TV programs via  satellite, although individual consumers or users can receive  more than 20 TV channels from foreign satellites. Our program  provides for expanding two or three channels to Ukraine and to  Europe, as well as for broadcasting TV items to the United  States, Siberia, and the Far East. For this purpose we will be  able to utilize the resources of the station at Zolochev, as  well as the teleport whose construction is planned to begin  quite close to Kiev. This teleport has been designed in such a  way that--after the Lybid spacecraft has been put into  operation--most TV will be relayed to the teleport from leased  foreign satellites.  <H6>  A system of satellite links with mobile objects </H6>   With the aid of this system it is planned to organize  dispatcher-type links for guiding or direct technological  processes for transport. At the present time links with mobile  objects (and in Ukraine these are still only ships) are carried  out via spacecraft of Intelsat and Gorizont, as well as the  central station (TsMSZ-1) located in the city of Odessa. Our  program provides for expanding the technical capabilities of  TsMSZ-1 in order to offer the new types of services which are  now being introduced all over the world.    Beginning in 1995, we will be launching the Arkos and Mayak  satellites in order to replace Russia's Gorizont satellites. The  NKAU has been conducting negotiations with the Informkosmos  Joint-Stock Company--the developer of the Marafon mobile  satellite link. The purpose of Ukraine's participation in this  project was conditioned by several factors. These include  advantageous rates for us for the link services and the  participation in this project by Ukraine's leading enterprises,  in particular, by the Muson Concern, located in the city of  Sevastopol. It is the only plant on the territory of the former  Soviet Union which has produced mobile satellite-link stations  for civilian uses.    We must also take into account the fact that satellite links  constitute one of the most profitable types of business, and  hence Ukraine's participation in these promising international  projects is desirable, all the more so in that investments can  be made in the form of products of our own enterprises, rather  than by hard currency.  <H6>  4. A system of satellite links for news, information, and  business </H6>   This service will consist of individual networks of links  which will provide exchanges of information in the interests of  the president, organs of state administration, banking  structures, various departments, etc.    Certain networks of the business and information links are  being created within the framework of the program for converting  defense-type enterprises. Thus, for example, the Kiev Radio  Plant is producing small-scale stations for the Sokil satellite  link (the dimenions of the antenna are 46 X 46 cm), on the basis  of which the communications network of the Ukrinterzv'yazok Firm  are being organized. The large-scale network of a banking  communications link for Ukraine's Prominvestbank is being  created by the Geosat firm, based on the SSZ [satellite-link  station] which is being turned out in Izhevsk.    Negotiations are being carried out with Western partners  concerning joint production of SZ stations for individual use at  Ukrainian enterprises. These stations can operate within the  international networks of the satellite links on spacecraft of  Intelsat and Eutelsat.    The developers of the program which we are discussing here  envision two stages for implementing it. The first stage is  offering the services on the basis of leasing already-existing  satellite links, developing a ground-level infrastructure in all  four of the above-mentioned services, as well as the  development, manufacture, and launch of our own satellite links,  along with participation in the international project for the  Marafon mobile link system.    The second stage is as follows: After the launch of the  Lybid  spacecraft, most of the traffic will be transferred to it.  Leasing channels on foreign satellites is to be maintained--for  the most part--by means of links with America and the  Asian-Pacific region. What is envisioned is the possibility and  the capacity of leasing to other states and to foreign  organizations a portion of the resources of this spacecraft,  offering to make available the services of this satellite link  to adjacent regions, carrying out launches with the aid of Zenit  rocket-carriers, and selling systems as a whole, including those  of rocket-carriers and spacecraft.    Developing the Ukrainian satellite-link system in the first  stage--prior to 1997--in the event that all the services  envisioned by our program are adopted--would require 300 billion  krb. [karbovantsy] (at the prices prevailing in July 1993) and  100 million dollars. Most of the hard-currency outlays (97  million dollars) would be earmarked for leasing channels on  foreign spacecraft.    From the time when the Lybid spacecraft is put into  operation  these outlays--while retaining and even increasing the volume of  services rendered by the satellite links--would be reduced by  approximately two-thirds and would amount to about 5 or 6  million dollars per annum. The expenditures in the national  currency for maintaining the Lybid satellite-link system would  not increase because the basic funds for creating it would have  been spent during the first stage.    And so (not even taking profits into account) the creation  of  a satellite-link system using our own spacecraft would enable us  to save some 10-12 million dollars a year and to offer users in  Ukraine all the necessary services of a satellite link.    If we were to abandon the creation of our own spacecraft and  hire foreigners on a contract basis to produce it and launch it  into orbit, then the outlays for creating the satellite segment  alone--one which would be analogous to Lybid--would amount to  approximately 160-200 million dollars, instead of 30-50 billion  krb. Such a great difference is to be explained--in addition to  everything else--by the high degree of readiness of the Zenit  rocket-carrier and by the capability for manufacturing our own  platforms for satellite links. In other words, Ukraine already  has an abundant supply of those very systems components which  are so expensive on the world market.    The difference in the value of a satellite link "made on  contract" and one of our own systems amounts to a factor of  8-10. And this also provides us with an opportunity to acquire  big profits both from selling the services of our links and from  selling the satellite links themselves--as well as their  launches--on the world market.    We are still at the beginning of the road to creating a  satellite-link system in Ukraine. But this road must be traveled  so that Ukraine may become a truly independent state.</p>

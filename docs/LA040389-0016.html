			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TARGETING YUPPIE DRUG USERS  </P> <P> William Bennett's first major decision on the war against drugs -- to  concentrate on the "yuppie drug users" -- is a clearly misguided attempt and,  although well-intentioned, reveals a crucial lack of understanding of the  problems of urban communities (Part I, March 20). I do recognize that drug use  and abuse, by any sector of our society, are wrong and of some concern.  </P> <P> However, I must point out the following to Bennett: It is not yuppies who are  selling drugs on our school campuses; it is not yuppies who are peddling drugs  on every other corner in our community; it is not yuppies who have turned to  prostitution so that they can get a quick high; it is not yuppies who are  stealing from their family members to support their habit, and it is not  yuppies who are engaging in nightly warfare over the establishments of turf for  cocaine trafficking. The fact of the matter is that the most serious and the  worst problems in our society resulting from drug addiction are not affecting  yuppies.  </P> <P> Bennett's position represents the very type of ivory-tower approach which we --  in the heart of the problem -- have always feared. I do not profess to have the  answer, but I recognize that Bennett is starting at the wrong end. Any solution  to the drug problem in our community will have to contain some combination of  law enforcement, rehabilitation, punishment and early education about the  dangers of drug use. These efforts must be directed to where the major problems  exist -- the urban communities. If Bennett does not recognize this, then he is  obviously not in touch with what is occurring in these communities.  </P> <P> KELVIN D. FILER  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

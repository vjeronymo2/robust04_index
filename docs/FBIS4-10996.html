			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has returned  to the country. He considered the visit to four South American  countries positive; he had a chance to explain the Cuban  situation and to learn something of the situation on the  continent.    Upon returning to Havana, Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that  this tour has permitted the opening of new channels in Cuban  communications with Latin America, which he defined as the first  Cuban priority in the world. Latin America is important to us,  not only to the extent that we politically agree to a dialogue  or trade, but also to the extent that we may find a way to  develop our economic relations with the world, Robaina said.    Answering a question on the debt of the American continent,  Robaina said that most countries are today trying to renegotiate  their debts, but that Cuba has neither the necessary money nor  the possibilities of paying it, he said.    Returning to the country last night after his successful  tour  of South America, Robaina said that among Cuba's possibilities,  there is nothing more important than promoting the country's  economic reactivation and increasing exports to help the country  recover from its current situation.    He added that although some government structures of the  countries he visited wanted to discuss the debt issue, the  businessmen decided to discuss other matters they considered  more important.    The Cuban foreign minister met with hundreds of businessmen  who expressed interest in investment possibilities, legal and  financial guarantees, and areas that could be negotiated with  our country.    Concerning his visit to Argentina, Robaina said that  relations between Cuba and Argentina have not changed,  especially because Cuba has remained unaffected by any public  statement by Buenos Aires officials.</p>

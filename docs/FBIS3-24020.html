Kuznechikov: "Has the Ukrainian National Bank </F> Capitulated Again?"]    [Text] Reliable sources reveal that the National Bank of  Ukraine, heeding arguments of the Cabinet of Ministers,  allocated around four trillion karbovantsy for the stabilization  fund. It is believed that the stabilization fund will be used to  ensure timely payment of pensions and wages. It is highly  probable that part of the funds will be used to pay of debts to  agriculture and to increase the working capital of a number of  enterprises, including those in the woodworking branch. All that  is fine. However, from the same sources indicate that those  trillions were hardly stored in the basement of the National  Bank. Which means... Exactly. Serious apprehensions appear that  the printing press was once again put to work. If that is the  case then it is easy to imagine the catastrophic consequences of  another emission. "Greenbacks" will rise sharply, while  Ukrainian "candy wrappers" will go down. It is not unlikely that  in a week or so a dollar will fetch 60,000 karbovantsy, if not  more. It is not difficult to guess what unlimited opportunities  will appear for foreign investors wishing to participate in our  ill-starred privatization. Unless the government introduces  protective measures they will be able to buy-up the country for  a song. All of it--down to the last bolt. It is true that some  of the optimists are nurturing the hope that occasionally even  those sources worthy of attention can be wrong.    Meanwhile the dollar to karbovanets exchange rate in Kiev is  already one to 59,000. Unfortunately the predictions are coming  true.</p>

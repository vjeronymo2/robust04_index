The experience of history -- particularly the long years  when  the world's currencies were pegged to gold -- shows that EU  [European Union] members states wanting to fix their exchange  rates will probably have to jump into Stage Three of European  Monetary Union [EMU] without moving back to narrow bands at all.    This at least was the consensus of a high-level meeting last  week at the "central banks' central bank" -- the Bank for  International Settlements (BIS) in Basel. It also matches the  broadening view that the narrow 2.25 percent Exchange Rate  Mechanism [ERM] divergence bands may in fact be  counter-productive.    The Bundesbank, for instance, is once more peddling its  aversion to narrow bands in public. But its senior officers  make clear that the intervention obligations associated with the  old European Monetary System (EMS) regime are no longer on the  table for discussion until or unless governments can co-operate  more effectively on overall economic policy.    France is also in no rush to return to a system which --  during the run on the franc in July -- cost them more than their  entire foreign exchange reserves.    In Germany, responsibility for the deutschmark's external  relationships lies constitutionally with the Bonn government,  not the Bundesbank. But in reality the coalition government led  by Chancellor Helmut Kohl is unlikely to try to tie the German  central bank back into the marginal intervention obligations any  time soon.    The two EMS crises of September 1992 and July 1993 forced  the  Bundesbank to create massive amounts of extra deutschmark  liquidity which then flooded back into the country, endangering  its efforts to control money supply and hence future inflation.    The feeling on the continent is that although the Maastricht  Treaty specifies that EU member states wanting to relax  currencies in Stage Three must have held them with "normal" ERM  bands for at least the prior two years, this and other aspects  of the EMU convergence criteria will be subject to political  negotiations starting in the intergovernmental summit in the  summer of 1996.    Therefore "normal" may not turn out to be the 2.25 percent  that pertained for most years since the EMS's foundation in 1979  but could easily be interpreted as the newly current "normality"  of 15 percent.    The meeting at the BIS, organised by the Frankfurt-based  European Association for Banking History, brought together  senior central bankers such as European Monetary Institute [EMI]  president Alexandre Lamfalussy, new BIS general manager Andrew  Crockett and former Bundesbank director Leonhard Gleske to  discuss what history could teach about currency union.    University of California expert Barry Eichengreen said that  a  viable international arrangement had to: provide a method of  adjusting exchange rate relationships when a system is subject  to an unexpected shock; possess a set of "robust" rules credible  to financial markets; and have a means of containing market  pressures -- such as the ability to change domestic interest  rate levels.    The hope at the BIS meeting was that wider ERM bands may  oblige governments to pursue balanced and credible economic  policies to hold the value of their currencies rather than  paying lip-service to artificially narrow divergence ranges that  eventually burst.    Gleske commented "by maintaining larger (ERM) margins a  number of countries would stick together and achieve better  convergence of domestic policies. If this happened for a number  of years then the countries in a smaller band would be able to  move to monetary union."    Crockett said considerable EU consensus already existed for  having "robust" monetary rules.    Most countries wanted to bring inflation down to 2 percent  or  below although there were differences over the technical means  of achieving this.    Eichengreen said that in the days when the world's major  currencies were still backed by gold reserves, central banks  were able to use various technical measures which in effect  "widened the bands" whenever capital inflows or outflows exerted  revaluation or devaluation pressure.    The central banks of Europe and America also co-operated if  a  currency was under pressure by lending gold reserves to one  another in a system not unlike the foreign exchange reserve swap  arrangements now institutionalised at the European Monetary  Institute.    Given that the BIS was founded in 1930 to try to facilitate  just such international swap arrangements the venue of the  meeting turned out to be appropriate. Though BIS efforts were  thwarted during the 1930's by international political tensions,  the EMI in the 1990's should historically speaking have a better  chance of success.</p>

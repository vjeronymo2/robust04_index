Where the State does not currently provide or maintain a full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist, the plan must clearly establish and document that the program and administrative support staff resources currently assigned to the program will temporarily meet the adequate staff requirement, and provide an assurance that at least one full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist will be assigned to the Formula Grants Program by the end of Fiscal Year 1995 (September 30, 1995).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

Section 31.301 (a), (c), (d), and (e) is revised to read as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;31.301  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allocation to states.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Funds shall be allocated annually among the States on the basis of relative population of persons under age 18. If the amount allocated for title II (other than Parts D and E) of the JJDP Act is less than $75 million, the amount allocated to each State will not be less than $325,000, nor more than $400,000, provided that no State receives less than its allocation for Fiscal Year 1992. The Territories will receive not less than $75,000 or more than $100,000. If the amount appropriated for title II (other than Part D) is $75 million or more, the amount allocated for each State will be not less than $400,000, nor more than $600,000, provided that Parts D and E have been funded in the full amounts authorized. For the Territories, the amount remains at $100,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Match.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Formula Grants under the JJDP Act shall be 100% of approved costs, with the exception of planning and administration funds, which require a 100% cash match (dollar for dollar), and construction projects funded under section 299C (a)(2) of the JJDP Act which also require a 100% cash match.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Funds for administration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Not more than 10% of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total annual Formula Grant award may be utilized to develop the annual juvenile justice plan and pay for administrative expenses, including project monitoring. These funds are to be matched on a dollar for dollar basis. The State shall make available needed funds for planning and administration to units of local government on an equitable basis. Each annual application must identify uses of such funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nonparticipating States.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 223(d), the OJJDP Administrator shall endeavor to make the fund allotment under section 222(a), of a State which chooses not to participate or loses its eligibility to participate in the formula grant program, directly available to local public and private nonprofit agencies within the nonparticipating State. The funds may be used only for the purpose(s) of achieving deinstitutionalization of status offenders and nonoffenders, separation of juveniles from incarcerated adults, removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups, and/or reducing the disproportionate confinement of minority youth in secure facilities. Absent a request for extension which demonstrates compelling circumstances justifying the reallocation of formula grant funds back to the State to which the funds were initially allocated, or the pendency of administrative hearing proceedings under section 223(d), formula grant funds allocated to a State which has failed to submit an application, plan, or monitoring data establishing its eligibility for the funds will, beginning with Fiscal Year 1994, be reallocated to the nonparticipating State program on September 30 of the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated. Reallocated funds will be awarded to eligible recipients pursuant to program announcements published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Banks lending to companies at less than cost of capital The excess of capital in the banking system is leading to banks lending money to large companies on terms which only cover 'a modest proportion' of the cost of capital, according to a leading banker. Mr David Harrison, the senior general manager for corporate banking at Lloyds Bank, said that credit losses in the early 1990s had 'to be regarded as once in a lifetime acts of God' to justify recent loan pricing. Mr Harrison told the Financial Times conference on international banking in Madrid that there were, nonetheless, trends in corporate banking which allowed Lloyds to maintain its commitment to the activity. These included the chance of forming partnerships with customers to design tailored products, such as cash management systems, which banks could then offer to a wider market knowing that they had been tested. He defended the use of overdrafts by UK companies despite supervisory calls for longer-term finance. 'With luck, the atmosphere will improve as the recession recedes - the overdraft is too useful to be abandoned,' he said. Mr Onno Ruding, vice-chairman of Citicorp, said that monetary union in Europe was 'not dead, but carries a serious possibility of being implemented around the year 2000' by five or six EU members. However, technical factors such as the need for banks to have five years' warning of the introduction of a single currency meant that the original Maastricht Treaty timetable of full union by 1999 was unrealistic. He said that retail banks would bear substantial costs of adaptation, but the main revenue losses would be felt by wholesale banks, which would suffer a loss of income from intra-European currency exchange. Mr Isamu Koike, managing director of the Industrial Bank of Japan, said that Japanese bankers were more confident that they had identified the size of bad debts stemming from the 'bubble' economy. Mr Koike said that the Dollars 136bn of non-performing loans held by the 21 largest banks would 'not be resolved overnight' but Japanese banks' earning capacity should enable them to recover without government intervention.</p>

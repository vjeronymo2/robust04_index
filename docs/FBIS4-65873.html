			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg, Germany, May 25 (AFP) -- President-elect  Roman Herzog has called for a "head-on fight" against the  extreme right in Germany by the organs of the state, in an  interview to appear Thursday [26 May].    "It is above all a question of the police and legal  authorities," Herzog, who is currently chief judge of the  Federal Constitutional Court and was chosen Monday [23 May] as  the next head of state, told the weekly DIE WOCHE.    Asked whether he believed extreme right parties and groups  should be outlawed, he replied: "Yes, when the facts are such  that one can be sure of upholding the case in the courts."    Herzog said he could not imagine neo-Nazi theories  flourishing in Germany. "What worries me much more is that the  crypto-Nazis, the old incorrigibles, should find an appeal and  imitators among the younger generation."    Herzog, who takes office July 1, was criticised for not  having dealt with the problem of mounting extreme right-wing  violence in Germany in his acceptance speech Monday evening  following his election.    In the DIE WOCHE interview, the president-elect called for  determined resistance against any development on the lines of  that in Italy to bring neo-fascist parties into government.    He saw no immediate danger of this, but said "the highest  vigilance" was demanded.    Herzog spoke out against the revival of German nationalist  ideas, which he believed could "no longer be a driving force for  our people" today and which struck no chord in him personally.    He also dismissed the idea that reunited Germany need no  longer feel concerned about its Nazi past.    Herzog did "not feel emphasis should primarily be laid upon  past responsibility, but on what we can learn for the future",  which for him meant "a particular need to develop barriers  against totalitarianism".    "We must be ready in the future to draw conclusions from the  atrocities of the extermination of the Jews and other  minorities. I can for that reason absolutely not adopt this  notion that the postwar period has ended," he said.</p>

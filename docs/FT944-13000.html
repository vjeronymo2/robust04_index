			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley wins Stet role Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has won a fierce contest to advise the Italian government on the privatisation of Stet, the state controlled telecommunications holding company. The government announced yesterday the approval of the recommendation by IRI, which owns some 65 per cent of Stet, to appoint Morgan Stanley. The bank has played a big role in the privatisation or break-up of a number of the world's biggest telecoms companies, including British Telecom and AT&amp;T. Morgan Stanley was one of 21 firms in the competition which began late last year. The government said an Italian adviser would be appointed in the next few days to work alongside Morgan Stanley on equal terms. Mr Stephen Waters, co-head of Morgan Stanley in Europe, said he believed it would be possible to complete the sell-off next year. 'I think it is important to get it off when it's ready to go. My own sense is that this can be in 1995.' The bank will help to shape the privatisation process and will play a role in deciding who will handle the sale of Stet shares to international investors. Stet owns 60 per cent of Telecom Italia and other holdings in areas such as manufacturing and software, and ventures such as Stream, the multimedia company jointly owned with Bell Atlantic of the US. The sale is set to be one of the largest in the international telecoms sector.</p>

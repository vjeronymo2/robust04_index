			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Indicators spur hopes of economic recovery in US A SHARP rise in the index of leading indicators and a jump in home sales yesterday further bolstered hopes of an early US economic recovery. In congressional testimony, however, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, cautioned that the outlook remained highly uncertain. The pace of recovery so far was 'little more than glacial'. The Fed stood ready to ease monetary policy again if growth failed to materialise, he said. The composite index of leading indicators rose 0.9 per cent in January to register its first big rise since last July. Sales of new homes rose 12.9 per cent in January to an annual rate of 622,000, the highest level for nearly two years. Both indicators were stronger than most analysts expected. Rising share prices provided much of the impetus behind the recovery in leading indicators. But the rise also reflected strength in orders for plant, equipment and consumer goods, a rise in building permits, and faster growth of the money supply. Leading indicators for November and December were revised to show declines of only 0.2 per cent in each month, rather than 0.3 per cent as previously calculated. Last year, the index of leading indicators began rising about three months before the economy staged a partial recovery from recession. Yesterday's figures, however, showed a sharp 1 per cent fall in the composite index of coincident indicators, which track the current state of the economy. The fourth monthly decline in the coincident indicators suggests the economy has been experiencing a second economic dip. Home sales in January were running at about 20 per cent above the level of last summer and about 50 per cent higher than in January last year when they were artificially depressed by the Gulf war. The improvement reflects falls in mortgage rates following successive interest rate cuts by the Fed. Last month's increase, however, was heavily concentrated in the midwest and, to a lesser extent, the south. Home sales rose only fractionally in the west and not at all in the depressed north east. Yesterday's encouraging figures follow news of an unexpected surge last month in the purchasing managers' index, a closely followed barometer of industrial conditions. Money markets, Page 33</p>

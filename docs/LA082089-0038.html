			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALCONY GARDEN YIELDS FULL HARVEST OF PLEASURE  </P> <P> As I drive through Los Angeles, the tenacity and imagination of the small-space  gardener amazes me.  </P> <P> From the New Zealand spinach thriving in the semi-shade of a front porch in a  1-gallon container to the balcony so full of plants there is barely enough room  for the gardener, their efforts are undaunted by the amount of room available.  </P> <P> When I first walked out onto the 18-by-14-foot second-story balcony of what was  then my husband's bachelor apartment, it was clearly a small-space gardener's  dream. Planter hooks hung in the places of maximum light exposure and flower  pot rings were part of the wrought-iron railings.  </P> <P> I watched the sunlight move over the area for a couple of weeks and although  slightly discouraged by the mere eight hours of light (just enough), I bought  my first 2-inch and 5-inch pots of herbs, vegetables and flowers.  </P> <P> Lavender, lemon and peppermint-scented geraniums, thyme, rosemary, dill, curled  parsley, costmary and basil filled small, hanging clay pots, while my  rectangular redwood planter held a strawberry plant, a Japanese eggplant and a  tomato plant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Our Little Eden  </P> <P> Using 1-gallon plastic containers, my husband and I carried hundreds of gallons  of water from our upstairs bathroom through three rooms to the balcony.  </P> <P> We delighted in our little Eden, and were soon treated to a harvest of three  strawberries, one dozen Japanese eggplants and 14 tomatoes. It was a meager  harvest, but one we were proud of nonetheless. The herbs, however, thrived, and  I dried lavender to scent our dresser drawers and the costmary for some  hoped-to-be-discovered use, and we cooked with the fresh parsley, thyme, dill  and rosemary quite frequently.  </P> <P> I soon became a victim of my flourishing herbs: they got bigger and bigger and  required a succession of transplantings into larger and larger containers. I  reluctantly gave up my beloved clay pots in favor of plastic to reduce weight  and conserve water. My original 2-inch thyme and rosemary plants are now  overflowing their 5-gallon containers and measure about 1 foot by 2 feet each.  </P> <P> The second season, I grew more audacious. I planted eight "baby" corn plants  and discovered, three months later, that although the harvest was miniature,  the mother plant was within normal corn size -- about 5 to 6 feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cramped Roots  </P> <P> My interest in gardening grew, The Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening and  Taylor's Guide to Vegetables and Herbs became my horticultural Bibles, yet the  garden remained imprisoned in inadequate pots and containers with low yields  because of cramped root systems.  </P> <P> When I would pull out the annual plants at season's end, the entire soil  content was one solid churning root system in search of nourishment, sometimes  growing out of the drainage holes.  </P> <P> The garden was pretty, quaint and a joy to tend, but I wanted it to perform,  wanted vegetable crops I would really see making a difference in our cooking.  </P> <P> Finally one day I put two facts together and began to create a solution to my  space problems. I had learned the average root depth for vegetables was 2 feet,  whereas my deepest planter box was 8 inches and my tallest clay pot was 12  inches.  </P> <P> I realized that if my plants were higher up, in very deep planters, I could  take advantage of greater sunlight access while providing adequate room for  greater root spread, increasing my yield. Yet I had little horizontal space, so  this planter would have to be much taller than wide, something I had not seen  in any nursery and which would have been exorbitantly expensive, judging from  the smaller sizes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Redwood Planters  </P> <P> Also, the wooden planters I had seen were held together with nails and  stainless steel ribbons that would pull apart after several season's weight and  expansion.  </P> <P> I had seen something similar to what I needed in a gardening magazine but it  had handles for carrying and wheels for moving around, was square and required  nails for its construction. I didn't need mobility, so I figured I would take  the basic design and enlarge it, strengthen it and make it a rectangle.  </P> <P> Thus one Saturday my husband and I sat over brunch with paper and pencil  between us. Several muted arguments later, and after drawings, calculations and  refinements, we ended with a design that is adaptable to any space, is sturdy  and beautiful.  </P> <P> The redwood we used gives off an intriguing spicy smell when watered as well as  lending a woodsy feeling to the cityscape it adorns.  </P> <P> Having finished the planters (four in all) by early March (two weekends of  work), I began the task of choosing vegetables and herbs that would yield the  most per square inch of space.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tomatoes Are Healthy  </P> <P> I set seeds into 2-inch pots so I could bring them indoors in case of a freak  frost (at least three of which have happened in the last three years) and  transplanted them into the planters in early April. A hose attached to the  bathtub tap helps with the now-gargantuan task of watering.  </P> <P> As with any garden, especially with the complications of limited light and the  dangers of over-watering with container gardening, I have had some successes  and some failures.  </P> <P> My Roma tomatoes are healthy, bountiful and just ripening now and the Japanese  eggplants are another high-yield crop. I have seen at least a 50% or more  increase in plant size and crop yield working with the planters. Arugula and  chiso (a Japanese herb) are shorter-term crops that grow well in the lower  light areas of the balcony and several summer lettuces are surviving the heat  so far (Little Gem, Little Red Riding Hood and Red Leprechaun).  </P> <P> The Italian parsley, coriander, red, green, orange and yellow sweet peppers,  baby watermelon, honeyloupe and basil plants are all thriving to date, though  the jury is still out on the melons, which are just setting fruit now.  </P> <P> All in all I have reached my sought-after goal: almost every night there is an  element of our dinner that has been home grown in our own organic garden on the  balcony off our bedroom.  </P></p>

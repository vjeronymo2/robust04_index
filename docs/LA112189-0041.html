			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENG, 85, SAYS HE RETIRED BECAUSE HE MIGHT 'SAY CRAZY THINGS' AS HE AGES  </P> <P> Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said he retired because he might say crazy  things as he ages, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported Monday.  </P> <P> In a speech to senior officials, Deng said his retirement was designed to end  the practice of lifetime tenure among top officials.  </P> <P> "My last function is to take the lead to abolish lifetime employment," Wen Wei  Po quoted Deng as saying.  </P> <P> "When a man grows old, he tends to become stubborn and lose energy; this cannot  be changed by subjective will. I am old now, my brain still works, but I may  say crazy things in the future."  </P> <P> The speech was made Sept. 4, two months before Deng, 85, officially resigned  from his last Communist Party post.  </P></p>

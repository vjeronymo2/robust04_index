			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (6): Sandwich courses thrive - University of Glamorgan / Tradition of vocational study THE founders of the South Wales and Monmouthshire School of Mines could hardly have imagined in 1913 that this highly specialised establishment would develop into a fully fledged university with a comprehensive prospectus. A remarkable history of change and development lies behind the University of Glamorgan, which currently has more than 8,000 full-time students, 14 departments and 400 academic staff. The story started with the need to train and educate people to run the mines of south Wales, and the Coal Act of 1911 laid down that 'an approved diploma or degree, together with practical experience of mining, was necessary for any person to be qualified for a certificate of competency to manage a colliery.' This obliged colliery owners to recognise the need for formal schooling, leading to a recognised qualification, and 18 local pit owners decided jointly to set up and finance a school of mines. The location chosen was Treforest near Pontypridd, and the ideal building was identified as Forest House built by the Crawshay family, prominent ironmasters in south Wales. The new school was opened in 1913. The most notable aspect of curriculum development was the emphasis on practical training, combined with the theoretical rigour of an academic course. One of the first sandwich courses in the country was introduced at the school, enabling students to be seconded from their employers for study at the college. This brought education to students who had previously been unable to give up employment and income to study. Sandwich courses continue to be a vital element of study for degree courses and diplomas in higher education. Professor Adrian Webb, the recently appointed first vice-chancellor of the university, says: 'We really need to stick closely to our vocational mission ...our intention must be to do less on campus and more on site in private industry and in the public sector.' Prof Webb, who took up his appointment in April from Loughborough, believes maximum emphasis has to be placed on in-service training and on constantly up-dating practical and academic studies. 'I think this is very much what industry needs ...it's the very opposite of an ivory tower.' Following the government's white paper on higher education in 1957 the then Glamorgan Technical College was redesignated as an area college and again retitled, this time as Glamorgan College of Technology. Eight years later, Mr Antony Crosland, then education secretary, proposed the introduction of polytechnics and in 1970 the college was redesignated Glamorgan Polytechnic. More changes followed in 1975 when the polytechnic merged with Glamorgan College of Education at Barry to form the Polytechnic of Wales. The merger worked well, but two years ago the initial teacher training role was withdrawn from the polytechnic, which reverted to a one-site campus at Pontypridd. It was the only polytechnic in Wales, and this created an internal argument about whether it was sensible to lose this distinction in order to become a university when the status of all polytechnics was changed last autumn. In the end the demands of marketing, particularly to overseas students, won and the poly became the University of Glamorgan last September. However, this should not lead to substantial changes in academic or practical goals. A company, the University of Glamorgan Commercial Services, was established last year to handle all commercial activity and to act as the focal point for links with industry. In another innovation, there are franchise courses with local colleges and with educational establishments in Greece and Malaysia. Prof Webb believes that the inevitable pressures to 'chase the universities' tails' should be resisted by the former polytechnics, or by Glamorgan at least. He cites the change of status by the colleges of advanced technology (CATs) when they became universities, when some found themselves poor relations of the older, more traditional universities. 'There is a real chance that the polytechnics could end up at the bottom of the pile by chasing the university model. Our strategic plan must lead us to build on the traditional polytechnic model. Our mission remains largely vocational and this has great benefit both for employers and for the local community.' The university received one of the prestigious partnership awards, given as a mark of excellence in course design and teaching, in each of the last two years, and this year it has won two - a rare achievement. Prof Webb says: 'We succeeded in this national competition because our courses are well taught, and they are closely geared to what students need and to what employers are looking for in potential employees.'</p>

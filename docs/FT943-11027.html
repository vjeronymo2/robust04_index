			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Council tendering plans published The Department of the Environment yesterday published detailed proposals for handling compulsory competitive tendering in English local authorities which are to be reorganised after the work of the Local Government Commission. For services already covered by CCT, including housing management, the requirement to put work out to tender will be largely lifted. Reorganised authorities will not be subject to CCT for white-collar services until two years after reorganisation.</p>

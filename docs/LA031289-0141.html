			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. JUDGE NAMED TO CALIF. HIGH COURT;  </P> <P> GOVERNOR SELECTS APPELLATE JUSTICE JOYCE L. KENNARD  </P> <P> In a surprise move, Gov. George Deukmejian on Saturday nominated Appellate  Justice Joyce L. Kennard, an Asian-born immigrant who spent part of her  childhood in a World War II internment camp, to the California Supreme Court.  </P> <P> If confirmed, Kennard, a 47-year-old former state prosecutor and now on the  state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, will succeed Justice John A. Arguelles,  who retired March 1.  </P> <P> While there had been speculation that the governor would name a woman to the  high court, most of the attention had focused on Appellate Justice Patricia D.  Benke, 39, of San Diego, whom the governor had considered for previous openings  on the court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Radio Announcement  </P> <P> But Deukmejian, after conferring with Kennard on Monday, informed her of his  choice Friday night and announced her appointment to the $103,469-a-year post  on his regular Saturday radio program.  </P> <P> "Justice Kennard is superbly qualified and she has had a remarkable life of  achievement and triumph over adversity," the governor said. "(She) has proved  that hard work, skill and intelligence, combined with the promise of the  American dream, can lead one to great achievements."  </P> <P> Kennard declined Saturday to make extensive comment before her confirmation  hearing, but did say, "I consider it a great honor to be the governor's nominee  to the state Supreme Court. I expect now to be devoting all my efforts to  completing my assignments on the Court of Appeal and preparing for the  hearing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Youngest Member  </P> <P> Kennard, a resident of Sherman Oaks, is a former trial court judge who was  elevated to the Court of Appeal only a year ago and has been generally regarded  as a judicial conservative during her relatively short time on the bench. Thus  her move to the moderately conservative high court was seen as unlikely to  result in a major philosophical realignment. Nonetheless, she stands to be the  court's youngest member and could wield considerable influence in a long-term  career.  </P> <P> She would be only the second woman to serve on the state's highest court. The  first, Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, was defeated by the voters in the  November, 1986, election along with Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph R. Grodin.  </P> <P> Informed sources said Saturday that while Benke had not officially taken  herself out of the running, she had made it clear to the governor that if  nominated, she would not be prepared to move from a new home in San Diego she  shares with her husband and two children, ages 5 and 7.  </P> <P> Three court members currently live in Southern California and make weekly  commutes to the court's headquarters in San Francisco. None, however, has small  children at home.  </P> <P> Benke expressed strong support Saturday for the governor's selection of  Kennard. "I can't say that I'm not disappointed but I certainly can't complain  about the governor's decision. Joyce is a wonderful, delightful person and  she's going to be an outstanding member of an outstanding court."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prepared to Move  </P> <P> Kennard, who is married but has no children, said that if confirmed she would  relocate in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The new nominee was born in the Dutch East Indies, which is now Indonesia, and  spent her childhood years on Japanese-occupied land during World War II. Her  father, who was Dutch, died when she was an infant, and she and her mother  spent time during the war in a camp in West Java run by mercenaries.  </P> <P> Later, Kennard and her mother were able to find money to secure passage to  Holland, where Kennard's studies at a private high school were interrupted for  two years when she lost a leg from a life-threatening infection.  </P> <P> Kennard eventually became trained as a Dutch-English interpreter and, at 20,  came to Los Angeles and found a job as a secretary. Seven years later, her  mother died, and Kennard used the $5,000 her mother left her to enter Pasadena  City College.  </P> <P> Then, after earning a scholarship, she transferred to USC, where she was  graduated Phi Beta Kappa and later earned a law degree. She became a  naturalized citizen in 1967.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Favorable Response  </P> <P> Initial response to the nomination among legal authorities was favorable.  </P> <P> Justice Marcus M. Kaufman said he was "gratified" the governor made the  appointment promptly to bring the court to its full seven-member strength.  </P> <P> "From all I've heard, she is very, very well-qualified and will be a welcome  addition to the court," Kaufman said. "She will also provide a welcome feminine  perspective that will enrich the court."  </P> <P> Gerald F. Uelmen, dean of the Santa Clara Law School and an authority on the  state high court, predicted Kennard would be confirmed quickly in view of her  "excellent" reputation as a jurist.  </P> <P> Uelmen noted, however, that Kennard had not served on the bench as long as  previous Supreme Court appointees of the governor and thus had not established  the same kind of judicial "track record" on which to base predictions of future  performance.  </P> <P> "I think this appointment indicates the governor is willing to take a certain  risk in order to achieve the objective of getting a woman on the court," he  said. "I don't think the governor would take that kind of risk if this were a  swing-vote appointment."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confirmation Step  </P> <P> Kennard still must be confirmed by the state Judicial Appointments Commission,  which includes Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de  Kamp and Appellate Justice Lester W. Roth of Los Angeles, the senior presiding  justice of the state Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> It is expected that a hearing will be held by the commission in mid-April. If  approved, Kennard could be sworn into office immediately. Meanwhile, Arguelles  will continue to serve temporarily on the court, completing work on cases in  which he has participated -- including the widely watched constitutional test  of Proposition 103, the insurance reform initiative.  </P> <P> Kennard, Benke and Appellate Justices H. Walter Croskey of Los Angeles and Fred  W. Marler of Sacramento all had been under formal consideration by the governor  for the post. In the last three months, the four potential nominees had  undergone a confidential evaluation by a special commission of the State Bar.  The commission's report is non-binding on the governor, but if the governor  selects a nominee the commission has found unqualified, that fact may be  disclosed publicly.  </P> <P> Benke was one of six appellate justices considered by Deukmejian two years ago  for the vacancies left by Bird, Reynoso and Grodin.  </P> <P> Kennard, after graduation from law school in 1974, joined the attorney  general's office in Los Angeles, working in the criminal division until 1979,  when she took a post as a senior research attorney in the state Court of  Appeal, handling both civil and criminal cases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Court Appointments  </P> <P> In 1986, Deukmejian appointed her to the Los Angeles Municipal Court and the  next year named her to the San Fernando branch of the Los Angeles Superior  Court.  </P> <P> In evaluations made in response to inquiries by the state attorney general's  office when Kennard was nominated to the appellate bench last year, lawyers  familiar with her performance as a trial court judge described her as an able,  forceful and prosecution-oriented jurist, skilled and knowledgeable in legal  research. One lawyer noted that despite her background as a prosecutor, she  appeared to be "very fair" to defense attorneys.  </P> <P> In March, 1987, Kennard, while still on the Superior Court, sentenced a Sylmar  man to seven years in prison -- just four months short of the maximum -- for  shooting at a car on the Golden State Freeway.  </P> <P> Although occupants of the car were uninjured, the crime represented a serious  threat to public safety, the judge said.  </P> <P> "We are all aware of the thousands of commuters who drive the freeways every  day . . . and we know all too well the frustration that can be experienced from  an inconsiderate driver," Kennard said. "But such conduct does not justify  shooting. To tolerate such behavior would recall the days of lawlessness when  it was the outlaw and his gun, not the law, that ruled."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Identification Issue  </P> <P> In a unanimous opinion by the Court of Appeal last July, Kennard rejected  claims by a convicted burglar that his identification by the victim soon after  the crime was unfairly suggestive because no other people were included in a  police "show-up" or lineup.  </P> <P> "A single-person show-up is not necessarily unfair," Kennard wrote for the  court. "The potential unfairness in singling out a suspect is offset by the  likelihood that a prompt identification shortly after the commission of a crime  will be more accurate than a belated identification days or weeks later."  </P> <P> In a widely noted case that is now before the state Supreme Court, Kennard  joined in an appeal court decision in January rejecting a constitutional  challenge to the display of a Jewish menorah during the holiday season at the  Los Angeles City Hall.  </P> <P> The three-judge panel agreed that the display did not violate provisions of the  state and U.S. Constitutions barring government establishment of religion.  </P></p>

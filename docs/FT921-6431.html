			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: S G Warburg There is an element of hysteria about yesterday's fall of more than 6 per cent in S G Warburg's shares. The merchant bank admitted that second-half pre-tax profits would not match the Pounds 89m recorded in the first half, but the total would still be above the Pounds 66m for the equivalent period of 1990-91. That suggests the British Telecom issue was not quite the bonanza it should have been. Since Warburg's fiscal year started on October 1, the FT-SE has fallen by about 100 points and equity turnover has dwindled. Corporate finance business has become scarcer as decisions have been deferred because of the recession and the election. The pace of business could quicken after the election, especially if a Tory victory lifts the equity market out of its present torpor, allowing a revival of both capital raising and bid activity. In the meantime, a floor of Pounds 66m for second-half profits does not exactly constitute a collapse, although it is a far cry from 1989-90 when the bank notched up Pounds 187.5m in the full year.</p>

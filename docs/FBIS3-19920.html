			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Johanna Korhonen: "Finnish Growth Tops Among </F> Western Countries"]    [Excerpts] Finland's production will increase faster next  year than in any other Western country. Unemployment will,  however, remain at peak levels at the same time.    On Wednesday [16 February] the Finance Ministry published a  forecast that claims Finland is climbing out of the recession.  The recovery is, however, very unevenly distributed: Industrial  production and exports will continue their vigorous growth, but,  at the same time, domestic consumer spending will continue to  decrease while unemployment will increase.    "The economy stabilized during last year, and the turn  toward  growth is now under way. This does not mean that the recession  is over, however. The situation in some spheres of the domestic  markets will get even worse," says Sixten Korkman, director of  the Finance Ministry's Department of National Economy, as he  presented the forecast.    The price competitiveness of Finnish industry is so good at  the moment that exports this year are more than one-tenth higher  than last year. The Finance Ministry is also predicting that  demand for imports from Finland's most important trade partners  will begin to rise and that export prices will increase by about  6 percent.    The outward condition of the national economy will improve  remarkably this year when the balance of trade, which measures  the difference between currency gains and losses in foreign  trade, will rise to a surplus as high as 12 billion markkas.    Last year, Finland's net foreign debt rose by 37 billion  markkas, to approximately equal 60 percent of the GNP. According  to the ministry, this rise was caused primarily by changes in  currency exchange rates, that is, by the weakening of the markka  against other currencies. The trade deficit actually increased  the debt by only 5.5 billion markkas.    Now the net foreign debt is shrinking. The ministry is  predicting a 16-billion-markka surplus in the balance of trade.    The Finance Ministry predicts that industrial investments  will show a marked increase this year. This is explained by the  fact that firms involved in exports will modernize their  equipment and establish more production capacity. On domestic  markets, investments will continue to decrease.    Investments by the public sector, that is primarily by the  state and communities, will still decrease this year, according  to the Finance Ministry.    The weak link in the entire national economy is consumer  spending, which the Finance Ministry estimates will decrease 2.5  percent this year.    The biggest decrease in consumer spending will be in goods  and services related to foreign travel. This will decrease by  more than one-tenth from last year's levels.    The Finance Ministry believes that the "change in the  economic atmosphere" will cause people to cut back on savings  this year. This will not, however, greatly increase consumer  spending, since real disposable income for households will  decrease further by 4 percent due to higher taxes.    According to the ministry, "the forecast for most service  industries is continued difficult times, due to lethargic demand  and weak profitability." According to the forecast, private  sector services will still increase by 1 percent.  All in all, the sum of the values of all produced goods and  services, the GNP, will increase about 2 percent this year when  compared to last year. Next year the GNP will increase by 5  percent, according to the ministry's forecast. [passage omitted]    The rise in consumer prices, in other words, inflation, will  continue to be very low in Finland.    Public-sector spending, as compared to the GNP, will  decrease  from more than 63 percent to 61 percent. This is partly due to  the growth in the GNP, and another cause is the cuts in public  sector spending.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaker of the Crimean Parliament Sergey Tsekov says  Simferopol would be prepared to settle for a power sharing  agreement with Kiev similar to that between Russia and  Tatarstan. In a speech in Kiev late on Tuesday [24 May], he  called for the adoption of one sweeping act to settle  differences between Ukraine and Crimea.    Tsekov believes that the current tension follows not only  Simferopol's recent decisions, but also a string of inconsistent  political moves towards Crimea over the past 18 months.    He said that under the Republic's constitution of 6 May  1992,  Crimea is part of Ukraine and "that's all there is to it."    Parliamentary delegations on both sides ended talks in Kiev  late on Tuesday by deciding to offer their legislatures to set  up a joint working group to iron out differences.    In the meantime, a Ukrainian parliamentary commission has  given the Crimean parliament three more days in which to repeal  its resolution of last Friday to restore the Republic's 1992  Constitution.</p>

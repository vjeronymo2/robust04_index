			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Falletta Gets New Contract: JoAnn Falletta, director of the Long Beach  Symphony, has signed a new, three-year contract that will raise her salary from  $70,000 this season to a projected $105,000 in the last year of the contract,  1993-94, according to general manager Mary Newkirk. The 36-year-old conductor  has generated sellouts at concerts and has turned around the symphony's gloomy  days of the mid-1980s, Newkirk said. The conductor and her Long Beach orchestra  will be featured on CBS' "Sunday Morning" program this Sunday at 8 a.m. BETH  KLEID  </P></p>

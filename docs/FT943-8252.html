			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Technology: Identity in the picture If the UK goes ahead with plans to put photographs on driving licences, will computers be able to check identity from a picture? The answer is yes, but not very well. More reliable biometric identification systems - that can identify people from biological data - use handprints, eye pictures or fingerprints. Computers can fail to recognise a face if lighting conditions or facial expression change. Automated identification systems also use extra information to improve reliability. Ben Miller, editor of Personal Identification News, says biometric systems work best when combined with identity cards and passwords. Under these circumstances even an unreliable biometric identification system may have a beneficial effect. This is the context in which face identification systems are useful. There are two kinds of error: false acceptances and false rejections. Identification is tested by comparing two sets of numbers which can be identity card numbers, PINs, or numbers derived from biometric data. False acceptances can only be reduced by requiring the numbers to be very similar, which increases false rejections. Because the false rejection rate rises as the false acceptance rate falls, a useful benchmark is the 'crossover', where the two error rates are equal. Automated recognition of hand shape gives a crossover of one in 500, says Miller. There are no reliable estimates for the crossover for face recognition - even from manufacturers selling systems. Informed guesses suggest a level of about one in 20. The importance of the two kinds of error are different. Miller says several UK banks are very interested in biometric recognition systems. They will allow a false acceptance rate of one in 20, but want to keep the false rejection rate below one in 100,000. Unfortunately, no biometric recognition system has yet met these requirements.</p>

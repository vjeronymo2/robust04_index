			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The International  Liaison Committee for the Reunification and Peace in Korea  (Cilreco) in the "Memorandum on the Nuclear Issue of the Korean  Peninsula" published on May 11 cited concrete data to refute the  false argument of the United States and its allies about  "nuclear threat" from the Northern half of Korea and laid bare  the truth behind it.    The lengthy memorandum is made up of the foreword,  concluding  words and "1. The origin of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula and U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea,"  "2. The United States' deployment of nuclear weapons in South  Korea is the dangerous source of nuclear war," "3. The  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is taking the attitude  of discriminating against the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea. U.S. interference and intrigues with IAEA are a gross  discredit to the IAEA," "4. Attempt to impose `sanctions' upon  DPRK through the U.N. Security Council is a breach of the U.N.  Charter and meant to use the international community as a tool  of the United States for executing its policy of strength," "5.  The U.S. alleged 'nuclear threat' from the North is a new  excuse based on the fiction of `threat of southward invasion'  from the North," "6. In order to achieve a peaceful  reunification of the Korean peninsula without foreign  interference, an environment favorable for a solution to all  conflicts in the region should be created and the confederation  formula laid down by the DPRK be realized."    The memorandum says the aim sought by the United States and  its allies against the DPRK, raising a hue and cry over the  fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North is to perpetuate the  existence of nuclear weapons worldwide and push ahead with their  modernization and ensure continued monopolization of nuclear  weapons by big powers, and to draw public attention away from  the U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea on the pretext  of the "Korean issue".    According to the memorandum, the United States began  shipping  nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula in 1957 in violation  of the Armistice Agreement and turned South Korea into a vast  nuclear base from the mid-1970s.    The fact that nuclear weapons were deployed in South Korea  was confirmed officially when it was made public at the 125th  session of the South Korean "National Assembly" in 1985 that the  number of various types of nukes deployed in South Korea reached  1,720.    The DPRK, a non-nuclear state, in its government statement  June 23, 1986, proposed to the United States and South Korea to  turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone, and  urged the United States to reduce the nuclear weapons in South  Korea on a phased basis for the complete withdrawal of the  nuclear weapons therefrom and to cancel all its operational  plans.    The United States, together with South Korea, is conducting  a  campaign against the North over its "nuclear arms development".    The DPRK advanced new detailed proposals, paying heed to the  "declaration on denuclearization" of the then South Korean  "President" No Tae-u November 8, 1991 and, as a result, the  "joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula" was adopted.    The DPRK concluded with the IAEA the safeguards agreement  pursuant to the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on  January 30, 1992 and accepted the agency's five consecutive  inspections of its facilities.    The IAEA, however, under pressure from the United States,  has  further spread the "nuclear suspicion" about the North, trying  to force a "special inspection" of military sites of the DPRK.    The IAEA's unreasonable demand for a "special inspection" of  military sites of a sovereign state contravenes the principles  of neutrality and impartiality of the agency.    The unfair attitude of the IAEA is manifested in the fact  that pressure has not been put on the countries whose production  and stockpile of nuclear weapons are kept secret.    Japan has promoted its nuclear program from long ago, and  South Korea has stockpiled above ten tons of plutonium enough to  manufacture 1,500 Nagasaki-type nuclear bombs.    While negotiating with the North, the United States has made  the U.N. Security Council put pressure on it.    If the United Nations truly wants a fair solution of Korea's  "nuclear issue", it must take measures to get all the foreign  forces out of South Korea, dissolve the "U.N. Command" and to  help realize the principles of independent and peaceful  reunification of Korea, as clarified in the resolution adopted  at the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly in 1975.    The North's "nuclear threat" clamored about by the United  States and the successive South Korean authorities is nothing  more than a sophism invented to justify the U.S. military  occupation of South Korea and the deployment and reinforcement  of its military equipment and "protect" South Korea under its  "nuclear umbrella".    The June 11, 1993, DPRK-U.S. joint statement supported the  North-South joint declaration on denuclearization, and it  declared that Armed Forces including nuclear weapons shall not  be used, threat not be made with such forces and the  denuclearization, peace and security of the Korean peninsula be  ensured and each other's sovereignty shall be respected  mutually. It also expressed support to Korea's peaceful  reunification.    Nevertheless, the United States again launched into a  campaign against the DPRK, expressing its intention to resume  the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, and the U.S.  President blared that any North Korean attack on South Korea  would be regarded as an attack on the United States.    The agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. New York  contact for a negotiated solution of the problem was published  on February 25, 1994, but the United States negated the agreed  conclusions by threatening to resume the "Team Spirit" joint  military exercises and not to come out to the third round talks  but take the North's "nuclear issue" again to the U.N. Security  Council.    The deployment by U.S. war-thirsty elements of 192 Patriot  missiles and 84 ground-to-air Stinger missiles in South Korea in  April this year has caused apprehensions of the entire Korean  people in the North and the South and touched off ceaseless  demonstrations in South Korea against the United States'  escalated arms buildup.    The open deployment of latest-type weapons in South Korea is  a crude violation of the Armistice Agreement.    The United Nations, with heavy responsibility for ensuring  peace on the Korean peninsula, should discharge its role and  duty.    To this end, the unstable Armistice Agreement signed in 1953  should be replaced by a peace agreement in accordance with the  resolution of the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly.    The confederacy formula laid down by President Kim Il-song  of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a realistic and  fair one which makes it possible to achieve Korea's  reunification under the conditions where two different systems  exist in the North and the South.    To achieve the national reunification is the aspiration and  legitimate right of the entire Korean people.    It is also an important factor for the elimination of  nuclear  weapons, for the security in this region and the security and  peace of the world people.    The memorandum stresses that the international community  should call for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and  that the United States must not use such international  organizations as the U.N. Security Council and the IAEA to  gratify its interests but respect the joint statement adopted  with the DPRK, resume negotiations with it and thereby create  favorable conditions for peace and detente.</p>

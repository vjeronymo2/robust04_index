			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DESI CALLED FUNNIER THAN LUCY  </P> <P> Lucille Ball "was not funny off stage" and Desi Arnaz "ended up a drunk," but  daughter Lucie Arnaz said she doesn't resent her parents.  </P> <P> Her mom was "a control freak," Arnaz said on "The Joan Rivers Show" taped  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The show will be telecast Monday.  </P> <P> "She had to be in charge 24 hours a day," Arnaz said. "She loved us in her own  way. I'm sure she loved us in the only way she knew how."  </P> <P> Desi used to say that Lucille was "so funny," but, according to his daughter,  Desi was "a lot funnier" than Lucille.  </P> <P> "I mean, as far as doing the physical stuff, she (Lucy) was the queen. But . .  . I get my humor from my dad, not from her -- which is odd, but I do. He's a  naturally funny kind of guy. And he always used to see things funny, so that's  kind of depressing that he ended up a drunk."  </P> <P> Arnaz said her father "never got the acclaim that I think he deserved, because  he was the brains behind all that comedy talent."  </P></p>

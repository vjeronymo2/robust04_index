			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: In top gear and on course for a listing - The turnround and proposed flotation of the David Brown Group Correction (Published 9th February 1993) appended to this article. IT TOOK more than a coat of fresh paint to change the face of David Brown Corporation, a famous British gear manufacturer which had fallen on hard times after 130 years of family ownership. 'Some of the workshops looked like the Black Hole of Calcutta,' said Mr Chris Cook, 43, who three years ago became joint managing director with Mr Chris Brown, 39, through a Pounds 46m management buy-in. The new managers lost no time in ordering the redecoration of the group's sprawling 16-acre site at Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, believing that refurbishment would send a positive message to both employees and customers. The clean-up also extended to the finances of the company, which is soon to be floated as the David Brown Group, with an estimated market value of more than Pounds 70m. In spite of recession, small losses at the time of the buy-in have been turned into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.3m last year on turnover of Pounds 80m. Strong cashflow has enabled the two former FKI executives to repay a Pounds 16m loan five years ahead of schedule, invest Pounds 10m on capital expenditure over the past three years and spend Pounds 3.5m on acquiring new businesses. The change in the company's fortunes has not been painless. Some 300 people were made redundant after the buy-in, and another 100 have gone because of the recession. A further 100 went with the closure of three peripheral businesses. Even after the acquisitions, the group's workforce has shrunk from more than 1,800 to about 1,350. In spite having a strike each year since they arrived, the new management team said the workforce had responded very positively to changes - in particular a move to manufacturing on a 'cell' basis, with operators watching several machines and teams taking more responsibility for organisation and quality of their output. Although much of David Brown's equipment is old, new computer-controlled machines have been bought which do the work of six of those they replace and offer even higher accuracy. The group now comprises four core divisions: Vehicle transmissions, based in Huddersfield, supplies the Challenger tanks, Intercity's 140mph Class 91 trains and most Formula 1 cars; Special products, also based in Huddersfield, makes gears up to six metres in diameter for industrial and marine applications; Radicon, with factories in Sunderland and Huddersfield, makes standard geared drives for a wide range of industrial applications; Pumps, based at Penistone, near Sheffield, makes pumps and pumping systems for the oil and petrochemical businesses. Although the four divisions existed before the new team arrived, the group was still highly centralised, with head office taking responsibility for payrolls, cash-handling and invoices. Each division now has its own managing director and finance director, and is fully responsible for its own finances. Head office staff has been cut from 40 to seven - including the two chief executives and a secretary - who occupy a corner of a huge office suite above the Huddersfield workshops. Three of the four divisional managing directors came from within David Brown, but 20 managers have been recruited to provide 'reinforcements' further down the organisation. The new management found that although David Brown's reputation for technical excellence remained high, it had acquired a poor name on delivery dates, with many customers being given the impression that production was geared to the convenience of David Brown, and not them. Mr Cook said: 'There was a low-performance culture. People were set very low targets and - not surprisingly - business did not perform well. They are now set 'stretch' targets, which are tough but realistic'. There has been marked progress. Supply times for geared motors has been cut from 12 weeks to 2 days, or a week for less standard options. The group is now beginning to win orders on the basis of its speedy supply dates. In many ways David Brown embodies the history of British engineering. An early technical lead in gears was transformed, along with empire, into a huge industrial combine, which included tractors, Aston Martin cars, and the Vosper Thornycroft shipyard. Much of the grand heritage has gone, but the group retains another typical legacy: strong ties to Commonwealth markets, but a negligible presence in continental Europe and too small a share of the US market. Gearing was 300 per cent at the time of the buy-in, but was rapidly reduced and the group will have only modest borrowings after the flotation. The new team is interested in making an acquisition in continental Europe and would also be interested in acquiring a business doing repairs and maintenance for the US petrochemical market. The flotation is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with de Zoete and Bevan brokers to the issue. The buy-in was supported by Bankers Trust, Charterhouse and Morgan Grenfell. The new management will have 20 per cent of the group, post-flotation. Mr Cook and Mr Brown scarcely knew each other while with FKI, but enjoy their shared roles of joint managing director and intend to continue the arrangement, although each does take specific responsibility for two divisions. Mr Brown said: 'We do get asked to do talks and presentations together, which can be tricky. It's important not to come across like Morecambe and Wise, but we are getting better at it.' Last year the group appointed as non-executive chairman Mr Derek Kingsbury, not least because of his experience in bringing the specialist engineering group Fairey to the market in 1988. In spite of the speed with which David Brown has been turned around, the team is keen to dispel any impression of complacency. Mr Cook said: 'We know we've still got a way to go.' CORRECTION David Brown Group, the gear and pump maker which is shortly to be floated, had one strike in 1991, a year after the group's new management team arrived. The phrase 'a strike each year since they arrived' in yesterday's FT was the result of an editing error.</p>

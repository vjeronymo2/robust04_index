			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY TIGHTENED BEFORE STRIKE BEGAN  </P> <P> Federal authorities announced Friday they had made "extensive" preparations to  ensure that air safety standards are upheld and to prevent violence or sabotage  at airports in connection with the Eastern Airlines strike.  </P> <P> Immediately after President Bush announced that he would not intervene to head  off the strike that started as scheduled at 9 p.m. PST, the Federal Aviation  Administration said it had set up a central command post in Miami, where  Eastern is headquartered, to monitor the airline's operations and all its  maintenance facilities.  </P> <P> The agency said it would screen mechanics hired to replace striking Eastern  workers to make sure they met government standards.  </P> <P> Federal surveillance and aircraft inspections also were stepped up at all of  Eastern's 11 hub cities and foreign operations and all 2,100 FAA aircraft  inspectors were placed on alert to be dispatched to any Eastern facility "as  needed," the agency said in a statement.  </P> <P> The FAA will "make sure that every plane Eastern puts into the air during this  strike is airworthy and safe," said Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner.  "If the FAA finds a plane that does not conform with standards, it will be shut  down," he said.  </P> <P> He added: "We will not tolerate any threats of sabotage . . . on the ground or  in the air."  </P> <P> FAA Associate Administrator Anthony J. Broderick said the agency has ordered  tighter security at airports serving Eastern, its sister airline Continental  and other airlines whose mechanics are represented by the International Assn.  of Machinists, the union striking Eastern.  </P> <P> Airport security officers were put on special alert, and instructed to notify  local police immediately if there is any violence on picket lines or threat of  vandalism or sabotage to equipment, he said.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear how serious the prospect of sabotage was. Skinner  said there had not yet been any firm threats, but added that "it is clear . . .  from the activity last week that the animosity between the union and the  company is very intense."  </P> <P> Federal officials were also concerned about the possibility of confrontations  on picket lines that might be set up by sympathetic unions to disrupt  operations at other airlines.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Amtrak announced it would add 12 high-speed Metroliner trains in  runs between New York and Boston and New York and Washington on Monday to help  offset any loss in airline service.  </P> <P> But Amtrak spokesmen also said rail service could be cut substantially -- in  areas outside the East as well as along the seaboard -- if Amtrak personnel  decide to honor the machinists' picket lines. The agency said it is assigning  supervisory personnel with training to operate some trains.  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service said it has prepared "contingency plans" for keeping  mail delivery going by diverting the mail to other airlines and using chartered  planes if Eastern is forced to ground substantial numbers of its aircraft.  </P> <P> Ralph Stewart, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said agency planners believe  the strike "should not have a severe impact" on mail delivery even if Eastern  finds it must shut down.  </P> <P> White House Press spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that in view of the  possibility of transportation disruptions, the Transportation Department "will  monitor the situation and . . . take whatever steps are needed to protect the  safety of the traveling public."  </P> <P> He said Bush was urging responsible labor officials "not to try to influence  resolution of this dispute by disrupting the nation's transportation system  through secondary boycotts" against other airlines.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The peace accords are facing some problems, but  these problems are being resolved. These problems in no way  mean there is a crisis, General Mauricio Vargas (retired) said  yesterday, who used the term "imperial arrogance" to describe  the remarks by UN officials on the peace process in El Salvador.    Creating a crisis is an FMLN [Faranbudo Marti National  Liberation Front] obsession, because "they are the ones who  announce them and create them," indicated Vargas, who served as  member of the government commission that negotiated the peace  accords with the former rebels.    During a visit to the Legislative Assembly, where he went to  discuss with some deputies the spirit of land transfers (one of  the pending points of the peace accords), the officer denied the  National Civilian Police [PNC] has been militarized.    The problem of the PNC deployment and the demobilization of  the National Police is that there cannot be a security vacuum,  and the government cannot stop fulfilling its obligations, he  added. In making an assessment of the peace process, UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said that although it is  irreversible some noncompliance still persists and that requires  a commitment from all sides.    In his report to the Security Council, Ghali indicated that  ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador] will reduce its personnel  as the pending agreements are implemented and he noted the  Electoral Division was dissolved, while the Military Division,  which had 368 soldiers verifying the cease-fire, consists now of  only 12 soldiers.    Gen. Vargas stressed that one of the issues not yet resolved  is the issue land transfers, but he said that issue will be  resolved with a law the Assembly is currently reviewing. The  purpose of the law is to meet the need for legal security and to  erase the uncertainty that there is no land for those who need  it, noted Gen. Vargas.    According to official sources, the extension of ONUSAL'S  presence in the country should not exceed three months because  there is little verification work to do. "It is not proper to  maintain UN intervention much longer," the sources said.  ONUSAL Mission Chief Enrique Ter Horst said today "much  remains to be done" regarding compliance with the agreements.    Meanwhile, President Alfredo Cristiani described as  "logical"  the expansion of the ONUSAL mandate, since some peace accords  are pending.    Vice President Francisco Merino does not believe extending  the ONUSAL mandate is necessary "for internal purposes."    He said, however, "to a large degree, the foreign presence  can serve to make the international community respond to our  financial needs so the agreements can be implemented without  traumatic economic results."</p>

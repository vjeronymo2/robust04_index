			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Banks continue to give support to Eurotunnel EUROTUNNEL's 220 banks have agreed to give the Channel tunnel company continued access to its Pounds 6.8bn borrowing facilities until at least May 1994, unless there is a further deterioration in the financial performance of the company. The agreement with the banks, which was announced yesterday, should allow Eurotunnel to complete work on the tunnel without having once again to enter into tortuous negotiations with its banks. The banks are believed to be receiving around Pounds 30m in fees in return for continuing to provide the funds. They had originally asked for Pounds 50m, which prompted a furious response from Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's co-chairman. The company has been in breach of its borrowing covenants and therefore needed the banks to grant it a waiver so that it could continue drawing on the borrowing facilities. The breach was caused by increases in the costs of building the tunnel and reductions in forecasts of revenues the company is likely to generate in the next couple of years, due to postponement of the tunnel's opening date and delays in delivery of rolling stock. The tunnel is currently due to open at the end of 1993, though opening could be delayed until the spring of 1994 if a long-running dispute with Transmanche-Link, the contractors working on the tunnel, is not resolved. Once the tunnel is open Eurotunnel is likely to raise new equity from shareholders. The company said yesterday that in the coming year it would 'discuss strategies (with its banks) for meeting funding requirements which may prove to be necessary after opening'. Eurotunnel believes it will have used up all the Pounds 6.8bn borrowing facilities by the autumn of 1994, though the banks fear that the company will need additional funds earlier than that, probably in the spring of 1994.</p>

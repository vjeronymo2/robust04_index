			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Felgengauer under the rubric "A Visit": </F> "The First Bell For Pyongyang: The Defense Ministers of the  Russian Federation and South Korea Have Signed a Declaration of  Cooperation"]    [Text] Yesterday in Moscow the ministers of defense of  Russia and South Korea (Republic of Korea) signed a Declaration  of Cooperation and a Memorandum on Mutual Understanding in  Military Affairs between the Ministry of Defense of the Russian  Federation and the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea.  "We have agreed to cooperate even more," said General Grachev.  South Korea and Russia also officially expressed their  satisfaction with the level of understanding achieved in the  spirit of a similar declaration previously signed.    Moscow proposed, and this was supported in principle in  Seoul, that a joint group of experts in the military-political  area be set up to develop the concept of a system of collective  security in the Asia-Pacific region. General Grachev hopes to  draw experts from other interested countries into such  consultations of experts (the USA, China, North Korea and  others).    Pavel Grachev expressed "concern over the situation of  nuclear affairs in North Korea." Moscow considers Pyongyang's  withdrawal from the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear  Weapons to be extremely undesirable. In the future certain  measures "to influence" (pressure) North Korea are possible,  fairly mild ones at first. This extremely friendly reception of  the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Korea in Moscow is  obviously the first bell for Pyongyang.    General Lee Byung Tae announced that "we have found a common  point of view on those measures which must be taken to prevent  the situation in the region from deteriorating. North Korea must  remain within the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and become a full and, most important, a responsible member of  the international community."    Pavel Grachev accepted an official invitation to visit Korea  in '95. Russia's minister expressed his hope that it would be  possible at that time to sign agreements on closer cooperation  with South Korea, including agreements in the technical military  area. General Lee Byung Tae, in turn, promised to do everything  possible to see that a future visit by our minister to Seoul  would be fruitful.    Recently the Japanese press has written extensively about  the  sale of old Russian submarines to North Korea for scrap through  the intermediary of a Japanese company. Feliks Gromov,  commander-in-chief of the Russian Federation's Navy, however,  has assured a SEGODNYA corespondent that this matter "was not  raised" at all in the talks with South Korea's defense minister.  All of official Seoul's attention is focused on Pyongyang's  possible nuclear armament. Old submarines are apparently of  interest only to the journalists.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dragoljub Stankic from Knin] </F>   [Text] The assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina  delayed its meeting today by more than three hours. They were  allegedly waiting for Krajina Radio and Television to carry out  technical preparations for a live relay of the session.  However, the situation is such that earlier disagreements  between the government and the assembly have now reached their  peak. This is demonstrated by the proposed agenda; it has been  proposed to the Krajina assembly deputies to debate the already  established prime minister-designate. Let us recall: Milan  Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, took  advantage of his constitutional powers and informed the assembly  chairman in writing that he should appoint Borislav Mikelic  prime minister-designate. Mikelic was director of the Petrinja  Gavrilovic Combine for years and then the deputy director of the  Progres Enterprise. Assembly Chairman Branko Vojnica is only  supposed to inform assembly deputies of this, the debate will be  held only after the prime minister designate informs them about  the new cabinet.    The coalition of the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina and  the Serbian Radical Party opposed the first prime minister from  the very beginning, so a heated argument on this is expected at  today's session. However, the majority orientation both in Knin  and throughout Krajina is that Borislav Mikelic should be prime  minister-designate because of his good and correct relations  with the Serbian leadership, as well as strong business links  with new Serbian prime minister Mirko Marjanovic. The coalition  of the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina and Serbian Radicals  want to overcome this situation by entering onto the agenda the  formation of a parliamentary delegation that would leave for  talks with the Serbian president.    Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic is also expected to  present the government's proposal for the platform for talks  with the Croatian delegation in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on  22 March.    On the agenda are also amendments to several laws: on the  Krajina Radio and Television, the Serbian army of Krajina, as  well as a package of financial laws.</p>

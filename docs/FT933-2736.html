			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Directors face tough SE rules TOUGH NEW Stock Exchange rules will require directors of listed companies to set out full details of their remuneration and compensation arrangements if they are fired. The new rule removes a loophole which allowed directors simply to make available a document which contained few details but noted that fuller information was available elsewhere. The change is contained in the first revision of the so-called 'Yellow Book' governing the release of company information since 1984. Its new provisions come into effect on December 1. Under the rules, wider access to directors' contracts will be required, which will have to give details of a director's salary, bonuses and stock options and performance-related pay. Annual reports will also have to reveal the unexpired term of any director who is proposed for re-election at the next annual general meeting. However, the contracts will only have to be available from the date the company's next annual general meeting is announced until the date the meeting is held. Under the old rules such information about elements of a director's contract could remain off-limits to a company's shareholders. Shareholders who succeed in ousting incompetent or profligate management, only to learn that the severence terms of the director in question require even more generous sums to be paid to him or her, have been particularly vexed by the limited disclosure required until now. The new Yellow Book also raises the thresholds which determine the method for bringing shares to listing. From December 1 shares worth up to Pounds 25m can be placed entirely with the clients of the sponsor, up from the previous ceiling of Pounds 15m. Equity shares with a value of more than Pounds 50m must be marketed to the public, up from the previous ceiling of Pounds 30m. Between these limits, shares may be marketed partly by a placing, and partly by an offer for sale or intermediaries offer. Other new rules are particularly aimed at biotechnology or scientific research-based companies whose products may take many years to develop. The exchange wished to set limits on these companies and any company seeking to have shares traded must have been conducting its activity for at least three years and be able to produce financial statements for that time. Also, it must have attracted investment from professionals, be worth at least Pounds 20m and have the raising of finance to bring identified products to commercial exploitation as its primary reason for listing.</p>

Having signed the basic program of the Partnership for Peace  last week, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said the  Lithuanian Army would have to be rearmed, so that it could meet  NATO standards.    Lithuanian Military Chief of Staff Stasys Knezys told the  Baltic News Service that the prospects of standardization in the  army were unclear and that no concrete steps had been taken in  this respect. According to Mr. Knezys, Lithuania should first of  all decide what quality and quantity of armaments and defense  systems it needs.    Meanwhile NATO officials believe that rearmament should be  started with replacing communication systems and not weapons.  At present Lithuania is using 10 various (?such) systems, and  their adaptation to NATO standards would require huge funds,  which the national defense system doesn't possess.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report from London by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi </F> Shatarah, from Sanaa by Naji al-Harazi, from Damascus by Salwa  al-Ustuwani, from Muscat by Sa'id 'Isa, and from the Aden and  Cairo bureaus of AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT]    [Excerpts] The bullets and shells in the Yemeni civil war  were accompanied by a confrontation of a new type, aimed at  holding the minds of those who have conducted the battles or  participated in them, as the two sides disseminated conflicting  communiques about the northern forces' potential capture of the  city of Aden, and the distance between it and the battles.    While the communiques issued by Sanaa yesterday indicated  the  battles were going on 5 km from Aden, communiques and statements  of the southern command said these battles were in al-Dali' in  the Governorate of Lahij--at a distance of 100 km--and in  Zinjibar, the capital of the Governorate of Abyan--about 40 km  away.    Eyewitnesses in Aden said conditions were quiet there. No  firing or shelling was heard, which would testify to the  closeness of the battles to them in the areas of al-'Alam or Dar  Sa'd. Employees went to their offices and places of work,  merchants opened their doors, and while the sounds of distant  explosions echoed, some said that they perhaps came from  northern shelling in the Governorate of Lahij.    The Sultanate of Oman yesterday witnessed a large wave of  refugees entering from southern Yemen, due to the escalation of  the battles going on between the northern and southern forces.    An Omani source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that an Omani  emergency committee was formed with the chairmanship of Musallam  Bin-'Ali al-Busa'idi, minister of state and governor of Dhofar,  to deal with this situation. The committee includes in its  membership the director of labor in the southern part of the  Sultanate and some officials from other agencies, among them the  police and the armed forces.    This committee is being aided in its work by a similar  committee in Muscat headed by the minister of social affairs and  labor, Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Ahmad al-'Isa'i, and including  officials from other government agencies.    Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, sultan of Oman, has implored the  northern and southern leaders of Yemen to stop the battles, and  expressed Oman's regret over the fighting in the Cabinet meeting  held on Saturday.    In addition, Omani officials expect that the movement of  refugees toward the southern Omani borders will increase if the  intensity of the battles increases or they near the city of Aden  or the Governorate of Hadramawt.    Feelings of unease are spreading among the Yemeni citizens  in  both Aden and Sanaa, but it appears that their morale in the two  cities is high. All appear ready to bear up and withstand  hardship for a long time, if this will bring Yemen to a happy  condition, after the months of unrest that have prevailed during  the Yemeni crisis since 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice president and  secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP],  sequestered himself in Aden on 19 August.    Observers in Sanaa stated that several of its residents have  decided to leave for their villages, not due to fear of the  confrontation's widening and reaching the outskirts of the  capital, but to protect their women, children, and elderly. They  would possibly return to defend it if the situation required.  The movement of people and cars do not give the impression that  the situation is abnormal, except that the electricity is cut  off from time to time, and gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene  are scarce.    Residents told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that they are prepared to  remain in Sanaa and defend it, even if the war continues between  what they term the forces of legitimacy and the forces of the  separatists in the YSP for several weeks to come. Most of those  who belong to regions outside the capital are amazed at the  behavior of those who have decided to leave the city and flee to  their villages, asking: "How can they leave this city, which has  afforded them a chance to work, live, profit, and acquire  wealth?"    These people expressed confidence that the war will end in  victory for the truth and the constitutional, legitimate will,  no matter how long it takes. They indicated that the bombing  that Sanaa suffers from time to time, especially during the  night hours, cannot be worse than that during the 70 day siege  in which the masses' will was victorious. They described those  who fired rockets at or conducted airstrikes against Sanaa as  "traitors who deserve the most severe punishment."    At the same time, Sanaa radio and television are carrying  propaganda campaigns to raise the morale of the Yemenis and  mobilize them against what are called "the forces of separatism  and rebellion against constitutional legitimacy, led by 'Ali  Salim al-Bid."    Sanaa news does not provide specific details on the course  of  the fighting, which has become narrowly confined, as northern  sources say, around the approaches of the Governorate of Aden.  In addition, it affirms the advance of what it describes as the  forces of constitutional legitimacy, and the proximity of its  control over the approaches to Aden, and perhaps over the city  itself during the next few hours.    However, YSP sources affirm that this is absurd, and give as  an example the communique that said day before yesterday "that  the northern forces control the al-'Anad airport, while today  this was proved untrue."    The [northern] sources stated that these forces are striving  during their advance to minimize human and material losses as  much as possible in the areas that they control, especially  among the civilians who are, they said, appearing very  sympathetic and supportive of [the North], contrary to what Aden  radio and the communiques issued from there are repeating.    In addition, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah's  rejection of what was being said about Sanaa's acceptance of a  delegation from the League of Arab States to mediate in the  Yemeni crisis produced a positive reaction among many of the  citizens. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT talked to them about this, and they  confirmed their support for President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salim's  position refusing any foreign intervention or mediation at this  very late stage of the crisis.    They also confirmed their support for what is being  expressed  in Sanaa and what Yemeni Interior Ministry sources are claiming,  that the war going on now is not between the North and the  South, or the northern and southern armies, but is a Yemeni war  between forces defending constitutional legitimacy and forces  defending the interests of some of the YSP leaders who they  described as" [unfinished sentence as published] [passage  omitted on statements by the foreign minister, Jordan's Arab  League representative, the Arab League's assistant secretary  general, on the possible intervention of Arab League states to  mediate in the crisis]    In Aden, Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, head of the secretariat of  the YSP, condemned the destruction caused by the northern  authorities in the YSP Central Committee headquarters in Sanaa  and inquired as to the fate of Salih 'Abbad (Muqbil), a  Political Bureau member and member of the Senate presidency, who  is in Sanaa and whose whereabouts are not currently known. He  indicated "the absurdity of Sanaa's claim that its forces are  nearing Aden" and welcomed "any efforts to stop the bloodshed in  Yemen."    For his part, the former South Yemeni president, 'Ali Nasir  Muhammad, called for a stop to the fighting, but insisted that  the solution should be a Yemeni one, and rejected the sending of  any Arab forces to Yemen. He affirmed that his forces are  fighting for the Yemeni people's future, security, and stability.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE INSURANCE  </P> <P> William C. George's article on earthquake coverage contains an error that  should be pointed out to your readership. George states that those who did not  purchase earthquake insurance " . . . may be out of luck, even if their homes  burned down because of gas leaking from the tremblor-broken gas mains."  </P> <P> Actually, almost all homeowner policies, while excluding earthquakes, cover  fire and explosion losses that ensue from such causes as broken gas mains. If  anyone has a question as to whether damage is covered by their policy, they  should submit a claim to their agent or company.  </P> <P> Contrary to the opinion of our critics, the business of insurance is paying  claims, not denying them.  </P> <P> ROBERT KAI  </P> <P> Vice President Transamerica  </P> <P> Insurance  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 21 KYODO -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev proposed on Monday [21 March] a new framework of  talks by the United States, Russia and China with North Korea  over its suspected development of nuclear weapons, Japanese  officials said. Kozyrev disclosed the idea during a meeting  with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Moscow, the  officials said.    Kozyrev also urged Pyongyang to abide by controls on nuclear  facilities as imposed under the international nuclear safeguard  agreement, they said. He argued that all controls should be  abided by through inspections by experts from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the officials said.    High-level talks between the U.S. and North Korea have  stalled in the wake of the IAEA's report that its inspection of  Pyongyang's nuclear facilities had been obstructed and the  collapse of the dialogue between North and South Korea. The IAEA  adopted a resolution Monday to refer North Korea's refusal of  full inspections of its nuclear facilities to the United Nations  Security Council.</p>

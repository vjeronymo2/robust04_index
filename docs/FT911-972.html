			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Blenheim shares add 18p after US stake purchase SHARES IN Blenheim Group, rose by 18p to 828p yesterday after the exhibitions and conference organiser and publisher announced that a 12.2 per cent stake had been acquired for Pounds 28.3m by Ziff Communications, the private US publisher. Ziff bought its 3.38m shares at a premium price of 837 1/2 p each from Mr Lawrie Lewis, deputy chairman and former chief executive of Blenheim. Mr Lewis is expected to sever his connection with the company which he helped to found as Blenheim Dresswear in 1979 and bring to the USM as Blenheim Exhibitions in 1986. The concern, which moved to the main market last year, has been renamed Blenheim Group. It hopes the Ziff connection will help it to develop the publishing business, which has grown from nothing to 9 per cent of turnover in two years. In the year to August 31, Blenheim made pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.3m on turnover of Pounds 88.8m. At yesterday's closing price, it had a market value of Pounds 207.7m.</p>

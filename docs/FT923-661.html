			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Ill-health spreads in wake of explosion PUBLIC HEALTH authorities have been notified of 129 people developing various symptoms of ill-health after Monday's fatal explosion and fire at the Hickson and Welch chemical plant in Castleford, West Yorkshire. Most of those affected are Hickson staff, firefighters and other members of the emergency services involved in the accident. Their symptoms include eye and skin irritation, breathing problems, nausea and vomiting. Three workers in the plant were killed and 14 injured directly. Wakefield Health Authority is also contacting members of the public 'who may or may not be connected to the incident and who have reported similar symptoms'. Dr Alison Evans, the authority's public-health director, said last night: 'The possibilities of a chemical or infectious agent, or both, being responsible for these symptoms are being actively investigated, and nothing has been eliminated from the inquiry at this stage.' But Dr David Fyfe, Hickson and Welch managing director, said tests had shown no evidence of chemical poisoning as a result of the accident. Dr Virginia Murray, a toxicologist from Guy's Hospital, London, who is investigating the symptoms, believed they were consistent with a gastro-intestinal infection such as food poisoning. One possibility is that large amounts of dirty water from the River Aire, sprayed on to the site to put out the fire, could have spread infection. Meanwhile the company is continuing to investigate the cause of the explosion with the Health and Safety Executive. The only parts of the factory damaged on Monday were the nitrotoluene distillation column where the fire started and an adjacent control room and office block. Production of other chemicals had returned to normal, Dr Fyfe said.</p>

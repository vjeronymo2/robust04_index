			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Initial prize in the power game: An Anglo-US consortium may soon become the first outsider to break into Germany's utilities market For many years, Germany's utilities resisted attempts to open them up to outside buyers. But following unification, foreign investors saw an opportunity to gain a foothold in power generation through acquiring plants in east Germany. An Anglo-American consortium, headed by Britain's PowerGen and NRG of Minneapolis, will soon sign two contracts which will allow outsiders to penetrate the country's highly regulated utilities market for the first time. The deal may act as a catalyst to break down Germany's monopolistic industrial structures and could provide east Germany itself with a solid base for nurturing competition throughout the country. It all started with wax. In late 1991, NRG, a subsidiary of Northern States Power Company, one of the leading US utilities, wanted to buy the Romonta high-quality wax works. Romonta, a subsidiary of Mitteldeutschen Braunkohle AG, or Mibrag, has 85 per cent of the world market for wax. NRG approached the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising east German industry, which owned Mibrag, the vast complex of lignite pits straddling the eastern states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony. 'We were passed from official to official,' said Mr Manfred Raschke, chairman of the Massachusetts-based International Strategic Information Services, a consultancy firm which was advising NRG. The Treuhand's New York office was told about the foot-dragging in Berlin. Mr Klaus Schucht and Mr George Lange, the agency's energy and mining experts, met NRG and astonished it by their offer. 'We were told the whole of Mibrag was up for sale,' said Mr Raschke. NRG needed a partner for such a big investment, so it turned, through Mr Raschke, to Britain's PowerGen. From day one, however, the consortium decided that utilities, not mines, were its primary interest. 'The Treuhand made it clear from the beginning that it was unable to give us the entry into power generation without the purchase of Mibrag,' said Mr Alf Roberts, commercial director of PowerGen. 'Nevertheless, we saw it (buying Mibrag) as an opportunity.' In short, if the consortium presented a viable strategy for Mibrag, it could use the acquisition to clinch a contract to build a power plant in east Germany. The Treuhand needed the consortium's cash; the consortium needed a powerful partner. The Treuhand wanted a success story. This meant finding a buyer to keep Mibrag open. Before 1989, the pits were producing 106m metric tons of lignite a year, and employing 54,600 people. By 1992, the number of workers had dropped to 16,000, and production had fallen below 30m tons. There were fears Mibrag might be shut down. But not everybody wanted the pits kept open. Germany's principal utilities, RWE Energie, Bayernwerke and PreussenElektra, known as the Big Three, appeared determined to see Mibrag closed to keep any competitors to their own monopoly position out of east Germany. Early last year, Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE Energie, said Mibrag's coal was worthless, and the pits should be either closed or merged with Laubag, the large lignite pits three times the size of Mibrag. Rheinbraun was promoting its own cause; it wanted to buy Laubag. 'Rheinbraun was not thinking about jobs in eastern Germany. It wanted to keep out competition and keep energy prices high,' said Mr Paul Achleitner of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank advising the Treuhand on the Mibrag deal. Mr Thomas Klante, spokesman for RWE Energie, holds a different view. 'We believed it would be commercially more viable to merge Laubag and Mibrag. It would reduce administrative and other overheads.' Unknown to Rheinbraun, the Treuhand had commissioned McKinsey, the management consultant, to assess the commercial viability of Mibrag. It found that the coal quality in two of Mibrag's four mines was higher than in Laubag's. The report helped convince the government of Saxony-Anhalt to keep the Mibrag mines open, and save jobs. Following talks with the European Community in June 1992, Saxony-Anhalt provided a DM600m (Dollars 375m) subsidy to help transform a planned power station at Schkopau, near Leipzig, from imported hard coal to local lignite. By supplying brown coal to Schkopau, Mibrag might survive. The Treuhand now needed a buyer for the pits. The consortium was interested. Again, the Big Three had other plans. At an international conference of utilities on June 10 in Dortmund, Mr Friedhelm Gieske, RWE Energie's chairman, said foreigners trying to buy Mibrag were wasting their time. 'The message was clear,' said an NRG negotiator at the meeting. 'Foreigners were told to keep their hands off Mibrag.' As the consortium continued its exploratory talks with the Treuhand, the workers' councils at Mibrag were questioning the pits' sale to foreigners. 'Mibrag employees were told that the consortium intended to sack all the workers and replace them with Mexicans. This was a blatant attempt to drum up anti-foreign sentiment,' said an NRG official. The workers expressed their concerns in a letter to Chancellor Kohl on September 23. Signed by the workers' councils of Mibrag, Laubag and Vereinigte Energiewerke AG (or Veag), the main east German utilities company, it was timed to coincide with a federal government discussion on east Germany's energy outlook on September 28. In the letter, Mr Kohl was asked to block the sale of Mibrag to the consortium, because 'foreign investors' would flout Germany's labour laws and destroy jobs. Echoing Rheinbraun's earlier proposals, it suggested merging Mibrag with Laubag. The letter never reached Mr Kohl. It was intercepted by a senior official who did not want it to become the focus of the meeting. In a later statement, Mr Kohl said: 'The trust agency (the Treuhand) will do a fair and competition-based review of the offer which has been made earlier by an American-British group . . .' Nobody, publicly, would confirm who masterminded the letter. 'I do not know the precise source of the letter,' said Mr David Petersen, president of NRG. 'It smelt of Rheinbraun,' said a consortium negotiator. Rheinbraun denies any knowledge of the letter. Mr Jurgen Stotz, a board member of Veag, said the workers had written it themselves. 'You must understand what was going on in the minds of the Mibrag people,' he said. 'They were fighting for their survival. They were unsure about their future.' The Anglo-US consortium persisted in its negotiations with the Treuhand. Despite mounting opposition from Rheinbraun and lack of support from the influential economics ministry, its determination to acquire Mibrag grew stronger. It had already won some political support from other quarters. During the Munich summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised countries last July, Mr James Baker, then US secretary of state, met Ms Birgit Breuel, the Treuhand president. Besides stressing the commitment by NRG and the US to investing in east Germany, he said the Treuhand should encourage foreign investors as a means of opening up competition there. The finance ministry in Bonn agreed. 'I always said we cannot privatise eastern Germany as a closed shop, and that is not restricted to any sector,' said a senior finance ministry official. 'I think we have got to use this (the consortium) to begin the break-up of the German power generation system,' he added. However, this bulwark of political assistance could not remove the single overriding obstacle facing the consortium: how to go from building a power plant to selling electricity in east Germany or abroad. The Treuhand could help with power generation but it could not guarantee access to the transmission grid. The consortium had made its purchase of Mibrag contingent upon building one of the two 800MW electricity-generating units at Lippendorf, in Saxony-Anhalt. Lippendorf is owned by Veag, which controls the high-voltage grid in the east. Although technically under the Treuhand, which will privatise it later this year, Veag is controlled by the Big Three west German utilities as a result of the Stromvertrag, or 'electricity contract'. The contract, signed in August 1990, gave each of the Big Three a 25 per cent stake in Veag. To underwrite large investments in east Germany, including modernising equipment and building brown coal-fired power stations, the Stromvertrag stipulated that east Germany's regional utilities had to buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag over the next 20 years. In practice, this created an electricity distribution monopoly for Veag and thus the west Germans. Last August, Bayernwerke and a smaller utilities company offered to build one of the two power generating blocks at Lippendorf. The consortium was interested in building the second unit, stressing it wanted to co-operate with the Big Three. 'There was no other way,' said Mr Raschke, the US energy consultant who was a negotiator for the consortium. 'You have got to remember that the German utilities are too big, too rich, and too politically well-connected to take head-on.' Bayernwerke did not want to co-operate. 'They were never happy that we should own a power plant (in eastern Germany),' said Mr Raschke. Mr Hans Werner Klein, the Treuhand's expert on privatising coal and electricity, said: 'Even if the consortium managed to build a power block at Lippendorf, we could not guarantee it access to the grid which is controlled by Veag.' Attempts by the consortium to build at Lippendorf ended abruptly at a secret meeting with the Big Three at the Sheraton Hotel at Frankfurt airport, on November 17. 'We were bluntly told to give up, and get out of Lippendorf because we would not have access to the grid,' said Mr Petersen of NRG. 'But in return for getting out of Lippendorf, they offered us a majority stake at the (900MW) Schkopau power plant.' The consortium returned to the drawing board. Despite the reduced power generation capacity at Schkopau, the station had several advantages over Lippendorf. Schkopau would come on line by 1996; Lippendorf, three years later; and Schkopau could be fuelled by Mibrag's coal. With Schkopau in play, the Treuhand put Mibrag out to tender. The deadline was December 18. The consortium drew up a detailed plan, on time. The Big Three, now interested in Mibrag, presented the same old plan - the merger of Mibrag with Laubag. 'Rheinbraun was arrogant enough to believe we would get out, and arrogant enough to believe that it could secure Mibrag, even though it had earlier condemned the pits to die,' said Mr Petersen. On January 22, the Treuhand announced that the consortium had secured sole negotiating rights for Mibrag until the end of this July. Rheinbraun had misjudged the stubbornness of the Anglo-Americans, and their ability to sway the Treuhand. Developments moved in the consortium's favour. On March 8, the Treuhand secured long-term coal contracts for Mibrag, guaranteeing it a secure economic basis. Spread over 40 years, Mibrag will supply an annual 15m metric tons of coal to Lippendorf and Schkopau. By mid-May, the coal contracts had been signed, and the consortium had started evaluating Mibrag's assets and drafting a contract in which it is expected to pay DM2bn for the pits. By the end of May, it had virtually secured a 44 per cent stake (or 400MW) in Schkopau, and obtained an agreement that Veag would buy its energy. By this time, Veag was starting to acknowledge the commitment of the consortium to east Germany's utilities market and was becoming more flexible. To have reached this stage, the consortium has made considerable concessions. The stake at Schkopau, which will cost about DM1bn, is considerably below the consortium's intended 800MW access to power generation. The terms of the contract with the Treuhand will guarantee several thousand jobs at Mibrag, which negotiators say involves some overemployment. 'It was part of the price, and our commitment in eastern Germany,' said an NRG official. In addition, the consortium has won widespread credibility by standing its ground against the Big Three. 'It was difficult. But if the concept of a European single market means anything, then what we are doing in eastern Germany seems perfectly natural,' said PowerGen's Mr Roberts. 'I expected it to be tough. But not this tough,' said Mr Petersen, who believes the foothold in east Germany could give the consortium a launching pad into eastern Europe. 'You see, the German utilities thought they could keep us out. But our company, and PowerGen, have a reputation. Unless there is nothing there, we don't give up at all,' he added. They might even acquire the coveted wax works.</p>

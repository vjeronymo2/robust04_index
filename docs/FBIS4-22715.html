			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Berres and Aleksandr Maltsev, under </F> rubric "The Case of the Vladivostok Mayor": "No Accusation Has  Been Leveled at the Administration Head"]    [Text] In Vladivostok the scandal is still raging  around the figure of the city's mayor, Viktor Cherepkov (on 18  March KOMMERSANT-DAILY wrote about the mayor's ejection from the  city administration building). Yesterday in the city's Leninskiy  Court there occurred the latest session in the suit brought by  Vice-Mayor Vladimir Gilgenberg, who contested the appointment of  a kray administration employee as the acting mayor. Meanwhile  eight local journalists who had spoken out in the mayor's  defense requested the United States consulate to grant them  political asylum, since they "feared for their life."    As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already written, the scandal began  with the procurator's office initiating a criminal case based on  instances in which employees of the Vladivostok mayor's office  had received bribes, although the fact of the bribes themselves  is confirmed only by a certain person offering the bribes, who  is named Volkov. Mr. Cherepkov's lawyer, Semen Ulitskiy,  reported to a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the kray  administration's reports to the effect that an accusation had  been made against the mayor are false, and, consequently, the  procurator's office's decree concerning the mayor's removal from  his position is illegal.    Meanwhile, according to the lawyer, associates of Mr.  Cherepkov are currently being barred from entering the city  administration building. These include, for example, Vladimir  Gilgenberg, the acting mayor during the latter's illness.  Gilgenberg himself feels that this is the consequence of his  dismissal by order of the acting administration head of  Primorskiy Kray, Igor Lebedinets, who was contested by the  vice-mayor in Vladivostok's Frunzenskiy Rayon Court. But so far  the documents concerning who specifically had dismissed Mr.  Gilgenberg have not been presented to the court, and therefore  the case is dragging out. The vice-mayor also protested in the  Leninskiy Rayon People's Court Lebedinets' order concerning the  appointment of kray administration employee Konstantin  Tolstoshein as acting mayor of the city. Yesterday there was no  court session -- this time the judge was ill.    Viktor Cherepkov himself has his own opinion about the  reasons for the scandal, and he expressed that opinion in an  interview with a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. According to  him, even as early as the mayoral election he was threatened,  and told to withdrawn his candidacy. But when he nevertheless  became mayor, "dual authority formed" in the city. On one side  was the "Pakt" [Pact] grouping of Primorskiy Kray  industrialists, who occupied key positions in the kray  administration, and on the other side were the "democrats,"  headed by the mayor. Mr. Cherepkov feels that "Pakt" monopolized  the sale of the output produced by the Primorskiy Kray  industrial enterprises, which sell their output cheaply to  "Pakt," which then resells it at substantially higher prices.  The mayor asserts that he began openly to oppose this, and that  resulted in the present criminal case. As long ago as late 1993,  certain people "began replacing" him with Mr. Volkov (who has  accused the mayor of taking bribes). The mayor was warned that  he should avoid Volkov, and he met with him in the presence of  witnesses, with the conversation being recorded by a video  camera.    Mr. Cherepkov also reported that the local journalists who  had spoken out in his defense are currently experiencing a large  amount of pressure on the part of unknown individuals -- for  example, Sergey Shakolenko, editor in chief of PRIMORYE  newspaper, was beaten up in the street. Therefore Mr.  Shakolenko, as well as Anatoliy Lelyakin, editor in chief of  BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK newspaper; Pavel Kiyevskiy, chief of the  Vladivostok administration's television center; Vadim Karyagin,  director of the Vladivostok administration's television studio;  and four more journalists had asked the United States consulate  to grant them political asylum.</p>

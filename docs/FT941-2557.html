			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Gardening: English flowers in a class of their own - Trying to impress a great foreign botanist, Robin Lane Fox finds a sight worth the journey from St Petersburg March is behaving madly, which makes life difficult for show-offs. Where do you take visitors if you want to impress them with English flowers at their best? I have just faced this difficulty. I have been trying to impress a great foreign botanist - not any old European dignitary but one of the senior plant scientists from Russia, who has seen more fruit trees than you or I would recognise and knows every botanic garden from the Caucasus to Vladivostock. A few drifts of narcissus Cragford in long grass would not make the right impression. As usual, this early spring is split between towns with clouds of early blossom and a countryside which has yet to see an anemone in flower. Acid soil and shelter have hurried along the camellias, but where are Cornwall-like habitats within easy reach of Oxford? The answer, this weekend, is at the Savill gardens in Windsor Great Park, where spring breaks early on a sheltered site. Would it have broken already, I wondered. The person at the end of the telephone assured me she could see daffodils the last time she managed to escape from her paperwork. Vladimir was expecting great things: cravenly, I threw in such sweeteners as the promise of seeing Windsor castle, royalty at prayer, and a guided tour round Eton college - the pinnacle, I apologised, of the English class system. If the camellias failed, we could fall back on boys in tailcoats and guesses about Princess Margaret's bedroom. Perhaps it was the promise of narcissi, perhaps it was the class struggle. But, when we set off, the plan already had a Russian stamp of approval because two passengers had become five: Vladimir brought along some extra friends to keep up the numbers. They had much to teach me, some of which will enliven this column in future: a post-Stalinist exclusive for the pink FT. Meanwhile, I learnt that there are great rose beds in the botanic gardens at Yalta; thousands of roses have been planted down the streets of major Ukrainian towns; and there are vast orchards of scientific collections around Vladivostock. To seal an agreement of collaboration, I now have bushes of blackcurrants (with names such as Delight of Lenin) which have been planted in that last lingering ash-bed of communism, the gardens of my Oxford college. On the road to Windsor, Vladimir wanted to tell me about great cherries which he had visited; one friend wanted to interpret; another wished to tell all of us (in Russian) about the latest political changes; and the fourth harangued me on her understanding of relations between ancient Persia and Greece. Schizophrenically, I wondered if the Savill gardens would rise to the occasion, or if we would peter out in snapshots of Eton's school yard. There is no knowing at the turnstile: the gardens are entered through an extraordinarily ugly gift shop which blots out the style which the late Eric Savill tried to achieve. The famous meadow beneath it has Britain's finest sweep of the small Hoop Petticoat daffodils which revel in the damp. A few dozen were visible, and so I improvised about the millions which were waiting to emerge. What impressed my convoy most was the meadow's similarity to the sort of steppe they see in Russia every day. Beyond the future narcissi, the white-flowered osmanthus delavayi is flowering freely, but it did not attract comment. The first rhododendrons were better, including the aptly-named Redwing; the big bushes of the Falconieri variety looked wonderful to me, but less wonderful to those in the party who had seen them wild in Bhutan. I was beginning to think it was time for St George's chapel and the royal dolls' house when we rounded the path to the garden's furthest dell and my guiding anxieties all passed away. Go and see it if your own gardens are still emerging from winter. Huge bushes of all the various corylopsis are smothered in the yellow bell-flowers which never appear on my soil and old, hybrid camellias are tangled into a flowering archway where names such as Inspiration are entwined with Salutation. The rhododendrons are not overpowering and the trunks of the birches are beautifully white. Out in the clearing, to the right of a pile of drainpipes, stands a sight worth the journey from St Petersburg. The small cyclamen-flowered narcissi are already flowering by the thousand in the wet conditions which their tubular flowers require. Above them stands a tree of a special magnolia sprengeri, its hundreds of white and reddish flowers opening flat in the spring sunshine. They bear the name of Savill, who made this garden out of unused parkland. You and I are unlikely to have the soil, or the years of patience, to grow a magnolia to this size. Visit it instead - and reflect on the appropriate chance that it was open to welcome St Petersburg's leading botanist on a visit which could never have been considered when the tree was first put in place. We admired the crocuses and felt at home among the Chinese azaleas. By the time we moved on, it did not seem to matter that the state apartments were closed and there was scope only for a snapshot of Windsor castle's towers. The Etonian boys were viewed with wonderment and the buildings made my visitors feel expressively pro-British. Magnolias, it seems, are stronger than Marxism and, when we left, we all felt we had seen something to provide a special memory - one that is greater than any particular country and common to anyone who responds to flowers. This weekend, those flowers should still be holding and the gardens will have even more to show. You do not need a foreign delegation to persuade yourself that the journey is a justified pleasure on its own terms.</p>

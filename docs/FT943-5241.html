			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mexican airlines' chairman resigns The chairman of Mexico's two largest airlines, Mexicana and Aeromexico, has stepped down under pressure from creditor banks seeking a Dollars 200m injection of new capital from shareholders. The resignation of Mr Gerardo de Prevoisin, who in February 1993 brought the two former competitors together, threatens to unravel the alliance that controls more than 70 per cent of Mexico's domestic airline market. Both airlines are in financial trouble. Aeromexico lost Dollars 136m in the first half of 1994, while Mexicana followed 1993 losses of Dollars 100m with a first-half 1994 loss of Dollars 115m. Together they have total debts of more than Dollars 1bn. Creditor banks gave Mr de Prevoisin until September 1 to find Dollars 150m of fresh capital for Mexicana and about Dollars 50m for Aeromexico. Advisers to Mr de Prevoisin say his first priority has been to find new money for Aeromexico, which has been the stronger of the two companies, both of which were privatised by the Mexican government in the 1980s. Mr de Prevoisin's plan of rationalising routes and uniting workforces among the two carriers has yet to prove its worth. Only baggage handling and other ground services have been successfully combined. Management has faced competition from a plethora of new, small airlines which have taken advantage of the Mexican government's open skies policy and flooded the most popular routes with cut-price flights. Average revenue for the airlines is between 15 and 20 cents per km travelled. The company believes it needs to increase that figure to about 30 cent per km in order to break even. Mr Jose Luis Llamosas was named new chairman of Aeromexico, while Claudio Terrein will take over the post at Mexicana. Both were already board members of both airlines.</p>

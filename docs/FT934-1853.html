			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Bonds: CCF offers two-year floating-rate notes Credit Commercial de France (CCF) provided some interest in a quiet Eurobond market yesterday when it raised FFr3.5bn through an offering of two-year floating-rate notes (FRNs). An official at the bank said that the short maturity of the notes would appeal to domestic money-market funds, short-term funds and corporate treasurers. He added that, as well as injecting fresh liquidity into the short end of the market, the issue was also the first FRN offering to be linked to the Paris inter-bank offered rate (Pibor), the short-term French interest rate, since late 1990. The notes, which carry a quarterly coupon equal to three-month Pibor, were priced at 99.91 to give a yield of five basis points over Pibor. When they were freed to trade the notes slipped to 99.85 bid, to yield seven basis points over Pibor. Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, said yesterday that it had lowered its rating on Banesto's short-term debt to A2 from A1 and removed it from Credit Watch where it was placed with negative implications in June. S&amp;P said that its action reflected the sharp increase in the Spanish bank's non-performing loans (to 8.28 per cent of total loans as of September this year from 4.87 per cent in September 1992) and the negative effect that this deterioration in asset quality was having on the bank's income statement.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: GM rejects request for recall of pick-up trucks GENERAL MOTORS yesterday rejected the US government's recent request that the vehicle manufacturer recall 4.7m pick-up trucks because of concerns about possible design flaws. As part of a vigorous defence of its safety record, GM argued that its trucks performed within federal safety requirements when tested recently by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Last month, the NHTSA asked the government to request the trucks' recall because it believed the placing of the fuel tanks outside the vehicles' frames made them more prone to fire risk in a collision. GM, however, said that the NHTSA judged the GM trucks unsafe compared to other manufacturers' trucks because it applied safety standards beyond those normally set by the government. The company also said the NHTSA ignored safety data compiled by state authorities which showed that its trucks were as safe, or safer than, other similar models.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Edouard Balladur in Guadeloupe: </F> `France Needs You'"]    [Excerpts] Basse-Terre (Guadeloupe) -- "France needs you.  The government needs you. However, it cannot do everything.  You must make your contribution to building this new society to  which we all aspire." In his first visit to the Antilles,  Edouard Balladur launched an appeal to all the inhabitants of  overseas departments to take direct control of their future by  developing their economies. [passage omitted]    Under the dome of the Regional Council, Lucette  Michaux-Chevry [president of the Guadeloupe Regional Council]  (she has been away from Paris for three weeks and some observers  said she was on bad terms with the government) argued in favor  of a greater solidarity effort from the state to help the  overseas departments and, like all the deputies present,  expressed the desire for better cooperation between the state  and Guadeloupe, a "frank and active partnership based on mutual  respect."  <H5>  Large Amounts of Aid </H5>   This is the message the prime minister echoed. "The state  will support you by encouraging you to exercise your local  responsibilities. Moreover, the state is at your side every  time Guadeloupe experiences problems. I am anxious that the  state should honor the pledges made in 1989 following Hurricane  Hugo. To this end, a sum of 30 million francs [Fr] has been  allocated for economic recovery. The remaining Fr75 million for  rebuilding public buildings will be allocated very shortly."    These are not the only measures that he was to announce. For  instance, state funds for Guadeloupe will increase from Fr589  million to Fr824 million in the 11th Plan. The state will  devote Fr285 million to the funding of major port, airport, and  road facilities. Guadeloupe's social policy will be  strengthened with an allocation of FR122 million; FR326 million  will go to agriculture. Finally, a package of Fr89 million will  be allocated for environmental protection.    "The state," Mr. Balladur stressed, "is ready to cooperate  out with you on economic development and a more united society."  Explaining the bill drawn up by Dominique Perben [the minister  for overseas departments and territories] to combat unemployment  more effectively in the DOM [overseas departements], he  continued: "We want to encourage the DOM to develop their  economies. We want to compensate for the financial handicaps of  remoteness, insularity, and the small market size. If we are  able to use its potential, this bill should make it possible to  increase the activities available to those in job creation  programs by two-thirds in two or three years. This ambitious  project is costly. National solidarity will pay for the reform  of the job creation program. Employment aid measures will have  an annual cost of over Fr1 billion." This cost will be funded  partly by the increase in overseas departments of VAT on  products which are not essential. This is a measure which has  not been well received here but which the prime minister regards  as necessary. This plan, he argued, "is an opportunity for the  overseas departements. It is an opportunity which Guadeloupe  must not waste."    Before continuing his visit to Les Saintes and relaxing on  the beach, Mr. Balladur stressed the need to achieve unity to  jointly take up the "challenge of the new society."</p>

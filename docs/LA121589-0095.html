			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUOTABLE  </P> <P> "I have been told that the movie industry is probably the slowest industry to  grasp technological changes of any industry in American society. They had the  ability to do talking pictures years before they did it, they had the ability  to do Technicolor a decade before they did it; they are just techniphobic." --  Amos Hostetter Jr., chairman of Continental Cablevision in Broadcasting  magazine.  </P></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar fails to strengthen The dollar yesterday failed to rally despite the tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve and a generous cut in the German repo rate, writes Philip Gawith. The US currency finished in London at DM1.685, down from its Tuesday close of DM1.6885 before the Fed nudged up the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent. The dollar is well below the DM1.76 level it traded at shortly after the Fed tightened in February. In Germany, the Bundesbank provided further evidence of a decoupling of US and European interest rates when it announced an eight basis points cut in the repo rate to 5.80 per cent. The dollar also finished lower against sterling, closing at Dollars 1.4935 compared to Dollars 1.4862 on Tuesday. The pound was boosted by a poorer than expected February retail inflation figure which set back expectations of a cut in UK interest rates. There was widespread concern in the market at the dollar's failure to rally despite the favourable interest rate movements. Mr Brian Hilliard, senior international economist, at SGST, said it seemed there was 'virtually no circumstance that provides strength to the dollar.' Others were less pessimistic about the US currency. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said the market remained thin with 'the long term players very much committed to the (long dollar) positions they held at the beginning of the year.' Sentiment against the dollar has soured following the currency's repeated failure to make headway despite an interest rate differential moving in the US's favour, and good growth prospects. Dollar bears are certainly in the ascendancy at the moment. Swiss Bank Corporation, for example, confirms that it is 'very comfortable' with its forecast of the dollar at DM1.60 by the middle of the year. The SBC view is that the dollar is weak because of a large current account deficit and interest rates that are too low. A spokesman said if the US currency went through DM1.67 by next Monday, a large number of investors would be forced to rethink their positions. 'People who buy currencies because of growth are having to reconsider,' he said. Mr Chertkow says the dollar needs a catalyst to break from the levels where it is currently 'languishing'. One candidate he suggests would be a package of market-opening measures from the Japanese government. Another would be the release of a good non-farm payroll number on April 1. The UBS analyst added that in the absence of evidence of long-term investors being frightened out of the dollar, he was happy to stand by the bank's forecast of DM1.80 by mid-year and DM1.90 in December. In the futures market Eurodollar contracts firmed showing a slight downward revision of the pace at which Fed tightening is anticipated. The June three month future rose by eight basis points to 95.68. The December contract was nine basis points firmer at 94.84. More encouraging for the dollar was that it managed to keep a firm tone against the yen, despite a return to the offensive from US negotiators about the trade dispute with Japan. The dollar closed in London at Y106.430 from Y106.005. The Bundesbank pleased the market with its generous repo cut, at the top end of traders' expectations. The D-Mark held up well in Europe, finishing unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.418 and the Belgian franc at BFr20.64. The lira was slightly firmer against the D-Mark at L988.9 from L990.4. Euromark futures rallied after this news, but later lost ground when rumours were rife about another bad money supply figure. The February M3 number will be released later this week, and there was speculation that growth could be as high as 30 per cent - well above the Bundesbank guideline. The June contract settled one point lower at 94.50, with the December contract seven points down at 94.88. Call money was slightly easier at 5.70/5.80 per cent after the repo, indicating the market view that interest rates will continue to fall. In the UK, sterling had a better day as a poor inflation number scotched talk of a rate cut. The headline retail price index rose 0.6 per cent in February for a year-on-year rise of 2.4 per cent, compared with market forecasts of 2.2 per cent. It finished at DM2.5165 against the D-Mark from DM2.5094 on Tuesday. In the futures market, sterling contracts eased across the yield curve showing the market believes rates may be close to bottoming. The June contract lost two basis points to 94.83 while the December future was seven points lower at 94.39. In the discount market, the Bank of England offered a Pounds 365m round of late assistance after forecasting a fairly small shortage of Pounds 750m. Analysts said the delay in clearing the shortage was probably the result of banks holding back bills earlier in the day because of interest rate speculation.</p>

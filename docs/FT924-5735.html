			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Export prospects buoy Fairline Boats shares SHARES OF Fairline Boats, the luxury yacht maker, yesterday rose from 175p to 197p as buoyant export prospects outweighed annual results well short of expectations. The Peterborough-based group turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 507,000 for the 12 months to end-September, compared with profits of Pounds 3.02m last time. BZW, the company's broker, last month forecast a deficit of Pounds 250,000. Losses per share worked through at 7p against earnings of 55.9p. The total dividend is halved from 21p to 10.5p with a final of 6.925p. Mr Sam Newington, chairman, said: 'We are budgeting for increased sales and a return to profit in the current six months, and if we meet our targets, we will be well set to restore the dividend'. The shares are well below their peak of 590p in October last year. Thereafter, signs that recession in the UK and Europe was catching up with the luxury boat trade, confirmed by the group's poor interim results in May, sent investors scuttling. Sales fell 21 per cent to Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 35m), and although costs were contained, the company incurred an operating loss of Pounds 672,000 against a Pounds 2.59m profit. Mr Newington said that export sales made up 63 per cent of business, but demand in France, Spain, Germany and Japan was weak. However, the company had record order deposits of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 888,000) at the end of October, with the value of the order book standing at Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 6.1m). Mr Newington said sterling's devaluation would boost exports this year, but Fairline would also benefit from the year's 'heavy investment' in new models: Squadron 62 (which sells for Pounds 620,000) and Squadron 56 (Pounds 414,000). He said there was good demand from German customers, increased interest from Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, and Fairline would exhibit at a boat fair in Dubai, when it could win back orders lost since the Gulf war. It was still unclear how VAT would be implemented in Europe. In the past EC boat-owners could avoid paying VAT by buying in one country and berthing in another.</p>

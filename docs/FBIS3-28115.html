			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Thursday [3 February] expressed willingness to  modify details of a new indirect tax in response to criticism  from the largest party in the ruling coalition, a cabinet member  said.    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, one of the six cabinet  members from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which opposes  the new tax, told reporters Hosokawa said he is "ready to modify  my decision to introduce the tax if the leaders of coalition  partners approve of such change in their meeting."    Hosokawa told fellow Diet members of the Japan New Party  that  the SDP was "indispensable" for the coalition, adding, "if the  ruling coalition tells me to do something, I am not concerned  about saving face."    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference the Hosokawa administration is ready to modify the  details of the new indirect tax, tentatively called a national  welfare tax.    The chief cabinet spokesman said the administration is ready  "to correct the wrong" if it helps defend the unity of the  coalition and alleviate public dislike of the new tax proposal.    The premier instructed the leaders of the coalition partners  to band together for a meeting on Thursday afternoon to work out  a consensus over the issue prior to the announcement of the  government's expected 15 trillion yen pump-priming package,  coalition officials said.    Hosokawa reportedly plans to cite the package in his summit  with U.S. President Bill Clinton on February 11 to alleviate  U.S. criticism of what the U.S. sees as Japan's insufficient  efforts to rekindle its stagnant consumer spending and whittle  down its trade surplus.    Igarashi made the remarks after he and other five ministers  from the SDP called on Hosokawa at the premier's official  residence to demand a change in the new tax plan.    It was not immediately known whether Hosokawa was ready to  comply with the SDP's chief demand to insert into the text of  the new tax bill wording that would obligate the government to  spend all the fresh revenue from the new tax on welfare.    Under Japan's revenue structure, the government can set up  an  independent account inside the state budget -- apart from its  general account -- for accepting and disbursing fresh revenues  from a new tax, if it wants to spend all the revenues from the  new tax for a specific purpose.    Hosokawa's remark came a few hours after the SDP leadership  decided to stick to its demand urging the coalition to amend the  tax plan and threatened to withdraw its six ministers from the  cabinet unless the demand is met.    The SDP criticized the welfare tax as a ploy to persuade the  public to accept a virtual tax increase by merely changing the  name of the consumption tax.    The new 7 percent tax, whose mechanism is almost identical  to  that of the current 3 percent consumption tax, is to be imposed  on most goods and services.    In a news conference in the early hours of Thursday,  Hosokawa  said the government decided to impose the new tax to offset a  revenue shortfall from planned income tax cuts and finance the  cost of increased welfare spending due to the rapidly graying  society.    He said the government wants to introduce the new tax to  offset a revenue shortfall stemming from the income tax cut of 6  trillion yen, starting from April 1, 1997.    The SDP, which has insisted on the abolition of the  consumption tax, bolstered its parliamentary strength in a 1989  House of Councillors election shortly after the then LDP  administration of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita introduced the  tax.    Since joining the seven-party coalition, the SDP has been  forced to accept compromises over key issues such as the opening  of Japan's rice market last year and political reform in January.    The SDP said in December that it opposed a GATT compromise  proposal on partially opening the rice market, but had no choice  but to abide by Hosokawa's decision to accept the plan.    The party was forced to accept a compromise plan on  political  reform bills reached between Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei  Kono during last-ditch talks, for fear that the SDP's opposition  might bring about collapse of the coalition government.</p>

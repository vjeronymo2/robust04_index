			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Michel Rosten: "Decisive Days for Bosnia"] </F>   [Text] It is possible that within the next two weeks we  will see the Bosnian crisis take a decisive new turn. At the  beginning of next week, NATO will be holding a summit during  which Bosnia will certainly be a subject for discussion. We  cannot reasonably hope to see, by the waving of a magic wand  like in a fairy story, any miraculous solution emerge from this  meeting of the Sixteen. But at least we can hope that the  allies will agree on a stance to take, and that they  subsequently stick to it.    It is in fact on 18 January that events should start to  turn.  This is when the warring parties meet in Geneva to continue  negotiations. Yet again, there will be comments by those who no  longer believe that a solution can be found at a table covered  with green baize; it will be a last-chance meeting for the many  experts involved in the negotiating process. It does seem clear  that further failure will have dramatic consequences as it would  be impossible to implement peace before the spring and that, as  a result, the war leaders could return to their activities  undisturbed.    This scenario, which would be disastrous for the populations  of the three communities, is, unfortunately, a serious  possibility. On Thursday morning [6 January], in an interview  given to RTBF [French-language Belgian Radio and Television]  Television from his headquarters in Sarajevo, General Briquemont  spoke of information indicating that the Bosnian authorities now  want to win the war. This is not the first time that it has been  said that Mr. Izetbegovic is not interested in a cease-fire:  Sufficiently armed, he feels that he is able to adopt a  position other than that of peacemaker. Diplomats who attended  the conference organized on 22 December in Brussels by Mr. Claes  have also concluded -- in all "neutrality" -- that the  responsibility for the failure of this negotiation lay -- in  technical terms -- with the Muslims. They demanded, with a view  to a negotiated division of the republic, 33 percent of the land  with links between the isolated enclaves. The Serbs, who are  anxious to achieve a lifting of the international embargo  imposed on them, were ready to make the concessions that the  negotiators demanded of them; but Mr. Izetbegovic wanted more or  -- more specifically -- other zones than those which Mr.  Karadzic agreed to deliver.    This is not a question of coming to the Bosnian Serbs'  defense, but fairness prevents all the blame for the present  impasse being attributed to him in the way which Mr. Claes chose  to do at the end of the negotiations -- and in terms which are  scarcely in keeping with what one would expect of a foreign  minister.</p>

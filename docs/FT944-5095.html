			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Germany to decide on Nato's request for jets The German government is expected to decide tomorrow how and when it will respond to a request from Nato for German Tornado fighter-bombers to back up airstrikes in Bosnia, officials said yesterday. But the Nato request, made last week, has revived sharp divisions within the country's political establishment about what military role Germany should and can play following the end of the cold war and the unification of east and west Germany in 1990. It has also rekindled memories of the second world war when Germany backed the fascist, or Ustasha regime in Croatia, and bombed Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, will discuss the request with Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister. But officials yesterday said Mr Kohl's room for manoeuvre was limited because of the government's slim parliamentary majority as well as opposition within the cabinet to sending the Tornados. A spokesman for the Free Democrats (FDP), the junior partner in the governing coalition, and which holds the foreign ministry portfolio, said it was 'highly sceptical' that either the government or the Bundestag would ever agree to send the Tornados to fly patrols over Bosnia. In contrast to Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which runs the defence ministry, the FDP has staunchly opposed any active military role for Germany outside Nato territory. Mr Karsten Voigt, foreign policy spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), yesterday described the entire discussion as highly 'irresponsible', given the political and military risks. However, several commentators, including Mr Walther Stutzle, the military expert and editor-in-chief of Tagesspiegel, said yesterday: 'Germany apparently still believes it can take time to recover domestically (from unification) and overlooks the fact that a giant mess is brewing on its doorstep.' Mr Robert Hetkamper, a commentator for ARD state television said: 'If Germany refuses . . . that could drive a deeper wedge in the alliance.' Nato asked Germany for the Tornados because, apart from the US, it is the only Nato country which has fighter-bombers equipped with Electronic Combat Reconnaissance devices, or ECRs. This military technology can neutralise surface-to-air missile launchers by jamming their radar systems. But Nato diplomats yesterday said the request was made also in the knowledge that constitutionally Germany can now send troops out of Nato territory following a ruling by the constitutional court last July. Since then, German pilots have manned the Advanced Early Warning Aircraft, or Awacs, which have monitored the no-fly zone over Bosnia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- The Japanese Foreign  Ministry on Friday [25 February] rapped moves in the United  States to draw up a bill targeting trade with Japan, saying it  is "unproductive" that Washington would draw such a bill  unilaterally.    "We think it is unproductive that the United States would  draw up these bills unilaterally," Foreign Ministry spokesman  Terusuke Terada said. He said the Japanese Government is making  efforts to hammer out voluntary measures to open up its market,  holding a cabinet-level meeting earlier in the day to discuss  the matter.    Terada was commenting on moves by a group of U.S. lawmakers  led by House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt Thursday to  introduce legislation requiring the U.S. Government to retaliate  against Japan unless the Japanese meet some U.S.-set import  targets.    The bill, or the Fair Market Access Act of 1994, requires  the  Commerce Department to define "objective criteria" for what the  U.S. feels would be a fair market share in Japan for U.S.  products. The bill was the second salvo this week from Congress  on the troubled U.S.-Japanese trade relationship.    On Tuesday, two key U.S. senators on trade matters submitted  legislation to revive the so-called "Super 301" trade law, a  measure that would require the U.S. Government to cite unfair  foreign trade practices on an annual basis and retaliate if no  settlement is reached through negotiations.    Terada said the U.S. understanding that past bilateral  agreements with Japan have had no results at all is wrong,  saying there is "clear proof" that the two sides have made  steady results out of the past arrangements.    As such proof, he cited that Japan is the second largest  market for exports of U.S. products and that NTT's [Nippon  Telegraph &amp; Telephone] procurement of foreign goods has  increased 46 times over 13 years ago when an agreement was made.    He also said there were 11 cases in 1993 in which Japan  purchased supercomputers and that six of them were U.S.-made  supercomputers.    "So we can't understand the discussion on the other side of  the Pacific Ocean that the past arrangements were ineffective,  or that there were no results," Terada said.</p>

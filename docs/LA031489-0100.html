			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDIO CITY FIRM TAPS INTO GROWING MARKET FOR BEST SELLERS ON TAPE  </P> <P> A year ago, Michael A. Viner read "A Brief History of Time," a recent book  about the universe by Cambridge scientist Stephen W. Hawking. And where Hawking  saw stars, Viner heard the sound of money.  </P> <P> "I thought it was going to be a big hit, no one else did," Viner recalled. The  hard-cover version of Hawking's book was published by Bantam Books, but Viner's  Studio City company, Dove Books on Tape, stepped in front of Bantam and other  publishers and bought the audio rights to record the book on audiocassette  tapes for a $2,000 advance.  </P> <P> A month later, Viner had a six-hour, four-volume tape version of Hawking's book  for sale -- retail price $24.95 -- in bookstores nationwide.  </P> <P> Viner's hunch paid off. Hawking's book was one of the most popular nonfiction  books of 1988, and has spent the past nine months on The Times' best-seller  list. As for Dove, it's sold 40,000 copies of the tape version of the book,  making it Dove's biggest seller since Viner started the company four years ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Picking Winners  </P> <P> Most of Dove's success, in fact, rides on Viner's sixth sense about what new  books will be big sellers and popular with the burgeoning audio-book market,  while moving nimbly to get the rights to those books.  </P> <P> Dove, which is two-thirds owned by Viner, also banks on its ties with some  well-known authors, including Viner's close friend, best-selling fiction writer  Sidney Sheldon ("Master of the Game," "The Sands of Time") to supply raw  material for its tapes. Sheldon also likes the books-on-tape idea and is a part  owner of Dove.  </P> <P> The market for books on tape is now roughly $100 million and growing by 25% to  50% a year, industry executives estimate. Although a limited number of audio  books had been around for years, sales began surging in 1985 after Dove and the  major book publishers jumped into the market to take advantage of the 300  million audiocassette players Americans own.  </P> <P> Dove's sales this year will hit $4 million to $5 million, nearly double last  year's $2.5 million, while its unit sales may double to 600,000 taped books,  Viner said.  </P> <P> The company, with 17 employees, has a catalogue of 140 taped books for sale  that it's produced and has about 30 more in production. The eclectic author  list ranges from Howard Cosell to Charles Dickens. Dove also distributes an  additional 50 to 60 titles that were produced by other companies.  </P> <P> It helps that Viner, 45, who also is a movie and TV producer (Sheldon's  "Windmills of the Gods" for TV), has close ties to the entertainment world. For  the past 14 years, he's been married to actress Deborah Raffin ("Death Wish  3"), who has also narrated and produced some of the tapes. Viner's Hollywood  links have helped attract such stars as Roger Moore and Roddy McDowall to  narrate Dove's books for a modest $2,000 fee, plus royalties. He contends that  Dove stands apart from the competition by using higher quality tapes and  production.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tough Competitor  </P> <P> Dove's rivals naturally disagree that Dove's tapes are superior, but Dove looks  for any edge it can find. The audio-book market has several competitors,  notably publishing giants Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Gulf &amp; Western,  and Random House, a subsidiary of Affiliated Publications.  </P> <P> Daniel Roth, vice president of Simon &amp; Schuster's audio division, claimed  that his company and Random House are the biggest players in audio, while Dove  is among the largest independent competitors. For Dove, Simon &amp; Schuster  and Random House are formidable foes simply because of the huge marketing clout  they already have with bookstore chains.  </P> <P> "Our ability to cross-promote our audiocassettes with the hardcover division or  the paperback division is a considerable advantage," Roth said. "That's very  appealing to an author. Your product comes into one house and is marketed  successfully in three different venues."  </P> <P> Even so, Simon &amp; Schuster and Random House also distribute some of their  audio books through Dove to reach a wider audience.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Audience on Wheels  </P> <P> Much of that audience listens to books in their cars. "Americans drive over 2  billion miles a year," and 70% of U.S.-made cars are now sold with cassette  players, Roth said. When stuck in a traffic jam, drivers can forgo the news and  listen to Joan Rivers reading her autobiography, "Enter Talking," or Terry  Southern reading his book "The Magic Christian."  </P> <P> The major bookstores, such as Waldenbooks and B. Dalton/ Barnes &amp; Noble,  have racks devoted to audio books. Most of the books are condensed to fit on  two 90-minute cassettes, which are sold in one package that retails between  $9.95 and $14.95.  </P> <P> Taping a book can certainly add to an author's bank account, although it pales  compared to possible six-figure paperback rights. A best seller on tape can  earn an author such as Hawking or Sheldon an extra $30,000, but the payoff more  often is $5,000 to $15,000, Viner said.  </P> <P> But getting the books out to the public on tape involves lots of production and  financial steps.  </P> <P> Once Viner or one of his staff has selected a book for tape, Dove must purchase  the audio rights.  </P> <P> "Publishing houses have about three-quarters of the rights themselves," Viner  said, while the most popular authors have kept the oral rights to their works.  "The Sidney Sheldons, the Tom Clancys, etc., will be selling them through their  own agents," Viner said.  </P> <P> To land the rights, Dove must pay an advance and a royalty on sales. The  advance can range as high as $10,000, with royalties typically at 10% of the  tape's wholesale sales for a veteran author. Viner said the average wholesale  price for a twin-cassette book is about $7.50, so an author might pick up 75  cents per copy. A big-name author, though, can command up to 10% of the tape's  retail price in royalties, he said.  </P> <P> Although Dove has used many celebrity readers, such as Academy Award winners  Paul Scofield and Julie Andrews, sometimes it signs the book's author. Most  readers, Viner said, need several hours to compensate for pronunciation errors  and other mistakes. One exception was sportscaster Howard Cosell, who read a  three-hour version of his own book, "I Never Played the Game," in three hours  and 6 minutes. Viner said Cosell "made seven mistakes in the whole tape and  updated his book while he read. It was the most phenomenal reading I have ever  seen."  </P> <P> After the master tape is produced, Dove sends the tape out to be mass-produced  and distributed to the bookstores.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Costs, Profit  </P> <P> So the $7.50 average wholesale price of a Dove tape probably would include 75  cents to the author, 20 cents to the reader, and $4.50 in production,  advertising and overhead costs, Viner said, leaving him about $2.05 in gross  profit.  </P> <P> But Viner said some of Dove's top bookstore customers get a hefty discount on  the price for big orders, so that the $7.50-per-tape average -- and Dove's  profit -- is actually less. Bottom line: Dove tries to earn an average pretax  profit of $1.50 per tape.  </P></p>

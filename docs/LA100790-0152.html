			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDIS ASK JAPAN TO BOOST AID FOR ALLIES  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia's King Fahd asked Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on  Saturday for extra aid for countries that sent troops to defend his kingdom  against Iraq, Kaifu's spokesman said.  </P> <P> "I want you to think of aid to Syria, Morocco, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other  countries that are sending forces here," the spokesman quoted the king as  telling Kaifu.  </P> <P> Kaifu did not reply, but a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said Tokyo would  consider the request.  </P> <P> Japan has already pledged $2 billion toward the cost of the 300,000-member  multinational force in the Persian Gulf, and another $2 billion to aid  "front-line" states hard hit by economic sanctions against Iraq.  </P> <P> Kaifu agreed with Fahd that Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, if unchecked,  would allow the proliferation of a "dangerous principle that allowed strong  states to swallow smaller ones," the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Fahd said he would wait "a little longer" for the economic blockade of Iraq to  take effect. He did not elaborate.  </P> <P> Kaifu arrived in the Red Sea port of Jidda on Saturday on the fourth leg of a  five-nation Middle East tour. He travels to the Omani city of Salalah today for  a meeting with Sultan Kaboos ibn Said.  </P></p>

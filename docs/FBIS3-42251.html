If this is confirmed by investigators, it  would represent a major change in the scale and direction of  terrorist violence against Spanish targets in Rome, experts said.    The probable target of the attack was the owner of the car,  Spanish military attache Ruano Fernando Sagristano,  investigators say--raising the hypothesis that the persons who  planted the bomb meant to kill him.    As to the authors, they pointed to the Basque terrorist  organisation, ETA, which has been responsible for a string of  largely symbolic bomb attacks in Rome, against property rather  than individuals.</p>

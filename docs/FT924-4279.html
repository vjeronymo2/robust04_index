			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row over union links fades THE POTENTIALLY explosive review of Labour's links with the unions has been temporarily disarmed with an agreement that several options may be presented to the national executive in January, it emerged yesterday. The compromise is intended to take the heat out of a fierce debate that, to the alarm of Labour's image makers, had spilled over into newspaper reports of deep-rooted divisions in the working party. A widely leaked 'outline final report' of the 13-member committee had fuelled the controversy by appearing to back reforms that fall well short of those sought by those demanding a substantial reduction in union influence. Supporters of less radical changes have been angered by what they believe to have been a deliberate attempt by the 'modernisers' to use leaks to mobilise press opinion against the working party's proposals. The controversy has concentrated most acutely on a plan to allow union members who pay the political levy to apply for 'registered supporter' status, giving them the right to vote on the selection or de-selection of MPs and for the party leadership. A majority group on the committee is understood to back the plan while a minority favours a simple one-member-one-vote system that would let only full party members participate in ballots. The draft paper also recommended that a 'third force' of MPs and MEPs be allowed to vote at party conferences in addition to unions and constituency parties. The debate has also threatened to force Mr John Smith, the party leader, to side with one faction or the other. At a meeting of the committee yesterday, however, both sides agreed to a compromise plan to submit an inconclusive paper. Editorial Comment, Page 20</p>

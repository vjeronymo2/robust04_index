			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Anatomy of a banking nightmare: The cautionary tale of the TSB There is no better cautionary tale for bankers than TSB Group's ill-fated foray into commercial lending. It is the story of a savings bank which got into a business, corporate lending, whose risks it did not properly appreciate. It then lent too much too quickly and concentrated much of the lending on a particularly risky sector, property. The price of this mistake has been high. The bank recently disclosed an annual loss of Pounds 47m, in large part because it made provisions of Pounds 432m to cover possible losses on commercial loans made by its subsidiary, Hill Samuel. These provisions were equivalent to 9 per cent of Hill Samuel's loan portfolio, a very high rate. But just over four years ago, TSB was confident that by paying Pounds 777m for Hill Samuel, it would shed its dowdy image as a savings bank and pose a challenge to England's quartet of clearing banks. It can now claim close kinship with the clearing banks, but not in the way it wanted. As a proportion of its total loan book, its losses from corporate lending are even bigger than theirs. The group would be in trouble without its unglamorous traditional business. At the end of March 1987, six months before the deal with TSB, Hill Samuel had a Pounds 1bn portfolio of corporate and personal loans. Mr Don McCrickard, TSB's chief executive, says it then inherited another Pounds 2.5bn of corporate loans already made by TSB and its subsidiaries. But the loans which have caused today's difficulties were made in the main between the end of 1987 and mid 1990. In this period, Hill Samuel lent a further Pounds 3.5bn, according to former Hill Samuel executives. Mr McCrickard says that most of the growth in lending took place before mid 1989, when Pounds 3bn was added. In other words, for a year and a half, TSB was expanding its loan book at an annual rate of more than 50 per cent, an unusually high rate. When a lending book is being expanded so rapidly, it is difficult to maintain the standards used to assess potential borrowers. 'Where we might have lent Pounds 2m in the past, we were suddenly lending Pounds 5m. The decisions were not bad at the time they were taken, but the amounts lent were probably too large,' says a former Hill Samuel executive. Lending was directed towards the particularly vulnerable sectors of property and construction. Together these sectors account for 59 per cent of Hill Samuel's 1991 bad debt charge. TSB's board has made it plain whom it holds responsible for the Hill Samuel mess. About a third of Hill Samuel's management has left in the past nine months. The most notable departures are Mr Hamish Donaldson, who was chief executive, and Mr Ted Emerson, head of banking. Only two out of the top 12 executives from the expansionist epoch have survived - those in charge of personnel and legal and administrative affairs. Hill Samuel's corporate banking department has been cut from 600 people to less than 540. Only four of Hill Samuel's 11 branch directors survived. The departed executives do not deny their share of blame. But they are bitter that the TSB board has apparently absolved itself of responsibility. 'From May 1988 onwards Hill Samuel was very firmly under the management of TSB executives', says another former senior Hill Samuel director. 'Some of the blame for the loans that went wrong must lie with them.' Their anger is directed principally at Mr Don McCrickard, TSB's chief executive. Mr McCrickard did not initiate the increase in lending, which was the joint responsibility of TSB's chairman at the time, Sir John Read, and his then managing director, Mr Philip Charlton. However former Hill Samuel executives say that from 1988 onwards, Mr McCrickard was the principal link between the merchant bank and its parent and thus in a position to curtail the lending spree earlier than he did. TSB accepts that Mr McCrickard had responsibility for Hill Samuel from an early stage - though his capacity to control the bank is now difficult to assess, because TSB's cumbersome management structure of the time has since been simplified. During 1988 Mr McCrickard, already a TSB main board director, moved across from running UDT, TSB's finance house operation, to its head office. He became group deputy managing director for banking in February 1988, and in April was appointed as chief executive of a new bank holding company which embraced both TSB and Hill Samuel. His main task from 1988 was to forge the group's six or seven scattered banking operations into a unity. A year later he moved upwards again, becoming chief executive of TSB Bank in January, and chief executive of the entire group in December. Mr McCrickard says that he started to apply the brakes on lending in May 1989: 'From then onwards we gripped the business increasingly firmly . . . We started to slow down the business in the summer of 1989.' 'We could have put our foot on the brakes a few months earlier, but it would not have changed the nature of the problem.' By the second half of 1990, Mr McCrickard says he was badly alarmed at the way things were going at Hill Samuel. 'I put the business under the microscope and saw a clear element of managerial shortfall' he says. However, Mr McCrickard is hopeful Hill Samuel, under new management, can recover. He adds that Hill Samuel now falls into two distinct parts: its healthy mainstream business and a Pounds 680m rump of non-performing loans, managed as a separate business unit, on which the bank has doubts about borrowers' abilities to make payments. One former executive warns: 'TSB board members' public criticism of Hill Samuel has been damaging. They have hurt the business so much that it is going to be a long haul for it to recover'. Mr McCrickard is a realist. He says that further bad debts may keep Hill Samuel in the red for at least another year: 'It depends on how quickly there is a turn around in the economy.'</p>

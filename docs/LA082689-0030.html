			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS FIELD OF DREAMS HAS FERNANDO ON MOUND  </P> <P> I first heard the voice as I was riding my bike through Griffith Park. It was a  raspy whisper:  </P> <P>  If you sign him, he will come.  </P> <P> I looked into the parched chaparral. Nobody there. Maybe it was the wind.  </P> <P> Near the Los Feliz exit to the park, I heard it again, only louder:  </P> <P>  If you sign him, he will come.  </P> <P> Then I realized the voice wasn't coming from the park. I pedaled madly along  Riverside Drive through Silver Lake and the Elysian Valley in pursuit of that  raspy, disembodied whisper.  </P> <P>  If you sign him, he will come.  </P> <P> It was louder than ever. I looked up. The street sign said Stadium Way.  </P> <P> Then it hit me.  </P> <P> If you sign him, he will come means that if the Dodgers make a sincere effort  to re-sign him, the great Fernando Valenzuela -- who hasn't really been seen  around here since 1986 -- will come back to Chavez Ravine to pitch in 1990.  </P> <P> Now, I realize that it'll cost Peter O'Malley a lot of money to sign  Valenzuela, but at least he doesn't have to build him a ballpark.  </P> <P> MIKE EBERTS, Los Angeles  </P></p>

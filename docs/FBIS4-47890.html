			<p>BFN     [Text] Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana told Radio  Mozambique in Maputo today that there is nothing dramatic  threatening the Mozambican peace process. Minister Hunguana was  reacting to speculation concerning the Mozambican Government's  successive requests to postpone the Supervision and Control  Commission [CSC] meeting to analyze a report by UN Special  Representative Aldo Ajello.    Minister Hunguana described the report as extensive, adding  it presents many problems that require action, rather than a  formal response. He noted that the government has been working  to present the CSC with concrete details concerning the schedule  to be followed up to the holding of elections in October.    Meanwhile, Radio Mozambique has learned that the CSC is  scheduled to meet in Maputo tomorrow.</p>

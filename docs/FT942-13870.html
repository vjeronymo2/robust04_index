			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Bavarian bank in Hungarian deal Bayerische Landesbank, the Bavarian state bank, is on the verge of taking a 25 per cent stake in Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank (MKB), Hungary's state-owned foreign trade bank. The transaction, which is to be formalised at MKB's annual general meeting on May 3, will be the first western acquisition of an important Hungarian state-owned financial institution and one of the largest bank privatisations yet in eastern Europe. The purchase price for MKB was not disclosed. However, ING Bank of the Netherlands paid Dollars 60m for a 26 per cent stake in Poland's Bank Slaski last December in the first major east-west bank tie-up. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the London-based institution, is expected to take a 17 per cent stake alongside Bayerische Landesbank. The acquisition plays a part in the EBRD's efforts to shore up eastern Europe's banking system and thus fulfil its mandate to support, even if indirectly, private enterprise in the region. Bayerische Landesbank and the EBRD are buying into the strongest of Hungary's four main commercial banks. MKB had a capital adequacy ratio of about 11-12 per cent of its end-1993 balance sheet total of Ft238bn (Dollars 2.3bn), comfortably over the 8 per cent level recommended by the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. MKB, with its emphasis on trade finance, suffered less from the bankruptcy of industrial companies that have weighed down most of the state-owned banking sector in Hungary. Of the big four, only MKB had the capital strength not to require government assistance last December. The state had to inject Ft110bn to restore solvency to Magyar Hitel Bank, Kereskedelmi Bank and Budapest Bank, the three largest commercial banks, and five smaller financial institutions. Budapest Bank is the next bank in line for privatisation.</p>

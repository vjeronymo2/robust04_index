			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jacques Baumel, vice president of the </F> National Assembly's Defense Committee, by Daniel Bernard; place  and date not given: "Jacques Baumel: `The President's Speech  Is Farewell to Arms'" -- first paragraph is LE QUOTIDIEN DE  PARIS introduction]    [Text] Jacques Baumel, who is mayor and deputy for  Rueil-Malmaison, is also vice president of the National  Assembly's Defense Committee. In his opinion, "all Francois  Mitterrand did [in yesterday's speech on nuclear deterrence] was  harp on general principles."    [Bernard] Yesterday, Francois Mitterrand adoapted a very  "Gaullist" tone. This is something you must be happy about.    [Baumel] Given the way things were orchestrated, as well as  the setting and the audience chosen, and in view of the  uncertain world situation and the unpredictable threats we are  surrounded with, I would have expected the president of the  Republic to give a clear definition of the new directions our  national defense is to follow. What we got instead was the  stubborn repetition of a number of principles first upheld by  General de Gaulle in a very different context. All Francois  Mitterrand did was harp on general principles in an attempt to  show 12 twelve months before the end of his presidency, he  remains in control. His statements about the continuation of  the moratorium on nuclear testing is testimony to his  determination to maintain the status quo. His speech was  nothing more than a "farewell to arms." On the other hand, I  can only be happy about Francois Mitterrand's newfound belief in  the nuclear deterrent, which he opposed for 30 years!    [Bernard] What was it that you would have liked to hear?    [Baumel] After reaffirming those general principles which  nowadays are taken for granted by everyone, Francois Mitterrand  should have moved on to tomorrow's defense policy. In the  current context, focusing on yesterday's world is inappropriate;  what we must concentrate on is the disruption of former  equilibriums throughout the world.    [Bernard] Which means?    [Baumel] I shall limit myself to three examples. First of  all, while the traditional doctrine must be preserved, it was  necessary to go beyond the old principle of deterrence, which  was born of a bipolar balance of world power. Today, there are a  multiplicity of threats against our country, including from  Third-World countries beyond the Mediterranean. Such threats  could one day be backed by chemical or nuclear weapons.    Second, the president said not a word about reform of the  national service, about the choice between conscription and a  professional army. Nothing was said about the indispensable  professionalization of our military system, although it is a  necessary step toward a professional army, that is, toward the  army of the future.    Last, no decision was announced with respect to the major  programs that were launched during the Cold War and whose  weapons systems will be partly obsolete by the year 2005/2010.  To an extent, this jeopardizes new programs.</p>

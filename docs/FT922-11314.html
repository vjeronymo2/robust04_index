			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Survey into Sunday shopping About a million people in England and Wales visited a supermarket every Sunday during March, and 2.8m people shopped on a Sunday at least once during the month, according to a survey by Nielson market research. The figure for February was 3m, and for January 2.6m. London has the highest proportion of Sunday shoppers, at about 18 per cent.  Households in the north of England are the least enthusiastic - only one in ten Yorkshire-area households took advantage of Sunday opening. People spend more on Sundays.  The average shopping basket on Sundays in 1992 cost pounds 10, but the average bill on other days of the week was pounds 7.40.</p>

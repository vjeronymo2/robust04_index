			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Capital Ventures bids for Harcourt Capital Ventures, a subsidiary of Rutland Trust, the financial services group, yesterday launched a hostile bid for Harcourt Group valuing the heavily borrowed plastic and catering company at Pounds 2.54m. Harcourt shareholders are being offered two CV shares or 200p in cash for every 25 held, valuing their shares at 8p. The shares rose 2p to 8p yesterday. Mr Peter Underhill, CV managing director, who owns 25 per cent of the subsidiary, wants to merge the two companies before seeking a listing on the Stock Exchange. Harcourt is currently quoted on the USM. Harcourt is opposed to the offer, but Mr Underhill claims to have the support of 40 per cent of its shareholders. The group has borrowings of some Pounds 5m against net assets of less than Pounds 5m. Last year it reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 193,000 for the six months to end-September, which it blamed on the economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>   [Text] According to estimates of politologists and  economists, Uzbekistan possesses such natural and people's  recourses which can transform this country into the an advanced  one over a short period of time. Uzbek President Islam Karimov  speaks about the prospects of the Republic's development and on  its ties with Russia with Interfax special correspondent  Vyacheslav Terekhov.    IF: It seems that Uzbekistan is one of the former USSR  republics which has not experienced a substantial industrial  recession over the last period of time and witnessed even a kind  of raising in several fields of industry. Does it mean that you  have found a recipe to fight with economic misfortunes?    I. KARIMOV: As a matter of fact, a 4.5 percent growth of  industry was fixed in 1993 in Uzbekistan. By the way, according  to Arkadiy Volskiy (President of the Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs - INTERFAX), if we take 1989,  when economic crisis started in the Soviet Union, as the basic  point the recession in the sphere of GNP and industrial  production was 2.5-times lower than in the former USSR in  general and in several fields it was even three-four times less.    I can tell those who want to understand the reasons of this  phenomenon that this mechanism is rather simple -- it is the way  which Uzbekistan has chosen to transfer to the market. Many  people try to explain this by upward distortion of the results  achieved. This is incorrect. By the way, the army of officials  was reduced two times in our Republic, at the same time the  former Union apparatus servicing the former USSR was preserved  and even is being increased in Russia.    Some time ago the Republic abolished the department guarding  "the socialist property" (OBKhSS) and reduced the People's  Control. There is no more apparatus of the state committee on  prices which was controlling prices. It has been united with  the Finance Ministry, a total of 20 people work there. There is  no more Gosplan (state planning committee) and Gossnab (state  supply committee) in Uzbekistan. We have practically abolished  all organizations controlling economy.    We act given the people's wisdom "Having not built a new  house, do not destroy the old one." Nobody intended to  immediately destroy the previous system towards which the new  radical democrats feel hatred, the question concerns its gradual  re-structuring because it is impossible to force this process.  There is no other secret. I am convinced that all reforms  should be implemented gradually and one should not blame the old  system for all mortal sins. We went along a creative road but  not along the way of destruction of everything what was created  before.    I believe that the decision of the Russian authorities to  widely celebrate the 50th anniversary of the victory of the  Soviet people over fascism is absolutely just. Now Russia  cannot live without the Army, without the mighty  military-industrial potential which gave the possibility to  support the balance in this two-polar world.    Those Republics, which primarily shipped raw materials in  the  former USSR, have suffered less after the destruction of  economic ties within the collapsed Union than those which  produced manufactured goods. For example, Belarus, which has no  natural resources, entirely depended upon other Union Republics.  Such a dependence is extremely dangerous.    Over the last few years by means of barter, in exchange for  cotton and other products, Tashkent managed to receive those  industrial goods which help to maintain rather a high level of  production. But the main thing is that nobody in Uzbekistan  intends "to break the old world to the basis and then to build a  new one."    IF: What is the reason of these, say, relative success of  Uzbekistan?    I.KARIMOV: I believe that everything depends upon those who  stand at the helm of this state. For example, "chiefs of  laboratories and chief research employees who pretended to be  leaders of this nation were illiterately fulfilling their  duties. For example, what could understand a historian,  Azerbaijan's former president Abulfaz Elchibey, in economy and  policy? This man has worked all his life among dusty book  shelves.    An analogical situation was in Georgia as well; in this  Republic a philologist Zviad Gamsakhurdia was heading the state.  For example, I am not going to write poems and to play piano  as, say, the former head of the Lithuanian parliament  V.Landsbergis. When a professional politician Algirdas  Brazauskas came to power the life in the Republic began to  return to normal.    There existed a threat that incompetent people would come to  power in Uzbekistan in 1989-90 as it happened in the Caucasus.    I must say with a great regret that such negative process  is going on in Russia now; unwillingness of the people to  participate in the elections testifies to this fact. And if the  people do not trust the ideals then any reforms cannot be  implemented. This is a sad fact because there cannot be  Uzbekistan's flourishing without Russia's flourishing. I have  said about this may times.    IF: According to available information, about 40 percent of  Uzbekistan's citizens do not know the Uzbek language which is  the state one in this nation...    I.KARIMOV: As many as 22 Mn people live in Uzbekistan, 77  percent being Uzbeks, Tatars, Kazakhs, Tajiks, Kyrgyzs,  Turkmenians, and the so called Russia-speaking people  representing about 10 percent of the total population represent  other nationalities living in the Republic. The overwhelming  majority know the Uzbek language, some of them do not speak  fluently but there are such people who do not accept it at all.  On the other hand, there are Russians in the Republic who  brilliantly speak the Uzbek language, for example, Vitaliy  Segedin, director of the Akmalyk mining-metallurgical plant.    The Uzbek decree on the language is a liberal one -- the  authorities do not demand that all people should freely possess  the language but I believe that they should demonstrate respect  to our language because this is a sign of respect towards the  people. I think that the Republic's citizens should possess the  language at least on the level of everyday association.    By the way, almost 99 percent of Uzbeks know the Russian  language whereas this percent is much lower in the  Transcaucasian and Baltic states. Uzbekistan is an example of  the respect towards the great Russian language.    IF: Several sources in mass media assert that there are  people in Uzbekistan's distant regions who hunger...    I.KARIMOV: Several years ago I worked in the most distant  mountainous kishlaks (villages) going on foot and mounted. I  can say that I know how people live in "out-of-the-way places."  There are regions where there are droughts and the lands are  infertile but hunger is impossible in our Republic. I assert  that "there are neither poor nor hungry people in Uzbekistan."  The community style of Uzbeks' life does not allow this. If at  least one hungry man appears in makhalla (a traditional  community of Uzbeks) it would be shameful and disgraceful for  everybody. I am proud of these people.    IF: The previous party apparatus has preserved in  Uzbekistan's leadership. Do you think that it will be difficult  to implement reforms with these people or it is easier to rule  the country?    I.KARIMOV: The Uzbeks are very law-obedient people, this  feature of the people was brought up in the course of centuries.  In addition, we pursue our own way of democratic construction  of the state and of market relations -- we do not divide people  into communists, anti-communists, radicals and democrats in our  country, we have only refused from Bolsheviks' slogans. One  should not think that only former communists work in  Uzbekistan's leadership. By the way, I myself did not study in  a party school.    Many of the Uzbek ministers and their deputies have nothing  in common with the party apparatus -- these are people younger  than 40 years old. One can say the same about the majority of  the governors in the regions. There are no more ardent  Bolsheviks in the Republic's leadership and many former  secretaries of the regional party committees correctly  understand today's demands. Changing in people's thinking in  Uzbekistan is going on dynamically and I am proud of this.    IF: What is the situation in the field of the Republic's  foreign economic relations?    I.KARIMOV: The interest of the foreign capital in Uzbekistan  is great and it seems to me that Russian leadership perceives  this with some jealousy. More than 1200 joint ventures function  in the Republic now, largest international corporations  participate in their work. There are branches of six  prestigious foreign banks in the Republic, several reputable  firms have opened their missions in the Republic.    I believe that Uzbekistan could teach Russia in some  spheres,  for example, in the field of infrastructure creation, in the  sphere of foreign economic policy and transfer to market  relations. By the way, I have written a book devoted to this  problem. At present Tashkent has currency deposits in the best  world banks totalling more than $700 Mn. What CIS state can  boast with such a reserve in hard currency created within  one-two years? It's my secret how Uzbekistan has managed to  achieve this.    Achievement of a trade parity with Russia is on today's  agenda. Unfortunately, Tashkent buys practically everything in  Russia without selling anything to it. At the same time one  should not perceive Russia as "a milking cow" -- it is the  richest power and Russians can be proud of its potential.    IF: What is your assessment of the case on corruption in  Uzbekistan's supreme echelons of power investigated by the USSR  General prosecutor's office and Sh.Rashidov's role (the late  first secretary of Uzbekistan's communist party -- INTERFAX)?  According to the investigation, the greatest number of  millionaires lived in the Republic. Where is their money?    I.KARIMOV: You are right, there was corruption in the  Republic. Upward distortion of the results achieved in the  production of cotton which were later on transferred into money  by Uzbekistan's leaders who were gaining great profits is the  main reason of corruption. However, I believe that the Union  authorities were fighting with these illegal actions by vicious  methods, they did not observe laws themselves.    Nobody took into account that the Republic had its own  Constitution, its own Supreme Soviet, its own legislature. They  arrested deputies of the Union parliament violating their  status. The suspected ones were hunted by dogs, they were  handcuffed without any sanctions of the attorney general.    I believe that the methods used by the investigators of the  General prosecutor's office Mr Telman Gdlyan and Mr Nikolay  Ivanov personified complete lawlessness. Such ignorance of the  national dignity of the Republic's citizens led to the bloodshed  in the course of inter-ethnic clashes in the Fergana valley. In  my opinion, the whole Uzbekistan and, probably, the whole Middle  Asia could have exploded as a result of this. The Republic  could not control Gdlyan and Ivanov. They were acting on the  order of the CPSU Central Committee.    I believe that an additional investigation of this case  should be instituted in the near future. The thing is that  funds earned honestly were confiscated from the people accused  of corruption at that time. Women were deprived of  wedding-rings and jewelry received from their ancestors. This  was a pure humiliation. Where have all confiscated jewelry's  disappeared? How much has remained in Mr Gdlyan's pockets and  in the pockets of other investigators? They have not handed over  anything into Uzbekistan's treasury. I think that Tashkent can  raise this issue today. Though we do not want to trouble people  in this difficult time...    IF: Are there opposition parties in Uzbekistan and will they  participate in the elections?    I.KARIMOV: We should start with the clarification of an  issue what a political party is. This is a movement having its  own program and its own perception of the state's development.  After the collapse of the USSR several tens of parties  immediately appeared in the Republic which announced themselves  "parties." This testifies to the fact that these are not parties  but just groupings with definite political ambitions pursuing  their own goals.    As far as the opposition is concerned, it must be  constructive and act within the Constitution. When a party  proclaims itself an opposition one but it has the aim to destroy  public system then, I believe, it cannot be called an opposition.    IF: Have you ever thought that you would become leader of a  state?    I.KARIMOV: Never in my life I thought that I would be a  leader of such a scale and carry a colossal responsibility for  the fate of the whole country. For a long time I worked in  planning and financial organizations, I was deputy chairman of  the government and headed the Republic's State Planning  Committee. After the discussion of my candidacy in the  Political Bureau of the CPSU Central Committee and at the plenum  of the Central Committee I was confirmed on the post of the  first secretary of Uzbekistan's communist party. It happened  just after the tragic events in Fergana. At the same time I  believe that I am an accidental man in the party.    I am convinced that any society, even the most democratic  one, is not barred from sins. Now, Uzbekistan is accumulating  experience while building its statehood. I think that elements  of authoritarian system are needed during the transition period.  If the people elected me to the post of the president, it means  that they are confident in my program and see that it will bring  stability and peace to this nation. I believe that I must  fulfill my duty in the face of the people, that is, I must  fulfill my program. I must admit that I have never resorted to  volitional methods. However, I think that sometimes they are  necessary.    IF: The thing is that you yourself create an economic system  in this country which cannot be subordinated to strong-willed  decisions...    I.KARIMOV: We are forced to resort to volitional methods at  a definite state in order the objective economic laws could  triumph. Somebody must take the responsibility and prepare the  ground in order these laws could work tomorrow.    IF: Over the last period of time mass media often reports  about the growth of anti-Russian moods in Uzbekistan...    I.KARIMOV: I do not want to use passionate words but I'd  like to underline that Uzbekistan always treated Russia with  great respect and gratitude. This is a sincere feeling.    A word expression "near abroad countries" is widely used  now.  Frankly speaking, I do not understand what it means. I think  that such terms artificially separate us with the Russian  Federation. As for me, authors of this term do not understand  themselves what is hidden under this word combination.    Russia has a great future. After the collapse of the USSR,  independent young states experienced a kind of euphoria. In  some of the republics this independence turned into a fetish.  But the life has proved that sovereignty is not just loud  statements and declarations. Now many people understand that  Russia should be the guarantor of peace and stability in the  Middle Asia.    Not long ago in Davos, Pakistani Prime Minister Mrs Bhutto  declared that today when there is no more iron curtain and the  republics of the Central Asia are open for the outside world,  it's high time to start integration process in this region by  creating an association in which Pakistan will be the leader. I  categorically oppose this point of view. I believe that the  Commonwealth of Independent States is a serious organization and  one cannot but take it into consideration.</p>

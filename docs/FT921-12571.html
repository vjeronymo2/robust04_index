			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Property: The marina mystery - John Brennan asks why Britain's 3m sailors do not buy more purpose-built yachting properties IT SHOULD be a dream for every leisure sailor. Living in a marina home, able to watch sails pass the window and step from the veranda onto your yacht. But if that is the case why are there so many leisure sailors in Britain and so few marina homes? Equally, why, given that such purpose-built homes are rare, should yacht-orientated housebuilders be suffering just as tough a home sales market as their landlubber counterparts? The number of people who 'mess about in boats' is increasing. The exact number is not known but the figure of 3m active and occasional boat users in Britain is commonly used. On the supply side of the equation the number of marina homes is quite unrelated to that ostensible demand. In recent years only 1,800 to 2,200 boat-orientated homes have been completed in the south of England. If 3m boating enthusiasts were in pursuit of a couple of thousand marina homes, this would be an even more exotic sub-division of the residential market than it already is. But it is clear that the majority of casual leisure sailors do not have any special interest in, or the resources to buy, a home by the water. Boating tends to call for a greater degree of commitment than most leisure activities. As such, the gross figures for the number of active amateur sailors can include a heavy turnover of people who try taking to the water but never become serious. As far as buying a waterside property is concerned, we can further eliminate the substantial number of leisure sailors who use small boats. They may be regulars but for them a permanent marina berth would be unnecessarily lavish. Many of the often-cited limitations on the supply of marina homes would have been overcome if buying demand had been more consistent. But there are genuine physical constraints on the supply. The stretches of coastline that the average leisure sailor is happy to set out from, and to sail around, are largely in the south of England. Any changes planned within a harbour, river backwater, estuary, or even mud flat along that coastline is of immense local and, potentially, national interest. Opportunities to create adequate yacht berths and scope to develop berth-side residential property have been scarce. Nevertheless, outstanding planning applications and currently unused consents for marina properties around the south coast give the lie to the suggestion that building restrictions, ecological concerns or coastal protection matters are an absolute bar on new building. Most of south England's coastal towns are keen to win the extra business that a plush yacht marina attracts. Infrastructure costs are also an important block to new marina. Even on a small scheme it can cost several million pounds for site preparation, sewage works and water level management before any property is available to generate cash to offset the financing costs. And when it comes to financing costs, the City is highly sceptical of anything with a leisure association. The financial implications of the marina creations have made City investment funds nervous, not to say terrified. The Brighton Marina fiasco is the main reason. Immense and costly infrastructure works were paid for without any hope of the proposed yacht berth rental business alone generating enough revenue to make the scheme work. It took George Walker, in his Brent Walker days, to spot the need for more revenue earning facilities and the scope for creating marina islands giving the opportunity to sell marina houses to supplement the boat rentals. As the costly sea walls and water regulating locks had been built and paid for by the ill-advised city funds, Walker was able to make the necessary internal changes without too much expense. This kind of investment story has had a negative effect on fund managers' willingness to stray into the sector again. Brighton Marina may not be the sole culprit, but it certainly has been one reason why British leisure developers have had to lean more heavily on bank finance than their counterparts in the US or Japan. There, leisure properties are treated as a viable investment suitable for the most staid of the insurance or pension funds. Leisure developers can refinance projects without becoming overdraft-logged like their British counterparts. Under-financing and corporate death by drowning in an irreversibly rising overdraft proved to be something of a business standard among would-be marina developers in Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Boat yard and yacht berth owners recognised that change was leading towards a future where boat owners would insist on a better quality of berth, and that demand for moorings outstripped the existing supply. Many owners responded to this with a club house and an in-season shop. Plans for homes overlooking the boats quickly landed on the authorities' desks. Many of these multi-phase schemes won permission for the early stages which involved change of use of existing surplus commercial or old industrial properties. A number of landowners and their funders went ahead on this basis even where their architects argued that the scheme would only make a satisfactory living area in its entirety. The owners' concerns only surfaced when they discovered that even boating purists will not pay a waterside premium for a house on a building site. The simplistic idea that there are so many leisure sailors and so few waterside homes inspired a number of small boat yard owners and local builders to start their waterside cities. A disproportionate number of individual marina schemes stumbled to a halt because of the classic problem for a sole developer: slower than forecast initial sales which crippled cash flow. Marina Developments' emergence as market leader in the mooring and development business in the 1980s owes much to judicious mergers and acquisitions of waterside projects, some of which fell into the cash-strapped category. Now, five out of the group's 16 coastal and Thameside yacht and boat mooring sites rate as marina villages with a total of 450 homes completed. Like its on-shore equivalents, Marina Developments has stopped building residential units while it retains unsold stock. The company's spread of activities means that it has been able to look to its commercial property and moorings business to help counter the downturn in residential sales. However, a reported 70 unsold flats and houses is a painfully high proportion of the 450 total in its five marinas. If the market leader cannot sell homes, talk of the marina market avoiding the worst of the sales decline is clearly wrong. But the company reports an air of 'quiet optimism', after a successful London Boat Show. A competition offering free moorings for the winners helped attract 700 leisure sailors to sales staff at the Boat Show compared to 100 last year. Basic information gathered from brief interviews will help the company to follow up with an appropriate sales story; whether for a short of long lease mooring, or for one of the marina homes. The company is active in cross-selling to its wider customer base. Existing long-lease berth-holders are seen as a source of potential marina home-buyers. These leaseholders are being shown how the sale of their mooring rights could generate a good proportion of the cost of a 999 year lease on a marina flat with its own mooring space. The company is also trying to persuade marina flat owners to buy a house. Prices range from two bedroom appartments for Pounds 70,000 in Milford Haven, west Wales, to large houses with mooring space for the largest vessels near Plymouth and Southampton for nearly Pounds 500,000. 'There are,' says Sue Howson of Marina Developments, 'deals to be done.' But the conundrum remains unresolved. Where are all the leisure sailors with the time and cash to rest by the sea? At these prices they evidently represent a far less plentiful species than anyone imagined when first reviewing marina prospects.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Unpleasant ingredient - Capital gains tax / The Budget and You / The move to end indexation for CGT losses will be very unpopular Budgets are expected to throw up some unpleasant surprises, but the decision to end the use of indexation for capital gains tax losses will be particularly unpopular. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke included the measure among the tax 'loopholes' rattled off at great speed in his speech. Investors will now be able to use indexation only to reduce gains but not to create losses; since Tuesday, only nominal losses (ie, when the price of the asset has fallen) can be offset against gains. 'It's a fundamental change in the law and not a loophole,' said David Rothenberg of chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg. 'It will affect all those people with assets which have not increased in value since 1982. The approach of hiding it under the guise of anti-avoidance is underhand.' CGT is payable when you make gains on the disposal of most assets but there is an annual exemption of Pounds 5,800. (The annual exemption was not raised in either of this year's two Budgets). An investor must pay tax at his marginal rate on gains above this amount. In 1982, an indexation allowance, based on the retail prices index, was introduced so that nominal gains achieved because of inflation were not taxed. The Inland Revenue releases the indexation factors, and the Weekend FT publishes a table every month explaining how to calculate your CGT bill based on these figures. Former chancellor Nigel Lawson decided to make a number of changes to CGT in his 1985 Budget, to 'produce a fairer tax' and 'make life simpler for the taxpayer.' One of these was to extend indexation to losses, so that a nominal capital gain would be treated as a real capital loss and the value of a nominal capital loss could be increased to reflect the real loss and to be offset against other gains. Clarke has now reversed Lawson's change, with immediate effect. It complicates what was already a complex tax. Maurice Parry-Wingfield of chartered accountant Touche Ross, said: 'Once people realise what he's done, they are going to be extremely upset - think of all those people whose investments have gone down the drain. 'CGT was hell already. Now we're back to 1982-85, with all the unscrambling of history to do. Clarke is restoring all the anomalies, and it will make the calculations very complicated.' What is the effect on the investor? Ignoring the situation before April 6 1982 - when indexation was introduced  -and assuming that November's RPI is the same as October's (141.8), Parry-Wingfield offers the following examples of how the change now affects those with assets subject to CGT. Suppose that you bought shares in April 1982 (after the 5th) for Pounds 10,000 and sold them last month for Pounds 1,000. If you sold them before Budget day, your allowable loss, using the indexation table published in last week's paper, would be Pounds 16,500. This is because the proceeds of Pounds 1,000 are deducted from the indexed cost of Pounds 17,500 (Pounds 10,000 x 1.75). If, however, you sold them on Budget day, your allowable loss would have been only Pounds 9,000 because the Pounds 1,000 proceeds would be deducted from the unindexed cost of Pounds 10,000. What about transfers between husband and wife? At first sight, it might appear that husbands and wives can get around this rule by transferring loss-making shares to one another. Transfers between spouses are on a 'no gain/no loss basis,' which simply means that there is no immediate tax effect. Since the spouse is treated for CGT purposes as having acquired the shares at their original cost plus indexation up to the date of transfer, some married couples could think that, by transferring loss-making shares to each other before selling them, they can preserve the indexation. The Inland Revenue is going to prevent this, though, by introducing 'special rules' so that the indexation applying to the cost of an asset transferred between spouses on or after Tuesday can be used only for gains, not losses. Nevertheless, the indexation incorporated in the last transfer of shares between spouses before Budget day will not be affected and will still be available to create or increase a loss. This would appear to lead to some curious scenarios. Suppose your spouse bought shares for Pounds 10,000 in April 1982 and transferred half of them to you in September 1991. The price of the shares kept falling and, by chance, you both decided to sell on Budget day, obtaining only Pounds 500 each. Your spouse is caught out completely by Clarke's measure, in the same way as the investor in the above example. Your spouse's allowable loss is only Pounds 4,500 (50 per cent of Pounds 10,000 minus the Pounds 500 proceeds). But the effect for CGT purposes on your sale is completely different. The indexation factor for April 82-September 91 is 1.661, so the indexed cost would be Pounds 8,305 (Pounds 5,000 x 1.661). Subtracting the Pounds 500 proceeds from this figure leaves you with Pounds 7,805 of allowable losses. The Treasury says it expects the indexation restriction to raise Pounds 50m in 1994-95, rising more sharply to about Pounds 300m in 1996-97 - which, according to Parry-Wingfield amounts to a forecast of what losses people will make. Rothenberg added: 'Farmers will be major losers from the legislation because of the fall in value of agricultural land since 1982. 'People with assets which have not gone up, including a second home, loss-making shares and failed businesses, will all be affected. These are people who expected to have allowable losses which they now will not have.' CGT re-investment relief Although many people will be affected by the CGT restriction, fewer are likely to benefit from a CGT concession handed out by Clarke. This extends the CGT roll-over relief, introduced in the March budget for entrepreneurs selling their own company and re-investing in an unquoted trading company, to any individual. The aim is to encourage people to invest in small businesses by holding out the carrot of deferring a CGT bill. But the type of unquoted trading companies into which investors could roll over their CGT liability is limited - excluded are those which hold more than 50 per cent of their chargeable assets in land, as well as most financial companies and subsidiaries. So investors are confined to the riskier end of the market. As long as the shareholder does not emigrate within three years of buying the new shares, he can defer the CGT bill on their original gain. 'It's bound to attract a lot of interest as long as the investment is not too risky,' said Caroline Garnham, tax and trusts specialist at solicitor Simmons and Simmons. 'The fact that there is no clawback after three years gives scope for planning.' Rothenberg said, however, that investors in quoted companies could sell easily because of their liquidity while the market for unquoted shares was less liquid. 'In practice, few people will want to sell and re-invest to postpone CGT, but the roll-over relief does give an opportunity to shelter a proportion of the gain,' he added. Andrew Jones, of accountant Ernst &amp; Young, agreed. 'Unquoted companies are not readily marketable, so it's not taken for granted that people would want to roll over CGT relief. I think the impact will be marginal.' Another positive CGT measure announced by Clarke was raising the limit on the amount of relief from CGT when a person sells a business (or some other assets) on retirement, provided they are 55 or over. Relief is now available on the first Pounds 250,000 (instead of Pounds 150,000) of gains, and half relief is given on gains between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 1m (previously between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 600,000). The exemption is reduced for those running the business for less than 10 years.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW TICKET PRICES GIVING SOCKERS FANS CASE OF COLD FEET;  </P> <P> SOCCER: SEASON TICKET SALES AND ATTENDANCE ARE DOWN THROUGH FIRST FOUR HOME  GAMES.  </P> <P> During the summer, the Sockers hit their patrons with higher prices. Now the  patrons are punching back.  </P> <P> Season ticket sales are down and, after four home games, so is attendance. The  four-game turnstile count of 33,420 at the Sports Arena is down 3,723 from last  season.  </P> <P> If the drop-off continues, the Sockers' average attendance would fall for the  sixth time in the past seven years and would tumble below 8,000 for the first  time since 1981-82, when the average draw was 7,047.  </P> <P> Unless last year's trend -- in which crowds dwindled as the season wore on --  reverses, the Sockers will finish with an average of 7,201.  </P> <P> After 26 home games last year, the average stood at 8,131. But attendance  trailed off as the season neared the playoffs. Two of the first four games  attracted more than 11,000. But after that, the Sockers drew only one crowd in  excess of 10,000, none beyond 11,000.  </P> <P> And that was before fears of recession rocked the economy and before the price  of lower-level tickets increased.  </P> <P> Of those two factors, the economy and ticket costs, Sockers President Ron Cady  said the recession gets most of the blame for his team's attendance woes.  </P> <P> "Season tickets are down," Cady said, "but that's an effect of the economy. We  didn't get any negative feedback on the price increase."  </P> <P> Yet there was negative feedback in the bottom line. Last year 3,180 season  tickets were sold. This year the number stands at 2,250.  </P> <P> "A significant drop," Cady said.  </P> <P> Although the Sockers' survey of 800 former season ticket-holders might not  broach the subject, trends during the past seven years suggest price changes  affect ticket sales.  </P> <P> Ticket prices have been hiked in six of the past seven years, and in each of  the six years of hikes, average attendance slipped.  </P> <P> The kicker here is that the only gain in average attendance came in 1986-87,  the one season in which ticket prices were lowered from the previous year.  </P> <P> It was a modest gain, 166 per game, but the drop in price was also modest. The  lower-level seats remained unchanged while some seats in the top level sold for  $7 and others for $5, a difference of $1 to $3 from the previous season.  </P> <P> In 1987-88, the $5 seat was eliminated.  </P> <P> Another example that lower costs attract more customers unfolded last week when  the team drew only 4,490 for a Thursday night game, then packed in 11,316 two  days later. The difference was that the Sockers sold out the upper deck for the  second game by offering $5 tickets to youth soccer players.  </P> <P> "The Sockers should have never stopped offering $5 seats," a former marketing  employee of the team said. "They should have reserved fewer and fewer seats for  $5 each year, but still kept them so they could advertise tickets starting at  $5. That way even if they sell out of $5 tickets, they've drawn parents with  their kids to the ticket windows. What are parents going to tell their kids?  That they have to go home? No, they'll buy the higher-priced tickets."  </P> <P> Cady said the club has thought about lowering ticket prices.  </P> <P> "We have looked at that in the past," he said. "But when we had $5 seats,  everyone bought those tickets and then moved down into the lower section. . . .  You dilute the quality of the product if you offer too low of a price on  tickets."  </P> <P> Cady said instead of lowering ticket prices, the club has decided to discount  them, offering cheaper rates to juniors (age 19 and under), seniors (55 and  over), military personnel, families and to large groups.  </P> <P> The cost of tickets and the shaky economy aside, there appear to be at least  five other factors in the continuing decline in attendance:  </P> <P> * Poor perception of the league. For the third consecutive summer, the MSL  teetered on collapse, which not only further tarnished its image but played a  direct role in the Sockers' smaller crowds.  </P> <P> Cady said the Sockers "lost 60 days of selling" when Milan Mandaric, owner of  the St. Louis Storm, insisted he was going to fold his club. Other owners,  including the Sockers' Ron Fowler, said if Mandaric closed shop, they would  follow. Thus, the Sockers' sales and marketing efforts were abandoned for a  time.  </P> <P> In the end, no team went under, but the summer's uncertainty seems to have  affected all eight clubs and has spawned one of the many paradoxes for which  the league is often chided:  </P> <P> Despite their crumbling crowds, the Sockers actually lead the league in  attendance.  </P> <P> * Too little offense. Whether defenses have improved or the game is losing its  scoring heroes -- or both -- there have been fewer goals.  </P> <P> Teams combined for an average of 12 goals per game in the inaugural season,  1978-79. Last year an average of eight goals were scored in each game.  </P> <P> League owners, however, remedied the decrease by enlarging the goal two feet in  width and one foot in height and by requiring defenders to back off 15 feet on  all free kicks, rather than 10 as in the past.  </P> <P> At last count, scoring was up 34% from last year to 10.64 goals per game.  </P> <P> Now owners must sit back and hope others take notice.  </P> <P> "The idea behind the new rules," Cady said, "was to attract new fans. We  thought if we could increase scoring, someone new to the game might say to  himself, 'Gosh, maybe indoor soccer is something I'd like to go see.' "  </P> <P> * Poor TV exposure. If a new fan is going to discover indoor soccer, the league  needs TV.  </P> <P> But the MSL has never had a legitimate national television contract. It has  been on ESPN, but games were delayed by more than a week in some instances.  This year, an arrangement has been worked out with SportsChannel America, a  small cable outlet that currently is beamed to only one MSL market, Cleveland.  </P> <P> Locally, Sockers games have been on Prime Ticket, a cable-only station, since  1985-86 and therefore TV games have not been available to all San Diego  households.  </P> <P> "I think that definitely had an impact," the former Sockers marketing employee  said. "I think they lost the casual fans when they went to Prime Ticket."  </P> <P> The Sockers' association with Prime Ticket, however, ended last season and the  team recently announced a six-game package with KUSI Ch. 51 that will begin  with a Dec. 22 game at Baltimore.  </P> <P> "Now they'll have the casual fan back again," the ex-employee said. "If they  run a promo for a Sockers-Sidekicks game during, say, 'Cosby,' a lot more  people will see that than will ever see Prime Ticket."  </P> <P> Cady said he is eager for the televised games to begin.  </P> <P> "We just have to get through the first eight home games (without the benefit of  TV)," Cady said. "Then through the next 18, I feel very confident things will  really start to pick up (because of TV)."  </P> <P> * Competition. For the first time since the National Basketball Assn. Clippers  left in 1984, there's another winter team vying for the sports fan's dollar --  the Gulls of the International Hockey League.  </P> <P> Cady said the Sockers lost 15 accounts (each account averages 2.2 season  tickets) to the Gulls.  </P> <P> "Which is a negligible loss due to the Gulls," Cady said.  </P> <P> Actually, Cady and Don Waddell, general manager for the Gulls, said the  presence of two teams eventually will help each at the gate.  </P> <P> "With two teams, you get people in the habit of coming to the arena," Waddell  said.  </P> <P> Added Cady, "It's like the old restaurant theory. You have a lot of restaurants  in one area and people going to one look up and say, 'Hey, look at that new  restaurant over there. Next time let's try that one.' "  </P> <P> * Too many games. The one flaw in the old restaurant theory is that most people  have a limited entertainment budget. Just how many games can a fan afford to  attend?  </P> <P> Let's see:  </P> <P> The Sockers all-time high in attendance came in 1983-84 when the club was  forced to forgo the Major Indoor Soccer League season in favor of the North  American Soccer League's 32-game indoor schedule. The Sockers had only 16 home  games to sell that year and drew an average of 11,415.  </P> <P> The next season, the Sockers realigned with the MISL and played 24 home games.  Average attendance dropped by 1,820, the largest single-season fall.  </P> <P> The second biggest fall came in 1987-88 when the MISL decided on its most  ambitious schedule and gave each team 28 home dates. The Sockers' average crowd  that year was 8,996, a drop of 751 from the previous season.  </P> <P> The Sockers currently play 26 home games.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of things to do in San Diego," Cady said. "And very possibly  going to a soccer game two days a week really isn't a viable choice."  </P> <P> Cady also said there is a downside to paring the season.  </P> <P> "You're giving up receipts by cutting down the season," he said.  </P> <P> SOCKERS' ATTENDANCE  </P> <P> Sockers' attendance, with two factors that might affect it, ticket prices and  the amount of offense (in combined goals per game):  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.89IN:2.44IN:1.67IN:1.78IN:3.32IN:2.44IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="6"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Season  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Avg.

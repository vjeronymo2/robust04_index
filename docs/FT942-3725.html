			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: BAe to discuss rocket system with Pinochet British Aerospace said yesterday it planned to have talks this week in the UK with Gen Augusto Pinochet, Chilean armed forces chief and former president, on the development of an artillery rocket weapons system. A Bae official said last night: 'We are aware that General Pinochet is in the UK, and it is assumed that he will be in conversations with us. There is considerable Chilean interest in this system which is potentially worth millions of pounds to us.' The potential research and development contract involves a 'flexible' rocket system which can be produced for use either by wheeled or tracked vehicles. The system would be jointly developed with the Chilean defence industry by the rockets division of BAe's subsidiary, Royal Ordnance. It is understood the Chilean army is interested in producing the system locally. Britain has good diplomatic relations with Chile, and has largely ignored protests over Gen Pinochet's human rights record following the strong support offered by the Chilean armed forces to the UK during the Falklands War. However, Amnesty International confirmed it was asking Sir Nicholas Lyell, Britain's attorney-general, to prosecute Gen Pinochet under the Criminal Justice Act which obliges the UK to pursue alleged torturers. The Foreign Office stressed that there were no official or ministerial contacts involved.</p>

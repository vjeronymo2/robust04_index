			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian magnesium hopes boosted AUSTRALIA'S HOPES of developing a magnesium metal industry have been boosted by agreement on a ADollars 50m research project with Australian and Japanese companies. Senator John Button, industry minister, said the federal government and the Queensland state government would contribute ADollars 25m (Pounds 10.4m) to the project over the next four years. The remainder of the financing will be provided by MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, Ube Industries of Japan, and Queensland Metals Corporation. The government hopes the project will develop low cost technology for the production of magnesium metal from a magnesite deposit at Kunwarara, in Queensland, which is controlled by QMC. Kunwarara, which was discovered by QMC in 1985, is believed to be the largest cryptocrystalline magnesite deposit in the world. It is situated close to ports and power supplies, in an area of little environmental significance. Senator Button said the project would culminate in the development of a magnesium metal demonstration plant at the port of Gladstone, 160 km (100 miles) south of Kunwarara. A full-scale production plant could follow if the technology is deemed to be viable. Successful development of low-cost technology would create an opportunity for Australia to play a major role in the world magnesium metal industry. Magnesium metal could eventually parallel the aluminium industry as a major export earner, Senator Button said. The government believes world demand for magnesium metal will increase significantly over the next 10 years. Much of the demand is expected to come from the vehicle industry as car manufacturers produce lighter vehicles to meet tighter environmental standards. Mr Wayne Goss, the Queensland premier, said the demonstration plant could be upgraded to produce 60,000 tonnes of magnesium a year if the research project was successful. Mr Norm Fussell, Managing Director of MIM, said the research agreement was 'a positive step full of promise for a new wealth creating industry in Australia by the turn of the century'.</p>

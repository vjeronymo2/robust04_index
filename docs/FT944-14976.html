			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Waterglade's new board concedes defeat The new board of directors at Waterglade International Holdings, the property development group which had its shares suspended on October 10, yesterday conceded defeat and said it would not oppose liquidation moves next month. Following a boardroom coup in September, the existing management was ousted and the new board instituted an inquiry into the group's finances with a view to restructuring the lossmaking business. However, the board reported yesterday that the group's financial position made any proposed rescue plan impossible. Waterglade's liabilities are put at Pounds 29m. Of this, some Pounds 21.5m is owed to various banks and secured on properties worth not more than Pounds 9.5m. There is also Pounds 7.5m owed to unsecured creditors  - this includes about Pounds 800,000 of VAT and the winding up order initiated by the Customs and Excise office is due to be heard on November 9. Mr Anthony Midgen, one of the new directors, said he expected the liquidator to initiate his own enquiries into the running of the company's finances, and there could also be an inquiry from Customs and Excise.</p>

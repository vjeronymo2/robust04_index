			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UN postpones peace talks on Bosnia The United Nations yesterday called off crucial talks in Geneva between the warring Bosnian factions after the Bosnian Serbs failed to withdraw forces from the safe haven around the eastern town of Gorazde. Bosnia's Moslem leaders have refused to attend the talks until this condition is met, and the UN accepted their contention that the Serbs had reneged on promises to comply. Despite the setback, the powers involved in talks on Bosnia signalled their continued determination to bring the parties to the table. The French government announced that representatives of the 'contact group' on Bosnia, which includes the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, hoped to convene tomorrow, two days earlier than planned. UN officials said there was a slim chance that talks between the warring parties could begin today, but only if the Bosnian Serbs fulfilled a pledge to remove all armed personnel, military and civilian, from the 3km exclusion zone around Gorazde. Some 150-200 Serb militia and para-military police, as well as some armed civilians, remain in the zone to 'protect' Serb civilians, in contravention of a UN agreement. The Bosnian Moslems accuse the Serbs of blurring the distinction between soldiers and civilians, with some fighters donning civilian clothes and posing as 'refugees' resettling the area. Dr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said on Wednesday that all armed personnel would leave Gorazde immediately. But yesterday afternoon the UN reported there had been 'no movement' and senior Bosnian government representatives remained in Sarajevo. Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of UN operations in former Yugoslavia, who had hoped to negotiate a four-month cessation of hostilities across Bosnia, had no choice but to abandon yesterday's talks. The deadlock between the Bosnian parties cast a shadow over the international negotiations planned for tomorrow in Geneva. These talks, under the auspices of the five-nation contact group, are aimed at securing a two-way split of Bosnia between the Bosnian Serbs and the newly-formed Croat-Moslem federation. Dr Karadzic and other members of the Bosnian Serb delegation arrived in Geneva yesterday, as did Mr Kresimir Zubak, the Bosnian Croat leader who was this week elected interim president of the new federation. There has been some confusion over the relative seniority of Mr Zubak and the Bosnian government headed by Mr Alija Izetbegovic.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: IBM wins rulings against Comdisco INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has won two rulings in its lawsuit against Comdisco, the leading computer leasing company. A Delaware court has ruled that Comdisco misappropriated IBM property by removing and then selling or leasing parts of a computer owned by IBM Credit. The court granted summary judgment to IBM, and ruled that other charges brought against Comdisco should go to a jury for final determination. The IBM lawsuit, filed in 1991, charged that Comdisco engaged in 'elaborate schemes in which property belonging to IBM Credit Corporation was illegally transferred, released, or sold'. The suit was part of a broader dispute between IBM and the computer leasing industry over business practices. Comdisco and other computer leasing companies complained that IBM was attempting to thwart competition in the market. Parts of mainframe computers are typically swapped during the upgrading the equipment. IBM claimed, however, that this practice prevented it from keeping track of its property and violated its leasing agreements. 'From the outset, our position was that you cannot take and dispose of property that belongs to someone else, said Mr Harry Kavetas, IBM vice-president and president of IBM Credit Corporation. Comdisco, however, said it was pleased the court remanded to trial other aspects of the dispute. 'We look forward to the opportunity to present our case on the issues involving sub-leasing and over-leasing, said Mr Kenneth Pontikes, chairman and president. 'Comdisco's ultimate vindication in this case will also be a victory for the computer leasing industry generally, which has been operating under a great cloud of uncertainty since IBM first filed this litigation two years ago.'</p>

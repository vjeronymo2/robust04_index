			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Italian unions warn on pensions The Italian government will this week step up discussion of budget measures for 1995 in the face of growing threats from unions to create trouble if their wishes on pensions reform are not respected. The full cabinet will hold its first formal debate on budget proposals tomorrow, although the Treasury stressed at the end of last week that no decisions would be taken on the detail of the budget. Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government has to find an estimated L45,000bn (Dollars 28.4bn) from cuts or additional revenue in 1995, in an attempt to bring the budget deficit down to L138,600bn. Plans must be agreed and presented to parliament before the end of the month. The Treasury has refused to confirm growing speculation that savings worth an additional L3,000bn or more will be needed to cover the additional cost of servicing Italy's large public debt following the half point rise in interest rates last month. Figures released last week by the Bank of Italy indicated that the overall debt had grown to nearly L1,900,000bn by May. The Berlusconi government will come under attack internally if it reneges on election campaign promises not to increase taxes. But Treasury experts believe they still have some room to raise indirect taxes next year without increasing the overal fiscal burden, because tax measures introduced by the previous government expire in 1995. Mr Innocenz Cipolletta, director general of Confindustria, the Italian employers' federation, said at the weekend that even a budget which raised L48000bn next year would not be enough. But trade unions are resisting the drastic action recommended by the Treasury to reform Italy's overloaded pension system. Two of Italy's three main trade union federations - CIGL and UIL - have expressed serious doubts about the government's plans. Only CISL, the Catholic federation, is taking a softer line.</p>

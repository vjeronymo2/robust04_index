			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act similarly requires that states containing certain CO nonattainment areas to adopt contingency measures that will take effect without further action by the State or EPA upon a determination by EPA that an area failed to make reasonable further progress or to attain the standards, as described in section 172(c)(9). (``Not Classified'' areas, that is, areas that had a design value less than the 9.0 part per million CO NAAQS at the time of designation, are not required to submit contingency measures.) Pursuant to section 172(b), the Administrator has established a schedule providing that states containing areas not exempted from the contingency measure requirement shall submit SIP revisions containing contingency measures no later than November 15, 1993. EPA guidance (``Technical Support Document to Aid States with the Development of Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plans,'' EPA&hyph;452/R&hyph;92&hyph;003, July 1992) recommends that implementation of the contingency measures provide vehicle miles travelled (VMT) reductions or emission reductions sufficient to counteract the effect of one year's growth in VMT. However, the Act does not specify how many contingency measures are needed or the magnitude of emissions reductions that must be provided by these measures. In the interim period ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , after an area fails to attain and while required additional measures are being adopted due to being reclassified to serious), EPA believes that contingency measures must provide for continued progress toward the attainment goal. This would be the minimum requirement and is consistent with the statutory scheme.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 172(c)(9) of the Act specifies that contingency measures shall ``take effect *&blank;*&blank;* without further action by the State, or the [EPA] Administrator.'' EPA has interpreted this requirement (in the General Preamble at 57 FR 13512) to mean that no further rulemaking activities by the State or EPA would be needed to implement the contingency measures. In general, EPA expects all actions needed to affect full implementation of the measures to occur within 60 days after EPA notifies the State of its failure to attain the standard or make RFP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that certain actions, such as notification of sources, modification of permits, etc., may be needed before some measures could be implemented. However, States must show that their contingency measures can be implemented with minimal further administrative action on their part and with no additional rulemaking action such as public hearing or legislative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and CO contingency measures for Missoula were developed by the Missoula City-County Health Department (MCCHD), with input from the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (MDHES). After a local public hearing on September 16, 1993, the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Board adopted the measures. At its November 19, 1993 MBHES public hearing, the Board adopted the contingency measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Governor submitted the contingency measures to EPA with a letter dated March 2, 1994. After reviewing the submittal for conformance with the completeness criteria in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, EPA determined the submittal to be administratively and technically complete and notified the Governor of such determination in a letter dated May 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

If, after analysis, the major contributing source is determined to be re-entrained road dust, the area of regulated road sanding materials will be expanded to include Section 1, T12N R20W; Sections 5 and 24, T13N R19W; and Sections 19, 24, 25, 30, 31, and 36, T13N R20W ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Rule 1401(7)(b) will be implemented). In general terms, the regulated sanding material usage area will be expanded to include East Missoula, Southwest Missoula near Buckhouse Bridge, West Missoula between the Clark Fork and Bitterroot Rivers, and Northwest Missoula in the Grant Creek area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The actual wording of Missoula's PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  contingency measure regulation is ``[u]pon sixty (60) days notification by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and U.S. EPA *&blank;*&blank;*.'' However, in a November 3, 1994 letter from Jeffrey T. Chaffee, MDHES, to Douglas M. Skie, EPA, the State indicated that the word ``and'' is not intended to imply that EPA cannot make an independent finding of Missoula's failure to attain the standard. Therefore, EPA is approving this regulation based on the expectation that all actions needed to affect full implementation of the contingency measure will occur within 60 days after EPA notifies the State of Missoula's failure to attain the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  standard or make RFP,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , the State need not provide notification as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If after analysis the major contributing source is determined to be residential wood burning, then the exemption for burning during an air pollution alert allowed for Class I permitted stoves and dealer demonstration permitted devices will not be allowed ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Rule 1428(5)(d) and (7)(b) will be implemented).

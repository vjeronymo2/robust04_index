			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, April 16 KYODO -- Arrests have increased  to 40 after two days of labor-related riots in North Sumatra  province, a labor activist said Saturday, though police denied  the report.    Independent unionist Hasby Ansyori told KYODO NEWS SERVICE  that some 40 people had been arrested by Friday night, following  riots on Thursday and Friday in Medan, the provincial capital  about 1,400 kilometers northwest of Jakarta.    Hasby is an executive of the Indonesian Prosperity Trade  Union, an independent union which has challenged the  government's policy of only allowing one trade union, the All  Indonesian Workers Union.    Contacted by telephone in Medan, Hasby said the number of  arrests may continue to increase.    The police have denied Hasby's claim, saying they have only  arrested four demonstrators.    About 20,000 workers Marched Thursday, and 51,000 on Friday,  demanding an official investigation into the death last month of  one of their colleagues.    The workers were protesting the death of 22-year-old Rusli,  a  worker at a Medan-based company, after he took part in a labor  strike which was crushed by government troops. Rusli's body was  found floating in a river three days after the March 11 strike.    Police reports said that by Saturday morning about 165 shops  and homes, mostly owned by residents of Chinese descent, were  destroyed and looted. Dozens of cars were set ablaze.    A Chinese businessman of PT Sumatra Blue Company, identified  as Yuli Kristanto, 53, was killeD in Friday's rioting when his  car was pelted with stones by demonstrators.</p>

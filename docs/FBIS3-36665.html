Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS at the airport here that even in  dealing with international matters some statesmen had the habit  of "looking what the neighbour will do" and waiting for somebody  to make the first step. "This is why," the speaker of the  Council of the Federation (the upper chamber of the Russian  parliament) believes, "the economic union treaty, signed on  September 24, 1993, has still not been ratified by CIS  parliaments."    Shumeyko believes that the main task confronting the current  session of the Interparliamentary Assembly is to create a  mechanism to settle problems linked with the ratification of  inter-state treaties. Shumeyko thinks the leaders of the  delegations, attending the current session, are able to reach an  agreement on the simutlaneous ratification of the economic union  treaty by all the CIS parliaments.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["um" report: "Industrial Production in the West Has </F> Meanwhile Overcome Its Low Point"]    [Text] Munich, 12 Apr -- According to its own assessment,  west German industry has overcome its low point in production.  In the second quarter of 1994 most sectors expect a net output  considerably higher than that of the same quarter last year.  This is the result of a poll conducted by Ifo [Institute for  Economic Research] in Munich among 352 industrial companies at  the beginning of the year.    Compared with the corresponding period last year, Ifo  calculates growth rates of more than 1 percent for the second to  the fourth quarter of 1994 based on information provided by the  companies. In total, an increase of industrial net output by  1.25 percent is expected for 1994. Next year, the growth will  probably go up even more and the average growth rate will  increase to 2.5 percent. In August 1993 the companies feared a  decline in output of 0.5 percent in 1994.    Most sectors of the raw materials and producer goods  industry  recovered in the course of 1993. According to Ifo, a growth  rate of 1.5 percent in 1994 and 1 percent in 1995 is certain for  this main industrial group, even without a production index that  clearly continues upward.    The producers of investment goods expect the most dynamic  development. From their information it is possible to calculate  a 4.5-percent increase in output for 1995, following 1.75  percent in 1994. The upswing is essentially supported by  machine-building, road vehicle construction, and electrical  engineering. In contrast, the consumer goods sector is still  weak, showing negative rates of change this year (in total minus  1.25 percent) and only a slight increase by the end of 1995  (plus 0.25 percent). Obviously, the companies do not see any  factors that could compensate for the renewed decline in  spending on consumer goods as a result of tax increases.    Despite the expected strong recovery, by the end of 1995 the  investment goods sector will have reached only the level of  mid-1989. The consumer goods sector, where the slump was  considerably less pronounced, will also reach this level, while  it continues to stagnate. As a result of its stability shown  during the period of its downturn, only the basic materials and  producer goods sector can reach its so far highest annual  average level of 1992 by the end of 1995, assuming that the  companies are able to implement their assessments.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (12): Review follows as US cancels grants - The defence industry / Congress's decision is a major setback THESE ARE trying times for Turkey's defence industry. After all the encouraging words for the country's robust role in the war against Saddam Hussein, Turkey can be forgiven for feeling a little let down by its allies. As if an embarrassing tussle with German parliamentarians over the rules for the use of military aid equipment was not bad enough, worse was to come with the decision by the US Congress on October 6 to end the programme of grants for the Turkish defence effort. Although Turkey was only a spectator - if a rather close one - the Gulf war did much to underline the shortcomings in mobility and firepower of its own armed forces. Turkey has a number of joint defence collaborations with foreign companies. The priorities are well known - electronic warfare, real-time communication and mobility and agility. The broad challenge, as identified by Gen Dogan Gures, the chief of general staff, is not just to modernise the armed forces, but how to standardise the military's diverse supplies, which was one of the original arguments for pushing ahead with a homegrown defence industry. The army, however, has had its differences with the civilian-run defence procurement agency (SSM). The question, as ever, is whether SSM, in its efforts to maximise the amount of local production, is able to deliver what the generals really want. Having once been the favoured industrial child of the former Motherland party administration, the Demirel coalition, too, seems to be less enthusiastic about SSM's procurement strategy. Indeed, when the prime minister came to review progress on the various SSM projects at the start of the year, he was said to have been shocked by the size of the financing involved. He immediately called for the re-tender of a large military helicopter contract, to see whether it made sense to have an off-the-shelf purchase of a smaller number, rather than committing millions of dollars to a long-term industrial collaboration. It was not just the financial imperatives that determined the need for a policy review of the defence programme. Mr Suleyman Demirel is under growing pressure to provide enhanced firepower for the military in its increasingly bloody fight with Kurdish separatists in the south-east of the country. In the event, Turkey awarded the contract to United Technologies, the long-running favourite with its Sikorsky Black Hawk multi-purpose helicopter. However, the contract called for an immediate delivery of 25, with the remaining 50 being built under a joint production arrangement. In other areas, too, the procurement agency has had its wings clipped. The armoured personnel carrier built in co-operation with FMC of the US is still having problems. The agency cancelled a contract awarded to Texas Instruments of the US for night-sighting equipment for the vehicles, after disappointing trials in the US. There were also earlier problems with the engine capability, and the gun. Giat of France recently was awarded the contract to supply the 25mm gun and turret, after another wrangle with the Swiss over the supply of its Oerlikon gun, widely seen as the best product on offer. Berne earlier suspended all arm sales to Turkey over its Kurdish policy, a point which was not lost on the generals when it came to retendering for the gun. Ironically, the latest move by the US Congress could provide ammunition for those in SSM, championing the cause of an indigenous manufacturing capability. Turks need little reminding of the time, after Turkey's invasion of Cyprus in 1974, when the US placed an arms embargo. According to the foreign aid bill, Turkey, like other Nato southern-flank countries, will now receive low interest credits. In 1992, the US pledged Dollars 475m in grant form, the lion' share to be targeted at the F-16 jet fighter project. Earlier this year, Turkey signed a supply contract with Egypt, and is hoping to tap into the Dollars 4bn Gulf Defence Fund, set up by the US and its Arab allies in the wake of the war against Iraq. But the Congress decision clearly represents a major setback, and for many officials is seen as a harbinger of things to come in military relations with the US. 'Disappointing,' was the conclusion of the Turkish foreign ministry. The decision 'does not give the impression of a coherent policy,' a ministry statement complained. 'We have to have a credible military force. In that sense, the congressional decision had a very negative impact on our ability to assume our new responsibilities,' said a senior Turkish diplomat. The immediate casualty will be the F-16 jet fighter programme, which was heavily dependent on US funds under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programme. In both 1988 and 1989, the Turkish treasury sought a refinancing of some of its outstanding credits under the FMS programme. A similar move is not ruled out today. The continuing crisis with the Germans will further underline how Turkey is subject to the political whims of its first-world arms supplier. This dispute followed television pictures of the BTR-60 armoured personnel carriers being used to put down Kurdish demonstrations in March. The BTR-60, a former East German weapon, was given to Turkey as part of the Conventional Arms in Europe disarmament agreement, whereby arms from the richer Nato partners would replace the older equipment of the poorer members  -the so-called cascade effect. The German arms were to be used expressly for Nato defence purposes. The TV pictures therefore brought howls of protest, and led indirectly to the resignation of a German minister and the imposition of a ban on arms shipments to Turkey. The issue came up again in last month, when Turkish newspapers carried pictures of a body being dragged on the ground by one of the BTR-60s. The crisis has now taken another twist, with the plans of the Turkish interior ministry to buy the same vehicle from the Russians. Mr Ismet Sezgin, the interior minister, was in Moscow in October finalising a deal which should allow the Turkish security forces to use the mixed stock of BTR-60s with impunity against the Kurds.</p>

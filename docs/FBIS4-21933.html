			<p>BFN     [Text] In the context of the security measures that the  Internal Security Forces and Army units are using to reassure  the citizens, maintain stability, and punish those who disregard  the lives of the citizens, Ba'labakk's Gendarmerie Company,  operating under the command of Colonel Hasan Hallaq, the  al-Biqa' area commander; and company commander Staff Col.  Ghassan Subh, has carried out raids with the assistance of the  Syrian Arab forces deployed in the area. The company arrested  four individuals of the Shakar family in the township of al-Nabi  Shit. They are Zakariya Muhammad Shakar, 'Ali Wahbah Shakar,  Haytham Wahbah Shakar, and Muhammad 'Ali Shakar. They were  detained in connection with the accidental fatal shooting of the  policeman Husayn 'Ali Shakar.    In Tripoli a military engineer defused a small explosive  device which had been placed in a yellow Renault 12 in the  city's Abu-Samrah district. The device had been set to detonate  when the accelerator was depressed. A security source said it  is likely that the car owner was the intended victim because of  a personal dispute.    In a related development, a noise bomb exploded under the  car  of Ahmad Tawfiq al-Barqawi al-Halabi in Tripoli's al-Mullah  area. The incident occurred while the car owner was driving it,  but there was only minor damage to the car.</p>

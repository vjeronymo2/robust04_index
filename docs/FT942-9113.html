			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (6): Faint smell of gas  -Trends among Asia's utilities The uphill campaign by independent power producers to establish a strategic foothold in the state-dominated Asian electricity industry has received a sharp boost in the past year as a result of several private sector projects. At the same time, overall energy growth in Asia will boom at 4 per cent per year over the next 20 years, says the International Atomic Energy Agency, more than double the growth in the west. Natural gas will be the fastest growing energy fuel in the region, providing a further spur to independent producers as gas-fired units can be built twice as fast as coal units. The recently-negotiated projects underline the growing acceptance by national governments, notably in South Asia and Southeast Asia, of the need for greater public accountability and the reduction in electricity price subsidisation. These changes in perception are helping establish a more hospitable environment for independents to negotiate their deals. In India, the US Enron Power Development Group signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which will allow it to supply the first phase of a 2,015MW gas-fired (LNG) powered plant and related facilities. The scale and nature of the project - costing more than Dollars 2bn and using an imported fuel - makes the deal exceptional in a catalogue of some 70 Indian power projects seeking private sector partnerships. The first phase, now nearing construction start, calls for a 695MW unit costing Dollars 930m, to be followed by a 1,320MW second phase. Equity partners with Enron are General Electric and Bechtel of the US. The build-own-operate project will recoup its costs from the MSEB through the sale of power at 7.5 US cents per kilowatt hour. The deal followed about 18 months of negotiations - not long by international standards - and came on the heels of a similar package of independent power deals involving British companies National Power, British Gas and Rolls-Royce, the largest of which is a 1,000MW coal-fired power station at Visakhapatnam on the Andhra Pradesh Coast. Independent power producers are also encouraged by the success in Indonesia of a US-Japanese consortium's 1,200MW coal-fired Paiton power project on east Java. The deal is the first sizeable independent power deal in Indonesia and involves project leader Mission Energy of the US and partners General Electric of the US, Mitsui of Japan and PT Batu Hitam Perkasa of Indonesia. Construction will start early next year with full power from the project planned for early 1998. The breakthrough in Asia's third-most populated country, after China and India, has sent power plant equipment suppliers and potential project sponsors scurrying to the archipelago. Enron, for example, recently submitted a feasibility study for a joint venture agreement for Indonesia's first large gas-fired plant in East Java. The 500MW integrated power project is aimed at taking advantage of Jakarta's policy to bring gas-fired power generation into Indonesia's mix of coal, oil and hydroelectric power generating stations. The restructuring of the industry is not limited to independent power groups setting up alongside state utilities. There is also the overhaul and, in some cases, market flotation of the state groups themselves. The main reasons are to ensure the delivery of efficient electricity plant quickly and to relieve the state of the onerous financial burden of build all plant under its own wing. Legislation was passed in Pakistan in April to authorise the sale to the private sector of thermal power stations operated by the Water and Power Development Authority. Indonesia's PLN is also being prepared for a minority flotation, along the lines, two years ago, of the 22 per cent divestiture by the Malaysian government of Tenaga Nasional Berhad, the state utility. Thailand's Electricity Generating Authority is preparing to set up private sector subsidiaries and is hiving off some thermal power units to independent power operations. The Manila government is grooming the National Power Corp. for flotation and plans to allow power distributors to built their own power stations. Even Singapore's efficient Public Utilities Board has announced that its gas and electricity business will be commercialised in about two years. It is doing so as it prepares the groundwork for the Dollars 5bn 4,800MW Tuas oil-to-gas power complex, to be built by the end of the century. In terms of equipment supply, the ascendancy of gas as an important power station fuel is stimulating more interest in gas-fired projects, both by independents and the state utilities. Despite the move to privatisation, it is state utilities which still provide the vast majority of orders, although this is diminishing steadily. According to David Genever-Watling, chief executive of General Electric Industrial Power Systems of the US, the Asian power generation equipment market should account for 45 per cent of all power equipment orders in the 1990s. This meant 462,000MW of power equipment orders. Of this, 206,000MW would be for coal/steam turbines and 84,000MW for hydropower, emphasising the point that hydro and coal potential in Asia are available in enormous quantities, albeit not always in the right places. Significantly, gas, which scarcely figured in the equation a decade ago, is now looming larger, with a prediction of 82,000MW for combined-cycle and 37,000MW for gas turbines. GE's prediction also noted that nuclear equipment over the next 10 years would account for 50,000MW of orders, although this is concentrated mainly in Japan, Taiwan and Korea. China is only now making its first foray into nuclear and Indonesia will not be a factor for a decade.</p>

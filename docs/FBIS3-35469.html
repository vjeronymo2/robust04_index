The topics include Palestinian passports and postal stamps,  the size of the Palestinian police force, and the area of  Jericho to enjoy self-rule under the agreement. The same  sources added that the Israelis refuse to take any step that may  give the self-rule areas the form of a state, such as the  issuing of passports and postal stamps.    PLO sources have noted that Israeli troops have begun to  withdraw from some sites in Gaza and Jericho in preparation for  the final withdrawal from the two regions. Five Palestinian  police officers have arrived in Gaza and Jericho to discuss how  the Palestinian police force will be deployed once the Israeli  withdrawal is finalized.</p>

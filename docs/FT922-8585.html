			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Purchasing a tight grip on European hosiery / Considering the questions surrounding the rapid growth of Hartstone MR STEPHEN Barker is a goliath in the world of tights and handbags. When Hartstone publishes its results on Thursday, investors will be keen to learn how this soft-spoken giant's ambitious plans are measuring up. Pre-tax profits at the acquisitive hosiery and leathergoods group are expected to have leapt from Pounds 7.3m to between Pounds 21m and Pounds 22.5m, while turnover will have more than trebled to about Pounds 237m. The dividend should be raised by at least 50 per cent to 4.85p. The architect of Hartstone's rapid expansion is undoubtedly Mr Barker, the former accountant who picked up his skills under the tutelage of dealmakers such as Mr Michael Ashcroft of ADT and Mr Tony Millar of Albert Fisher, the fruit distributor and processor. It is perhaps his employment history, and the similar patterns of rapid growth by acquisition, which have contributed to uncertainty about Hartstone. Rumours about trouble bedding down the two European hosiery companies acquired in January and black holes in its US leathergoods operation were among several which gave the share price a rough ride last month. The price has since more than recovered to finish last night 5p up at 279p, while the company dismisses the speculation as completely false. Nevertheless, analysts say the uncertainty reflected in the volatile share price is something which must be addressed in this week's results. 'It is what's going on underneath (at Hartstone) that is difficult to establish,' said Mr Alistair Irvine of Smith New Court. 'They will have to make sure the numbers are totally clean, so no-one can come back to ask what's going on.' The difficulty lies in Hart-stone's rapid transition via three rights issues and more than 20 acquisitions from a dull UK hosiery company called Glamar to Europe's third-biggest hosiery group and the world's largest distributor of leather goods. The UK hosiery and leathergoods side, last year the largest of its businesses by far, now represents 25 per cent of sales. The purchase of Aznar, Spain's second largest hosiery company, and Cogetex, number two in France, propelled Hartstone into the European big league. Mr Robert Stockfis, an independent analyst with the Metropolitan Optima publication, is forecasting that these two companies will have contributed about Pounds 16m in turnover and Pounds 1.5m in profits for just two months of 1991-92. The logic of combining the Spanish and French companies under one roof is such that the original management might be forgiven a twinge of regret upon hearing that Hartstone had negotiated the agreements simultaneously and, not surprisingly, in secret. 'Had we known, Hartstone would not be here now,' said Mr Michel Urbain, managing director of Cogetex. In the five months since Hartstone moved in, 20 per cent of Cogetex's finished output has been transferred to Aznar's under-utilised, state-of-the-art factory in Valencia. The Spanish company is supplying 15 per cent of Cogetex's yarn needs, and 20 per cent of the materials for the UK hosiery operation. Aznar has also introduced Cogetex's Well brand to all leading Spanish supermarkets, as part of Hartstone's drive to create a pan-European brand of tights. Furthermore, the acquisitions have given Hartstone the raw materials deals with manufacturers such as Du Pont, which analysts estimate could save it more than Pounds 2m in the present year. The company has been equally astute in its raids on the fragmented leathergoods market. Most of this operation is in the US, where Michael Stevens and Etienne Aigner were bought last year. Growth at Michael Stevens, the handbag and leathergoods supplier, has outstripped even Mr Barker's high expectations. Sales are expected to reach Dollars 95m in the year just finished, up from Dollars 45m last time. Analysts have calculated that the benefits of Michael Stevens' buying power in the Far East will help the North American leathergoods division, included for the first time, to contribute profits of more than Pounds 13m. European leathergoods, although much smaller, will also find some benefits in Michael Stevens' sourcing powers. Already the US company is selling to Hartstone's UK companies, such as Lanca. Analysts expect this division, enlarged by some small acquisitions, to show sales of about Pounds 44m, up from Pounds 28.5m, and profits of about Pounds 4.8m, compared with Pounds 3.8m. Mr Barker's integration theory also offers the promise of benefits across divisions. By the end of the year, he said, the hosiery companies would have introduced the leathergoods products to continental supermarkets and Aznar warehouses would be storing leather products. But such ambitious plans are a long way away from what company watchers will want to know next week. If Hartstone is to make the psychological transition from small company to large - and quell some of the market uncertainties - it will have to convince fund managers and analysts who have had their fingers burnt by the likes of Albert Fisher. That means that several longer-term questions will have to be answered. For instance, what happens to an acquisitive company's growth record when new accounting practices begin to hit earnings through above-the-line costs? More importantly, after rationalisation and reorganisation, how much more growth can be extracted from a mature market such as hosiery? Finally, will there have to be a third leg to maintain growth, and if so, what? Mr Barker makes no secret of his ambition to move into lingerie. Conveniently, Hartstone has taken an option to buy Aznar's lingerie arm, Aznar Industrial. However, European lingerie,dominated by well-established names such as Cacharel, may prove a more difficult market.</p>

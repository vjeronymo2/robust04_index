			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Moscow offers three economic options to CIS RUSSIA is offering members of the Commonwealth of Independent States a choice of three options for economic relationships and co-operation. Mr Herman Kuznetsov, deputy head of the government committee which deals with commonwealth republics, said the first option was a10-year treaty providing for the gradual construction of economic union. A fast-track agreement for 'intensive economic integration' was a second option, now being envisaged only by the three Slavic neighbours, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. This would be in the form of a common trading area without internal customs barriers and with a common currency. It would also give Ukraine a 'way out' of its indebtedness to Russia by providing for joint ownership of valuable Ukrainian refineries and other industrial installations starved of Russian raw materials. A third option, which any commonwealth member could combine with either of the economic union treaties, was for a currency union. This would create a new type of rouble zone which he compared to the zone franc operated by the Banque de France in some African countries. Mr Kuznetsov explained that this menu of options, although complicated, was designed to help the CIS out of a rut whereby for the past 18 months all its members 'had been equal but nothing had been achieved'. Under the currency union plan, initialled so far by Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, countries would use the rouble as their national currency after adjusting their credit, budget, and monetary policies in line with Russia's. War-ravaged Tajikistan had expressed a desire to join, while Belarus was still making up its mind. With this option, he said that the Russian government was trying to 'make something useful' out of the central bank's invalidation of pre-1993 banknotes, with which it had tried to wean the republics off the rouble in one stroke. Mr Kuznetsov acknowledged total currency union was the most difficult option to implement. It would take several months to establish but republics might view it as an assault on sovereignty. The Russian cabinet has rejected the resignation of Mr Sergei Glaziev, the foreign economic relations minister. Mr Glaziev had offered to resign over pressures from officials whose corrupt interests he said he had threatened.</p>

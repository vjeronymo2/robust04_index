			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Eduardo Mascarenhas report: "Military at Azimuth of </F> Europe"]    [Text] Fernando Nogueira believes that the changes taking  place on the continent of Europe cause Portugal, in its capacity  as a member of the Atlantic Alliance, the European Union, and  its military component -- the WEU [Western European Union] --  henceforth to assume the role of a fulcral country as regards  Europe's security and defense, while preserving transatlantic  ties.    In other words, the defense minister believes that the time  has come for Portugal to contribute more substantially to the  strengthening of the Atlantic alliance's European pillar by  systematically committing to the WEU's (still mediocre) military  structure the operational product resulting from the process of  modernizing its own Armed Forces.    This is the purport of a working communication that Fernando  Nogueira has conveyed to the Armed Forces chief of staff and the  director general of defense policy. In this communication, the  defense minister orders the intensification of studies aimed at  realizing the above-mentioned intention, but does not forget  interests linked to the country's influence in Africa and in the  regional geostrategic scenario of which it forms part.    The external aspect of the government's philosophy is based  on the ideas approved by the last NATO summit, specifically  those connected with Partnership for Peace and the Joint  Combined Forces, which give the alliance a new image as a  security organization; and the internal aspect is based on the  new Strategic Concept of National Defense.    Portugal's appropriate and balanced presence in the  above-mentioned international organizations (NATO and the WEU),  as well as support for the initiatives aimed at maintaining  global and regional stability carried out by the United Nations  and the CSCE, does not impair but rather makes advisable an  increased national prominence in bilateral and multilateral  relations -- obviously within our real means -- whereby the  safeguarding of national interests will be complemented in a  sustained and harmonious manner, Minister Fernando Nogueira  states in the communication concerned.  <H5>  Observer in Eurocorps </H5>   The defense minister directs that until a new form of joint  military structure is created in the WEU and NATO, the national  forces allocated to the Atlantic alliance should be deemed  available for the WEU, and that the feasibility of various  initiatives should be studied.    Three of these are the possible strengthening of the WEU's  structures with Portuguese military personnel, the posting of an  observer to the Eurocorps command, and the participation of the  Separate Airborne Brigade (BAI) in the nonpermanent ground  component of the Mediterranean Air and Sea Force.    At the same time, forms of participation by Portuguese naval  air forces in that Mediterranean joint force will also be  studied.    Within the strictly European framework, it will also rest  with the military to propose the phasing of the Marine Corps'  possible forms of participation in the Anglo-Dutch Amphibian  Brigade.  <H5>  NATO, United Nations, and Portuguese-Speaking African </H5> Countries    The development of bilateral cooperation in the sphere of  the  defense of the Central and Eastern European region --  specifically with Romania and Hungary -- is also advocated by  the defense minister, who, in light of the last NATO summit's  conclusions, also ponders the ability to respond to Russia.    Active participation in the working parties developing in  international forums the ideas of Partnership for Peace and  Joint Combined Forces will be the background for carrying out  that kind of cooperation.    The setting up of a group of national forces for possible  allocation to the United Nations (on a standby basis) also  appears in the defense minister's communication.    With respect to the national political and strategic  framework, Fernando Nogueira refers to the intensification of  bilateral defense relations with the Maghreb countries and  technical and military cooperation (including at the trilateral  level) with the Portuguese-speaking African countries and other  countries of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, lawyer for the two </F> suspects in the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, by Tal'at Rumayh  in Tripoli; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Rumayh] Could you please  specify the accusations against the two suspects point by point?    [Al-Ghuwayl] The accusations are based on four pieces of  evidence against the suspects:    1. The fact that 'Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi [one of the  suspects] was in Malta on 7 December. He bought things from  some shop and the shop owner testified to the purchase.    2. Al-Amin Fuhaymah's [second suspect] private diary.    3. The timers, the story of which came to light with the  fall of East Germany. It was discovered that the timers were  also sold to East Germany.    4. The story of the suitcase shipped from Malta. But this  piece of evidence was automatically dropped. Even an FBI report  sent from Frankfurt to its headquarters in the United States  recommended that this piece of evidence be dropped because  shipping an unaccompanied suitcase from a country to another  cannot be done without sending a cable with it and taking  specific administrative measures. The cable is not there and no  measures were taken; it would be difficult to fabricate this  because a long time passed before the indictment was issued.    If some "suitcases" passed, they must have entered from  Frankfurt airport without going through the detection machine.  This casts much doubt on those who carried out this operation.  The suitcases were American-made.    There is also a stunning thing that we will reveal soon; it  will deal a crushing blow to the accusations against the Libyans.    [Rumayh] What is that?    [Al-Ghuwayl] On 30 December 1988, CIA agents visited Mr.  Polier [name as published], owner of the factory producing the  timers used in the bombing crime. They sought to wrest a  confession from him that he sold the timers only to Libya  although the piece of the timer had not yet been discovered in  the plane's wreckage.    More surprisingly, this timer piece, over which Libya was  accused, was not found by the Scottish police but by American  FBI agents in Scotland!    This indicates that the accusation against Libya was  deliberate and prearranged.    More seriously, the CIA asked the aforementioned person to  say that he personally went to Malta on 20 December -- a few  days before the incident -- to install the timers on the  explosives on behalf of the Libyans. Under pressure, he wrote  them something to that effect. However, circumstances did not  serve them; at that specific time the same person was already  booked on another flight to a different airport. They,  therefore, did not use the piece of paper he wrote for them.    Regarding the testimony of the Maltese vendor who claimed  that things were bought from him, it is invalid. His testimony  against the suspects said that the purchase was made on a rainy  day and that there was a football match between Italy and  Germany on that day. We checked the weather bulletin but found  that it was not raining that day. We also checked the dates of  matches but did not find any match on that day. The match to  which the witness referred was played on 23 November 1988,  several months before that date.    There remains the story of Fuhaymah's diary. These are the  papers taken from his diary. There is nothing in them. All  that happened is that the accusers of al-Amin Fuhaymah joined  some lines together and read them as they wanted. This is the  paper, please read it! "'Abd-al-Basit coming from Zurich with  Salvo. Take the tanks." What is this? Various points on  various topics and impressions. They put them together and made  accusations out of them according to their whims.    [Rumayh] From your own point of view, how could this problem  be solved?    [Al-Ghuwayl] This is a media effort. I believe that even  among the Arabs there are those who believe that Libya is  involved. The fact is that whoever carefully reads the  accusations and the answers to them and whoever is versed in the  legal precedents, even those in the United States, on the  acceptance of holding trials in foreign countries without  insisting on demanding an extradition -- whoever carefully reads  this will discover that all these accusations are fabricated.  We are now in the process of preparing booklets to explain  these matters from all the angles. We will distribute these  booklets to the public, intellectuals, decisionmaking centers,  and even the Arab leaders themselves.    [Rumayh] Time is in favor of which side?    [Al-Ghuwayl] So far it is in their favor. Nevertheless,  certain things happened recently that refuted many of the false  accusations. Following the downfall of East Germany and during  the trial of intelligence officers, it was proved that the  "timers" used in the bombings were also delivered to East  Germany. It is not true that they were only delivered to Libya.    [Rumayh] Are the two suspects leading a normal life?    [Al-Ghuwayl] They are not leading a normal life. As is  known, they are confined to their houses. According to the  Montreal treaty, the authorities guarantee their presence so  that they can be brought in at any time. We have not asked for  changing this treatment so that the option of their trial in  Libya will also remain open.</p>

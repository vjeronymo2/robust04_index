			<p>BFN     [Text] In conclusion of his two-day visit to the Czech  Republic, UK Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has met with his  Czech counterpart Josef Zieleniec. Klara Stejskalova reports:    [Stejskalova] The talks between the foreign ministers  chiefly  concerned the Czech Republic's membership in the European  economic and security structures. Minister Zieleniec praised  Britain's role in involving the countries of Central Europe in  the European Union. At the same time, he stressed that we are  striving for membership not because we want to be recipients of  European aid but because we want to contribute to transformation  using our own funds. According to Hurd, the European Union must  grow gradually, on the basis of agreements that have already  been concluded.    The talks also concerned NATO and the Partnership for Peace  program. The two ministers praised the role of the United  States, saying that its military presence in Europe is the  guarantee of stability and that it has played an important part  in the recent changes in Central Europe.</p>

Yeltsin's Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov made the  statement soon after Boris Fyodorov, a major reformer in the  cabinet, resigned as finance minister with a warning of economic  collapse and social unrest.    In an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency, Kostikov  said  that Yeltsin will watch closely any changes taking place in the  government.    Once President Yeltsin finds any divergence from reform in  the work of the new cabinet, he will stop it with his  constitutional powers, Kostikov noted.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Lex to buy Swan National retail arm LEX SERVICE, a leading UK motor retailer, is to acquire the Swan National motor group, the UK's 11th largest dealership concern, in a deal worth around Pounds 46m. Swan National motor group, the retail motor distribution arm of Swan National, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the TSB banking group, has 23 UK dealerships. The deal will make Lex the second-largest publicly quoted car retail group in the UK with 86 dealerships. The planned acquisition is the latest move in a radical restructuring of UK motor retailing. Late last year Inchcape, the international motor distribution and motor retailing group, took over Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn (TKM) making Inchcape one of the world's biggest independent car distribution and retailing groups. At the same time, the privately-owned AFG motor dealer group, controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, reduced its 160-strong dealer network to 127 and aims to retain more than 100 dealerships with a range of franchises. Lex Service's planned takeover of Swan National motor group follows its expected loss of the exclusive UK importer/distributorship for Volvo in the UK. Lex said the Swan National deal was conditional on the Volvo transaction, worth a net Pounds 77m to Lex, being approved by its shareholders and given clearance by the European Commission competition authorities. Under the deal Lex will acquire the Swan National dealerships for Pounds 26m in cash and repay inter-company loans of about Pounds 20m. Swan National sold about 18,500 new vehicles in the year to the end of September. It holds dealer franchises for Ford (4), Vauxhall (6), Peugeot (3), Mercedes-Benz (3), and Rover (2) as well as single outlets for Fiat, Jaguar, Land Rover, Renault and Volvo. The acquisition of the Swan National operations would raise its share of the UK new car market from 1.7 per cent to 2.6 per cent. The existing Lex Retail group has a turnover of Pounds 594m, 3,600 employees, 57 dealerships and a sales volume of 27,000 new and 17,000 used cars. Swan National has a turnover of Pounds 309m, 1,200 employees, 23 dealerships and a sales volume of 18,500 new cars and 7,400 used cars.</p>

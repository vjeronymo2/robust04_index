			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Level of injury pay-outs attacked Compensation for personal injuries in England and Wales is often inadequate according to research by the Law Commission published yesterday. It said delays of six years or more in settling claims meant damages were eaten up by debts and extra expenses incurred before settlement. The commission surveyed more than 750 victims of accidents occurring between 1967 and 1991. They had received compensation from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 100,000 or more. The commission found minor injuries could have unexpectedly severe consequences and serious injuries did not necessarily result in big settlements. More than 50 per cent of victims in work at the time of the accident never returned to the same job and a substantial minority never returned to work. Almost 90 per cent of those receiving damages of Pounds 100,000 or more left their job as a result of the accident. Many victims who did return were forced to leave owing to the continuing effects of their injuries. This resulted in a significant burden of unpaid care being shouldered by family or friends. Although most victims were satisfied at the time of settlement with what appeared to be a substantial sum of money, this satisfaction decreased dramatically as they realised the long-term effects of their injuries and their reduced capacity to work.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUMPED PARK PLAN DRAWS FIRE;  </P> <P> LANDFILL: NEIGHBORS OF A DUMP SITE IN NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY ARE ANGRY ABOUT A  DECISION TO EXPAND THE FACILITY. IT WAS DUE TO BE CLOSED AND CONVERTED INTO A  PARK.  </P> <P> A dozen or so families in the Elfin Forest neighborhood who are neighbors to  the San Marcos landfill -- the only large trash dump in North San Diego County  -- have been waiting and wishing for the facility to reach capacity. Then, they  believed, the dump would be covered and turned into a park.  </P> <P> Their wish is expected to come true by next July -- but its fulfillment has  turned against them.  </P> <P> Instead of closing the dump by July, 1991, county public works staffers are now  racing the clock, working overtime to expand the landfill so it will  accommodate the North County's discards for the next 10 or 11 years. In the  process, the county is offering -- in some cases demanding -- to buy the homes  of neighbors who have waited for the end of clattering trash trucks and pungent  garbage smells.  </P> <P> "It's not fair," said Evelyn Alemanni, one of the landfill's beleaguered  neighbors. "They promised us that when the dump was full they would turn it  into an open space park.  </P> <P> "We've been waiting and waiting for that day to come, hanging on to that  promise. Now, instead, they are going to build a trash pile 20 stories high  right next to us and expand the landfill right into our community, right across  Elfin Forest Road."  </P> <P> She laughs when she calls the county's "vertical expansion" of the present  landfill "Mt. Trashmore" and refers to the 230-acre "horizontal expansion" as  "Rancho Basura" (Spanish for garbage), but the laugh is hollow and no smile  goes with it.  </P> <P> Alemanni's home is within the proposed expansion area -- part of a proposed  buffer zone to separate the Elfin Forest from the active landfill. The county  Board of Supervisors, which in 1979 promised residents that they would turn the  landfill into a park when it was filled, now is offering to buy Joe and Evelyn  Alemanni's home and land at fair market value.  </P> <P> County supervisors are looking for a new landfill site in North San Diego  County but choosing and preparing one will take several more years. The San  Marcos landfill was supposed to be usable for the next several years, but  because of rapid growth in the North County, it filled up sooner than expected.  </P> <P> For Robert Haberman, who came from Illinois and bought a home in the secluded  valley 4 1/2 years ago, the future is bleak.  </P> <P> Haberman and owners of two new estate homes do not have the choice that the  Alemannis and a dozen other homeowners have. He must sell his California dream  home for the price an independent appraiser names or face condemnation and a  court fight.  </P> <P> "If they don't get me out of this in a stylish fashion, I'll fight," Haberman  said of the county's as-yet-undisclosed offer for his house. "Like the guy in  that movie, 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more.' "  </P> <P> But, he admits, whatever the price, he'll miss the silent nights after the  bulldozers have shut down. He'll also miss the 200 or so quail that dine on his  hillside.  </P> <P> "I love the location, I love this house, I love feeding the birds. I thought we  could hang in here forever until this came along. So much for the economic  dreams one has of living in Southern California."  </P> <P> For Jim and Marcie Malloy, leaving their three-acre plant nursery is  unthinkable, but the thought of staying is just as bad.  </P> <P> "We've spent five years, six days a week, building up our business. I don't  think we've been away from here together for more than three days since we  started," Jim Malloy said.  </P> <P> "This is not just our home, it's our livelihood," he said.  </P> <P> The Malloys don't have to sell their house, although the county will offer to  buy it. But Marcie Malloy is concerned about the mound of trash that will rise  200 feet higher over their land in coming years.  </P> <P> For those within the buffer zone, the 950-foot-high landfill level approved two  weeks ago by county supervisors will cut afternoon and evening light from the  west, not to mention cutting out sunsets.  </P> <P> "We've already had problems with freezing in the low-lying areas," Marcie  Malloy said. "Losing sunlight, even 15 minutes of it a day, could be a  disaster."  </P> <P> Jim Magee, a principal civil engineer, said that the open-ended offer to buy  out all but the three homeowners closest to the landfill was a humane gesture  proposed by the county Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> "We don't want a few people 'paying' for what is a public facility -- paying by  being adversely impacted," Magee explained. "The public should pay for  acquiring their properties at fair market value and that is what we are  planning to do, if they want to sell."  </P> <P> And what will happen to the homes that the county acquires? Magee isn't sure  yet, but he figures that when the expanded landfill is full -- in about 10  years from now -- the county will probably put most of the property up for  sale. "None of the land is to be used for actual landfill operations," Magee  said of the Elfin Forest properties. "When the landfill is closed, it will be  turned into some sort of a park by the city of San Marcos."  </P> <P> To a person, the property owners who have a choice are undecided as to what  they are going to do. But they do plan to go on fighting to overturn the  county's decision to expand the San Marcos landfill.  </P> <P> Marcie Malloy can't decide if she can stand another 10 years of dust seeping  under her closed windows, of the constant roar of trash trucks and the growl of  bulldozers seven days a week, of the shuddering roar of blasting and the  cloying smell of overripe garbage.  </P> <P> "We're not the only ones affected," she said. "It's the whole valley and more:  the heavy trucks on our roads, the trash that they scatter along the roadside,  the mud they track out of the dump that makes the road dangerous for all of us,  the accidents that happen almost every week and the views of the Pacific Ocean  that will be lost as the pile of trash grows higher.  </P> <P> "I think that they should honor the promise that they made to us 10 years ago  and close the dump, and find someplace else to put the dump that is not in  someone else's back yard."  </P></p>

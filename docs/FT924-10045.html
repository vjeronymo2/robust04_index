			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Textile exports become India's silver lining - Economic reforms have provided an overdue fillip to marketing and investment IF the Indian government is to achieve its aim of export-led growth, it must depend on entrepreneurs like Mr Sudhir Dhingra. Mr Dhingra runs a garment-making business on the outskirts of Delhi. Last year he sold Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.1m) worth of clothes overseas; this year he hopes for Dollars 19m and next year for Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m. Buyers include Macy's and Liz Claiborne in the US, Spiegel, the Chicago-based catalogue company, and Britain's Marks and Spencer. 'If you take account of the international recession, sales are picking up very well,' says Mr Dhingra, the managing director of Orient Craft. The same might be said for the Indian textiles industry as a whole. After a decade of sluggish growth, textiles exports this year have soared. According to government figures, textile exports in the first five months of the financial year starting April were a record Dollars 2.37bn, up 17.1 per cent over the same period in 1991. This included a 32.7 per cent increase in ready-made garments, the fastest-growing business in the industry. As textiles account for about one third of Indian exports, the industry's export performance is a critical barometer of the government economic reforms. Mr Dhingra believes that even though his sales were growing before the introduction of reforms in mid-1991, the government's programme has generated new interest from foreign buyers. Textiles businessmen in Bombay, the centre of India's cotton industry, tell a similar story. Foreign customers visit more frequently and test purchases for 10,000 pieces are turning into orders for 100,000 and more. Liz Claiborne has opened an office in India and Quelle, the German catalogue retailer, plans to do the same. Mr Arvind Mafatlal, chairman of Arvind Mafatlal, a textiles-based conglomerate, says: 'We are just beginning. By 1994 India will be a major force in the market.' Companies are gearing up for growth with heavy investments. Orient Craft is expanding into two new factories and increasing the workforce from 1,400 to 3,000. On a much larger scale, Arvind Mafatlal is ploughing Dollars 200m into up-grading its textiles factories, including one producing shirts for foreign buyers such as J C Penney, the US retailer. In a sense, the industry, like the Indian economy, is trying to make up for lost time. With abundant raw cotton, low labour costs and a long history of textiles manufacturing, India could have taken advantage of international markets long ago. But previous socialist-inclined economic policies encouraged companies to concentrate on protected home markets and exports to the Communist bloc. Moreover, the state intervened by repeatedly nationalising old mills to save them from closure while simultaneously subsidising small-scale workshops to save handloom weavers from poverty. The result was a bloated, uncompetitive, inward-looking industry. By 1990, India's share in the international textiles and clothing trade was just 3 per cent, little more than Pakistan's 2 per cent and far behind China's 7.5 per cent. Even before the advent of Mr Narasimha Rao, the reformist prime minister, better-managed companies were prodded into action by a collapse in sales to former Communist states. But the new government's policies have encouraged others to follow suit. Exporters also took advantage of the sharp devaluation of the rupee, which increased export competitiveness, coupled to the economic slowdown in industrialised countries, which forced buyers to seek out cheaper sources of supply. 'Business leaders saw this was our first and last chance to catch up with other countries,' says Mr Sanjay Lalbhai, managing director of Arvind Mills, a textiles group investing Dollars 200m in what will be one of the world's largest factories for denim and cotton shirting. But the industry will not transform itself overnight. As the chairman of one Bombay mill company says: 'We are not competitive even with Indonesia, never mind Pakistan or China. We have a long way to go.' Economic liberalisation has barely begun to affect the industry's core. While export incentives have been introduced with some dramatic results, manufacturers' freedom is still curbed by import controls on cotton and other raw materials and, especially by labour laws which make it all but impossible for large companies to dismiss or redeploy workers. Government-directed cheap finance for state-owned companies and for small workshops drives up the cost of capital for other businesses. The real interest rate in India (nominal rates minus inflation) is about 10 per cent. Furthermore, years of protection have generated a business culture which tolerates poor quality, little attention to cost control and frequent delays in deliveries. Even export-oriented garment-makers, which are particularly attuned to foreign requirements, can be hamstrung by their suppliers. Indian textile makers cannot rely on the further devaluation to make them competitive, because this would make it prohibitely expensive to buy the imported equipment needed to meet foreign quality and design standards. Also, the industry is heavily reliant on cotton for its success. A swing in fashion in developed countries away from the current preference for natural fibres could hurt Indian fabric makers. Finally, the rules of the Multi Fibre Arrangement, under which developed countries restrict imports of textiles, tend to treat India less favourably than longer-established textiles exporters. Nevertheless, Indian companies have some competitive advantages. High-quality cotton is in good supply. With improvements in communications and transport, companies will be increasingly able to use the great diversity of Indian skills in spinning, weaving and dyeing. With the help of reforms, there are enough opportunities in Indian textiles for entrepreneurs to build large businesses over the next few years. But the danger is that the legacy of India's past economic policies could limit the extent to which the successes of the energetic few benefit the rest of the industry, let alone the rest of the economy.</p>

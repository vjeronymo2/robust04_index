			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Mitterrand attacks UK delay on treaty PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand launched a strong attack last night on Mr John Major for delaying the UK decision on ratifying the Maastricht treaty until well into next year. His unusually sharp assault on the prime minister came as British and Danish ministers had limited success in Brussels in trying to calm EC partners alarmed about the Maastricht treaty's future. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, asked other EC ministers to take in good faith the UK's goal of speedy ratification, but he avoided giving a final date for wrapping up the treaty in the House of Commons. The French president said in a television interview he would be content to give the UK government 'a delay of a few weeks' after January 1 1993  - which had been set as a target date for ratification - 'but not more'. While he was confident that 10 countries would ratify the union treaty by the end of this year, Mr Mitterrand said it was 'unacceptable' for Mr Major to delay the UK ratification decision until after Denmark held a second referendum on the issue in May at the earliest. Downing Street reacted tersely to Mr Mitterrand's remarks. An official said: 'The British government has a number of priorities. The first now is to prevent a trade war. The timing of the Maastricht legislation is a matter for the British government.' The French president's strong stance bodes ill for Mr Major at next month's Edinburgh summit, though Mr Mitterrand said he still thought the UK leader 'will stick to his word'. Clearly hoping for a further change of tack by Mr Major, Mr Mitterrand said: 'One should not prejudge the final decision of Mr Major, who only a short time ago seemed to say that Britain would deliver its verdict before January 1. 'I judge it (the UK delay) badly, but one should not be surprised. On all the big European agreements in recent years, we have had the same sort of difficulties with Britain.' Indirectly, Mr Mitterrand was even more scathing about Denmark. For Britain to make the timing of its decision dependent on Denmark was 'unacceptable, because this could last as long as the Danes would wish it'. After the Brussels meeting, Mr Hurd said the UK decision to delay ratification until after a second Danish referendum had met with 'some anxiety, but considerable understanding'. Belgian and French officials both suggested yesterday that the delay in approving the treaty could jeopardise enlargement negotiations planned early next year with Finland, Sweden and Austria. Mr Hurd acknowledged doubts about the timetable, but he implied that the postponement of UK ratification was the price to be paid for overcoming opposition within the ruling Tory party. 'A delayed treaty is better than no treaty.' Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, said Denmark aimed to hold a second referendum on the treaty next May. But the timing would depend on the EC agreeing on Denmark's demands for 'legally binding' exemptions by the time of the EC summit on December 11-12. Obstacle course, Page 12</p>

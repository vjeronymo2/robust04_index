			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The Japanese Communist  Party [JCP] said in a statement Friday [18 March] that an  employee at a rice milling factory on the southernmost island of  Kyushu found a dead mouse last January in rice that had been  imported from Thailand.    The JCP statement said that the employee discovered the  mouse  at a milling factory in Fukuoka Prefecture while he was removing  rice from a bag to put it into a flour milling machine.    Rather than consulting with the factory management, the  employee brought news of the find directly to the local JCP  branch office, the statement said.    The party's statement was issued to substantiate remarks  made  in the Diet earlier this month by JCP parliamentarian Yuko  Takasaki, who claimed Japanese rice millers have so far found a  dead mouse, bird bones and cockroaches in shipments of imported  Thai rice.    The allegation has had the effect of creating widespread  doubt among the general public about the quality and safety of  imported rice, particularly that coming from Thailand.    Officials of the Food Agency, however, said that no such  allegation has yet been confirmed. They said the factory in  question has been subject to its inspection aimed at ensuring  the quality of imported rice.    The Thai Embassy in Tokyo earlier this week expressed  concern  over the prominently reported allegations.    In a letter to a Japanese daily newspaper, the embassy said  that each rice shipment is strictly inspected before export to  Japan, by both Thai authorities and Japanese experts, and then  reinspected upon arrival in Japan.</p>

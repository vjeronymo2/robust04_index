			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nedcor income ahead 16% after six months Nedcor, the South African banking group, yesterday announced a 16 per cent rise in net income to R271m (Dollars 80m) for the six months to March, up from R234m a year ago. The interim dividend has been increased to 29 cents from 25 cents, while earnings per share rose to 139 cents from 121 cents. Overall interest income rose to R3.39bn from R3.12bn, and was helped by growth in both loans and advances. Other income rose 16 per cent to R653m from R562m. Mr Richard Laubscher, chief executive, said the improvement was chiefly the result of 'very good volumes'. Results were also boosted by a 14 per cent reduction in provision for bad debts to R103m compared with R120m last year. This was partially offset by a 21 per cent increase in the tax burden as a result of an increase in value added tax. The group's best performer was its UAL financial services division, which increased net income by 25.4 per cent, rising to R32.1m from R25.6m. Mr Laubscher said he was 'much more positive' about prospects for the economy after the elections. He singled out the Perm, Nedcor's main home-loan arm, and said that it was exceptionally well placed to take advantage of further growth in the black market, particularly as the new government pursues its reconstruction and development programme in the townships.</p>

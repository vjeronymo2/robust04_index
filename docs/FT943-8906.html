			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Edinburgh poised for biggest festival yet The largest annual cultural gathering in the world opened last night at the Edinburgh International Festival with a performance at the Usher Hall of Mahler's 8th Symphony by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. For the next three weeks Edinburgh plays host to four major festivals as well as the Military Tattoo. In addition to the International Arts Festival there is the Fringe, the Film Festival, and a Jazz Festival. At the end of the month the television world gathers for its annual conference. This year's International Festival, directed for the third time by Mr Brian McMaster, promises to be the most successful for many years. The box office has already taken Pounds 1.5m towards its Pounds 2m target and, for the first time, the new Festival Theatre will be open to take large-scale opera productions. Beethoven and the 19th-century French composer Chabrier are featured prominently in the music programme, with Scottish Opera performing Beethoven's only opera Fidelio at the Festival Theatre. Three of Chabrier's five operas are to be performed to mark the centenary of his death. The Australian Opera will appear in Benjamin Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Among dance troupes in Edinburgh are Miami City Ballet, the Mark Morris Dance Group and Merce Cunningham, while the highlights of an impressive drama programme are the world premiere of Canadian director Robert Lepage's The Seven Streams of the River Ota and the return of German director Peter Stein with a performance in Russian of the Oresteia lasting more than seven hours. Last year's Edinburgh Festival made a small profit. With local authorities contributing more than Pounds 1m in subsidy and corporate sponsorship almost as much, this year's festival should also end up in the black - in spite of the need to sell 20 per cent more tickets with the opening of the Festival Theatre. The festival closes on Saturday September 3 with Elgar's Dream of Gerontius performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras. The festival brings more than Pounds 30m to Edinburgh's economy. Its main competitor for custom is the Fringe, with 9,000 performers from 36 countries, who have scheduled 13,415 performances of 1,275 shows at 184 venues, including church halls, Masonic temples, a delicatessen, a swimming pool, and a bus running around Edinburgh. The Fringe has been criticised in the past for its preponderance of comedy but this year the number of comedy shows has fallen from 209 to 167. There is also a reduction in the number of Shakespeare productions  - just eight, a record low. The Scottish National party yesterday attacked the festival over its lack of Scottish plays, music and dance in the programme. Mr Paul Scott, the party's arts spokesman, said the festival could be 'in Edgbaston rather than Edinburgh' as far as recognition of Scotland's heritage and creativity went. In a letter to Mr McMaster he says that there is no sign of the festival director's 'stated aim to bring Scotland to the world as well as the world to Scotland'.</p>

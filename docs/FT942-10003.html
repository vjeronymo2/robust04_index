			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: No bids for Peruvian mining giant The drawbacks associated with Peru's huge state-owned mining and refining concern Centromin outweigh its attractions, potential buyers decided on Tuesday, when no bids were presented at the first attempt to auction the company. Centromin's privatisation committee had set a minimum price of Dollars 280m in cash plus secondary debt paper with face value of Dollars 60m. In addition, the buyer was to commit at least Dollars 240m in new investment to replace run-down machinery and equipment and make basic environmental improvements. Although company officials claimed it was only one of several possible deterrents, long-term pollution seems to have been what decided at least front-runner RTZ to pull out. Centromin's central Andean mining and refining operations - in the hands of the private, US-owned Cerro de Pasco Corporation until 1974 - has been a notorious polluter for decades. RTZ is reported to have sent, some six weeks ago, a long letter to Centromin's privatisers explaining in detail why it could not bid. That letter has not been made public but the British-based company is believed to have balked at the open-ended litigation problems that assumption of Centromin's 'environmental debt' might involve in the future. That unknown factor aside, RTZ was believed to have been extremely keen to take on the giant operation, which comprises seven production units and the largest refining complex in South America. Annual sales of minerals top Dollars 400m and private sector mining executives believe Centromin could be made 'hugely profitable'. Tuesday's flop poses a major problem for the Peruvian state. Centromin is the life-line for almost 12,000 workers and literally hundreds of thousands more Peruvians in the mining-dependent central Andes. La Oroya is also the only refinery willing and able to turn the region's typically 'dirty' minerals into a world-class product. Many smaller, privately-owned mines in the depressed central Andean region depend on La Oroya to turn their minerals into saleable metals and by-products. Mines minister Mr Daniel Hokama, who also heads Copri, the government's privatisation office, says he and Centromin officials will now reassess sale possibilities. Potential buyers - including two Mexican companies and UK-based Waverley Investment, all thought to be still interested - are to be sounded out. The base price could be reduced or the debt paper element raised. Another alternative, previously rejected, would be to split Centromin into smaller packages. The hydro-electric plants and the Cerro de Pasco and Antamina mines would certainly find ready buyers. But the 'social problem' would remain. What nothing can be done about, at least in the short-term, is the environmental damage, acceptable even to US companies two decades ago but, for today's multinational corporations, the kiss of death.</p>

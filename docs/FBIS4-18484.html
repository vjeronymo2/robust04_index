			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gerry Adams, "president of Sinn Fein, the </F> political wing of the Irish Republican Army," by Sabine  Christiansen on 5 April; Christiansen is in the ARD studio in  Hamburg, Adams is in a studio in Belfast -- recorded; Adams  statements in English with superimposed German translation]    [Text] [Christiansen] Good afternoon, Mr. Adams. What do  the Irish Republican Army [IRA] and Sinn Fein want to achieve  with the limited cease-fire agreement?    [Adams] The IRA initiative is basically an attempt to create  room and to achieve a breakthrough. The point is clarification  for Sinn Fein on the part of the British Government. [sentence  as heard] Yet, when the Downing Street Declaration was  published we did not get that clarification that we should have  been given, and which everybody else received.    [Christiansen] You have said that you want clarification.  Are you not seeking direct negotiations with London?    [Adams] No, no, we are currently not seeking negotiations,  even though one day we will. All parties involved in this  process wanted a negotiated peaceful settlement, but only later.  At the moment our point is to have the British Government  involve Sinn Fein and accept the legitimacy of our electorate  and answers those questions that we would like to see answered.    [Christiansen] Could the second step now not also lie in the  IRA's commitment to non-aggression? After all, then the British  Government would sit down at the negotiating table with you.    [Adams] This is a question for the IRA. I am talking on  behalf of Sinn Fein. The peace process must get started. We  must not accept a standstill as a result of difficulties that  John Major happens to have regarding his relations with the  Unionists and his own right wing. At the same time, we must  understand that he is a weakened prime minister, and that this  is his reality. The worth of the IRA initiative is that it  creates certain room, and that if John Major would like to  achieve some progress on this issue that he could do so on this  basis.    [Christiansen] Mr. Adams, what will happen once the  cease-fire expires if -- as signals from London indicate --  there will not be a positive reaction from there?    [Adams] I assume that the British Army will continue its  activities, and the same applies to the other side. The point  is to give a very clear signal to the British. This signal will  not be lost despite all gut reactions from Downing Street. The  eminent advisers have certainly realized how significant this  IRA attempt to show flexibility is.    [Christiansen] Thank you very much.</p>

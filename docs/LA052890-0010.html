			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 118;  </P> <P> MAKE REDISTRICTING FAIR TO ALL  </P> <P> Proposition 118 would give a minority (one-third) of the state Legislature the  power to veto any reapportionment plan proposed by the majority. This would  increase racial gerrymandering and back-room deal-cutting by incumbents.  </P> <P> Proposition 119 would remove the redistricting process from the hands of  popularly elected legislators and put it into the hands of an appointed  commission. Cynical at best, this would take the redistricting process one more  step from the voters. Putting such matters into a commission only hides power  struggles and increases the influence of special interests.  </P> <P> Few Latino leaders argue that past redistricting efforts were fair to our  community. As Democratic and Republican incumbents battled for power, Latino  communities were gerrymandered. The result is that while Latinos comprise 26%  of California's population, they hold only 5% (6 of 120) of the legislative  seats.  </P> <P> It is time to introduce a new ethic into the process. The Voting Rights Act and  subsequent precedents hold that criteria of one person/one vote, respect for  the integrity of communities of interest (blacks, Latinos, etc.), and  prohibition of racial gerrymandering are preferred guidelines for  redistricting. New laws should enforce these standards for redistricting at the  state and local levels (Latinos are also shut out by nonpartisan county  supervisor elections in California, holding only 8 of 290 seats, or 3%).  </P> <P> The Latino contribution may well be to reintroduce the great values of American  democratic thought into California political debate. Good governance ought to  facilitate political participation and representation for all -- poor and  working class as well as wealthy, ethnic minorities as well as Anglo majority,  non-citizen as well as citizen, female as well as male.  </P> <P> Proposition 118 won't do it. Neither will its competitor, Proposition 119.  </P></p>

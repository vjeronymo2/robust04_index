			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / BAT nears American Tobacco takeover consent BAT Industries, the British tobacco and financial services group, looks well placed to win a US court's consent this week for its planned Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover of American Tobacco, the fifth biggest US cigarette maker. Over the past two weeks the US Federal Trade Commission has been arguing in a New York court that the takeover should be blocked on competition grounds because BAT already owns Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, the third biggest US cigarette maker. The case closed last Wednesday with the judge reserving his decision, so neither side yet knows the outcome. But lawyers for the Federal Trade Commission acknowledge that BAT seems to have come out ahead. Mr Merlin Orlans, who represented the FTC during the hearing, said that the judge had clearly not been disposed towards the FTC's arguments. During the hearing, the FTC argued that the US tobacco industry was already highly concentrated because it had only six participants. If two of the participants combined, the FTC said, competition would be further reduced and it would become easier for the remaining participants to raise prices. BAT countered that a merger of Brown &amp; Williamson with its 11 per cent market share and American Tobacco with its 7 per cent share would increase the combined company's ability to compete with Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco, the two industry giants, which together account for 70 per cent of US cigarette sales. The FTC appeared to start the proceedings with a strong case, but as the hearing progressed, it became evident from Judge Milton Pollack's grilling of key FTC witnesses that he was far from convinced by the FTC's arguments. Judge Pollack is thought likely to announce his decision tomorrow or Wednesday. But the FTC and BAT may yet reach a settlement before then under which the FTC would drop its opposition to the takeover. For the FTC, a compromise would be better than an outright defeat. For BAT, an agreement would eliminate the likelihood that the FTC, if defeated, would further delay the takeover by lodging an appeal. One compromise that the FTC and BAT are understood to have considered would involve an agreement by BAT that it would shed an American Tobacco factory and some its brands if the takeover went ahead.</p>

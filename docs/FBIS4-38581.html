			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, June 1 (AFP) -- Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk, seeking to bring Crimea back into the fold, said  Wednesday [1 June] he was prepared to consider a new  power-sharing arrangement with the Russian-speaking republic.    In an address to lawmakers, Kravchuk said that a new  constitutional court could be formed within a month to examine  the Crimean basic law that provides for a Crimean citizenship,  treaty relations with Kiev and the establishment of a separate  militia force.    The Ukrainian leader also held out an olive branch to the  leadership of the breakaway republic by announcing that he was  prepared to consider legislative changes that would give Crimea  greater autonomy from Kiev.    "I pledge to maintain peace and calm but only if Crimea  adopts laws and legislative acts that are in line with the  Ukrainian Constitution," Kravchuk said.    "Only in this instance is compromise and settlement of all  outstanding issues possible," he said, adding: "There are  extremely dangerous precedents currently being established in  Crimea."    Crimea, a predominantly Russian-populated republic bordering  the Black Sea, has stepped up its drive to secede from Ukraine  and be reunited with Russia since the election in January of  Russian nationalist Yuriy Meshkov to the presidency.    The republic was part of Russia up until 1954 when  then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev handed over the territory  to Ukraine as a "gift" celebrating the friendship between the  two Slav peoples.    The Crimean crisis was triggered by the local parliament's  decision on May 20 to restore a 1992 constitution in a move that  was viewed by Kiev as tantamount to a declaration of  independence.    The attempt at a settlement came ahead of the June 26  presidential election which Kravchuk is expected to lose and is  seeking to postpone.    In his address, Kravchuk cited an agreement reached between  Russia and the breakaway republic of Tatarstan as a framework  for negotiating a new power-sharing arrangement that would give  Crimea greater autonomy from Kiev in managing its economy.    But the Ukrainian leader stressed that the Russian-Tatar  agreement did not provide for a republican police force and for  citizenship rights which he said amounted to a "gross violation  of the Ukrainian Constitution."    He asserted that all law-enforcement agencies and security  forces must be subordinated to Kiev and proposed that a post of  deputy prime minister responsible for territorial issues be  created as well as a parliamentary commission.    Kravchuk announced that a 10-judge panel for the new court  could be appointed by parliament within a month and proposed  that five candidates be put forward by Speaker Alexander Moroz  and the remaining five by the presidency.    The parliament was to examine the Kravchuk proposal and  render its verdict later during the day.</p>

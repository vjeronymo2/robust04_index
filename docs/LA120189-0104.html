			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN HELD IN PLOT TO KIDNAP, RANSOM TEXAS BILLIONAIRE;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: A TENNESSEE MAN ALLEGEDLY PLANNED TO KIDNAP ROBERT M. BASS AND  HOLD HIM FOR $5 MILLION.  </P> <P> A man was held Thursday on racketeering and extortion charges for an alleged  plot to kidnap Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass and hold him for $5-million  ransom, authorities reported.  </P> <P> Austin James Veleff, 57, of Germantown, Tenn., was arrested by FBI agents on  Wednesday after he had driven to Texas with an undercover agent he thought was  going to help him.  </P> <P> The arrest came after Veleff took pictures of City Place, a 33-story office  complex built by the Bass family, where Robert Bass has his office.  </P> <P> Carroll Andre, an assistant U.S. attorney in Memphis, Tenn., said Veleff had  never met Bass and had no connection with him. He had made Bass the target of a  kidnaping after reading about him in a business magazine, Andre said.  </P> <P> Federal authorities had been aware of the alleged plot since May. But Andre  said Veleff told the undercover agent he had been planning to abduct Bass for  seven years.  </P> <P> Dee Kelly, a lawyer for the Bass family, declined to comment.  </P> <P> FBI agent William Fallin of Memphis, the agent in charge of the investigation,  said Veleff planned to ask for $5-million ransom after taking Bass to south  Texas.  </P> <P> Veleff, an advertising salesman for the Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper for  about 20 years, had operated a swimming pool business for about eight years  before becoming unemployed.  </P> <P> If convicted, Veleff could face a maximum prison term of five years and a fine  of up to $250,000.  </P> <P> Andre said that in addition to the $5-million ransom, Veleff talked about  filming Bass "in distressing situations" and seeking an additional $20 million  after the initial ransom had been delivered by plane to a mountain in Mexico.  </P></p>

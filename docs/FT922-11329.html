			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Letter: Corporate security strategies can help counter terrorism Having the ultimate responsibility for investigating serious crime in the City I was very disappointed to read the remarks of Mr Noboshi Kamei of Sanwa Bank in your article, 'City workers accused of complacency on security' (April 23), on security in the wake of the St Mary Axe bombing. Unlike Mr Kamei I firmly believe that there is a range of positive preventive measures capable of deterring the terrorist. As a community the Square Mile can, in partnership with the police, raise general public awareness of the potential threat. Terrorism after all is serious crime - the murder and maiming of innocent people and the destruction of property. Society has long accepted the principle of combating and preventing general crime, so why should terrorism be viewed any differently? We need to maximise the effectiveness of the available resources, ie the deployment of the man guarding resources by patrolling the exterior of premises, enhanced use of closed-circuit TV cameras, proper access control measures to buildings and encouragement of staff to be alert to any suspicious activity, whether by individuals or vehicles in the vicinity of their premises. The police, meanwhile, play their part by substantially enhancing uniform patrolling and focusing all their efforts to protect the public. By these and other methods we can together hopefully deter the terrorist. In the event of an incident occurring, the loss of life, injury and damage can be minimised by taking physical and and safety protection measures - blast-proof film for windows and bomb incident contingency plans covering the searching and safe evacuation of premises. Implementation of these basic security and safety plans should be an integral part of any corporate security strategy serious in its efforts to protect its employees. Free advice is available to all who ask. P A Gwynn, detective chief superintendent, head of CID, City of London Police, 26 Old Jewry, London EC2</p>

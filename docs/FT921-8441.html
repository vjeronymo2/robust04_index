			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Kuwait to privatise telecoms network THE KUWAITI government is planning to privatise its telecommunications network through a public flotation, the first public service to be sold to the private sector. The sale could raise up to Dollars 1bn. A first tranche of shares would be floated on the Kuwaiti stock exchange, possibly as early as next year. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK firm advising the government on the sale, has just submitted an interim report on the privatisation. A final report is due in May. Privatisation of the network would first require a change in the law on the government's virtual monopoly on telecoms. Mr Abdul Aziz Al-Ayoub, under-secretary at the Telecommunications Ministry, said yesterday he hoped the sale would be underway by the end of 1993. Under privatisation, all the government's telecoms assets would be transferred to a separate authority, which would establish a company to transfer assets to the private sector. The government plans to invest about Dollars 300m in the system before privatisation, including conversion to a fully digitalised network. The government intends to maintain a stake in the new company for an initial period during the phased sale. It would also continue to regulate the telecoms market. A proportion of shares would be offered for sale to Kuwaiti citizens. The telecoms service had to be privatised if it was to improve efficiency and keep pace with new technology, Mr Al-Ayoub said. Ericsson, the Swedish telecoms group, supplied more than 90 per cent of the government-controlled market before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. However, other foreign companies, most notably AT&amp;T of the US, have been battling for a share of the estimated Dollars 400m repairs and replacement of equipment damaged during the war. Less than Dollars 100m worth of contracts have been awarded so far.</p>

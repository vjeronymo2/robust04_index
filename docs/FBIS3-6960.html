			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly's  Foreign Affairs and National Unification and National Defense  Committees met Wednesday to hear reports from the Kim  administration on the escalating tension on the peninsula  triggered by the North Korean nuclear dispute.    The committees also looked into the security situation as  North Korea threatened war after rupturing the inter-Korean  contact last Saturday, and the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) referred the nuclear issue to the United Nations  Security Council for possible sanctions.    "In case North Korea changes its posture in order to avoid  U.N. sanctions, the Kim administration will map out active  measures to take the initiative on inter-Korean problems,"  Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok told the Foreign Affairs and  National Unification Committee.    Yi, also minister of the National Unification Board, said he  will monitor North Korea's reaction to discussions at the U.N.  Security Council.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said the key to resolving the  nuclear question lies in either U.N. sanctions or securing  China's cooperation.    The government is expected to make a strong push for Chinese  cooperation when President Kim visits Beijing next week, Han  said.    "If North Korea determines that there is no possibility of  improving its relations with the United States, it may take  drastic action," Han said. "It is necessary to maintain a  channel of dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang."    But as long as North Korea fails to honor its promises,  there  will be no third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks,  Han said.    Neither South Korea nor the United States intends to  compromise on the basic issues with North Korea, Han said.    The foreign minister also said the world community should  refrain from adopting an emotional hard-line stance against  Pyongyang that could backfire.    U.N. Security Council sanctions should be applied in stages,  Han added.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae told the National Defense  Committee that South Korea and the United States are currently  negotiating the timing of the joint military exercise Team  Spirit. Dates in late April, mid-May or sometime after June  were mentioned, according to Yi.    "Since North Korea could not satisfy the two conditions for  the suspension of Team Spirit, the resumption of the exercise  this year is unavoidable," Yi said.    Practical military maneuvers such as river crossings and  emergency landings will be added to the annual Team Spirit to  realize the participation of the fewest troops for maximum  effect, Yi said.    The Patriot anti-missile missiles, soon to be deployed by  the  U.S. Forces in Korea, will also be used in the exercise, he said.    One Patriot missile battalion is capable of taking on 55  incoming enemy aircraft, Yi said, adding that "its ability to  destroy Scud missiles in the air is an additional function."    Yi said Seoul and Washington will determine the dates for  Team Spirit with maximum training and demonstrative effects in  mind. He said the military also hopes to avoid busy farming  periods.    Once the two countries announce the resumption of the war  games, it would be difficult to turn back, he said.    The defense minister said, "there are no signs that North  Korea will launch a provocation within a short period of time."    "But we cannot rule out the possibility if the U.N. Security  Council starts deliberating sanctions," he added.    In order to prepare for all eventualities, the government is  working out measures in two stages -- one before and the other  after the U.N. Security Council decides on sanctions, Yi said.    In the first stage, the Armed Forces will strengthen  surveillance, hold regular meetings of the South Korean-U.S.  Military Committee, report on strategy to the commander of the  allied forces and request that part of a rapid reaction force be  deployed, he said.    Moreover, Yi said he will urge the government to request the  United Nations to build up its deterrent potential, he said.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> WICHITA STATE CAN'T HANDLE KELLER  </P> <P> Clyde Keller hears the baiting every time he takes the mound for Florida State.  </P> <P> Frustrated hitters at the plate and in the dugout are never shy or tactful with  their requests for something more macho than Keller's deceptive palmball.  </P> <P> "If they're going to yell and scream about not getting enough fastballs, that's  fine," said Keller, a senior right-hander from Carmichael, Calif. "But, I'm  just going to go out and get them out with I've got."  </P> <P> Keller had Wichita State in the palm of his hand Sunday night, pitching a  complete-game, four-hitter as the top-seeded Seminoles defeated the Shockers,  4-2, in the second round of the College World Series before a crowd of 15,800  at Rosenblatt Stadium.  </P> <P> Florida State (54-16), which remains unbeaten in the East Division of the  eight-team double-elimination tournament, will play Wednesday against the  winner of Tuesday's game between Wichita State (64-16) and Arkansas (51-15).  </P> <P> Arkansas defeated North Carolina, 7-3, Sunday afternoon, eliminating the Tar  Heels (41-18-1).  </P> <P> Wichita State arrived in Omaha with a .327 team batting average -- the highest  in the tournament. The Shockers, however, never got a bead on the 5-foot-9,  160-pound Keller (13-0) who struck out four and walked two.  </P> <P> Keller surrendered two runs in the sixth, then retired the final 11 batters he  faced.  </P> <P> "His palmball comes in there looking pretty fat," Wichita State catcher Eric  Wedge said. "Then it just blows away."  </P> <P> Bob Reboin broke a 2-2 tie in the seventh inning with a single off Wichita  State starter Pat Cedeno (12-4) that scored Rocky Rau, who had singled to lead  off the inning and moved to second on a sacrifice by Pedro Grifol.  </P> <P> Grifol, the Seminole catcher, provided the final run in the ninth with a solo  homer to left off Shocker relief ace Jim Newlin.  </P> <P> "We took a big step forward in the first game," said Wichita State Coach Gene  Stephenson, whose team defeated Arkansas on Friday, "and a giant step back  tonight."  </P> <P> College World Series Notes  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach (50-14) plays Louisiana State (53-16) today in a West  Bracket elimination game and Miami (49-16) meets Texas (52-17) in a winner's  game. . . . Kyle Abbott (15-2, 2.37 earned-run average) will start for Long  Beach against Curtis Leskanic (14-2, 3.00) of LSU. . . . Alex Fernandez (15-1,  1.60), a freshman right-hander, will start for Miami. Fernandez's only defeat  was a 6-5 loss to Texas in February. . . . Arkansas shortstop Rod Stillwell,  who went to Thousand Oaks High, is a second-generation World Series  participant. His father, Ron Stillwell, played shortstop for USC in the 1960  and 1961 World Series. The Trojans won one of their 11 national championships  in 1961.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO'S EXPLOITED?  </P> <P> Tro Konialian's July 2 letter bemoans the commercial excess of today's artistic  productions, specifically Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera." One  passage of his letter:" . . . If I were the world-renowned composer . . . I  would require stipulations in the production and advertising contracts to  protect my art from being exploited and tainted by modern business tactics and  commercialism."  </P> <P> I admire Mr. Konialian's vision of Lloyd Webber, Zola-like, penning his latest  opus with stiffened fingers in a freezing loft somewhere, but Konialian should  suggest those stipulations to someone else.  </P> <P> We're talking about the "exploited" artist who had the idea of incorporating  and selling shares in himself and who makes more money in one hour than most  people make in a year and who personally approves of each item of tainting  exploitation.  </P> <P> The driving force behind the commercialism of Mr. Lloyd Webber's art is Mr.  Lloyd Webber.  </P> <P> It is likely that much of his creative artistry will be remembered for the next  few years, and it is a virtual certainty that his business innovations will  live forever. So don't cry for Lloyd Webber, Mr. Konialian.  </P> <P> LEE GRUENFELD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

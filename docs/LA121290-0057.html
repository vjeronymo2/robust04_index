			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GERHARD SAMUEL LEADS MONDAY EVENING CONCERT  </P> <P> The great sorrow of contemporary music is not a lack of premieres, but the  inconsistent performance histories afterwards. New music specialists,  struggling to keep abreast of current production, can seldom afford the luxury  of looking back, and nobody else seems to care.  </P> <P> Which leaves works such as Henze's "Kammermusik 1958" all dressed up in robes  of acclaim with nowhere to go. Rare performances of it tend to settle in memory  with the weight of myth.  </P> <P> The performance on the latest Monday Evening Concert, at Bing Theater of the  Los Angeles County Museum of Art, may not be the stuff of legend but it amply  demonstrated the power and grace, the fertile imagination and sensitive  text-setting of the piece. A big, formally clear song cycle with revelatory  instrumental interludes, "Kammermusik 1958" is both immediately ingratiating  and stubbornly persistent in the ear.  </P> <P> Gerhard Samuel, a familiar champion of contemporary music here since his days  as associate conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the early 1970s, led  an octet of local virtuosos in a deft, occasionally blocky account that found  its greatest inspiration at the most crucial point, the aching bittersweet  benediction of the Adagio epilogue.  </P> <P> Tenor Randall Gremillion and guitarist David Tanenbaum were the protagonists,  in music written for Peter Pears and Julian Bream. Gremillion did not sound in  the best of voice, but he used his resources with intelligence, articulating  the often convolute lines cleanly and let the febrile music carry Holderlin's  allusive text naturally, lucid on the surface but with dark manias never far  away.  </P> <P> Tanenbaum is well-practiced in Henze's music, and he supported Gremillion with  flexible point. He played the three Tientos with fluent drive and expressive  nuance, firmly projected.  </P> <P> The pertinent, well-chosen program also featured a world premiere, Samuel's  "Outcries and Consolations" for 13 players. It reflects much of the  instrumental language and color of Henze, in a vivid, fragmented collection of  thematic parodies. It shares some of the emotional subtexts of "Kammermusik,"  in the nervous outcries and shimmering consolations.  </P> <P> The two "Kammermusik" soloists also had independent vehicles. Tanenbaum,  however, proved virtually inaudible in the austere Sonata of Peter Maxwell  Davies, even when not overwhelmed by the astonishing audience noise level in  the hall.  </P> <P> Gremillion acted skillfully in the "Melodrama" from Berio's iconoclastic  "Opera." He spoke with neurotic, stagy purpose and sang urgently in the  structurally rigorous, climatic absurdist monologue. Samuel and the MEC forces  backed him with accommodating flair.

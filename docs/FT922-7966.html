			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Export earnings help Amcoal advance 16.5% AMCOAL, the coal arm of Anglo American, the South African conglomerate, has recorded a 16.5 per cent rise in attributable profits to R321.1m (Dollars 112.66m) in the year to March, despite lower sales volume. Profits were lifted by higher earnings from exports and from sales to Escom, the national power utility. Group turnover rose by 4.2 per cent to R1.89bn. However, volume sales of coal and coke fell to 42.4m tonnes, a decrease of 1.1m tonnes from 1991. Sales to Eskom by volume were down by 1.1m tonnes at 29.9m tonnes, while export tonnage increased by 3 per cent to 10.3m tonnes. Earnings from collieries supplying Eskom rose due to increased investment. Higher tonnages helped raise export earnings, which were also assisted by slightly higher dollar prices and a marginally weaker exchange rate. Colliery working costs rose by 6 per cent, well below the inflation rate of 15 per cent. Mr David Rankin, chairman, said lower sales to Eskom and to the industrial and metallurgical sectors reflected the weak state of the economy. Mr Rankin said that South African coal exporters, with Amcoal the largest, had sold a total of 48.5m tonnes in 1991, 1.1m tonnes less than in 1990. Coal exports remain South Africa's largest foreign exchange earner after gold. He forecast lower earnings for the year because of soft domestic and international markets, lower interest earnings and a less favourable tax position. Earnings per share were 16.3 per cent higher at 1,275 cents, and the dividend was lifted by 9.4 per cent to 465 cents.</p>

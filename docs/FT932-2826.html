			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / EC subsidy urged for Swan Hunter EUROPEAN Community officials in Brussels were urged yesterdayto make Swan Hunter eligible for Shipbuilding Intervention Fund subsidy. The Tyneside shipbuilder, which is in receivership, does not qualify for the 9 per cent subsidy for merchant shipbuilding orders because it has been classified since its 1986 privatisation as a warship yard. Despite this it has since built two non-naval vessels. Mr John Foster, North Tyneside council's executive director, yesterday presented EC competition directorate officials with a report by his council. This argues that Swan Hunter could be redesignated a 'mixed' yard, qualifying for the subsidy, without establishing any precedent. Swan Hunter, the report says, is the only EC shipyard building both naval and merchant ships without access to state aid. 'As such, it is operating in exceptional circumstances,' it says. The subsidy alone would not save the company, but could assist its recovery. The council hopes its report will strengthen the government's request to the EC to reconsider UK warship yards' exemption from the subsidy.</p>

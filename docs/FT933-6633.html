			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Finnish insurer improves POHJOLA, the Finnish insurance group, expects an improved 1993 result after it swung to a first-half operating profit of FM6m (Dollars 1.03m) from a FM105m loss in the same 1992 period, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The group saw investment income rise by FM300m to FM534m, helped by the strong surge in share prices on the Helsinki stock exchange. This compensated for a worse underwriting performance, which swung to a FM104m deficit from a FM79m profit, after losses from credit insurance, domestic reinsurance and foreign insurance. Premium income fell 4 per cent to FM2.1bn, largely because of the impact of the Finnish recession on domestic premiums which were 5 per cent lower at FM1.8bn. Rising share prices lifted the group's solvency capital at June 30 to FM4.4bn, from FM3.7bn at the end of 1992.</p>

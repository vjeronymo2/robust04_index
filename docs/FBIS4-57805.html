			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 23 May (EFE) -- Today, Genaro Arriagada,  minister secretary general of the Presidency, revealed here the  government does not believe it is the right moment to change the  regulations by which the commanders in chief of the Armed Forces  and Carabineros, who will remain in their post until 1997,  cannot be replaced.    The minister said that "although everyone is aware that we  believe the commanders in chief should be appointed by the  president of the Republic, the government has now proposed to  the country what we call an `explicit defense' policy."    Arriagada explained that the policy "does not emphasize the  relationship between civilians and military, but rather issues  pertaining to national defense."    The fact that the high military commands cannot be replaced  is established in the 1980 Constitution, which was drafted under  the military regime headed by General Augusto Pinochet.    The minister admitted that the political parties of the  governing coalition lack the support in the Senate, as well as  in the Chamber of Deputies, to approve the constitutional reform  announced in President Eduardo Frei's government program when he  was elected in December.    Minister Arriagada was asked about the subject in view of  the  fact that President Frei did not mention it in his 21 May speech  to Congress, in which he announced the tasks his government will  undertake next.</p>

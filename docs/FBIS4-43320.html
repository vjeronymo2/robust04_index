			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini by Marco </F> Cecchini on 9 June; place not given: "No Increase in Fiscal  Pressure"]    [Text] Bonn -- Are you pleased? "Very pleased." The  minister made a fist: The package introduced Wednesday [8 June]  is a combination of "strong" measures, he said, which will have  no repercussions on our financial situation, "for the simple  reason that it is self-financing."    In other words, budgetary constraints "will be honored."  True, there is a more general tendency for revenue to decrease,  "because the effect of the various once only measures adopted by  [former Prime Ministers] Ciampi and Amato is coming to an end."    But the government remains committed to "not altering  overall  fiscal pressure." He also talked about the response of the  markets, Italy, the European Monetary Union, the lira,  inflation, and coming moves on the public finance front expected  at the end of the month.    Lamberto Dini covered the whole field, the day after the  Berlusconi's first real test in finance and employment policy.  The treasury minister reaffirmed his commitment to stringency,  having been general manager of the Bank of Italy for 15 years.    He clearly reaffirmed his utmost attention to the problem of  the debt, to inflation, and to Europe, without losing sight of  the objective of increasing the levels of growth and employment.    Yesterday he met in Bonn with Theo Waigel, his counterpart  at  the German Finance Ministry. Italy's "innovations" were also  broached at the meeting, which was described as "extremely  cordial."    In this regard, Waigel displayed "the utmost interest, the  utmost understanding, and no anxiety" with regard to the  government headed by Silvio Berlusconi, the treasury minister  revealed, while describing as "awesome but inevitable" the new  government's program centered "on the deregulation of labor,  privatization, and the reform of public finance." CORRIERE  spoke to Dini after the meeting.    [Cecchini] Minister, are you really sure that the package  will have the desired effect?    [Dini] This is both our hope and our belief.    [Cecchini] Are you really sure that it will not all  ultimately place yet another burden on the state budget?    [Dini] Look, if the package does work -- and it will work --  the resulting higher growth and employment levels will generate  the necessary resources to compensate for the initial reduction  in revenue. If it does not work, there will be no reduction in  revenue. From the budgetary viewpoint, the effect will in any  case be neutral.    [Cecchini] But the markets did not respond with excitement  to  its announcement: The lira and government stock remained  static, but the stock market actually weakened.    [Dini] It must be realized that we are in an era of  globalization. The markets behave according to mainly external  stimuli. What has happened recently? What has happened is that  after months of falling interest rates, those active in the  economy have realized that the scope for further reductions is  becoming exhausted: Especially in the debentures field, capital  is shifting to areas where there are greater opportunities for  profits -- the United States, for instance.    [Cecchini] You inherited an unbalanced public finance  situation from the Ciampi government. Taking account of the  recession, there is a gap of at least 5 trillion lire in the  1994 budget. Do you intend to bridge it by means of a possible  additional package?    [Dini] We will have to see; I cannot rule it out as a matter  of principle. Now we must draw up the new three-year economic  and financial planning document, which we expect to do by the  end of the month, but we will have to examine the figures.  There is a fall in revenue at present, because the effects of  the once-only measures adopted by Amato and Ciampi are coming to  an end, and we want to keep overall fiscal pressure unaltered.  We could take action on tax rates, but the tax pressure must  remain the same. We will see whether we can bring forward  measures connected with the 1995 Finance Bill, in which case  that could bridge the 1994 budget gap. But the issue is still  open.    [Cecchini] Meanwhile, the European Commission is waiting to  hear whether we will use the third installment of the Community  loan.    [Dini] This too depends on other factors. The European  loan was negotiated in connection with Amato's three-year  document in 1992 and is therefore subject to observance of that  plan. Since then, however, the scenario has completely changed.  There has been a recession in Europe and a recession in Italy.  Amato's plan envisaged an initial advance of 100 trillion lire,  no less, and was based on entirely unrealistic macroeconomic  hypotheses of expansion. Now we must draw up a new plan and see  how close we can get to the objectives agreed with Brussels at  that time. After that we will present it to the Commission; if  it is acceptable, we will use the third installment;  otherwise....    [Cecchini] Otherwise, what?    [Dini] We will not use it.    [Cecchini] You met with Waigel. Did he grant his approval of  your economic program?    [Dini] It is not a matter of granting approval; we do not  grant our approval to the Germans, and they do not grant us  theirs. Waigel showed great interest in and appreciation of our  plans, because these ideas move in the direction of European  convergence and because, both with regard to the issue of  employment and with regard to finance, they are in line with the  pointers issued by all the international bodies, from G-7 to the  IMF.    [Cecchini] With a lira exchange rate of 970 against the  German mark, did you receive any pressure to rejoin the European  Monetary System or for a revaluation?    [Dini] None.    [Cecchini] One last question: Italy has for some time been  underrepresented in the international bodies; we lost over the  issues of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development  [EBRD] and the European bank for the East, and now the issue of  nominations to the European Commission is about to arise and we  await a decision on the World Trade Organization. What does the  government intend to do?    [Dini] There has been a great deal of confusion about the  EBRD: We did not lose; the issue of the deputy presidency will  be discussed again in 1995. For the World Trade Organization,  we have our sights set on Renato Ruggiero. As for the rest, our  policy is to do our utmost to ensure that the country is  adequately represented.</p>

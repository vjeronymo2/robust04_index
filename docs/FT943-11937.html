			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Russia agrees troops pullout from Estonia The presidents of Russia and Estonia yesterday signed an agreement under which the remaining 2,000 Russian troops in Estonia will leave by August 31  -marking the last and hardest won of such agreements between Russia and the three former Soviet republics in the Baltics. If adhered to, it will mean that by the end of the summer all Russian divisions will have been pulled back from the three countries which they have occupied, in Soviet or Russian form, for 50 years. They have already left Lithuania and are leaving Latvia - though the Baltfax news agency reported yesterday that Mr Sergey Zotov, the Russian negotiator, had expressed 'serious concern' that the Latvian parliament had not ratified the pullout agreement. The negotiation process - especially in the case of Estonia, the smallest of the three republics - has been protracted, bad-tempered and mutually recriminatory, with the main western states all putting pressure on Russia to observe the August 31 date. Moscow had put this in doubt because of fears that the rights of the Russian speakers in the Baltic states were being violated. A brief statement to the official news agency Tass said that 'the presidents of Russia and Estonia signed an agreement today that the rights of the Russian military pensioners would be respected equally to the rights of Estonian citizens. They also signed an agreement in accordance with which Russian troops are withdrawn from Estonia before August 31'. Russia's president Boris Yeltsin, emerging after six hours of talks with his counterpart, President Lennart Meri - with whom he has never found any rapport - commented that the negotiations were 'pretty hard'. The formula appears to mean that the Estonian side will pay pensions and offer the rights of citizenship to those among 10,000 Russian officers who have reached retirement age - but not to those among them in their thirties and forties whom the Estonians believe are present or former secret policemen who have been actively engaged in espionage and other anti-state activities. The agreement puts to one side two other Estonian demands - for a return of two slices of Russian territory which had been part of the pre-war Estonian Republic, and for a statement of regret on the Russian side for the Soviet occupation of Estonia and the repression of the population after the war. Neither of these - especially, as Estonian officials admit privately, the first - are likely to be conceded and may be shelved quietly if relations settle down. Some 500,000 Russian speakers still live in Estonia; 40,000 have applied to leave, 60,000 have applied for Estonian citizenship and the majority are undecided. Estonia's economy is in by far the healthiest shape of any of the 15 former Soviet states and this is likely to persuade many of the Russian speakers to learn enough Estonian to pass the language test necessary to apply to transfer their allegiance from Russia to Estonia.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillmann: "Economic Forecasts From the </F> Firth--The Institute for World Economics in Kiel"]    [Text] Bonn's economic political leaders depend on the  analyses and forecasts of the research institutes. Especially in  times rife with economic problems the "council of researchers"  gains added importance. The Institute of World Economics (IfW)  in Kiel is Germany's oldest economic research institute and  probably the best known internationally.    Whenever Horst Siebert cannot think of anything new he looks  out the window. The view is stimulating indeed: from the second  floor of the former Imperial Yacht Club one can see large  tankers and small yachts go by on Kiel's Foerde. Since April  1989 Siebert, an economics professor, has headed the Kiel  Institute of World Economics, the oldest economic research  institute in Germany and perhaps the best known internationally.    In the almost five years since Siebert took over from his  predecessor, Herbert Giersch, the annual reports have been  getting more voluminous and the number of researchers has  increased from 75 to 92. Siebert himself, who both heads the IfW  and holds a professorship of economics at Kiel University, is  viewed as one of the first social scientists to treat economic  and enviromental issues as a unit. In addition, numerous  publications of his have been devoted to international economic  relations and foreign trade.    In the past four years the IfW has shifted the focus of its  research on the economic side of German unification as well as  on the question of how planned economies can be turned into  market economies and be integrated into the world market. From  time to time as many as 20 researchers in different IfW  departments are working on various aspects of this historic  transformation, Siebert says.    The media accused him in this connection of "muscling in  everywhere." But that does not faze the 55-year-old professor  who has also been a member of the council of experts for the  assessment of overall economic development since 1991. Of course  "we jumped on this issue," says Siebert, who has written a book  entitled Das Wagnis der Einheit--Eine  wirtschaftspolitische Therapie [The Risk of Unification--An  Economic Policy Therapy]. Scientists have to be enthusiasts  because "one simply does not move without an impetus." What is  more, "we are in the midst of competition and look upon new  issues as challenges."    The public sector is the IfW's principal client. The  Economics Ministry in Bonn alone commissioned research studies  in 1993 worth 1.287 million German marks (DM). Some of these  studies will occupy the researchers until 1995.    In addition to collaborating on joint research projects  which  six different institutions prepare each spring and fall the IfW  is working on the "Main Report Within the Framework of Reporting  on Structure" which the institutes submit in annual rotation.    At the end of 1993, the IfW produced the ninth report on  "Overall Economic and Managerial Progress in Adaptation in  Eastern Germany" in collaboration with the German Institute for  Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin and the Institute for Economic  Research in Halle (IWH), the 1992 successor to the East Berlin  Institute for Applied Economic Research. From the middle of 1993  to the middle of 1995 these reports will cost the economics  minister DM1.535 million. DM625,200 of the total will go to the  IfW, DM645,000 to the DIW, and DM264,700 to the IWH.    It was not the institutes themselves, Siebert says, that  wanted to collaborate but the express wish of the Economics  Ministry. The "basic idea, however, was that they should compete  with one another," he adds.    Aside from the government, the institute receives major  funding from foundations, e.g. from the Bertelsmann Foundation  which has commissioned a multiyear study on "the future outlook  for the social market economy." As part of the study the  institute's researchers are investigating issues such as ethics  and the marketplace, international rules on competition,  management, and motivation as well as the connections between  the ecology and the economics of the marketplace.    "The project hopes to determine how the market economy will  legitimize itself in the future in view of the fact that the  collapse of the socialist planned economies has robbed it of its  counterpart," Siebert says. The aim is to find out what  incentives will be required in the future in order to maintain  the efficiency of the market economy in the absence of  competition with the planned economy model.    The Volkswagen Foundation has commissioned a study of  eastern  Central Europe and the Baltic region. The EU commission has also  become one of the institute's major clients. This part of the  institute's business can still be expanded, Siebert says. The  IfW's well-known critical stand on protectionist trends and a  rapid monetary integration of the EU places more or less natural  limits on expanded cooperation with Brussels, he adds.    In 1993, the studies commissioned by the Economics Ministry,  land ministries, foundations, and the EU have earned the IfW  DM4.12 million. Given a total budget of DM29.7 million, this  adds up to a third-client quotient of 14 percent. Compared to  other institutes--particularly to the Ifo Institute for Economic  Research in Munich--this is a very small ratio.    Basic subsidies from the Economics Ministry last year  amounted to DM11.377 million. The institute received the same  amount from the land government of Schleswig-Holstein.    The IfW spends a good two-fifths of its budget on the  Central  Library of Economics--an added expense but more than worth it  from the standpoint of prestige. The IfW library numbering  almost 2.3 volumes and occupying about 25 miles of shelf space  is the most important economics library in Germany. It also  contains Econis, a 500,000-title database on economics  literature.    The IfW grew out of the political science seminar of Kiel  University. In 1914, Prof Bernhard Harms founded the IfW under  the then-name of "Koenigliches Institut fuer Seeverkehr und  Weltwirtschaft" [Royal Institute for Maritime Affairs and World  Economy]. In the twenties, the inflation-plagued citizens of  Kiel referred to it merely as "sehr verkehrte Weltwirtschaft"  [the "upside-down world economy" institute].    Today, the IfW has a staff of 341, of whom 120 work in the  institute's five research departments: growth and structural  policy, resource economics, regional and transportation  economics, developing countries and world economy, economic  trends. The institute's regular publications include KIELER  STUDIEN [KIEL STUDIES], WELTWIRTSCHAFTLICHES ARCHIV [ARCHIVES OF  WORLD ECONOMY], DIE WELTWIRTSCHAFT [WORLD ECONOMY], and KIELER  DISKUSSIONSBEITRAEGE [KIEL DISCUSSION PAPERS].    For the past 10 years the institute has been offering a  one-year advanced study program in international economic policy  research for young economists. The faculty is made up primarily  of practical economists of international standing. The entire  program is conducted in English. Some of the graduates stay on  at the IfW, Siebert says. "But the World Bank grabs them up so  fast and we can't compete with it."</p>

A smooth transition from the old tax system to the new  system  has been achieved during the past three months, according to Liu  Zhongli Finance Minister and the Director of the State Taxation  Bureau.    Liu noted the massive tax reform has not triggered major  price fluctuations as many people had worried.    Moreover, it didn't have any unfavorable impact on the  country's industrial production and market operations.    During the first two months of the year, China's industrial  production reported a 18.16 per cent growth compared with the  same period last year. Total retail sales volume increased 23  per cent during the same period, he said.    Moreover, by the end of February, the country's revenue --  excluding domestic and overseas loans -- registered a 32.1 per  cent increase compared with the same period last year.    Industrial and commercial tax revenue increased 32.2 per  cent  from the corresponding period in 1993, Liu said.    In addition, he noted most enterprises reacted calmly to the  changes on their tax burden under the new system.    Foreign investors' worries about a heavier tax burden were  also dispelled after they found their taxes didn't increase  under the new tax system, Liu said.    And no provinces or cities reported financial problems as a  result of the new tax-sharing system which restructured tax  revenues between the central and local governments.    Liu said tax reform has reinforced the country's confidence.    However, he also acknowledged some minor problems have  cropped up in recent months.    Some enterprises, especially grassroots units, remain  ignorant about the functions of the new tax code.    The minister attributed this to inadequate publicity and  instruction about tax reforms.    Also, a small number of enterprises have complained the new  system adds to their tax burden.    Actually, Liu said, only 25 percent of the country's  enterprises have had to pay more taxes. Half of these  enterprises have had just a four per cent rise in taxes.    Liu said minor problems are inevitable during such a massive  reform. He said the government expects to overcome these  difficulties through progressive efforts.    "We must persist in this reform which is of vital importance  to the establishment of modern enterprise management mechanism  and reforms in the financial, foreign exchange and investment  systems," he pledged.    Liu said this year's task is to set up the basic framework  for a tax system which can suit the needs of the socialist  market economy.    To reach that goal, great efforts will be paid to ensure a  successful issuance of this year's treasury bonds, he stressed.    Meanwhile, the printing technique of value-added tax  invoices  will also be improved to prevent fake receipts, the minister  added.</p>

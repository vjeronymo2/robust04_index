Commenting on the Palestinian-Israeli talks, al-Baz said  obviously the climate in which the talks are conducted has  improved and become positive and that agreement between the two  sides is likely in the next few weeks.    For his part, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian side  in the Taba talks, said after his meeting today with Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa and Dr. Usamah al-Baz that important talks to  overcome obstacles delaying an agreement on Gaza and Jericho,  especially differences on the crossings and Jericho, were held  after President 'Arafat's visit to Oslo and his meeting with the  Israeli foreign minister.    Sha'th added that President 'Arafat briefed President  Mubarak  on developments in Oslo and discussed future steps with him.  Sha'th said that President Mubarak invited the Palestinian  delegation to a working breakfast with President 'Arafat.  Presidents Mubarak and 'Arafat then asked the Palestinian  delegation to meet with 'Amr Musa and Dr. al-Baz to continue  discussion of a plan for a joint move to resolve the problems.    Sha'th affirmed that Egypt is exerting efforts, as it has  been since the start of the negotiations, to resolve outstanding  problems.    The head of the Palestinian side on the Gaza-Jericho  Committee said that the latest talks in Taba saw a serious,  objective attempt to break the deadlock. He added: We  submitted a paper in Taba that was the subject of discussion in  Oslo, and thus, the attempt to break the deadlock began in Taba  and continued in Oslo and then in Cairo.    Sha'th said he will return to Taba after tomorrow, Tuesday,  to resume negotiations with General Shahaq, who will be briefed  by then on Shim'on Peres' view of the talks that were held with  'Arafat in Oslo. He added that talks on the civilian authority  will be resumed in Taba tomorrow.    He said that President 'Arafat will meet Shim'on Peres in  Davos, Switzerland, on Sunday [30 January] and expressed his  belief that the Davos meeting will help lead to an agreement  soon. Sha'th added that no time has yet been fixed for a  meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin.</p>

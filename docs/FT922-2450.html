			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cost controls help LPA hold profits at Pounds 0.31m Tight cost controls enabled LPA Industries, the USM-quoted industrial electrical connectors and accessories group, to hold pre-tax profits at Pounds 310,000 for the six months to March 31. Turnover was down 7.7 per cent at Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 3.44m) and operating profits slipped by 2.3 per cent to Pounds 335,000. Mr Michael Rusch, chief executive, said that strict control on borrowings - the company is negligibly geared - pressure on debtors and increasing concentration on exports all helped counteract the 'severe trading conditions' and produce a 'most satisfactory' result. Mr Rusch said that customers' big projects were still few and far between, especially in railway engineering. The interim dividend is held at 1.65p and is payable from earnings of 2.41p (2.31p) per share.</p>

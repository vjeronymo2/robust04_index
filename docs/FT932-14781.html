			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Lippo's HK arm climbs 1,202% LIPPO Ltd, the listed holding company of Indonesian tycoon Mr Mochtar Riady's Hong Kong empire, announced a 1,202 per cent increase in net profits to HKDollars 211.02m (USDollars 27.29m) in 1992, up from HKDollars 16.2m in 1991. During the year, the group underwent heavy restructuring. It hived off the Hong Kong Chinese Bank as a separate listing, and purchased controlling stakes in four other Hong Kong-listed companies, Hong Kong China, Asia Securities, Morning Star and Hong Kong Building and Loan. Expansion was funded primarily through the issue of new shares. Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong group was issued with HKDollars 300m in convertible loan stock during the year. Further equity or convertible placements were made to the Riady family, to China Resources, the mainland group, and to outside investors.</p>

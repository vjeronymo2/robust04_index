			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'NOW THAT RED IS DEAD'  </P> <P> My question to Thomas Powers and the "red is dead" tradition ("What Next Now  That Red Is Dead?" Opinion, April 23) is why does a dead movement have to die  so many deaths? According to the Powers' heritage of journalistic analysis,  socialism died with either the Paris Commune, Karl Marx, the Second  International, Lenin's New Economic Policy, Stalinist dictatorship,  intellectual disillusion in the West, "the end of ideology" theory, or now,  Mikhail Gorbachev's democratic reforms. Take your pick. There's abundant  precedent for all.  </P> <P> But then the Powers' tradition has never been about foreign events; it's been  about popular attitudes at home. Powers even makes the point clear in a  revealing sign-off statement. Like it or not, his obituary on socialism  concludes, the American people have no alternative to the continued reign of  Reagan-Thatcherism.  </P> <P> So there it is, the article's real message. An Exxon dumps all over land, sea,  and air, then thumbs its nose in true Reaganesque fashion. The Powers' message  to an agonized American public -- don't even think expropriation, because  expropriation equals dead socialism. Public monies continue to buy out private  bank failures. The Powers' message to a confused American public -- don't even  think you've purchased something, because public ownership equals dead  socialism. The dwindling American voter stands before a paralyzed electoral  system and sees one party where there's supposed to be two. Same message, same  result.  </P> <P> Really, Thomas Powers has earned a bonus from his employers for telling the  American people they have no alternative to corporate rip-off as usual. He's  done his job for them in true workman-like fashion. There's a pithy saying  somewhere in Marx for the kind of service Powers and his historical brethren  provide. But I think we get the idea anyway.  </P> <P> F.D. DOEPKE  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

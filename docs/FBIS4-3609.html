			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, a senior  Chinese leader, told Cheng Yu Tung, chairman of the board of  directors of the Hong Kong New World Development Co. Ltd, that  he hopes that Mr. Cheng would more actively participate in  governmental and political affairs and in making contacts with  overseas people.    Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made this  remark today while meeting Cheng, who came here to attend the  second session of the 7th national conference of the All-China  Federation of Industry and Commerce.    The chairman, also a member of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's Central  Committee, reaffirmed that it remains a leading policy that an  economy of public ownership co-exists with multiple sectors of  the economy with the former as the dominant part, which is an  important part of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics.    During the past few years, Cheng, also an advisor on Hong  Kong affairs, extended his concern and support to the All-China  Federation of Industry and Commerce, which is considered as a  representative of non-public economic sectors in China.    Cheng said that he will continue his efforts to contribute  to  China's economic construction and Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity.    Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the  CPPCC, also attended the meeting.</p>

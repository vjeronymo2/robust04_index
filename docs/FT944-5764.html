			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: Industrial output tops forecasts West German industrial output rose 1.6 per cent in October according to preliminary, seasonally adjusted data. The renewed advance took year-on-year growth to 5.1 per cent, above many economists' forecasts. According to latest predictions from the authoritative Ifo institute, industrial production in the region will grow by 5 per cent next year. A new study predicts lively recovery after 4 per cent output growth this year. Machinery-makers should see output rise 9 per cent after 3 per cent this year as domestic demand picks up to complement export sales which have led the recovery. Passenger car output is forecast to rise 7 per cent after 8 per cent this year. Production of commercial vehicles, up 6 per cent this year, is expected to expand 12 per cent in 1995. Denmark's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 11.4 per cent in October from 11.7 per cent in September and from 12.4 per cent in October last year. Norwegian unemployment fell to 4.4 per cent in November from 4.5 per cent in October and 4.9 per cent a year ago.</p>

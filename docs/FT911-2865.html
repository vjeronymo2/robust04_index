			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Provisions cut NHL by 35% PRE-TAX profits at National Home Loans, the mortgage lender and financial services group, fell by 35 per cent in the six months to March 31, after the group was forced to make heavy provisions against bad debts. Taxable profits for the period were Pounds 10.1m, down from Pounds 15.6m in the same period a year earlier. Mr John Darby, chairman, said the group had been hit by the most difficult housing market for 50 years, but he was confident that the downturn in profitability would be only temporary as the underlying performance of the group was more than satisfactory. Mr Darby disclosed that the group had been the subject of a fraud which, he said, was under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. This had caused a loss of Pounds 3.5m to the group, of which Pounds 2.3m, net of tax relief, was taken as an extraordinary item. The loss related to lending through the Castlegate Group, a second mortgage and consumer finance broker in Reading, which went into creditors' voluntary liquidation in December. Provisions for other bad debts, including mortgage arrears, rose from Pounds 800,000 a year ago to Pounds 16.3m. Mr Kevin Milner, chief executive, said that just under 1,000 homes had been repossessed by the group. Its mortgage book now stands at Pounds 1.7bn, down from Pounds 2bn at the end of last year. New lending in 1991 has risen to Pounds 500m, up from Pounds 450m in the same period of 1990. Most of the group's subsidiaries were said to be performing satisfactorily, though the group's leasing subsidiary made a loss. Interest receivable was Pounds 178.9m (Pounds 184.6m) while interest payable was Pounds 153.2m (Pounds 162.9m). Total operating income was Pounds 44.5m, up from Pounds 30.6m, while operating expenses rose to Pounds 18.1m from Pounds 14.2m. Earnings per share fell from 7.4p a year ago to 3.4p, but the interim dividend is being maintained unchanged at 3.75p. COMMENT A year ago NHL looked as if it had found a way to come almost unscathed through the depression in the housing market. The jump in its level of provisioning since then suggests that it was unduly complacent and is now paying the price. Nonetheless, there are some signs of strength in its latest set of figures. Income is healthily up. Mortgage arrears are said to have peaked, while margins have widened. On this form, the group seems on course for profits of around Pounds 20m by the year end, and a maintained dividend. But as with all mortgage lenders this will depend on how quickly the mortgage market revives. Meanwhile, its performance has a distinctly fragile appearance, which is not helped by greater reticence than in the past about supplying details of how its subsidiaries are faring.</p>

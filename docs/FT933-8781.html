			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rutland Trust develops thirst for soft drinks RUTLAND TRUST is enlarging its business services portfolio with the strategically surprising acquisition of Ben Shaws, a soft drinks maker based in West Yorkshire. The initial consideration is Pounds 5.69m giving Rutland an 84 per cent interest in a newly formed subsidiary, Orderport, with the senior management team of Ben Shaws holding the balance. Rutland is paying Pounds 2.84m in cash, Pounds 2.45m in loan notes and Pounds 400,000 in shares. Further consideration will become payable in 1995, depending on profits before tax. Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, said: 'This is not the first time we have made substantial investments in a field outside pure financial services.' Capital Industries, Rutland's separately quoted associate, last year bought Samuel Jones, a manufacturer of laminated paper. Mr Langdon said: 'Where we can enhance our shareholder value by using the skills we have at Rutland then we will invest.' Mr Langdon and another Rutland director, Mr Christopher Dowling, have become respectively chairman and deputy chairman of Ben Shaws. Ben Shaws, which incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 546,000 on turnover of Pounds 66m in the year to end January 1993 and had net assets of Pounds 7m at that date, has been owned and run by the Shaw family since 1871.</p>

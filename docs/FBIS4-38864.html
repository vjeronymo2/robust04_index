			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General of Aviation Yevgeniy </F> Makoklyuyev, first deputy chief of the Air Defense Forces Main  Staff, by Aleksandr Ivanov; place and date not given: "Air  Defense Indicates Where to Capture Terrorists. The Press Has  Never Written About the Role of the Air Defense Forces Men and  Equipment in Disarming Air Terrorists. Although Not a Single  Case of Clamping Down on Air Piracy Has Occurred Without Their  Participation"]    [Text] Every time such a situation occurs, a task force is  formed at the Air Defense Forces high command. Its leader,  Lieutenant General of Aviation Yevgeniy Makoklyuyev, first  deputy chief of the Air Defense Forces Main Staff, spoke to our  correspondent about how it works.    [Makoklyuyev] Let us recall last Friday.... The latest  terrorist act in the Mineralnyye Vody area. At 0900 an A-50  radar patrol airplane took off from the Privolzhskiy airfield.  It was faced with the task of reinforcing the radar  intelligence system in the North Caucasus region.    That was the moment when the air defense men and equipment  began their most vigorous actions to discover the exact route  taken by the helicopter containing the terrorists and the  hostages that had been taken, determine the landing site, and,  if need be, quickly send raiding parties into the area.    The alert forces located in the area of the criminals'  supposed flight were brought to Alert Condition One, an extra 10  radar subunits were involved, and mobile low-altitude platoons  were taken out to the position areas. I would observe that this  was done in a very short space of time. All the information  about the helicopter's flight was processed by an air defense  task force in Rostov headed by Lieutenant General Nikolay  Kurochkin and was then sent to the Air Defense Forces Central  Command Post. The information received was sent minute by  minute to the Ministry of Internal Affairs task forces in Rostov  and Mineralnyye Vody.    These measures were necessary because we understood  perfectly  well that the criminals, using minimum flight altitudes, the  mountainous locality, the weather conditions, and various  maneuvers, would try to shake off the raiding parties that were  following them in the air and then land and disappear undetected.    [Ivanov] That is exactly what terrorists did in the same  region at the end of December of last year when they took some  Rostov schoolchildren hostage.    [Makoklyuyev] Yes, they flew out of Mineralnyye Vody by  military helicopter at the lowest possible altitude. The  weather was terrible: There was fog, and a snowstorm was  blowing. In a word, the helicopters carrying the raiding party  lost view of the target. Who could have supposed that the  criminals would land twice on the route, trying to get their  bearings and, despite the visibility, which was practically  zero, find a place near Georgiyevsk where their accomplices were  evidently waiting for them. Having used up most of the fuel,  they decided to return to Mineralnyye Vody. And they only flew  out again after refueling the next morning....    At the same time, taking advantage of the poor visibility,  the pilots made a landing not five km west of the village of  Khasavyurt, as the terrorists were demanding, but about 10 km  north. Then they took off again, this time for Makhachkala.    Our A-50 tracked the target for two days, passing on full  information. It was practically only the air defense systems  that registered all the criminals' maneuvers in the air and gave  out precise details of where they landed, and they were were the  first to furnish the Dagestan Ministry of Security with the  information about the likely landing place, which made it  possible to blockade the area in advance and end the operation  successfully.    [Ivanov] But in the latest case the weather was favorable,  and the tracking helicopters did not get lost....    [Makoklyuyev] Nevertheless we had a lot of trouble with the  extremely short time frame. And it was not only the air defense  forces that had this trouble. There was every justification for  assuming that it was accomplices of the same criminals that had  gotten down to carrying out the plan that was disrupted in  December. As soon as the route was determined, the Ministry of  Internal Affairs task force bore in mind that the terrorists  might try to escape to Azerbaijan and beyond. Therefore, on the  instructions of Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov,  commander in chief of the Air Defense Forces, who was in charge  of all the air defense forces in this operation, we reported to  the commander of the Azerbaijani air defense. We agreed the  procedure for the helicopters to fly across their borders  together with the raiding party and our A-50 airplane, as well  as the actions that the alert forces should take against the  intruder.    But the criminals landed in Chechnya, just as they had six  months before. The air defense forces clearly determined the  landing location, accompanied the helicopter all the time, and  gave out the necessary information both to the Ministry of  Internal Affairs organs and to the raiding party.    Hundreds of specialists from the radiotechnical troops,  aviation, command posts, and the leadership of this branch of  service were employed in making sure that the operation to save  the people and disarm the criminals passed off successfully.</p>

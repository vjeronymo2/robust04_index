The 1993 Edition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Card Industry Directory: The Blue Book of the Credit and Debit Card Industry of the United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (Faulkner &amp; Gray) (hereinafter, ``the 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Card Industry Directory <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> '') reported that the merchant processing business ``has come to be dominated by firms not controlled by banks, a trend that concerns some executives in the banking community.'' (See Exh. A.) The most recently available figures show that non-banks have moved to the top of the credit card processing business, with 3 of the top 10 processors being institutions that are not affiliated with depository institutions. (See Exh. B, the 1994 Edition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Card Industry Directory: The Blue Book of the Credit and Debit Card Industry of the United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (Faulkner &amp; Gray) (hereinafter, ``the 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Card Industry Directory <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ''), ``Top 25 Merchant Acquirers'' list, showing NaBANCO ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1), Card Establishment Services ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3) and National Data Corp. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 7) among the top 10 processors, with the top 10 processors commanding more than 49% of the market.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same trend is apparent in the point-of-sale (``POS'') debit and ATM processing markets. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  While those processing markets have traditionally been dominated by financial institutions (with EPS, the owner of MAC, being the largest of the top 5 Electronic Funds Transfer (``EFT'') <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Processors, by a significant margin), in 1993, 2 non-financial institutions_Deluxe Data Systems and Electronic Data Systems_were included among the top 5 EFT Processors.

When the card is used in an ATM, the cardholder enters his personal identification number. The transaction is then authorized by the financial institution that issued the card, the cardholder receives the authorized amount of cash, and the depository account to which the card is tied is debited by that amount. When the card is used in a POS terminal for a debit transaction, the transaction likewise begins with entry of the cardholder's PIN and an on-line authorization of the transaction from the card-issuing financial institution. Once the transaction is approved, the customer receives the merchandise or services and, in many cases, cash back from the merchant (in rough analogy to paying for groceries with a check for more than the amount of the purchase). A hold is then immediately put on the customer's funds on deposit for subsequent payment to the merchant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EFT (or Electronic Funds Transfer) is the movement of funds from one source to another using electronic transmission over telecommunications networks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Like the market for processing services, the market for ownership of ATMs and other similar devices has expanded well beyond depository institutions. However, the judgment is somewhat ambiguous as to its application to ATMs owned by entities other than depository institutions. It should be clarified to provide that all ATMs, and not just ATMs owned by depository institutions, are included within its scope. Today, six non-depository institutions rank among the top 300 ATM owners, owning more than 3,000 terminals. (See Discussion,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , under Comment No. 1.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, and more significantly, the judgment fails to reach the overlapping and interchangeable POS debit market. (See Discussion,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , under Comment No. 2.) According to a survey published by Faulkner &amp; Gray in 1993, in the next 7 years significant growth is expected in the EFT market, which encompasses both ATM and POS. Until now, the growth in EFT has primarily been fueled by ATM growth. While ATM growth is expected to continue, it is projected that the most sizeable increases in the EFT market will come from debit POS. Many networks have predicted that POS alone will grow by more than 50% a year and, that by the year 2000, POS transactions will exceed ATM transactions. (See Exh. D, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Debit Card Directory <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , Chapter 9, Section 1.) If POS grows at such rates, the failure of the proposed judgment to include debit POS could render it less and less effectual as time progresses and the EFT market changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Technology: From Jurassic Park to Gatwick Airport - The clarity of computer-generated designs The graphics design technology that produced the animation in blockbuster films Jurassic Park and Batman is now being used to help to design 'environments' such as the interiors of buildings. British Rail's InterCity division got together with design consultants PSD Associates of Isleworth, Middlesex, to redesign the facade of the Gatwick Express station at the London airport's north terminal. The brief was simple: to make the entrance immediately noticeable. 'We wanted something with a bit of life, a bit of interest, a bit of sparkle,' explains Simon Brazier, InterCity's architectural business manager. Using a Silicon Graphics workstation and software from Alias, PSD designed a number of options for the new portals. The design company then met representatives from Intercity and Gatwick Airport, which owns the site, to decide on a design. At that point, says Steve Hughes, associate director at PSD, one of the big advantages of the system came into play. 'It was a hands-on meeting, where we could pull out different elements of the design. We gots lots of people round the table and they could 'buy in' to the final design.' The photographic quality of the computer-generated designs also helped, Hughes believes. 'Because it looks like a photo, not a drawing, everyone can understand the image. People look through sketches and they don't really believe them.' Brazier, too, was impressed with the photographic quality of the images. 'With drawings you don't get a real feel. With the photographic quality there is no doubt what you are going to get.' He also liked the short animation sequence, which manipulated the images to give the viewer the impression of walking through the portals of the new entrance. 'To be able to walk through while the design is still on the drawing board or computer is a wonderful facility. These options will be very valuable for other schemes.' These could include the interior design of buildings, station entrances or even trains. Brazier envisages being able to design a train interior and then walk through it as a passenger would. The software enables the designer to change the seating plan or even the colour of the fabric. At PSD the designers are looking ahead to further uses of the system, in particular where it can be used to speed up the design process. They are considering using videoconferencing links so that they can discuss their designs with international clients. As for the design of the new facade for the Gatwick Express station, in the distinctive Intercity claret colour, it has been put on hold while the airport authorities decide whether to go ahead. If not, says Brazier: 'I'll go back to PSD and get them to modify the sketches.'</p>

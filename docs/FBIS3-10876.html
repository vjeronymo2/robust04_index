Two people were injured, one of them by a bullet.  An Arena communique disclosed that one citizen was beaten,  while a young woman was shot. Both were taken to a San Salvador  hospital.    On Saturday, thousands of Arena supporters marched along the  streets of San Salvador to close the campaign. According to the  communique, some of the marchers were attacked by hooded men who  burned tires; threw bottles, stones, and water balloons at the  marchers; and later physically attacked Arena supporters.    On Saturday night, Arena publicly urged Ruben Zamora,  leftist  presidential candidate, and Jorge Shafik Handal, coordinator of  the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, to control their  supporters.    Meanwhile on Sunday, the Office of the Ombudsman for Human  Rights condemned the violent events, and, without blaming any  political party, said the human rights of those who were  demonstrating peacefully had been violated.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR CHEERY GATHERING, KEEP FAMILY BUSY, SHARING  </P> <P> Your cousin Bob has vowed that if Uncle Eddie shows up this year and tries to  sell him more life insurance, Eddie will never live to see New Year's.  </P> <P> Your nephew Joey (he calls himself Mangler) is taking karate and can't wait to  show everyone, Aunt Giselle is into the cooking sherry again, Mom and Dad have  turned the martyrdom dial up to high because they'd really planned to be in  Hawaii, your sister Moonbeam has become a vegetarian and is lecturing everyone  on the evils of turkey flesh, your wife's sister's twins have just poured brown  gravy into the VCR, your own children are afraid to come out from under the  bed, and the creamed corn just exploded.  </P> <P> The only silver lining you can find in all this is that Norman Rockwell didn't  live to see it.  </P> <P> Short of calling 911, how do you cope with the holiday family gathering that is  a cinch to be far quirkier than the warm, loving, tolerant, traditional evening  over at the Cratchits? What do you do when you're faced with the real world of  modern family peccadilloes, jealousies, rivalries, squeamishness, avoidance,  unfriendliness, nit-picking, discomfort and anxiety that sometimes go with the  season?  </P> <P> For starters, say Orange County psychologists, distract 'em.  </P> <P> "It's important to try to inject a little humor into the situation," said  Tustin psychologist Alan Liberman, a marriage, family and child counselor. "I  think anything that can be done that might be of a creative nature where you  can provide humor, or have more than one activity going at a time, would help.  The guests might bring white elephant gifts to exchange to warm things up, or  you might even produce a little newsletter to catch people up on what has  occurred during the year with different family members.  </P> <P> "You can assign people to tasks during the gathering, too. Make someone  responsible for games and activities, or for bringing different parts of the  meal. That way people feel a part of things and don't feel so isolated. And, it  takes the burden off the people giving the party."  </P> <P> Jody Dean, a psychologist with practices in Mission Viejo and Fullerton, said  activities such as movies or a visit to the park "will direct the attention  away from conflict and onto the movie, or the kids playing, onto something that  is pretty neutral and an undemanding situation. Sometimes adding a few people,  friends for instance, can actually enhance things in that those people will  give the guests something to focus on besides themselves."  </P> <P> It is that self-focus that often is the culprit when family gatherings get  tense, said Barbara Kreedman, a clinical psychologist with a practice in Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> "People have a problem with looking for approval during the holidays," she  said, "and one of the psychological issues that they're dealing with is their  need to separate themselves from the people that they're close to and at the  same time wanting love from those people. They're wanting to be who they are,  but they're looking for approval, too. They're looking for people who are like  them or who feel like them, and sometimes the family members cannot provide  that. There's what is called a narcissistic sameness that doesn't always exist  among family members. That's where injuries and disappointments take place."  </P> <P> The holiday season, Kreedman said, "increases the need for that narcissistic  sameness. You look to your family at this time of year, and there's a need for  family unity. Ideally, people have to realize that approval and validation  can't always be there. Coming to grips with the limitations found in other  family members will release the injury and depression that exists when people  aren't getting their needs met. That's going into adulthood."  </P> <P> It is possible, Liberman said, to defuse a family confrontation before it  begins.  </P> <P> "It's probably a good idea when you invite everybody to let them know in a  letter who is coming (to the party) so they can have a choice of whether to  come," he said. "If people know they're going to be going to a place and  someone is going to be there that they do not get along with, and certain  activities are going to be going on, they can participate in one activity while  the other person is doing something else. These gatherings are not the places  to work out bad-blood situations."  </P> <P> They also aren't the time to expect children to be on their best behavior.  Children can become confused by all the activity, and bewildered by the  behavior of adults.  </P> <P> "It's harder for children to look to themselves and say, 'Gee, Mom's cooking  all day and she's upset, but that has nothing to do with me. It would be  wonderful if adults could convey that idea to a child. But if the adults are  angry, children personalize that and sense that their parents have changed.  They say to themselves, 'What have I done? Am I bad today?' "  </P> <P> It's a mistake to expect resolutions to family conflicts during gatherings,  Dean said, even during the season of good will toward men.  </P> <P> "Especially around the holidays, when everyone's on edge, it's best that people  not have expectations that they'll have Hallmark-greeting-card family  gatherings," Dean said.  </P> <P> "Families don't work that way. Even though it's Christmas Day, it's possible  for it to turn out to be a pretty hellish afternoon. People shouldn't come into  one of these gatherings with an agenda on their minds. You're not going to  solve a 10-year-old problem with Mom and Dad."  </P></p>

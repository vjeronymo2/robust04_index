			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has made it a  prerequisite of his visiting New York that Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas accept the UN document of 21 March on the  confidence-building measures. Government spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis today said that if Kliridhis is asked to go to New  York, he will go with pleasure if he is told that Denktas has  accepted the 21 March UN document. Kasoulidhis said there is no  other reason for Kliridhis to go to New York.    Asked whether the government is informed about the meetings  that Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator  on the Cyprus issue, is holding in New York on the Cyprus issue,  the government spokesman described the situation as a waiting  period. He stressed that the government is not sitting back  doing nothing.    Asked to comment on press reports today on Butrus-Ghali's  upcoming report, Kasoulidhis said the Cypriot Government expects  that in his report to the UN Security Council, the UN secretary  general will attribute blame objectively for the lack of  progress in the procedure for the confidence-building measures.    Kasoulidhis said that any effort not to apportion blame,  justifying such a thing by saying that it would discourage the  Turkish side, threatens to discourage the Greek Cypriot side  tremendously.    The spokesman said that the UN secretary general's report  will be submitted as soon as Butrus-Ghali returns to New York on  14 May.</p>

Before Spring Festival, the cadres at various levels  should go to the grass roots -- particularly the enterprises and  households experiencing difficulties -- hold heart-to-heart  talks with the people, render service and express warmth to the  people, support the poor, do solid deeds for the people, and  help the people have a good festival.    From 4 to 7 January, accompanied by Sun Weiben, secretary of  the Heilongjiang Provincial CPC Committee; Shao Qihui, governor  of the provincial government; and Zhou Wenhua, chairman of the  provincial CPPCC committee, Li Ruihuan visited some state-owned  large enterprises, institutions of higher learning, and  scientific research institutes in the province to conduct  investigations and to solicit their opinions. He heard the work  report of the provincial party committee and fully affirmed the  provincial party committee and government's achievements in  guiding the broad masses of cadres and people to implement  conscientiously the guidelines of the 14th party congress and  the decision of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee, to tide over difficulties, to promote  economic development, and to safeguard social stability.    In regard to the current work, Li Ruihuan said: We should  notice that the national current situation in various aspects is  good. All localities are full of enthusiasm for engaging in  construction and making developments. A faster economic growth  rate has been maintained. The people's livelihood has  noticeably improved. Simultaneously, we should clearly notice  that some people still fail to improve rapidly their living  conditions due to various reasons and some people are even  confronted with some difficulties. We should always remember  these people. We hope that the speed of construction will be  faster and the scope of construction will be wider. In the  final analysis, we do this in order to improve the people's  livelihood. Therefore, in the course of construction, we should  consider the interests of the people and particularly ensure  that serious difficulties to the people's basic life do not  result.    Li Ruihuan said: It is certain that reform will bring about  benefits to the majority of the people. The reform measures  relating to the readjustment of the interests of the people  should thoroughly and cautiously be studied before  implementation, strictly adhere with the changes of the  situation after implementation, and be timely readjusted or  supplemented if necessary. We should be concerned about the  feelings of the people, conscientiously hear people's opinions,  and strive to help the masses overcome difficulties. This is  not only what the basic purpose of our communist party requires,  but also a demand for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and  opening up.    Li Ruihuan said: Spring Festival is also a juncture of the  two years. We have the responsibility to help the people who  have difficulties experience a good festival. The cadres at  various levels should be aware of the people with difficulties,  call on them, actively solicit their criticism and suggestions,  urge them express their difficulties -- even words they are not  pleased to hear, provide timely help, and try with every  possible means to help them solve some practical problems. We  should reduce other expenses and allocate necessary funds to  ensure their needs in this aspect.    Li Ruihuan also met with the comrades of the provincial and  Harbin city CPPCC committees and exchanged views on  strengthening the establishment of democratic politics and the  self-construction of the CPPCC.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (7): Last orders for the water of life SCOTCH MISSED: THE LOST DISTILLERIES OF SCOTLAND by Brian Townsend Neil Wilson Publishing Pounds 14.99 160 pages Whether it is coal mining, motor cycles or televisions, sentimentality about 'lost' industries is rather a British speciality. But when it comes to the uneconomic distilleries of Scotland, the pining becomes almost inconsolable. What a tragic loss, goes the cry, as a bottle of 64-year old Dallas Dhu is sold at auction for Pounds 4,400. Such hand-wringing is misplaced. It fails to take account of the unique conditions that led to a distillery's foundation and shaped its initial market. It also ignores the widespread failure of a hopelessly atomised industry to adapt to, and influence, changed consumer tastes. Brian Townsend is a devotee of the lost dram. His book is part history and part guide to the ruins. The 'water of life' probably came to Scotland from Ireland in the late 15th century, explaining in part peat-rich Islay's early pre-eminence. Family bothy distilleries remained ubiquitous north of the Highland line even after the Industrial Revolution, exploiting the special qualities of their location - whether peat, water, barley or all three. The North also stood out for its successful evasion of duty. This owed much to family ingenuity, but also to the localised nature of the market. Many a magistrate was struck with compassion when his importunate estate supplier stood before him. But ironically such parochialism does much to explain the demise of the smaller distilleries. Take, for example, their reaction to the 1820s reform of the excise system. It now became viable to distil on a larger scale, and such household names as Johnny Walker date to that time. But the smaller distilleries rarely combined. Not for the first time in British manufacturing, long-term thinking was at a premium in a long-term industry. Distilling in the 19th century offered better returns on investment than selling grain to mills, but quality varied between distillations and according to harvests. Continuity and reliability of supply were secured only by outside intervention. By blending malt with the less flavoursome, but more consistent, grain whisky increasingly produced in the larger distilleries, the new whisky merchants could ensure supplies to the lucrative distant markets, particularly London. Further growth came through exploiting the nascent glass bottling process which helped to reduce prices. The fact that expansion was largely the result of action by non-distillers is significant. The distillers were often woefully under-capitalised and their focus on local markets meant a large slice of the profits went to the merchants when, in the later 19th century, consumption increased among such groups as the brandy-deprived monied classes and Empire exiles. Townsend chronicles the almost yearly changes of ownership among the proliferating, but ultimately-doomed distilleries, as new owners sought unsuccessfully to cash in at the local level. When the boost in whisky consumption was ended by a combination of temperance, a big rise in duties courtesy of Lloyd George and war, the core weaknesses of the smaller distillers, particularly in the west of Scotland, were ruthlessly exposed. Depression and the organising mind of Distillers Company's chairman, William Ross, rationalised the industry and cut back the over-supply in the inter-war years. Once both domestic and export market conditions improved after 1950, a smaller, but more outward-looking industry developed, notably in Speyside. The fact that some of the most successful new operations are family-owned shows that past lessons have been learnt. Japanese inward investment has included distillery ownership, with tourist potential well exploited. Old habits die hard, however, and Townsend's affinity with his subject prompts him to echo the industry's plea for 'fairer' tax and tariff treatment. But British governments have a well-proven ability to raise revenue successfully from duties, while other countries seem set to ensure their own distilleries prosper, regardless of the Uruguay Round.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Venezuela relaxes bank rules in wake of Banco Latino collapse The Venezuelan government has moved to ease concerns that last week's failure of Banco Latino, the country's second-largest bank, could spark a widespread financial crisis. The administration yesterday began introducing less stringent rules covering reserve requirements in the banking system, and offered broad financial assistance to banks suffering from temporary liquidity problems. Some Venezuelan banks have had to cope with abnormally large withdrawals since Banco Latino was taken over by the government on January 16. Moreover, the bank's many subsidiary and affiliate financial institutions have suspended their operations. Latino's subsidiary bank in Florida declared bankruptcy on Thursday. Rumours about problems at domestic banks have increased in recent days, provoking nervous withdrawals at several financial institutions. Earlier this week the government announced that Banco Latino would re-open on January 28 to begin paying off depositors with small accounts. But it was far from clear if the bank would resume any other activities over the short term. President Ramon Velasquez, announcing the banking measures on Thursday night, said that Mr Julio Santodomingo, formerly an executive with Banco de Venezuela, would head a four-member government-appointed board to run Banco Latino. A group of presidents from eight big banks would also work with the government to implement the bank's rescue programme. The president also revealed that he had accepted the resignations of two key officials, the Superintendent of Banks, Mr Roger Urbina (who was appointed to take over Banco Latino only last Sunday), and the head of the government's deposit guarantee fund, Ms Esperanza Martino. The resignations came after business people demanded to know why the president waited until it was too late to take action on Banco Latino, since his government knew about its problems for some time. Stung by the criticism, Mr Velasquez said he had to rely on information provided by Mr Urbina and other government figures.</p>

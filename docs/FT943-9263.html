			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Waldegrave to argue for fish compensation Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, yesterday said that the government would consider compensating Cornish fishermen whose nets had been cut by their Spanish rivals. The agriculture minister said that the government would take up the issue of compensation for the fishermen with the Spanish government and that the door for interim compensation by the British government 'was not entirely closed'. Meeting Cornish fishing representatives, he stressed that the Royal Navy was present in the Bay of Biscay to protect British boats from the actions of Spanish fishermen. He said: 'I emphasised that the first duty of the navy and the government is to ensure that our fishermen are not driven from the fishing grounds by harassment or illegal action of any kind.' The Cornish fishermen had earlier complained about being harassed by British navy inspectors over the size of their drift nets. Spanish fishermen say that the British are using nets which are longer than the legal limit. Mr Paul Tyler, Liberal Democrat MP for Cornwall North, said Mr Waldegrave was in effect admitting that the system for enforcing the European Union rules on net size had not worked properly and that the fishermen had a justifiable concern. The navy has so far sent two British trawlers back to port for allegedly fishing with nets longer than the legal limit. Mr Waldegrave said yesterday that the government had decided not to take legal action against either of those boats and that one of them, the Charisma, had received a caution. Mr Waldegrave said he had tried hard to clear up 'misunderstandings' between the navy and trawlers over measuring nets. Fishermen will now have their nets measured on-shore before they set sail. They will then let them out at sea in the presence of navy and EU inspectors who will be briefed on the measurements. 'If the inspector knows what he's expecting to find, it will make it easier,' Mr Waldegrave said. He stressed that he would consider interim compensation although this would be an unprecedented and difficult action. 'It is the Spanish who should pay for illegal actions against our ships,' he said.</p>

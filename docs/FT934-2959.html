			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool With only one week to before the Christmas recess in the Australian selling season wool auction reports continue to indicate firm prices. The tendency if anything is slightly dearer, with the market indicator reaching 477cents, 9 cents higher than a week before. The Australian wool production forecast was revised upwards from 690m. kg to 717m. kg last week but the figure is still 12% lower than last season and much of the wool has already been sold. Some traders expect a degree of shortage in the second half starting in January.</p>

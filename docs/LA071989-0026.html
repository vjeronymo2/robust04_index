			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERY FLIGHT;  </P> <P> PLANE LANDS INVESTORS IN CONFUSION  </P> <P> The news literally fell out of the blue, landing on furniture company executive  John Blackwelder and his wife as they watched television on a warm summer's  evening in Charlotte, N.C.  </P> <P> A Washington lawyer named Thomas Root had been miraculously plucked from the  Atlantic Ocean, the newscast said, after a bizarre six-hour airplane flight in  which he slumped unconscious in his Cessna 210 while the automatic pilot  carried him toward what seemed certain death.  </P> <P> For the Blackwelders, Root's name rang a bell. Indeed, a letter from him was  lying on their armoire at that very moment -- a letter related to thousands of  dollars they had invested in applications for federal licenses for new FM radio  stations. Root was their lawyer in the deals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> About to Call  </P> <P> "I was just about to call that guy again," Blackwelder told his wife. What was  going on?  </P> <P> Why had Root's strange flight taken place -- what was he doing, what caused him  to lose consciousness, how did he survive the crash and how had he been wounded  in the abdomen by a gunshot? No one, except perhaps Root himself, could say for  sure.  </P> <P> What was going on with the Blackwelders' investments in radio station  applications, on the other hand, was in some ways a mystery only to the  Blackwelders and other unwary investors in cities and towns scattered across  the land.  </P> <P> In Washington, a city of insiders, the business about the radio stations had  been a subject of knowing glances for quite a while.  </P> <P> And the revelations that have followed Root's ill-fated flight appear to be a  classic illustration of the perils that await ordinary investors when they  venture into an esoteric field dominated by a relative handful of sophisticated  insiders. It is also a story of deregulation run amok.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Piled in Stacks  </P> <P> At the Federal Communications Commission, which controls radio station  licensing in the nation, applications for FM radio licenses filed by Root  together with a little-known Georgia company called Sonrise Management  Services, Inc., were piled in stacks. So numerous were they that they formed a  significant part of the 2,300-case backlog that developed during the FCC's  eight-year rush toward deregulation.  </P> <P> Sonrise was a company with problems. To insiders -- the communications lawyers,  federal regulators and others in the field -- Sonrise's success at finding  investors who would pour money into quests for licenses that almost never  materialized was a subject of derision.  </P> <P> Within the fraternity, Sonrise was known to be a company under investigation  for possible securities-law violations and for running what one formal FCC  legal opinion months ago termed a possible "scam on innocent investors."  </P> <P> To thousands of investors like the Blackwelders, on the other hand, investors  who have sunk more than $15 million into Sonrise-organized license application  efforts, the firm's troubling record was a secret, veiled behind a web of  evasions and a bureaucracy with little time to look out for the investors'  interests.  </P> <P> To the investors, Sonrise was a company that promised management with a  "Christian ethic." For some, it simply offered an opportunity for profits. For  others, Sonrise offered a special, more personal inducement: many of the  licenses it was avowedly seeking were to be used for religious broadcasting;  many who put money into Sonrise's projects saw them in part as an opportunity  to advance their faith via the airwaves.  </P> <P> And -- but for Tom Root's strange adventure -- all the investors might still  remain in the dark about the activities of Sonrise.  </P> <P> When Root's plane plunged into the Atlantic last Thursday near the Bahamian  island of Eleuthera, he had filed a flight plan for Rocky Mount, N.C., where he  was to participate in a legal proceeding involving one of the more than 160  Sonrise-related FM partnerships. As news of the crash spread, members of  Washington's tight-knit fraternity of communications specialists began to  wonder: Was this really an accident?  </P> <P> The questions became public the next day, when police in Hollywood, Fla., where  Root had been taken to the hospital, revealed that he had been shot. "It  appears to a self-inflicted gunshot wound," police spokesman David Steele said.  Root and his family have denied this adamantly ever since.  </P> <P> </P> <P> If Suicide, Why?  </P> <P> But the possibility raised another intriguing question: If it was a suicide  attempt, why?  </P> <P> Interviews with more than a score of communications lawyers, past colleagues of  Root's and current clients, together with an examination of hundreds of pages  of FCC documents have disclosed repeated difficulties in Root's law practice.  </P> <P> But even more, the evidence has raised disturbing questions about Sonrise,  Root's current chief source of business.  </P> <P> Over the last two years, Sonrise has been in the business of organizing groups  of investors to apply for radio licenses. At least 163 such applications have  been filed so far. Virtually all are now under scrutiny at the FCC. None of the  applications have yet been fully approved and the handful that have received  first-stage clearance by the FCC are now under renewed challenge.  </P> <P> To date, although some investors have succeeded in getting refunds, none seems  to have earned any return on investments that in some cases exceeded $150,000.  </P> <P> A senior FCC official, Administrative Law Judge Walter C. Miller, has labeled  the company an "application mill" and raised questions about whether its  applications for licenses were "shams." North Carolina securities regulators  have been investigating possible securities violations by the company in that  state, where many of its investors reside. And a Tennessee law firm,  representing a group of Georgia investors in Sonrise partnerships, accused the  firm -- in a complaint to Georgia consumer protection officials -- of  "apparently fraudulent and illegal actions" taken in inducing "unsophisticated  investors" to place money in its projects.  </P> <P> Sonrise officials declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this story.  A company receptionist said Tuesday that the firm would not comment beyond a  brief statement that it released Friday. In that statement, the company noted  that it "has never been found guilty of any securities-related violation or  wrongdoing, nor has any enforcement proceeding been instituted or charges  brought."  </P> <P> Root and his family members did not respond to a series of written questions  sent by telefax to him at the Florida hospital where he is recuperating.  </P> <P> Root began his work in communications law in the early 1980s. He was "a super,  super intelligent person," recalled his employer at the time, Edward M.  Johnson, a controversial Tennessee businessman and promoter. "Tom always knew  how to get what he wanted," Johnson said. "If he couldn't get it through the  front door, he'd get it through the back."  </P> <P> At the time Root entered the communications field, the Reagan Administration's  drive for deregulation -- along with changing technology -- was revolutionizing  the field. And one of the Reagan Administration's policy changes transformed  the landscape of radio licensing:  </P> <P> FCC rules had long given preference in handing out broadcast licenses to people  who live in the area to be served by a new station. But in 1981, the commission  decided that if a partnership applied for a license, only the residence of the  general partner would be considered. Limited partners -- people who put up  money but take no active role in management -- could live anywhere.  </P> <P> Then, in 1982, the Administration backed changes in communications law that  allowed applicants to pay unlimited sums to buy out competitors seeking  licenses. Such settlement payments quickly ballooned, often reaching into the  mid-six-figures, sometimes higher.  </P> <P> The combination of those two changes was dramatic.  </P> <P> Suddenly, a group of investors from any part of the country could find out  about a broadcast opening, form a partnership, find a local resident to serve  as the general partner -- preferably a woman or a member of a minority group or  a person with some broadcast experience to take advantage of preferences in FCC  policy -- and bid for a license. If they won, they would own a valuable  franchise.  </P> <P> Even if they didn't win -- even if their chances of winning were small -- they  often could count on other, more serious, applicants to pay large sums to get  rid of them.  </P> <P> And consultants, by putting together such partnerships and helping them through  the process, could make large profits.  </P> <P> That is Sonrise's business. In 1986, two men from Georgia, Ralph M. Savage and  Eugene B. White, and one from North Carolina, Charles D. McFall, along with  several partners incorporated Sonrise Management Services.  </P> <P> McFall, like several other people who would work as salesmen for Sonrise over  the next three years, had owned a distributorship with Amway, the home products  company known for its aggressive marketing and for complaints that its  structure amounted to a pyramid scheme.  </P> <P> Sonrise, according to sworn statements by McFall and Savage in FCC proceedings,  was organized similarly: regional sales representatives who provided  distributorships to area representatives who in turn provided distributorships  to local representatives.  </P> <P> When Sonrise was formed, the hottest field at the FCC was the lottery for  cellular telephone franchises. The firm organized 30 partnerships that applied  in hundreds of markets. Several made considerable amounts of money. Then, in  1987, when the cellular markets were exhausted, the company switched to  marketing applications for FM radio stations and it engaged Root to represent  its applicants before the FCC.  </P> <P> The Sonrise system, as outlined in depositions and the company's own  promotional material, was simple. Sonrise, acting through a pyramid of  salespeople, would seek out investors. Most lived in the Carolinas, Georgia and  northern Florida, although some are to be found spread across the nation from  Virginia to California. In sales meetings and promotional videotapes, White and  Savage would tout the potentially huge returns that investors could earn from  radio.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Christian Claim  </P> <P> And not only could a person earn money, sales representatives would explain,  Sonrise was a Christian company. Why, even its name proclaimed its faith --  S-o-n-rise. Many of the partnerships the company would proceed to organize had  a religious theme, as shown by the names they chose for themselves: Good News  Limited Partnership, Emmanuel FM, Paradise Communications, Holy Spirit, Holy  Hands.  </P> <P> "I'd never invested in radio before," said Dr. Robert L. Groat, a Greensboro,  N.C., ophthalmologist who was one of Sonrise's largest investors, entrusting  more than $100,000 to the firm's care. When questions would come up in sales  meetings, "they had good answers," Groat said.  </P> <P> "Obviously, now, looking back there were discrepancies."  </P> <P> In hindsight, one of the puzzles was the price. According to several Washington  attorneys active in the broadcast license field, a group of investors who  wanted to own a radio station probably, on average, could get an application  filed, the necessary engineering work done and lawyers paid for about $15,000  to $20,000. Sonrise, by contrast, collected roughly $90,000 from each of its  partnerships.  </P> <P> According to a sworn deposition by Savage, the company's former chairman who  now serves as a Sonrise consultant, that money would be divvied up: Sonrise  itself would keep $19,700, plus another $27,000 that would go in commissions to  its sales staff; $10,300 would go to pay engineers and FCC filing fees; the  remaining $32,000 would be held for Root.  </P> <P> In fact, Sonrise would retain virtually all the money in its hands. According  to a billing statement inadvertently submitted by Root to the FCC in a Sonrise  case, the money provided for Root would be kept by Sonrise and parcelled out to  him in $1,500 increments as he billed the firm.  </P> <P> Root, through his brother Todd, told the Washington Post Sunday that he has  been paid roughly $1.6 million by Sonrise so far. A source close to Root told  The Times that Root recently had said that the company owed him another $2  million in unpaid bills.  </P> <P> A second question involves the structure of the partnerships. Investors  interviewed by The Times repeatedly said that their role, as they understood it  from the beginning, was to be passive "limited partners." Only the local  "general partner" that Sonrise would locate for each application would have a  management role in the station, they were told.  </P> <P> That structure would accord with the FCC's preference for local control of  stations. But the sale of limited partnerships is, under the laws of most  states, usually considered the sale of a security, and security sales are  heavily regulated, requiring extensive disclosure of risks and costs.  </P> <P> In a move that avoided subjecting itself to those rules, Sonrise would market  its packages as general partnerships. Then, later on, it would legally convert  them to a limited-partner structure. The question of whether that pattern  complies with the law is at the center of the securities investigation in North  Carolina, officials say, and has been questioned by authorities in other  states.  </P> <P> A third problem involved the general partners. The main benefit of working  through Sonrise, investors were told, was the firm's expertise at locating  appropriate individuals in each community where a new station would be located.  And in fact, many of the general partners located by Sonrise were highly  qualified.  </P> <P> In several cases, however, they were not. In at least two cases, the general  partner located by Sonrise later turned out to have a criminal record, dooming  the license application. And in virtually all cases, the Sonrise general  partners lacked a key criterion: money.  </P> <P> The FCC requires license applicants to certify that they have on hand or  committed to them sufficient funds to build a station and operate it for three  months before ad revenues begin flowing in. But the Sonrise general partners  almost invariably had no funds at hand except the $90,000 that the partnership  had raised. And those funds, Sonrise already had taken.  </P> <P> Finally, the Sonrise partnerships have faced a recurring question: Who's really  in charge? FCC rules require that broadcast license applicants actually be the  people who are going to run a station if it is licensed. But in Sonrise's case,  the firm's key role in making decisions -- from locating the partners to hiring  their lawyer to holding their money and preparing their tax returns -- have  suggested to FCC officials that Sonrise, not the partnerships, was really in  control.  </P> <P> Repeatedly, that question has been raised about Sonrise applications and,  routinely, the applications have been withdrawn, preventing the questioning of  Sonrise officials in a hearing. Partners who inquired about why their  applications had been dropped would be offered "feeble excuses," said Groat.  </P> <P> The result, in case after case has been that Sonrise-related applications have  been dismissed as they have come to hearings. In some cases, investors have  been promised compensation after they inquired -- usually new shares in another  partnership. In most cases, however, investors interviewed by The Times said  that they had been given virtually no information about the status of their  investments or the legal difficulties that their partnerships were  encountering.  </P> <P> And in all that, some of them have begun to wonder, where were the watchdogs?  </P> <P> The answer, communications lawyers say, is that the theoretical watchdogs --  the FCC staff -- has been so short-handed and overwhelmed by a flood of  applications that in recent years it has ceased almost entirely to monitor the  bona fides of new applicants. Checking has involved little more than making  sure applicants had complied with proper engineering standards and had filled  out their forms correctly.  </P> <P> The commission, said attorney J. Richard Carr, a longtime communications-law  expert, effectively left the job of policing the process to the private bar,  assuming that rival applicants would hunt out frauds. But often, he explained,  private attorneys and their clients have found it cheaper to buy out  questionable rivals rather than raise questions about them publicly.  </P> <P> The Reagan-era rules changes, a special committee of the Federal Communications  Bar Assn. wrote in a recent review of the situation, have "greatly increased  the incidence of speculative and sham applications."  </P> <P> A commission spokesman Tuesday defended the agency's record, noting that the  commission staff has now begun investigating both Sonrise and the whole subject  of sham applications.  </P> <P> "We're following the normal procedures," Patricia Chew said. "The wheels here  turn very slowly."  </P> <P> Staff writer Michael Ybarra and Times researcher Edith Stanley contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

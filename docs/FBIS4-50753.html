			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Pan Gang (3382 1511) and XINHUA reporter </F> Fu Gang (0265 0474)]    [Text] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- A ceremonial meeting to  commend advanced young self-employed workers nationwide was held  at the Great Hall of the People today. Li Lanqing, CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau member and State Council vice  premier; Wang Bingquan, National People's Congress Standing  Committee vice chairman; and Wan Guoquan, Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference National Committee vice  chairman; met with 207 representatives and had a picture taken  with them.    While meeting with the representatives, Li Lanqing said: It  is my great pleasure to meet you, representatives of advanced  self-employed workers, and to congratulate you on the honor you  have received. As is known, a socialist market economy consists  of various economic sectors, with public ownership as the  mainstay. It is a long-term national policy to encourage them  to compete on equal terms, promote each other, and develop  simultaneously. In recent years, individually owned and  privately owned economic sectors have developed vigorously  mainly because of, first, the party's opening up policy and,  second, the hardworking pioneering spirit and diligent labor of  individual workers. They have played an important role in  promoting economic development, which is obvious to all.  Individual workers should run their businesses according to the  law, develop their undertakings through honest labor and  managerial expertise, and contribute to China's economic  development. It is hoped that they will always remember the  Chinese virtue of using one's fortune to help others, and will  lead local people to achieve common prosperity. Meanwhile, we  should advocate the spirit of readily helping others and donate  funds to promote educational undertakings.    Li Lanqing said: Among self-employed workers, there are  heroes and models, in addition to outstanding entrepreneurs.  One of the representatives commended at the current meeting is  an individual worker from Zhejiang who was burned and injured  while trying to put out a fire. People are touched by his  heroic deeds. We hope that other workers will bring into play  his self-sacrificing spirit and make joint efforts to further  develop economic and achieve fruitful results in building  spiritual civilization.    In his speech, Wang Bingqian said: Individually run and  privately run economic sectors are placing an increasingly  conspicuous role in promoting production, bringing about social  prosperity, enlivening circulation, making things more  convenient for everyday life, providing employment, and  safeguarding social stability. At present, there are some 17.6  million individually run industrial and commercial units  employing a total of over 29 million people. They have formed  an important and indispensable force in China's socialist  construction. Engaged in honorable undertakings, individual  workers should be protected by the state laws, recognized by  society, and respected by the people.    The meeting was sponsored by the Communist Youth League  Central Committee, the State Industry and Commerce  Administration, and the China Association of Self-Employed  Workers.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY  </P> <P> "Harvey" (1950), directed by Henry Koster. 104 minutes. No rating. Elwood P.  Dowd's best friend is a 6-foot-tall rabbit named Harvey that no one else can  see.  </P> <P> Is he crazy? Not as crazy as those of us who overlook the wondrous because  we're too focused on the mundane.  </P> <P> "The Crimson Pirate" (1952), directed by Robert Siodmak. 104 minutes. No  rating. A spoof of all those Errol Flynn pirate movies. The pirates say  "Arrrgh!" a lot and tend to get their peg-legs stuck in the grills over the  hatches. And this time it's Burt Lancaster who gets to be gallant as hell.  </P> <P> "The Third Man" (1949), directed by Carol Reed. 100 minutes. No rating. An  American comes to postwar Vienna to discover a friend has been murdered, and he  winds up learning a little about love and loyalty -- too late, alas, to help  himself. With Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, a script by Graham Greene that is a  marvel of wit and intelligence, and some great zither music.MIKE FLAGG  </P></p>

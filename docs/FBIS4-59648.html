			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, in London, by </F> reporter Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; date not given; from  the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa,  can you tell us something about the nature of the talks you have  had with British officials during your current visit to London?    [Musa] The talks dealt with many issues. These included  bilateral issues, regional issues pertaining to the Middle East  and Africa, and international political and economic issues.  Therefore, the talks with the prime minister, the foreign  secretary, other ministers, and members of the House of Commons  Foreign Affairs Committee were exhaustive and detailed.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What was your impression regarding British  attitude to these issues, considering that these important  issues are of interest not only to Egypt but to the entire  Middle East area?    [Musa] I detected British interest in these issues. We are  interested in talking to all influential states about a number  of problems, including, for example, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  peace process in the Middle East, and the situations in the  Gulf, South Africa, and Somalia. All these issues are of  interest to a large number of states, the important states.  This is what prompts us to act on the international level.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is the significance of your current  visit to London at this particular time?    [Musa] The purpose of the visit is to hold consultations,  particularly during the important period preceding the  resumption of the peace process on the other tracks. The  purpose is also to consult on the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement, the new era that has begun in  South Africa, the critical situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in  which Britain is playing a big role, and a number of other  existing problems. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Minister Musa, regarding the situation in  Yemen, everyone is asking which way the Yemeni crisis is  heading? What do you say?    [Musa] I tell you that the Yemeni crisis is extremely bad.  Fighting and bloodshed cannot augur good or lead to a settlement  or unity. At any rate, we have been following the situation.  As you may know, President Husni Mubarak has received envoys  from both parties to the conflict in Yemen. Egypt is playing an  extremely active role to contain this crisis. We undertook this  role even before the outbreak of the fighting. The outbreak of  fighting introduced new elements into the issue.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can we expect a solution to the Yemeni  crisis soon, or will it worsen?    [Musa] We hope that matters will not reach that point,  although there is fear now that matters might get out of hand  unless the fighting stops. I do not think--and we in Egypt do  not think--that there will be victor or vanquished in this  conflict.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Minister Musa, what is your opinion of the  start of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho?    [Musa] We hope it will succeed. This is a particularly  difficult time, and the future of the Palestinian-Israeli  relations, the settlement of the Palestinian issue, and progress  on the other tracks depend on it. Therefore, we wish our  Palestinian brothers success in this endeavor.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, thank you very  much and we welcome you as always on the airwaves of the Voice  of the Arabs Radio.    [Musa] Thank you.</p>

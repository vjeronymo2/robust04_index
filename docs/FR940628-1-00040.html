			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Areas With Operating I/M Programs_Continuing Operation With Upgrades. If an area chooses to upgrade the I/M program to meet the requirements of subpart S rather than to take advantage of the amendment proposed today, then a full SIP submission as specified in &sect;51.372 of subpart S shall be made that addresses those requirements. In this case, a state can claim full MOBILE model credit for the implemented upgrade in the maintenance plan as of its effective date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Areas With Operating I/M Programs_Discontinuing Operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Areas which receive approval of the redesignation request may cease operation of the I/M program after this approval if and only if the following requirements are met. First, a modeling demonstration must be included in the maintenance plan which shows the standards can be maintained without the program, and second, the I/M program must be transferred by SIP revision to the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan and implemented as a contingency measure in the event of a triggering condition. Emission reduction credit cannot be claimed in the maintenance plan if an I/M program is to cease operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal does not affect redesignation requests submitted for serious or worse ozone or carbon monoxide areas, moderate CO areas above 12.7 ppm, and for areas claiming full maintenance plan credits for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> I/M program without supporting evidence of emission reduction credits. Those areas must meet all the requirements of subpart S. This is because section 182(c)(3) of the Act does not provide the flexibility granted under section 182(b)(4) and explicitly requires areas subject to the enhanced I/M requirement to submit a full I/M program including regulations and implementation requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Participation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA desires full public participation in arriving at final decisions in this rulemaking action. EPA solicits comments on all aspects of today's proposal from all interested parties. Wherever applicable, full supporting data and detailed analysis should also be submitted to allow EPA to make maximum use of the comments. All comments should be directed to the Air Docket, Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;21. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule places no information collection or recordkeeping burden on respondents. Therefore, an information collection request has not been prepared and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, not subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. A small entity may include a small government entity or jurisdiction. A small government jurisdiction is defined as ``governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than 50,000''. This certification is based on the fact that the I/M areas impacted by the rule do not meet the definition of a small government jurisdiction, that is, ``governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than 50,000''. It has been determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. This rule would only relieve states of some regulatory requirements, not add costs or otherwise adversely affect the economy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 51 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Intergovernmental relations, Lead, Motor vehicle pollution, Nitrogen oxide, Ozone, Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur Oxides, Volatile organic compounds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Dated: June 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 --> Carol M.

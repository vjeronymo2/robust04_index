			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dialogue between station reporters Kim Myong and No </F> Myong-hwa: "Confrontation and War Are the Road to Destruction"  -- live or recorded]    [Text] [No Myong-hwa] Today the South Korean people are  raising their voices to overthrow the civilian government of the  Kim Yong-sam clique. I believe that this is an explosion of  their indignation against traitor Kim Yong-sam, the worst  betrayer of the nation, who is flagrantly running amok to pursue  confrontation and war maneuvers. Therefore, I would like to  talk about the maneuvers of traitor Kim Yong-sam who pursues  confrontation and war by running counter to the national demand  for reunification.    [Kim Myong] Speaking of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique,  originally, he was the most heinous anti-reunification element  and separatist who used to make absurd remarks that there will  be neither freedom nor prosperity if this country is reunified,  and that it will be more painful to live in the state of  reunification without freedom nor prosperity than to live in the  state of division. Such attitude of the traitor Kim Yong-sam  clique's shows that he is more persistently clinging to the  skirt of outside forces and is running amok to pursue the  criminal North-South confrontation and the Northward invasion  maneuvers. Such act would put the previous warmongers to shame.    [No] As is known, last year we proposed a 10-point program  for a great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of  the fatherland and urged the South Korean rulers to suspend  their confrontation and war maneuvers and to return to the road  of the national reconciliation and unity and the national  independence. However, they refused our friendly proposal and  walked the road against us. In order words, the traitor Kim  Yong-sam clique has viciously inspired a spirit of confrontation  between the fellow countrymen by saying at every opportunity in  a so-called meeting of the Army commanders or in his New Year's  address that South Korea must be ready for an emergency  situation. Some time ago, they kicked up another provocative  commotion at a meeting of the so- called Emergency Planning  Committee, talking about the resumption of a posture to prepare  for an emergency situation.    [Kim] You are right. We cannot forgive him today because of  the fact that the Kim Yong-sam clique is attempting to carry out  the so-called international cooperation system and international  sanctions in order to crush [apsal] our Republic by relying on  the might of outside forces. Some time ago, he announced that  he would make efforts to improve relations with the North based  on view of the fact that it is the same nation, but he behaved  himself disgracefully by begging the United States to exercise a  powerful influence against us and to carry out the international  cooperation system with South Korea, while even providing South  Korean rice markets to the United States. He even visited the  United States for this.    [No] You are right. The Kim Yong-sam clique has made  warmanic and absurd remarks by saying that he is ready to take  military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] against us under the  pretext of the nuclear issue. He does everything to inspire the  spirit of the North-South confrontation and has created the  spirit of northward invasion by touring the puppet military  units.    [Kim] You are right. The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has not  only pursued the North-South confrontation but has also been  frantic to bring the flame of war to the heads of our nation.  The Kim Yong- sam clique, who responded to our proposal for  exchange of special envoys of the top authorities of the two  sides by resuming the Team Spirit joint military exercise with  outside forces, has conducted a great number of aggressive war  exercises up to date. According to a military source, a few  days ago, the Kim Yong-sam puppets conducted war exercises in  the areas of Kyonggi Province and South Korea's Kangwon Province  -- areas near the Demilitarized Zone -- by firing guns against  us. The Kim Yong-sam puppets, who are running amok to the  spirit of war, have designed plots to conduct another  large-scale war exercise in collusion with outside forces if  they fail to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise.  Also, they have maneuvered to introduce Patriot missiles to  South Korea.    [No] The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has viciously committed  a grave military provocation in the Demilitarized Zone. In  fact, their new war provocation plots have been formidable.  Because of the confrontation and war maneuvers by the Kim  Yong-sam puppets in South Korea, all dialogues between the North  and South have broken. Also, big obstacles are being created in  the future road of the national reunification with each passing  day. The Kim Yong-sam puppets infringe upon even the basic and  democratic rights of the South Korean people. On 1 February,  they indiscriminately cracked down with their rifles, knives,  and tear gas, the struggle of farmers, youths, and students who  rose up to wage demonstrations against the opening of the  agricultural market. They arrested approximately 400 farmers,  youths, and students there. Even now, they are putting the  whole area of South Korea into a warlike atmosphere of terror.    [Kim] You are right. The Kim Yong-sam clique is the worst  traitor of the nation, as well as the vicious fascist warmonger.  The fact that the South Korean people from all walks of life are  fighting against the Kim Yong-sam clique under the slogan "Let  Us Overthrow the Civilian Government" is very just. Therefore,  the Kim Yong-sam clique must receive national punishment.    He is running amok to pursue the North-South confrontation  and the war plot for the northward invasion under the cloak of a  civilian government. I can say that this is to extend his dirty  life even one more day by persistently relying on outside  forces. However, this is a miscalculation.    As shown by history, confrontation and war maneuvers are the  shameful road to destruction. The Kim Yong-sam clique must be  aware of the masses' aspiration and historical lessons and act  with discretion.    [No] Army officers and soldiers in South Korea will clearly  see the last days of the Kim Yong-sam clique, who is hastily  running amok to the road of destruction, while standing on the  side of the masses and making efforts for the national harmony  and unity.    [Kim] You are right.</p>

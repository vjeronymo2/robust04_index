			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Distant pipes and drums from the real world outside SUPPORTERS of the Edinburgh international festival complain each summer that the official festival is in danger of being outdone by the scruffier but much more prolific fringe. This being Edinburgh, the summit has to have a fringe. And the official events stand little chance of making the impact on the people of Edinburgh which the dozens of fringe events will have. The summit is after all a largely secret meeting, almost invisible to the outside world, of 12 men (with several thousand officials and journalists in attendance). Most people will be lucky to glimpse more than a few speeding motorcades. But in the fringe there are demonstrations, marches, alternative summits and conferences, as well as open-air concerts and street theatre. Yesterday the fringe broke into the dignified part of the programme when protesters twice interrupted the Edinburgh University ceremony at which Mr Jacques Delors was given an honorary degree. Some were from a left-wing organisation called the EC Summit Unwelcoming Committee, which later staged a march of people chanting: 'It's your slump, we won't pay.' But the most significant event could be the Scotland Demands Democracy march and rally tomorrow, which should involve all political parties pressing for constitutional change for Scotland. The protest, organised by the Scottish Trades Union Congress, is intended to remind Mr John Major that there is still strong demand for change, despite the setback suffered by devolution and independence campaigners in the election. Speakers from the Scottish National Party, Labour and the Liberal Democrats will argue that it is hypocritical for Mr Major to say subsidiarity should apply to Britain but not apply to Scotland - a nation within Britain. Today the campaign to save Scottish regiments scheduled for merger will march with pipes and drums under the command of retired General Sir John MacMillan and hand a petition to Mr Major at Edinburgh Castle. Elsewhere, Scottish fishermen will be demonstrating against the EC Common Fisheries Policy. For most of the week a poverty summit has been discussing the impact of the industrialised world on developing countries. Socialist Party leaders from 19 European countries have been meeting under the chairmanship of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. Today and tomorrow experts on the Balkans will hold a conference on Bosnia. Tomorrow afternoon the people of Edinburgh are invited to surge out into the streets, first for an open-air market, then for Summit in the City, a programme of open-air rock concerts and street theatre. Warm clothes are recommended, just as for the festival in the summer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The closure of the Khmer Rouge [KR] office in Phnom  Penh will have a bad effect on Cambodia's attempts to reach  national reconciliation, and will prolong the conflict between  the Cambodian government and the guerrillas, Thailand's Foreign  Minister, Prasong Sunsiri, said.    Responding to reporter's queries, Prasong said Cambodia  should continue its attempt to bring back to the community the  Khmer Rouge, who refused to participate in 1993 UN-organized  election.    The Cambodian government has ordered the closure of the  Khmer  Rouge office in the capital, Phnom Penh, saying that it is  uncertain of the guerrillas representative in the city.  [sentence as published]    "Phnom Penh's order regarding the Khmer Rouge office clearly  showed the government's outrage at the Khmer Rouge refusal to  cooperate with it. However such closure should not happen, as  the two sides are in the process of negotiation," Prasong said.    The office, which has only one staff, has seldom been in  operation due to conflicts with the government. The government  has not yet outlawed the guerrillas. A proposed bill to outlaw  the group has been withdrawn temporarily pending the results of  talks held last week in Phnom Penh.    The talks failed to reach any agreement on a ceasefire,  reportedly prompting the Cambodian government to order the  closure of the office.    "Hope to see immediate and lasting peace in Cambodia has  been  further diminished as the guerrillas will certainly be angry  with the closure of its office," Prasong said.</p>

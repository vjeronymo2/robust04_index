			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares continue to hold their ground THE UK stock market continued yesterday to consolidate around its current levels, encouraged by indications during the day that the chances of serious political conflict in Russia appeared to be diminishing. Equities were also helped by further gains in government bonds and also by analysts' suggestions that, despite this week's unimpressive flow of corporate news, prospects for UK corporate earnings may be stronger than expected. The FT-SE Index passed the day shuffling around its overnight levels, moving in a narrow range between 3,006.9 and 3,002.2. But the Index was in positive ground throughout the session and the final reading, up 3.9 at 3,005.2, implied a further strengthening of the lower end of the latest trading range. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 1.6 to 3,431.9. This week has brought what must be the smallest recorded shift in the Footsie - down a mere 0.3 points. The Footsie 3,000 mark has been successfully held despite the uncertainties associated with the political clash in Russia. Firmness in the US dollar and in other European continental markets has buoyed London. Trading volumes have also been good and trading has been little affected by the political drama in Russia. High retail, or customer, volume in UK equities has sustained confidence in the securities markets. Company results, an actively restraining influence on UK share prices, continued to present a mixed picture yesterday, with John Mowlem, the building group, reporting increased losses. But analysts at Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant banker, and at James Capel, the London institutional broking house, published favourable comments on the outlook for UK company profits. Trading volume was fairly poor, however, with Seaq business reaching only 527.3m shares compared with 713.5m on Thursday; non-Footsie business made up around 61 per cent of the total. In the previous session, retail business jumped to Pounds 1.63bn, at the higher end of the improved trading range of the past 12 months. Long-dated UK government bonds edged higher without attracting much turnover. In the shorts, the closest reflection of base rate hopes, gains were very small. However, there was some interest in Index-linked gilts which put on about  1/2 a point.</p>

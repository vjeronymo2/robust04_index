One of the important problems in advocating and  adhering to socialism of our own style from the  antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and  reactionaries is to awaken the party members and workers to  class consciousness.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: At a  time when the situation is very complicated, it is important to  carry out class indoctrination well so that the party members  and workers can be awakened to class consciousness.    Awakening the party members and workers to class  consciousness involves the enhancement of class consciousness to  make them hate the exploitative system and exploitative class,  resolutely struggle against the exploitative system and  exploitative class, advocate and adhere to the gains of  socialism, and struggle to the end to complete the socialist  cause.    The importance of awakening party members and workers to  class consciousness as an important demand in advocating and  adhering to socialism of our own style lies in making it  possible to strengthen the main force of our revolution and  enhancing its role. Strengthening the main force of the  revolution and enhancing its role is a fundamental problem in  the struggle to advocate and adhere to socialism of our own  style. The main force of the revolution is directly in charge  of the struggle to advocate and adhere to socialism and a  powerful driving force in the socialist cause.    It is important to awaken the party members and workers to  class consciousness in strengthening the main force of the  revolution and enhancing its role. To strengthen the main force  of the revolution the popular masses must be firmly armed with  the independent revolutionary ideology and the socialist and  communist ideology, and firmly unite them through ideological  will around the party and the leader. To achieve this, they  must be awakened to class consciousness.    The working class' class consciousness is the core in  socialist ideology and the basis in socialist indoctrination is  class indoctrination. Therefore, class indoctrination must be  strengthened among the party members and workers so that when  class consciousness is awakened they can all the more be firmly  armed with the socialist and communist ideology and all the more  firmly unite around the party and the leader to extraordinarily  strengthen the main force of the revolution.    The class consciousness of the party members and workers  must  be awakened so that their revolutionary enthusiasm and  creativity can be enhanced to heighten the role of chuche.    Class consciousness is a decisive element in regulating the  people's role in carrying out the revolution and construction.  Class consciousness also regulates the characteristics of class  consciousness in the behavior of the people taking part in the  revolutionary movement and on how much they are manifesting the  strong will and struggle might.    The role of the ideological will in the revolutionary  movement is dependent on its characteristics and content. Only  people who are armed with the ideology of advanced class and the  revolutionary ideology of the working class can have a correct  class position in the revolutionary struggle and construction  work, and struggle to the end by overcoming all kinds of  difficulties and trials.    Therefore, when the class consciousness of the party  members and workers is raised, they can demonstrate high  revolutionary enthusiasm and positive creativity in the struggle  to defend and maintain the socialist cause and victoriously  advance it to significantly enhance the role of chuche.    Another reason why awakening the party members and workers  to  class consciousness is an important requirement for defending  and maintaining socialism of our own style is that it enables us  to firmly adhere to revolutionary principles in carrying out the  socialist cause.    Adhering to revolutionary principles in carrying out the  socialist cause is an important issue in defending and  maintaining socialism. The revolutionary principle on defending  and embodying the popular masses' demand of independence must be  consistently maintained to defend and maintain the socialist  cause and advance it. Only when the class consciousness of the  party members and workers is raised, they will consider  socialism to be their belief and persistently adhere to  revolutionary principles in carrying out the socialist cause.    Socialist, communist construction is being carried out amid  a  fierce class struggle. For the popular masses to defeat all  obstructionist maneuvers by the imperialists and reactionaries  and defend, maintain, and complete the socialist cause to the  end, they must have a firm belief in socialism.    People will believe in socialism only when their class  consciousness is raised. Party members and workers will  consider socialism to be their belief and constantly adhere to  revolutionary principles in carrying out the socialist cause  when we further strengthen indoctrination in class consciousness  among the party members and workers and when, as a result, they  have a full understanding of the reactionary nature of  capitalism and imperialism and the inevitability of their ruin,  the justness of the socialist cause, and the inevitability of  the victory of socialism.    Another reason why awakening the party members and workers  to  class consciousness is an important requirement for defending  and maintaining socialism of our own style is that it enables us  to thoroughly crush [chippusilssuikke] the antirevolutionary  maneuvers of imperialists and class enemies. The struggle to  carry out the socialist, communist cause entails a fierce class  struggle against all sorts of class enemies.    Those imperialists are continuously clinging to the policy  of  strength and threatening the socialist countries militarily.  They are also perpetrating all sorts of cunning maneuvers to  disintegrate socialist countries politically and economically,  ideologically and culturally.    Inspired by the imperialists, the remnants of the hostile  classes of socialist society [sahoejuui sahoe naebue namainnun  choktaegyegubui chanyobunjadul], are also maneuvering overtly  and covertly [umuro yanguro chaektong] to overthrow the  socialist system and revive a capitalist system. This is a  fierce class struggle of who beats whom [igussun nuga nugurul  hanun chiyolhan gyegup tujaeng imnida]. In this struggle, the  people cannot defend and maintain socialism, a revolutionary  achievement which was won with blood, without thoroughly  crushing [chippusiji] the antisocialist maneuvers of  imperialists and the remnants of the overthrown class of  exploiters.    Enhancing the awakening to class consciousness of the party  members and working people is important to smashing the  anti-socialist maneuvers of the imperialists and class enemies.  It is necessary to strengthen class indoctrination of party  members and working people to uncompromisingly wage a struggle  to correctly differentiate friend from foe, endlessly hate the  imperialists, landlords and capitalists, oppose the exploiting  system and class enemies, and defend and adhere to the socialist  system.    Thinking that people would naturally possess socialist  ideology if the socialist system was firmly established and  people's material and cultural lifestyles were enhanced, the  ruling parties in the former Soviet Union and eastern European  countries did not work hard enough at the work to enhance  people's awakening to class consciousness. As a result,  individualism and egoism seriously developed among party members  and working people, and anti-socialist ideology flooded in from  outside bringing about ideological permutation. It was  inevitable for these countries not to be able to overcome the  antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and bourgeois  welfarists and for socialism to be frustrated as the parties of  these countries gave up the ideological indoctrination works of  enhancing the awakening to class consciousness for their party  members and working people.    Socialism is a society where ideology is its life. Socialism  wins if the party of the working class strengthens class  indoctrination-based socialist ideological indoctrination work  so that the popular masses are armed with socialist ideology and  unite as one on that basis. Socialism collapses if the party  gives up ideological indoctrination work and the popular masses  become ideologically ill.    Taking the enhancement of the awakening to class  consciousness for party members and working people as one of the  important problems related to socialism's destiny, our party has  ceaselessly deepened the class indoctrination work for them.  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth a policy  concerning the strengthening of class indoctrination early in  the days of basic socialist construction and wisely led us to  strengthen class indoctrination work for the party members and  working people in conformity with the demands of revolutionary  development. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il put forth the  unique ideology to further strengthen the class indoctrination  work in conformity with our revolutionary development's new,  higher-stage demands of modelling the whole society after chuche  idea, and wisely led us to carry it out in diverse forms and  ways.    Today in our country, single-hearted unity of the leader  [suryong], the party, and the popular masses is strengthened as  iron and the people's awakening to class consciousness is being  heightened as the socialist ideological indoctrination work  based on class indoctrination is being vigorously carried out  among the party members and working people under the wise  leadership of our party.    Coping with imperialists and reactionaries' antisocialist  and  antirepublic maneuvers which is becoming more severe with each  passing day, we should further strengthen our class position and  better prepare the party members and working people for becoming  resolute revolutionary fighters who defend, adhere to, and  elucidate socialism of our style with their lives by ceaselessly  deepening the ideological indoctrination work to awaken their  class consciousness.</p>

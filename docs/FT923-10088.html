			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Letter: Retrograde step for credit card holders to divulge PIN to confirm their identity Sir, We have some major concerns about some of the points made in David Barchard's article 'Beating the cardsharps' (Credit and charge cards survey, July 15). The Home Office proposal to place photographs on credit cards may help to reduce the impact of opportunist thefts. However, a card can have the correct photograph but a forged magnetic stripe. A cashier, put at ease by the correct photograph and signature, would be less likely to notice the forgery than at present. The use of photographs could encourage an increase in the number of certain well-documented frauds. Of much greater concern is the statement that UK banks are considering the use of personal identification numbers (PINs) at the point of sale as a way to make card transactions more secure. Banks have always stressed the importance to the card-holder of keeping the PIN secret and not divulging it to anyone. They have taken the approach that if a valid transaction is made using a card and the correct PIN then only the card-holder could have both of these and must therefore have been involved with the transaction. We are aware of well-documented instances of card fraud where this has not been the case. From research undertaken at the computer laboratory in Cambridge we know of a number of serious frauds perpetrated using traditional magnetic-stripe based cards. By far the most potentially damaging to the image of the whole system, and to the trust that card users place in it and the financial institutions running it, are those that occur using knowledge of the PIN. We know of documented frauds perpetrated using counterfeit cards and genuine PINs gathered from simple visual observation of their entry. The easy availability of equipment that can be used to create seemingly authentic magnetic-stripes is evident from the many advertisements in your special section. To insist on the use of the card-holder's PIN at the point of sale (the stated option preferred by the industry to combat card fraud) will inevitably make it much easier for the criminally minded to obtain PINs  - by simple observation at any checkout; and therefore seeming to give a considerable boost to just such criminal activities the measure is intended to combat. We are also aware of a number of other mechanisms that are used to part the unwary from their PINs - including the use of counterfeit point-of-sale (POS) equipment to gather both PINs and account details. We strongly believe that to encourage card-holders to divulge their PINs in even more public places and on even more occasions than before, is a retrograde step in the efforts to combat card fraud and to protect the many millions of card-holders.

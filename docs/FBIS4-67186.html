			<p>CSO     [Summary] On 4 April at the Xinjiang Autonomous Region  counternarcotics meeting, Vice Chairman Wang Lequan emphasized  the serious nature of Xinjiang's narcotics problem. He noted  that the counternarcotics effort is an urgent, long-term  proposition.    According to Wang, despite some successes during the past  three years, cultivation and trafficking of drugs have not been  eliminated, and Xinjiang has seen the number of counties and  cities with a drug trafficking problem increase from 40 to 53.  In addition, traffickers have become better organized and  developed more extensive networks, and their methods have become  increasingly devious. Therefore, Xinjiang must improve its  counternarcotics propaganda, and the region will focus its  counternarcotics effort on cases involving large sums of money,  trafficking routes and hubs, and deeply-involved criminals. At  the same time, Xinjiang will counter scattered and sporadic  trafficking, uncovering traffickers through patterns of drug use  and destroying underground trafficking networks. Wang also  stressed the development of a counternarcotics responsibility  system involving the registration of drug users.</p>

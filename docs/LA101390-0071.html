			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG GAME / POINT LOMA 35, MIRA MESA 3;  </P> <P> MANASSA GETS ROUT OFF TO A QUICK START  </P> <P> Signs of life appeared in the Point Loma High offense Friday afternoon, and  they proved to be a sign-off for Mira Mesa.  </P> <P> For the third time this season, Point Loma defeated a top-five and  higher-ranked team by rolling over Mira Mesa, 35-3 at Point Loma High. Mira  Mesa (4-1) came in ranked No. 2. Point Loma (5-0) was No. 3.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Point Loma got by Helix when the Highlanders were No. 2. Before  that, the Pointers upset then-No. 3 Rancho Buena Vista.  </P> <P> But the Pointers did that with something of a secret-agent offense -- which  spent most of the time incognito, showing up for only three touchdowns combined  in both games.  </P> <P> The cloak came off Friday -- and fast.  </P> <P> Marlon Manassa took a handoff from Tobin Gault on the first play of the game,  peeked at the defense, darted outside and 80 yards later crossed the goal line.  </P> <P> Manassa deflected credit for the score to his offensive line, particularly  right guard La'Roi Glover (6-foot-2, 265) and right tackle James Witkowski  (6-4, 270).  </P> <P> "It's a play based on pure power," Manassa said. "Our two biggest offensive  linemen just power their men as far downfield as possible and I just choose  which hole to run through."  </P> <P> Manassa had many holes from which to choose during the afternoon. Her finished  the half with 187 yards on 14 carries, with three touchdowns. With five  second-half carries, Manassa finished with 209 yards and four touchdowns.  </P> <P> Manassa scored from the three on a fourth-and-two in the second quarter and  again from the one with 30 seconds left in the half.  </P> <P> His second-half touchdown came on a 79-yard punt return.  </P> <P> "I saw how slow and lackadaisical Mira Mesa was chasing the punt," Manassa said  of Mike Bovee's 56-yarder. "The rule is never back up on punts, but if I backed  up for this one I knew they weren't going to be up for a return."  </P> <P> So Manassa did back up, caught the ball and saw little coverage. He started  right, then cut back and strode in. Yes, that easy.  </P> <P> On this day, Manassa was Point Loma's offense. So convinced of this was Mira  Mesa that its defense went after Manassa on a second-quarter play-action,  leaving Matt Boxell open in the end zone. Gault hit him with a 17-yard throw.  </P> <P> All this came against the county's No. 1-rated defense. Mira Mesa had allowed  only 10 points in five games and figured to keep Point Loma's offense in  hibernation for another week.  </P> <P> Manassa knew otherwise.  </P> <P> "When we had a bye last week, the practices were really intense, like we were  preparing for a Morse game," he said. "As the week went on, we just got  hungrier and hungrier."  </P> <P> That game against Morse, now ranked No. 1, is two weeks away.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Peace Painting Continues: More than 100 Greek and Turkish Cypriot artists in  Nicosia, Cyprus, resumed work Sunday on two halves of a giant painting calling  for peace that they plan to stretch 500 yards across the buffer zone dividing  the island. The two groups continued to work on their respective sides of the  dividing line after Turkish Cypriot authorities refused to allow the Turkish  Cypriot painters to join their Greek Cypriot colleagues.  </P> <P> The canvases include pictures of doves and olive branches and multicolored  slogans declaring: "No More Violence," "Cyprus a Common Future," "Make Love Not  War," and "Yes to Peace." The project began Jan. 21. The U.N.-patrolled zone  has divided Nicosia and the rest of the island since a 1974 Turkish invasion  resulted in partition. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

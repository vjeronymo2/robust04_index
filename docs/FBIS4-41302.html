			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Yuriy Sizov, Vladimir </F> Malyshev, and Yuriy Manilov]    [Text] Kerkyra (Corfu), 23 Jun -- "Extensive, hard work  over a year and a half has ended with an intensive burst of  progress," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told  an ITAR-TASS correspondent today, replying to a question about  the significance of the forthcoming signing of the agreement on  partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and  the European Union [EU].    Different countries, he stressed, have approached the  establishment of relations with the European Union in different  ways. Often those relations have been of disadvantage to those  states. As for Russia, we have taken the path of signing a  full- scale document which reflects not only Russia's political,  but also its economic interests.    The representative of the Russian foreign policy department  said that the talks were difficult. The final compromises were  reached literally over the final weeks of work on the document.  "We are grateful to our Greek friends," Churkin noted in  particular, "who, as EU chairmen, have shown commitment and  energy in ensuring that work was completed on the agreement  which will be initialled this evening and signed tomorrow by  Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and the EU leadership."</p>

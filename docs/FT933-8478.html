			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Romanian rail strike defiance ROMANIA'S railways remained at a near standstill last night as train drivers continued to defy last Friday's supreme court decision to suspend their strike for 80 days, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. All but a few of the country's 18,000 train drivers supported union calls to continue the strike which began last Wednesday, Radio Bucharest said. The strike, considered the most serious labour conflict since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in 1989, has blocked international rail traffic through the Balkans and left thousands of Romanian holidaymakers stranded in train stations around the country. However, the government has made little attempt to mediate, or provide emergency alternatives, even though many Romanians depend on public transport. Instead, the government has stressed the illegality of the conflict and called on the country to oppose the strikers.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / People: Enterprise finance man seeks fresh endeavour John Walmsley, managing director in charge of finance at Enterprise Oil, is to leave the company at the end of the year after a decade in the job. The announcement yesterday surprised the City and knocked 12p off the company's shares, which closed at 439p. Walmsley, 46, had been expected by some analysts to be a strong candidate for the chief executive's role if Graham Hearne, who holds both that post and the chairmanship, should decide to relinquish it. Analysts were taken aback that he had decided to go even though he has no job in prospect as yet. 'I have absolutely nothing lined up,' he said yesterday. Walmsley, who trained as an accountant, joined the company from Arthur Andersen in 1984. 'I was trying to get a role for Andersen advising Enterprise but ended up joining as finance director and the role developed from there.' Walmsley, widely respected in the City for his role in building Enterprise into a highly rated company, said he wanted fresh challenges. 'I want the stimulus of building something' he explained. He will be succeeded by Andrew Shilston, group treasurer. In turn, John van der Welle, corporate finance manager becomes group treasurer.</p>

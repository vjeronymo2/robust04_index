			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): It was the week before Christmas . . . - Wall Street / . . . and usually nothing stirs. This year has been different The week before Christmas is usually one of the quietest trading periods on Wall Street. From Monday on, business winds down rapidly as investors and dealers tidy up their books ahead of the holiday and Christmas shopping trips, office parties (and office party hangovers) take their toll on both enthusiasm and trading volumes. Not this week, however. Since Monday, the stock market has been buffetted by (in chronological order): the fall-out from last Friday's record-breaking 'triple-witching' session; Intel's hamfisted handling of the flawed chip fiasco; Microsoft's announcement of yet another delay in the introduction of the new version of its Windows software; a Federal Reserve open market committee meeting; chaos in Latin American debt and equity markets; growing concerns about Russian military intervention in the breakaway republic of Chechnya; and, just to top it all, a firebomb explosion at a subway station in the financial district which revived memories of the devastating bombing of the World Trade Centre in 1992. All in all, a pretty lively pre-Christmas week, and the fact that the market managed to come out of it ahead was a testament to the power of this year's belated December rally. Some of the credit for the gains should go to the Fed, which decided at its open market committee meeting on Tuesday not to raise interest rates one more time in 1994. Although the decision to keep rates unchanged was expected, investors were still relieved. It looks as if the market has six weeks of breathing space before the Fed's policy makers next sit down to discuss interest rates, six weeks in which investors can try to build on the modest, but seemingly solid, gains of the past 14 days. The chances of the rates going up early next year, however, remain strong. Judging by the statistics released this week, the economy is still growing at an impressive - and potentially inflationary - clip. Data on durable goods orders, consumer spending, and merchandise trade all painted the picture of an economy in robust health. The trade figures were particularly revealing. In November, the deficit widened to Dollars 10.14bn (the second largest ever) because of a sharp drop in exports and a big jump in imports, which totalled a record Dollars 70bn. Although imports have been rising sharply for most of the year, there is no sign yet that this is having much of an effect on inflation. At some point, however, analysts expect import growth to fuel inflation - most likely early next year. This expectation, plus the fact that the widening deficit only adds to the downward pressure on the dollar, increases the chances for another monetary policy tightening in late January or early February. Yet, for now, investors appear content to put their interest rate fears to one side. While the Dow posted declines on Monday and Tuesday this week, most of the selling was attributed to a technical follow-through from Friday, when massive buying related to 'triple-witching' (the simultaneous expiration of various stock options and futures) boosted share prices and lifted volume close to record levels. By Wednesday, the December rally was back on track, and the Dow broke above 3,800 for the first time in more than a month. Some of the credit for the gains went to the technology sector, where stocks continued to rally in the wake of Intel's decision to finally get to grips with the problem of its faulty Pentium chips. After stalling for several weeks, the company announced on Tuesday that it would, after all, replace the flawed chips for customers - free of charge, and no questions asked. The decision helped Intel's share price rebound strongly from last week's losses, and prompted a sector-wide rally that was vigorous enough to lift shares in Microsoft, even though the software giant was still suffering negative publicity following its announcement that the release of Windows 95  -the keenly-awaited new version of its best-selling program - will be delayed yet again, possibly until as late as next August. By Thursday, external political events were weighing on investors' minds. Although the escalating conflict between Russia and Chechnya was troubling, it was still too distant and too small to frighten the market. Of more immediate, and local, concern was the financial crisis in Mexico, where the peso's woes sparked a devaluation, then flotation, of the currency, followed by a sharp sell-off in Latin American bond markets. Yet, the implications of Mexico's money problems were not entirely negative for US stocks. While the shares of big US banks with significant business interests south of the border suffered, and the ADRs (American depositary receipts) of Mexican companies took a predictable beating, the rest of the market held up well, with analysts proclaiming that the turmoil in Latin American markets would persuade international investors to redirect some of their capital to the relatively safe haven of US stocks.  ----------------------------------------------- DOW JONES IND AVERAGE  ----------------------------------------------- Monday              3,790.70    -16.49 Tuesday             3,767.15    -23.55 Wednesday           3,801.80    +34.65 Thursday            3,814.92    +13.12 Friday              3833.43     +18.51  -----------------------------------------------</p>

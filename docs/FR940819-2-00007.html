The file shall contain documentation to reflect the date of request and the date the borrower was notified and the addendum signed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The borrower shall be provided up to 30 days to sign Exhibit A, ``Addendum to the Promissory Note/Assumption Agreement for the Disaster Set-aside Program.'' If the addendum is not signed within 30 days and/or prior to the borrower becoming more than 1 installment behind, the DSA request will be withdrawn and the borrower notified of their appeal rights under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Pending requests for primary loan servicing will continue to be considered as set forth in subpart S of this part.

This voluntary withdrawal is not appealable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) By signing Exhibit A of this subpart, the borrower agrees to the withdrawal of any pending request for primary loan servicing.

Set-aside will not be granted on the loan if both of these installments are paid current.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The amount set-aside will not exceed the annual scheduled installment being set-aside minus any portion of that installment paid prior to Exhibit A being signed by the borrower. This amount will include the unpaid interest and any principal that would be credited to the account as if the installment were paid on the due date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Recoverable cost items charged to FO, SW, and RHF loans may be set-aside with the annual installment. Cost items identified with a loan number different from the parent loan cannot be set-aside.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Interest will accrue on any principal amount set-aside at the same rate charged the non-set-aside portion.

All existing security instruments will remain in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

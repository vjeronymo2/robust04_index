			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS SELLING SOPHISTICATED JET BOMBERS TO LIBYA, U.S. SOURCES SAY  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has sold sophisticated jet attack aircraft to Libya that would  give Libyan strongman Moammar Kadafi's government greater capability to strike  longer-range targets in the Middle East, including Israel, Pentagon sources  said Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The planes are SU-24 Fencers, which have an unrefueled radius of more than 800  miles, said the sources, requesting anonymity.  </P> <P> The Soviets are believed to have sold 12 to 15 of the planes to the Libyans,  the sources said. The price is not known.  </P> <P> Libya has been a major purchaser of Soviet military equipment in the last 15  years.  </P> <P> The SU-24 bombers have been broken into pieces, crated in large boxes and  delivered to the Libyans, the sources said.  </P> <P> The deliveries have been infrequent and at irregular intervals, the sources  said.  </P> <P> The sources said the Fencers are likely to be based in eastern Libya, possibly  at Al Bumbah. From there, the planes could fly round trip, without refueling,  to Israel.  </P> <P> The New York Times, in today's editions, reported that the Soviets have also  agreed to refit a Libyan transport plane, the Soviet-built Ilyushin 76, so that  it can be used as an in-flight refueling plane.  </P></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / OFT condemns secrecy in credit decisions LENDERS should be required to tell would-be borrowers why they have been rejected, the Office of Fair Trading said yesterday. It said it would consider whether legislation was needed if lenders could not agree on a voluntary disclosure format. The OFT added in a comprehensive report on the practice of credit scoring that it would consult the credit industry on a format to let customers know why their requests for credit had been refused. 'Should it prove impossible to implement this change by voluntary agreement, the office will consider whether a legislative solution is appropriate,' the OFT said. Credit scoring systems allocate points to various characteristics of a potential borrower. The characteristics, which include age, occupation and residential status, are meant to have a correlation with an individual's likelihood of repaying credit. While bank and building society lenders usually inform applicants that they have been refused credit on the basis of a previous adverse credit report, they do not specify what the decision is based on. The British Bankers' Association called the OFT's report 'a very balanced contribution to the discussions'. It said, however, that lenders were reluctant to tell those rejected for credit on the basis of low credit scores the specific reasons for the decision. For one thing, it said, such information could assist a subsequent fraudulent application. Also, a low score often reflects several factors and those may be known only to the credit scorer, often an outside company. Sir Gordon Borrie, OFT director-general of fair trading, said the confusion and secrecy of the credit process was itself evidence of a difficulty. 'Of course, lenders have the right to decide whether or not to grant credit,' he said. 'But that right does not justify secrecy in the decision-making process beyond the need for lenders to protect themselves from fraud.' In its report, the OFT rejected the assertion that providing more information would encourage fraud. It cited the US Equal Opportunity Credit Act, which for years has allowed rejected credit applicants to learn the basis of lenders' decisions, and said there was very little evidence that those reports had led to fraud. The US experience also suggested that it would be fairly easy to develop software packages that will help lenders to inform credit applicants of the reasons for their low credit score. The OFT urged lenders to develop methods to detect incorrect information, to offer applicants a simple explanation of how credit scoring works and to give information about appeal procedures to those who have been rejected.</p>

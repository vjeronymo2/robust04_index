			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Chin Chang-uk from Washington] </F>   [Text] The problem concerning the deployment of Patriot  missiles to the Korean peninsula is expected to become a  delicate diplomatic and security issue as the ROK and the United  States have expressed different opinions on the issue. The ROK  and the United States agreed in principle to the deployment of  Patriot missiles in December 1993 when sanctions on the North  were being seriously discussed due to North Korea's persistent  negative stance toward the resolution of the nuclear issue.    The two countries began to disagree, however, about the need  for the deployment of Patriot missiles after North Korea  accepted International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections  on 15 February.    By formalizing the issue of the deployment of Patriot  missiles to the Korean peninsula, in addition to the military  preparation for the possibility of North Korea's southward  provocation, the U.S. Government used the deployment as a  warning to North Korea that a southward provocation should not  be attempted and as a political and diplomatic demonstration  that the United States can enforce UN sanctions on North Korea.    On the other hand, public opinion in the ROK have focused on  political problems, rather than military effectiveness, citing  that Patriot missiles are not appropriate for Korean peninsula's  terrain and have very low accuracy. ROK media emphasized  concern that in addition to such military defects, the  deployment of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula might  arouse negative effects on the acceptance of nuclear inspections  by agitating North Korea.    In addition, it was strongly suspected that the United  States  was trying to sell inefficient weapons to the ROK at a high  price. In this regard, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visited  the United States on 10 February and asked U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry to postpone the decision on the  deployment of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula until  after the IAEA Board of Governors meeting on 21 February.    When North Korea notified the IAEA of its willingness to  accept nuclear inspections on 15 February, Minister Han  proclaimed in Washington that the deployment of Patriot missiles  should be reconsidered and the issue has since become an issue  of disagreement on a full scale.    Before and after Minister Han's remarks, the U.S. Defense  Department revealed that it will not consider the ROK  Government's opinion by raising the objection that the  deployment of Patriot missiles is purely a military issue that  cannot become an issue in political negotiations and by  expressing its intention to separate the Patriot missile issue  from political issues.    Before North Korea announced its acceptance of nuclear  inspections, the ROK and U.S. Governments agreed that the  deployment of the missiles was politically and militarily  appropriate. After the notification of the acceptance of  nuclear inspections, however, differences in positions emerged  because the United States stressed military reasons, while the  ROK stressed the Patriots were not needed for political reasons.    The U.S. Defense Department is stressing that the deployment  of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula has become a major  issue because it was reported by the media at the same time the  North Korean nuclear issue became an urgent matter. Actually,  the deployment has nothing to do with the nuclear inspections in  North Korea.    The U.S. stance is that the deployment is part of the plan  to  establish the Theater Missile Defense system connecting the ROK  and Japan -- which was planned in 1991 long before the North  Korean nuclear issue emerged -- when North Korea concluded the  development of Nodong No. 1 missile.    The fact that the United States is pushing ahead with the  deployment of Patriot missiles at the same time North Korea has  accepted nuclear inspections appears it is a strong sales motive  to make a final pitch in the prolonged effort to sell Patriot  missiles to the ROK, thus taking advantage of the situation.    This is the time for the United States to consider the fact  that if they overly stress the sale of Patriot missiles, while  the U.S. Army has already selected ERINT [extended-range  interceptor missile] as the next-generation interceptor missile  instead of Patriots, it may weaken ROK-U.S. security cooperation.</p>

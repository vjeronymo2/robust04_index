			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WIRE: UNEMPLOYMENT, LOW PAY STILL A BIG PART OF THE ACTOR'S LIFE  </P> <P> So you want to be an actor? Go for it. But first take a look at the statistics  in the current issue of the Actors' Equity newsletter, Equity News.  </P> <P> "EMPLOYMENT CONTINUES STRONG UPSWING" is the headline. That sounds hopeful, and  the figures do show that members worked a total of 233,540 weeks during the  1988-89 theater season -- the highest in the union's history.  </P> <P> They also show that:  </P> <P> * Only 38% of the union's 36,481 members worked at all during the year. Twenty  years ago, when Equity had only $14,504 members, 69% of them found at least one  job during the season.  </P> <P> * They worked only an average of 17 weeks. (A little better than the 1968-69  figure: 16.2 weeks.)  </P> <P> * Their average annual salary was only $9,858. (In 1968-69, it was $3,699.)  </P> <P> For comparison, the U.S. government pegs the poverty level for individuals at  $5,778 -- for families at $11,611.  </P> <P> If you want to act, learn to type.  </P> <P> EBENEEZER, THOU HAST CONQUERED. As usual, "A Christmas Carol" wins the holiday  play derby. American Theatre magazine's December issue lists 25 resident  theater productions of Dickens' story from Maine to California, either in the  original or in an update such as Ed Graczyk's "A Country Christmas Carol" (the  Players Theater, Columbus, Ohio).  </P> <P> Way back in the pack come O'Henry's "Gift of the Magi," Dylan Thomas' "A  Child's Christmas in Wales," Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory" and Thornton  Wilder's "The Long Christmas Dinner."  </P> <P> Fairy tales turn up in Milwaukee ("The Snow Queen," Milwaukee Repertory  Theatre) and Minneapolis ("Cinderella," Minnesota Children's Theatre). Chapel  Hill, N.C., will see a non-musical version of "The Nutcracker" (PlayMakers  Repertory Company). San Francisco's Eureka Theatre will do "Little Nemo in  Slumberland," based on the old Little Nemo comic strip.  </P> <P> A few theaters will also remember whose birthday it is. El Teatro Campesino's  production of "La Pastorela" at San Juan Bautista shows the Holy Family trying  to find lodgings. Romulus Linney's "Sand Mountain" (Attic Theatre, Detroit)  shows Jesus returning to Earth to share a jug with a mountain family.  </P> <P> Finally, the Indiana Repertory Theatre is offering something called "Christmas  With Bernadette." Hm.  </P> <P> IN QUOTES. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D.-Vermont) on the recent National Endowment for  the Arts controversy: "The issue that nobody wants to talk about is that some  day, if you vote to protect the NEA, somebody is going to run that 30-second  spot and say: 'Sen. So-and-So supports pornography.' "  </P></p>

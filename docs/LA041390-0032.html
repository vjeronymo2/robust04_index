			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: BALMAIN GOES SCOT  </P> <P> The French fashion house of Balmain has named a new designer, Alistair Blair of  Scotland, for its line of luxury ready-to-wear. Blair is well known in Britain  where he has been designing his own collection for Jaeger, the upscale  sportswear company. Earlier, he worked in the Paris couture houses -- Dior,  Givenchy, Chloe and Karl Lagerfeld -- for nine years. Erik Mortensen, Balmain's  Danish-born designer, will keep his post as head of haute couture, which he has  occupied since Pierre Balmain's death in 1982. The Balmain label has a classic  image, and no matter what creations Blair comes up with, the prices will remain  in the high rent district -- say, about $1,000 for a suit.  </P> <P> VIRGIN DRESS: Madonna has a new dress and it's the first ever made by Richard  Tyler, the L.A. designer best known for his men and women's suits. She  requested something in black with a velvet collar and he came up with what  looks like a priest's frock, except that it is slit on the sides to show off a  sheer black underskirt. Madonna will wear it during her concert tour and Tyler  will stock a version of it in his L.A. boutique, says the designers' partner,  Lisa Trafficante. Janet Jackson is also sporting Tyler togs in her latest  video. Her black silk suit with hand-stitched white pinstripes is a featured  attraction on "Alright." They're showing the video at the Tyler Trafficante  store.  </P> <P> LIMELIGHTS AND NOLAN MILLER: In the play "Sleeping Beauty -- Coma," playing at  the Coronet Theatre in Hollywood, thousands of dollars were spent to create the  Mod fashion world of London in the '60s, but nothing was left for a showpiece  outfit for the final scene. So Charles Busch, the play's creator/star, shopped  the racks at Sym's, a New York store, to come up with the final fashion  statement for his character, a Mary Quant-type designer he plays in drag. For  the last scene (which takes place in 1990) Busch found an off-the-rack, beaded,  white, Nolan Miller suit bargain-priced at $250. He reports that the suit,  which resembles the styles Miller created for Joan Collins in "Dynasty," stops  the show every night. "As soon as I walk out on stage in that suit the audience  screams," Busch said. "I'd like to think it's my acting, but. . . . "  </P> <P> BAG CAMPS: Prada accessories are becoming so popular that two of their bags are  becoming the status symbol among fashion folks, including many fashion editors  at the recent European collections. The nylon and silk chain-handled tote is  seen on the shoulders of models Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, Linda  Evangelista and big-haired blondes Dyan Cannon and Diandra Douglas. The other  camp -- led by designer Isaac Mizrahi -- slings on the Prada backpack.  </P></p>

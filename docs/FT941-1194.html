			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Media whip up a Whitewater froth: Bill Clinton stays cool under press barrage It was not as if it had been a quiet week. The likely next president of neighbouring Mexico had been assassinated; there had been coup rumours in Moscow; North Korea had threatened war on the South; the last US troops were leaving Somalia; the Fed had raised interest rates again; and budget and health bills had made progress in Congress. Worthy subjects all for a presidential press conference. Not on Thursday night, though, and not to the White House press corps. It took a journalist - from Honduras of all places - asking the 16th question (about Mexico) of President Bill Clinton, to break the Whitewater litany. It sometimes seems the capital's press - plus attendant politicians with their own motives - is alone in driving the Whitewater story. Polls show a public growing more concerned about it, but hardly surprising since that is what they are being fed. One survey found the evening TV news shows over the last two months had devoted three times as much airtime to Whitewater as crime and healthcare, which polls suggest the public does care about. In many respects, Mr Clinton was at his resilient and rational best on Thursday night, ducking no questions, volunteering more information on his taxes and Whitewater losses and stoutly denying any wrongdoing. He displayed no animus - not to the media nor even to Jim Leach, the Republican Congressman from Iowa, whose afternoon onslaught on the House floor had set an uncomfortable stage. He showed again that he is not to be messed with in one-on-one verbal jousting. One reporter tried to trap him with questions on his responsibilities towards, and relationship with, the federal agency in charge of cleaning up the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. 'I think the last thing in the world I should do is to talk to the Treasury Department about the RTC (Resolution Trust Corporation),' Mr Clinton cracked back. 'You all have told me that that creates the appearance of impropriety . . . you can't have it both ways.' He got his only laugh of the evening. Even his heaviest critics conceded that he had rendered an impressive performance. 'Cool and confident,' said the Los Angeles Times, 'magnificent,' said Jim Wooten of ABC News, 'well armed,' said the Washington Post, more grudgingly. Those who had half-expected a Nixonian 'Checkers' speech were disappointed. But far more serious was the sight of the White House press corps with the Whitewater bit between its collective teeth - Terry Hunt, AP bureau chief, Helen Thomas, UPI doyenne, Brit Hume from ABC, Andrea Mitchell of NBC. They cannot let go now - and nor can their journalistic masters. For some there are Pulitzer prizes to be won, along with the recognition of their peers. Many of the younger breed, influenced by Watergate 20 years ago, seem persuaded that all public servants are only in it for the power and the money. Older hacks have their reservations, and write them up, but cannot stem the tide. Some publications have motivations of their own. The leader writers of the Wall Street Journal see in Mr Clinton a counter-revolutionary force capable of wrecking Ronald Reagan's legacy. They have allowed only three days this month to pass without savage editorial comment on the Clintons and their friends. Comparable assaults last year on Mr Vincent Foster, the deputy legal counsel in the White House, appear to have been a contributory factor to his suicide. The New York Times, the best newspaper in the country by a city mile, has always had problems with smart southerners, Presidents Johnson and Carter, for example. Though much of its reporting has been careful and judicious, some of its Whitewater stories give the impression that Arkansas is a smelly object that has crawled out from under a prehistoric rock. A vast article last week, leading off with Mrs Clinton's profits as a commodities trader in the late 1970s and suggesting, without hard evidence, that the Clintons had been bought wholesale by the state's chicken industry, was a classic case in point. The Washington Post has been spurred by suggestions that it has been out-reported on Whitewater by the Washington Times, the arch-conservative daily owned by a Korean evangelist, Rev Sun Myung Moon. But even one of the Post's most famous products, Carl Bernstein, of Watergate fame, confessed this week he was unimpressed by the quality of much Whitewater reporting. Some opinion polls point to public concern with the media's Whitewater obsession. In this climate, Mr Clinton can only plug away, as he did on Thursday night. Even the upcoming Easter recess is unlikely to offer much relief.</p>

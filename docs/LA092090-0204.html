			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> FEELING BAD, SOUNDING GOOD;  </P> <P> FOR ROCKER MELISSA ETHERIDGE, A LOVE THAT HAS TURNED SOUR IS DEFINITELY  SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT.  </P> <P> If it were the movies, rocker Melissa Etheridge would be what is called the  strong female lead -- perhaps Sigourney Weaver beating up those slimy "aliens."  She's got a voice as big as all outdoors, sort of like Pat Benatar on steroids,  and Etheridge rocks as hard as any of those guys in leather pants.  </P> <P> The Beatles may have sung ". . . all you need is love," but the love Etheridge  sings about, nobody needs. It's angst with a beat, rocky relationships that  rock. But you'll probably be too busy dancing to hang yourself. She has a hot  band behind her featuring, among others, Bernie Larsen on guitar. Feeling bad  never sounded so good.  </P> <P> From "Let Me Go," a sample line:  </P> <P>  "Am I the snake inside your garden  </P> <P>  The sugar in your tea  </P> <P>  The knock upon your backdoor  </P> <P>  The twist that turns your key  </P> <P>  Am I the sweat you feel on your hand  </P> <P>  The shadow on your face  </P> <P>  The tune inside your head that put you  </P> <P>  Here in the first place  </P> <P>  Well I don't want to be . . . ."  </P> <P>  Etheridge, from Leavenworth, Kan., is on a roll with two gold albums. The  self-titled 1988 debut earned her a Grammy nomination. The second album, "Brave  and Crazy," was released in 1989, also on Island Records.  </P> <P> Etheridge, 29, will make her local debut when she plays the tree-lined Santa  Barbara County Bowl on Saturday night along with local rock heroes Toad the Wet  Sprocket.  </P> <P> In a recent telephone interview, she had this to say:  </P> <P> When can we expect a new album?  </P> <P> Well, we're going into the studio in February. It'll probably be another year.  </P> <P> Will you be playing any new songs at the concert?  </P> <P> Well, that depends on the crowd -- sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  </P> <P> How did you get started in the music business?  </P> <P> I've been in the music business ever since I could walk. It didn't come from my  family -- it wasn't a musical family. I got into music from records I bought  and from listening to the radio. WHB was our station in Kansas.  </P> <P> Who were some of your musical influences?  </P> <P> Most of it was pop music from the '60s -- the Beatles, Tommy James &amp; the  Shondells and, later, Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin.  </P> <P> You've toured extensively the last couple of years; where are most of the  Melissa fans?  </P> <P> Wow, Montreal, Canada, I guess; I'm a huge star up there. I'm also popular in  Australia, New York, Colorado and California.  </P> <P> Is there a basic Melissa fan, and is it a serious, young female English lit  major-type dressed in black?  </P> <P> Well, it used to be like that, young, female, between 20 and 30 years old,  working or in college, but not so much anymore. I'm attracting everybody now  and that's really exciting.  </P> <P> Was J. Geils right; does love stink?  </P> <P> Well, if you can't deal with it, it can. But it's not so bad.  </P> <P> Does bad love make good songs?  </P> <P> Of course, but it's my challenge to make a common experience into a good song.  </P> <P> Harry Nilsson once wrote a song called "Joy" in the early '70s. It had a line  in it that said, "If everyone was happy, there wouldn't be any love songs. . .  ." Do you agree?  </P> <P> That's true. As songwriters, we tend to deal with conflicts.  </P> <P> How would you describe Melissa music?  </P> <P> Well, it's rock 'n' roll. Hopefully, it's an intense performance of feelings  and emotions that we all experience.  </P> <P> What do you say when people tell you, "Melissa, lighten up"?  </P> <P> I say now wait a minute, I'm not actually just complaining about things. I  believe it's important to speak out and talk about things. That's the problem  with the world today, we don't talk; we just push things under the rug.  </P> <P> Can music change the world?  </P> <P> I think it has, it can and it will. I want my audience to leave with more than  they came with.  </P> <P> What's the best thing about being a rock goddess?  </P> <P> Getting free desserts at restaurants. Also, I'm able to do what I want.  </P> <P> What was your strangest gig?  </P> <P> Playing at a supermarket opening in Leavenworth, Kan.  </P> <P> You live in Los Angeles; how about those Dodgers?  </P> <P> Who?  </P> <P> How about those Royals?  </P> <P> Oh, yes, I do care about the Royals -- they're my hometown team.  </P></p>

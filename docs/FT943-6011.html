			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Monks expected to address Lib Dems: Break with tradition may invite criticism at TUC Mr John Monks, the Trades Union Congress general secretary, is expected to break with tradition and address the Liberal Democrats' conference later this month. He will also address a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference. Mr Monks is keen to loosen the trade union movement's special ties with the Labour party in favour of a more broad lobbying role with close ties to the main parties and the government. He continued to stress this modernisation strategy yesterday at the launch of a TUC-commissioned book by Robert Taylor, labour correspondent of the Financial Times. The TUC general secretary said trade unions should support rights for all workers - not just union members. 'As champions of workplace rights for all, unions can help to restore the balance between capital and labour that has been upset by 15 years of hostile anti-union legislation,' he said. He added: 'The immediate outlook is difficult but the unions are adaptable and pragmatic enough to grow.' His policies have their opponents in the trade union movement and Mr Monks' decision to address parties other than Labour may attract criticism at next week's TUC Congress. He has received an 'open-ended' invitation from the Liberal Democrats to speak to the full conference or to a fringe meeting. Mr Monks also said yesterday that he had accepted an invitation from the Law Society to speak at a fringe meeting at the Conservative conference. Both Mr Monks and Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, believe that a greater distance between the trade unions and the Labour party would be to their mutual advantage. However some union officials have raised objections to the close relations Mr Monks has been trying to foster with government ministers. The three main TUC-affiliated unions - Unison, the public-service union and the TGWU and the GMB , the two general unions - all objected to an invitation to Mr David Hunt, then employment secretary, to attend a TUC-organised conference on full employment in July. The arrival of Mr Michael Portillo to replace Mr Hunt makes a close relationship between the TUC leader and the employment secretary less likely, although Mr Monks has had an introductory meeting with Mr Portillo.

This optimistic and obscure  sentence was uttered by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last night.  Rabin once again called on the Syrian regime: Do something to  underline the seriousness of your peace intentions. Our  political correspondent Udi Segal reports:    [Begin recording] [Segal] Prime Minister Rabin is waiting  for a gesture by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in the coming  weeks. According to Rabin, Syria has to underscore its desire  for peace with actions and not only words. Rabin hinted at the  possibility of progress with the resumption of the talks with  Syria in Washington in late April.    [Rabin] I believe that some sort of better formula has been  found to clarify the problems between Syria and us.    [Segal] Rabin, who addressed the Council for Peace and  Security last night, disclosed that he had decided on a  referendum over the future of the Golan Heights in order to  signal to the Syrians that they have to do something to convince  the Israeli public about the seriousness of their intentions.  That is one of the things Rabin would like to see in the  negotiations with Syria.    [Rabin] With the Syrians, there is the test of normalization  before we discuss the line on which we will have to make a  commitment to withdraw.    [Segal] The prime minister referred to the support for the  Hebron massacre among some sectors of the Israeli public. Rabin  warned against the danger of Jewish racism.    [Rabin] The identification among sectors of Israeli the  public were larger than I had anticipated. I view that as a  danger of Israeli racism, and more precisely, Jewish racism.  [end recording]</p>

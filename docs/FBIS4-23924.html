			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 18 SAPA -- President Nelson  Mandela on Saturday [18 June] stressed it was necessary to bring  the Conservative Party [CP] under the leadership of Dr Ferdi  Hartzenberg into the democratic process in South Africa. He made  this point during an address at a conference of the Congress of  Traditional Leaders of SA (Contralesa) in Johannesburg.    Saying the creation of the volkstaat [homeland] council was  aimed at resolving the question of an Afrikaner state in a  responsible manner, Mr Mandela said discussions with Dr  Hartzenberg had already seen the CP leader shift away from the  Afrikaner weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance  Movement].    "We want to bring the right wing into the same process that  the National Party finds itself in to prevent bloodshed in our  country.    "As a result of our discussions, we got General Constand  Viljoen to move away from the rigid position of the Afrikaner  volksfront. Similarly, we have been able to get Dr Hartzenberg  away from the Eugene Terreblanche's AWB," he said to loud  applause.    "We as a government of national unity have to be responsible  when we deal with their (the Afrikaners') demands. If the  Afrikaners decide they want a volkstaat, we will deal with it in  a particular manner.    "But before that, we want to know whether they do represent  all Afrikaners in our country," Mr Mandela said.    Regarding structures for traditional African leaders, the  president said it was imperative greater urgency was given to  creating the bodies catered for in the interim constitution.    "I refer to the setting up of the houses of traditional  leaders in the provinces where this is required; the  constitution of the National Council of Traditional Leaders and  the drafting of legislation regarding the functioning of these  institution.    "In consultation with the provinces, we shall ensure that  the  relevant ministries as well as the commission on provincial  government immediately set this process in motion."    Mr Mandela added that his government recognised the equality  of all traditional leaders and kings.    "Whilst we do acknowledge that there are regional varieties,  this cannot be interpreted to mean that traditional leaders in  any given area should occupy a rung above the others. No king is  above other kings in our country. All our kings will enjoy the  same status," he said.    Also present at the conference were Minister of  Constitutional Affairs Mr Roelf Meyer, his deputy Mohammed Valli  Moosa and Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and  Technology Mrs Winnie Mandela.</p>

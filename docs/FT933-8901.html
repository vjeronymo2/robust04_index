			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Rexrodt to speed state sell-offs MR Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, yesterday promised to bring in new laws to accelerate privatisation by the country's 16 state governments, and local authorities. He sharply criticised the growth of creeping public ownership through the powerful state banks, singling out WestLB, the public sector bank in North Rhine-Westphalia, for particular attack. In an initiative clearly designed to step up public pressure for more privatisation at state and local government level, he warned that he would introduce 'instruments of torture' to get the process moving. He said that the spread of public ownership through state banks was in complete contradiction to the federal government's privatisation policies. Mr Rexrodt, who belongs to the liberal Free Democrats in Germany's ruling coalition, was not precise on the measures he intends to introduce, but said his ministry was working on necessary legislation. He proposed legal budgetary 'guidelines' as one measure, and a requirement that all public authorities must investigate private solutions to tasks currently conducted by publicly-owned bodies. His attack on North Rhine-Westphalia, and WestLB in particular, will certainly be warmly greeted by the private banking sector, which has sharply criticised the growth of the state banks. The bank is 43 per cent owned by the state government. Mr Rexrodt listed shareholdings of more than 10 per cent in nine separate public companies, including Preussag (32 per cent), the Horten retail chain (26 per cent) and VEW, the electricity generator (11 per cent), with a total value of more than DM3bn. The bank also has unlisted shareholdings in the travel groups LTU, TUI and Thomas Cook, and a string of other private companies. 'The purchase of shareholdings. . . in commercial enterprises through a state bank leads automatically to an extension of the public sector as against the private sector,' Mr Rexrodt said. 'This is diametrically opposed to the privatisation policy of the federal government.' He also called for Germany's powerful savings banks to be privatised 'as far as possible', in order to remove distortions of competition in the banking sector. As far as the federal government is concerned, he said that top priority was attached to the early privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the state telecommunications concern. There was a need to accelerate plans for privatising service areas, such as airports and ports. As a result of draft legislation approved by the German cabinet this week, the monopoly of the Federal Labour Office on job placements will be lifted, allowing private sector competition. Mr Rexrodt said that a principle of privatisation should be full national and international competition and tendering, to ensure the widest possible competition.</p>

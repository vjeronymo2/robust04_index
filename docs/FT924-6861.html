			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (3): A model for the modern - Ian Hamilton Fazey examines Lancashire Enterprises, 'a business in itself' Lancashire Enterprises is now widely regarded as a successful model for achieving regional economic development in most of Europe - except Britain. Its Luxembourg office evaluates economic development projects for the European Commission, giving the yea or nay for help from a Pounds 160m EC fund. Its specialists export their know-how directly into east European countries. Next year Khazakstan will use Lancashire expertise for a Pounds 1.2m training programme. Projects range from establishing economic development agencies to setting up business schools, or converting former Soviet barracks into managed workshops. The approach is an integrated one, involving public and private sectors jointly in investment, property development and training. Lancashire Enterprises has found a way of turning the process of regeneration into a business in itself, making substantial profits for reinvestment and further development. The scale has more than passed the government's 2-for-1 test for backing economic development, where at least Pounds 2 of private sector spending has to be levered by every public Pounds 1. The first Pounds 4m of Lancashire ratepayers' money used to launch Lancashire enterprises 10 years ago has levered Pounds 200m of private investment. It began in 1981, in the depths of the last recession, when Labour won control of Lancashire county council. If Labour was riven nationally at the time by a leftward lurch, the party in Lancashire was firmly in moderate hands. Mrs Louise Ellman, the pragmatic leader, knew the private sector was suspicious of Labour but was sure that public and private sector had to be partners. There was also an eminence grise: Mr Jim Mason, a former chairman of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, deputy chairman of the Co-operative Bank, and once the chairman of Warrington New Town Development Corporation. The first Thatcher government sacked him from this last appointment. It was nothing personal, Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, explained. Mr Mason's skills were admired - but he was a Labour supporter, and all Labour-appointed holders of similar public jobs had to go. Mrs Ellman says: 'We were faced with recession, economic decline and unemployment. We decided to try and construct a new type of economic initiative which would involve the private sector and help build their confidence to work with us.' The exact formula was worked out by Mr Len Collinson, chairman of Collinson Grant, a Manchester management consultancy. The mechanism was simple: take the product of a 2p rate - which councils were then allowed to spend locally on anything they wished - and use this as capital to fund a company which would take over Lancashire's economic development functions. The deal was a good one for Lancashire's ratepayers; the money - all Pounds 4m of it - did not disappear as non-returnable grants, but was capitalised and put to work. For all his left-of-centre credentials, Mr Mason's views were capitalistically correct. 'Where we were unique compared with all other regeneration agencies at the time is that we went into property. My experience at the CWS had taught me to borrow only against tangible assets. There was lot of bricks and mortar around.' Here was a coincidence of needs and interests. Mr Mike Hynes, now managing director, says: 'We had a shortage of places for small and medium-sized businesses, but we had a lot of old mill buildings.' These were too well-built to knock down, but in need of too much work to appeal to private sector property developers who had more profitable fish to fry in southern markets. The new agency, with Mr Mason as chairman and Mrs Ellman as his deputy, took the job on, carefully investing and nurturing unused capital while doing so. The council topped up resources as needed. The approach attracted cross-party support and private sector partners both on the agency's board and in projects. An early test was the decision of Turner and Newall to shut down in Lancaster, where the company occupied a 15-acre site in the town centre. Lancashire Enterprises bought it for Pounds 9m. Nine years on, the site now houses 120 companies employing 850 - 250 more than when Turner and Newall left - and has achieved a 9 per cent return on the Pounds 13m used to develop it. Lancashire Enterprises put in about half and got most of the rest from the European Investment Bank. Other big projects have included the redevelopment of large sections of Leeds-Liverpool canal, a derelict relic predating even the industrial revolution; Eanam Wharf, a rundown canalside part of central Blackburn; the redevelopment of Hardman's Mill at Rawtenstall; and a systematic training programme to improve the skills of the old British Leyland workforce at Leyland, so that they and their factory could successfully transfer to Volvo bus manufacture. Lancashire Enterprises also set up venture and development capital funds to finance new and growing businesses in the county and established a network of 'hands-on' help to improve survival rates. It now has two offices in Brussels, as well as the one in Luxembourg. Grants and work have been the reward. The ultimate test, however, came when the government forced all local authorities to stop trading activities. Lancashire Enterprises, although at arm's length from the county council, fell foul of the legislation and was forced to privatise itself by going public. Lancashire Enterprises itself now employs 230 people, compared with six when it started. It is a profitable and successful property owner. The question is why Lancashire Enterprises is without much national honour in Britain, when it is so well-regarded elsewhere in Europe. The answer has to be political. Capitalistic and profitable as it has been in practice, it is the child of a Labour administration. It is interventionist and its directors and managers believe in economic planning, at least at regional level. This was anathema to government in the Thatcher decade. But it works, encouraging private sector investment, reclaiming derelict land, bringing seemingly dead buildings back to life, and making money while doing so.</p>

Briefing newsmen in Islamabad today, a Foreign Office  spokesman recalled that Pakistan had given two non-papers to  India on the 18th of January for a peaceful solution of Jammu  and Kashmir issue and other problems. He said it appears from  reply to these papers that India is going back from a meaningful  and purposeful discussion on the Jammu and Kashmir issue as  agreed upon between the two countries.    The spokesman said the Indian reply appears to be a  propaganda exercise camouflaged in diplomatic language and the  Indians have merely reiterated their old inflexible position on  Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

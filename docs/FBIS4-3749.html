			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "Regional News Hookup" </F> program]    [Text] Recently, the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's  Government approved and relayed a circular, issued by the  regional radio-TV department and other relevant departments,  which called on all areas to implement the State Council's  regulations on control of ground facilities for receiving  satellite TV broadcasts.    The circular said: In October last year, the State Council  promulgated the Regulations on Control of Ground Facilities for  Receiving Satellite TV Broadcasts. The Ministry of Radio, Film,  and Television recently promulgated the Rules for Implementing  the Regulations on Control of Ground Facilities for Receiving  Satellite TV Broadcasts. This is of great significance for  placing the production, sale, and use of ground facilities for  receiving satellite TV broadcasts under control in accordance  with the law; ensuring orderly development; promoting the  building of a socialist spiritual civilization; and maintaining  social stability.    According with the regulations and implementation rules, and  in light of the situation in our region in which the  installation of ground facilities is in a chaotic state;  development of such facilities is being promoted recklessly  without out a plan; and the contents of TV programs is out of  control, the following five requirements have been set to  strengthen control over ground facilities for receiving  satellite TV broadcasts in our region. All prefectural  administrations, the Lhasa City People's Government, the  people's governments of various counties and cities, and various  commissions and offices under the regional government should  earnestly implement them.    1. You must vigorously publicize the regulations'  guidelines. Under the leadership of the local governments, radio  and television administrations in all prefectures and cities,  should, together with public security, state security,  industrial, and commercial departments, thoroughly understand  the documents and earnestly implement them in light of local  conditions.    2. You should register and check local cable TV systems and  ground facilities for receiving satellite TV broadcasts. If  problems are discovered in the course of inspection, you should  handle them in accordance with the relevant documents.    3. You should rectify the situation after carrying out a  checkup. Radio and television administrations of all  prefectures and cities must carry out a strict checkup of  permits. Old ones should be changed. If ground facilities for  receiving satellite TV broadcasts set up by individuals prior to  October last year must be preserved because of special  circumstances, they must be reported to the relevant radio and  television department before 5 May in order to obtain permits  according to procedures. Units which obtained permits prior to  5 October last year to receive overseas TV programs must be  urged to submit their permits for reexamination by a radio and  television department prior to 5 April. Units and individuals  that have set up and used ground facilities for receiving  satellite TV broadcasts but have not obtained permits according  to procedures should report to the departments concerned  according to provisions stated in the rules for implementing the  regulations. Units and individuals whose facilities are found  to meet the set requirements must obtain a permit before 5 May.  Units which have set up two ground facilities for receiving  satellite TV broadcasts but have not obtained permits to receive  overseas TV programs must dismantle the antenna for receiving  overseas TV programs. Units which have installed only one  satellite antenna must readjust their antenna to receive only  domestic programs. Measures for technological safety should be  adopted in accordance with regulations and implementation rules  to deal with units which are authorized to receive overseas TV  programs.    4. Efforts will be made to establish cable TV stations.    5. Problems should be handled in accordance with the  provisions contained in the regulations and with the procedures  and functions set by the implementation rules.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo under pressure STRONG speculation regarding board changes at Lasmo, the independent oil exploration group, left the shares trailing the market yesterday. They finished a turbulent session off 3 1/2 at 137 1/2 p, after 136p, as the company denied that the finance director was about to resign. A company spokesman said: 'There is no truth at all in the story.' The rumour of the departure of Mr Michael Pavia as Lasmo finance chief is said to have rumbled in market circuits for some time, but it was yesterday boosted by provincial brokers. Some market watchers have dismissed the revival of the speculation as an effort to head off a good performance in the shares. One industry watcher said that the resignation of Mr Pavia would not be surprising and that the finance director was one of a couple of top executives seen as vulnerable since Lasmo's acquisition of Ultramar in late 1991. Although he added: 'It would be a bit of a retrospective action.' Market talk in the summer that Mr John Walmsley, the former finance director of Enterprise Oil, could be attracted to such a position at Lasmo was given a new lease of life. Trading in Lasmo stock was above average at 5m.</p>

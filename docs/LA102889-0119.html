			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN A LIFE IS PUBLIC, HOW MUCH IS PRIVATE?;  </P> <P> DOCUDRAMA: EX-PRESIDENT NIXON TRIES TO STOP ABC'S "THE FINAL DAYS," BUT  LESS-WELL-KNOWN PEOPLE CAN LOSE TV RIGHTS TOO.  </P> <P> Whose life is it, anyway?  </P> <P> * Fifteen years after Watergate, Richard Nixon objects so strongly to his  portrayal in the ABC dramatization of "The Final Days" that he tries to stop  production of the three-hour docudrama. In letters to executives at ABC and  AT&amp;T, the sponsor of the show, lawyers for the former President charge that  his right to privacy is being violated and imply that he can sue for libel.  According to his lawyers, Nixon's ability to do his own version of events is  impinged upon by the TV drama, which is based on the best-selling account of  Nixon's last months in office by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. ABC, standing  by what it says is the fairness and accuracy of the TV movie, goes ahead with  the show. "The Final Days" is scheduled to air Sunday at 8 p.m. (ABC changed  its mind Friday on when the movie will be rescheduled should it be preempted by  a fifth game of the World Series, moving it back from Nov. 5 to Dec. 17.)  </P> <P> * In 1982, Elizabeth Taylor files a suit against ABC and the producers of a  planned TV biography. The actress charges that the unauthorized film infringes  on her ability to profit from her own life story. "I am my own commodity,"  Taylor says at a news conference. "I am my own industry." The TV movie, she  maintains, "is completely fictionalized -- unless there was somebody under the  carpet or under the bed." Taylor's case never comes to trial, and the drama is  not made. ABC today says the project was dropped for creative reasons.  </P> <P> * Two months after he was convicted of multiple murders, Richard Ramirez, the  infamous California "Night Stalker," is the focus of an NBC docudrama that will  air Nov. 12. The "Night Stalker" movie joins a variety of upcoming fact-based  TV dramas that are moving from headline to TV screen while the event still  flashes in viewers' recollection of the evening news. Among the upcoming  fact-based dramas on CBS, NBC and ABC are the story of Hedda Nusbaum, the woman  whose lover was convicted of beating to death their illegally adopted daughter;  "Small Sacrifices," with Farrah Fawcett as a woman who shot her children, and  the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.  </P> <P> In some docudramas, the formerly anonymous people who happened into the  spotlight have welcomed the dramatizations. But, in other instances, the people  would have prefered to be left alone.  </P> <P> Whose life is it, anyway? The question involves legal and ethical issues raised  by the proliferation of fact-based TV movies. The most compelling conflict in  docudramas goes to the heart of the Constitution: the confrontation between the  movie makers' right to free speech under the First Amendment -- and the value  of open discussion to the society -- versus the individual's right to privacy.  </P> <P> This is a murky area, and it depends on who the person is and what they've done  in the past," says Robert Levine, a New York lawyer who specializes in creative  rights. "With celebrities, it's not so much a question of privacy as a question  of who retains the rights to commercialize their experience. There's a big  difference between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Nixon. She's spent her whole  life building up the property values of her life. With 'The Final Days,' you're  dealing with events that are part of national history. Nixon's a public figure  whose claim to own history is not consistent with a free society."  </P> <P> Although Taylor never had her day in court to test her legal theory, the  argument still concerns those who favor the broadest interpretation of the  guarantees of free speech.  </P> <P> "One has a commercial right to exploit one's name, and Elizabeth Taylor has the  right by and large to have facts told about her that are truthful," says Martin  Garbus, a New York lawyer who specializes in First Amendment cases. "But Taylor  is a public figure, and anybody can make a movie about her."  </P> <P> The First Amendment protects what is said about public figures, unless it's  said with a knowing or reckless disregard for the truth. That may lead to  unseemly excesses in the media, Garbus acknowledges, but he argues that  censorship is a far less attractive alternative.  </P> <P> "People should be able to say nearly anything about an elected public  official," he maintains. "If you start to decide what is protected and what's  not, you get into very dangerous areas."  </P> <P> Nixon and his lawyers argued otherwise in their letters to ABC and AT&amp;T.  The former President should have been consulted on the TV movie, a source close  to Nixon's lawyers said recently, and now has lost some ability to, in effect,  merchandise his own version of events.  </P> <P> "They've misappropriated his likeness to sell telephones," the Nixon source  says.  </P> <P> No one has an absolute right to privacy, and, generally, people who are well  known have fewer privacy rights than unknowns. Yet average citizens can lose  some of their rights if they become part of a news event.  </P> <P> "Determining the difference between a public figure and a private figure can be  very complicated," Garbus notes. "People who are public can become private, and  private people can become public."  </P> <P> The family of murder victim Jennifer Levin, for example, did not cooperate in  the making of the "Preppie Murder" movie that aired on ABC recently, yet they  were depicted. According to attorney Garbus, the Levin family fell into "a hazy  area" where they may be public figures when it comes to what was known and seen  in court by the news media at the time of Robert Chambers' trial, and private  figures when it comes to intimate details of their private lives.  </P> <P> Being a participant in a celebrated court case is one likely way to find one's  life turned into a book, play or TV movie. Court testimony is a matter of  public record, and it can be used in docudramas, such as an upcoming NBC movie  about the white youths who chased a black man to his death in Howard Beach in  New York. In some cases -- among them the trial of Jean Harris on NBC and the  trial of Bernhard Goetz on PBS -- the court transcripts simply have been  fashioned into TV courtroom drama.  </P> <P> Although they may be able legally to portray a variety of people in docudramas,  producers say that, as a practical matter, they often try to gain the  cooperation of their subjects. That ensures the movie makers access to the full  story -- and guards against possible lawsuits.  </P> <P> For a 1988 movie about Uli Derickson, the flight attendant who was a heroine in  a 1985 hijacking, NBC did buy her rights. "We could have done the story from  the public record without her permission," says Don Zachary, vice president of  legal affairs at NBC. "But we wanted to portray a human side, how she felt,  what her relationship with her mother was."  </P> <P> "I always go to a highly visible public figure and offer them the opportunity  to participate," says Louis Rudolph, who has produced many historical  docudramas, including TV movies on Lyndon B. Johnson and Dwight Eisenhower. "In  no way are we giving script approval, but they can look at the script and tell  us what they know."  </P> <P> But he says he did not follow that practice with his latest film, "Small  Sacrifices," an ABC movie airing Nov. 12 in which Farrah Fawcett plays Diane  Downs, a woman who shot her children. Rudolph says he made no attempt to  contact the subject, instead buying the rights to the best-selling book on the  case by Ann Rule.  </P> <P> Neither he nor Rule paid any money to Downs for her story, Rudolph says. "That  would be feeding into sociopathic behavior."  </P> <P> In fact, in many states, criminals convicted of committing crimes with victims  are prohibited from profiting from dramatizations of their story under  so-called "Son of Sam" laws, named for a notorious murder case in New York.  </P> <P> As for "The Final Days," Alfred Schneider, ABC's vice president for broadcast  standards and practices, says that the network not only discussed the reporting  in the 1976 book with co-author Bob Woodward but also consulted other sources  of information about the revelations it contained.  </P> <P> So far, Nixon has taken no legal action against the movie. But, in a personal  protest, he canceled his AT&amp;T phone service and switched to a competitor.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince Mayor-elect Evans Paul has rejected  the proposal of Assistant-Mayor Joseph Gerald Salomon who said  on 17 March that he was ready to meet with the Port-au-Prince  mayor in the presence of the press. I have nothing to say to  somebody who is not credible -- Salomon must respect the chain  of command, Evans Paul stated.    [Begin recording, in Creole]    [Paul] I am not in an election campaign with Salomon. I have  no show to put on with Salomon. I am taking an administrative  step. It is within the scope of the administrative step that I  was trying to see if he could understand that he had a  responsibility. But I will not engage in demagoguery with  somebody with no credibility like Salomon. What would I discuss  with somebody who does not believe in democracy, who does not  believe in principles, who maintains an anarchical stance, and  who rejects the work of an institution? What would I say to  somebody who is setting obstacles despite all my efforts? What  would I say? I have already said all that I have to say. I  said it in the letter I wrote. Salomon has said that he does  not want dialogue, that he does not want compromise. If he does  not want dialogue and compromise, what would be the reason for a  meeting in front of the press? (?Because) if you cannot submit  yourself to the discipline of the administration, what would I  have to tell you? I have no time to waste. I have much work to  do. I can compromise. I can make concessions. I can hold a  dialogue, but first of all there must hope that the dialogue  will produce results.    [Valet] Furthermore, Paul has required guarantees before  sending money to the Port-au-Prince City Hall, fearing that this  money would be misused, as was the case this past December, he  says.    [Paul] We explained thoroughly that Salomon has created any  and all impossible situations so as to allow us to carry out the  payroll properly. [sentence as heard] Normally, we have a  responsibility toward city hall funds. We cannot allow  ourselves to send money to a city hall where a lot of people  arbitrarily do whatever they want with this money, as happened  with the payroll we made in December when a lot of people -- not  the least, I can cite the name of Assistant-Mayor Jocelyne  Sablon -- did not receive their salaries.    We have state employees who are ready to issue the payroll.  But we must be able to make sure that the persons to whom we  give the checks are really those entitled to them. Then they  will give us a signed receipt. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Dixon Motor will reverse into Plateau Mining DIXON MOTOR Holdings, a Yorkshire-based, multi-franchised motor dealership group with 12 outlets, is coming to the Unlisted Securities Market by reversing into Plateau Mining, the former natural resources group which has been fighting a hostile bid. Guinness Mahon, Plateau's adviser, said the enlarged company, which will change its name to Dixon Motors, will be valued at between Pounds 12m and Pounds 15m when dealings begin on May 25. It calculated that the proposals are worth more than 6p a share to existing Plateau holders compared with last August's suspension price of 3p and the revised all-share offer from Kingstream Resources, a small Australian exploration company, of 5.18p. Plateau was originally formed from most of the Robertson Group's mining interests and started trading in January 1990 at 90p. Mr David Hickey of Guinness Mahon said Dixon made pre-tax profits of about Pounds 400,000 on a turnover of Pounds 45m in 1992. He said Dixon would have to wait a year for a full quote because, although it had existed for 20 years and had increased profits during the recession, technically it had only a two-year profits record since the acquisition of some assets from the receiver of Corton Beach, the mini-conglomerate. Plateau will acquire Dixon for about Pounds 8.6m, to be satisfied by the issue of 8.2m new ordinary shares at 105p each. Another Pounds 3.5m of shares will be placed with institutional investors and Pounds 1.5m of the cash raised will go to 3i, which has been backing Dixon. The rest of the money will provide additional working capital. Dixon's other shareholders have agreed to retain their new shares for 12 months. Plateau has already announced the sale of its remaining mineral interests to Delta Gold and the Delta shares acquired will be returned to existing Plateau shareholders. Mr Hickey said shareholders representing about 70 per cent of Plateau were in favour of the Dixon deal but Kingstream's adviser, Ionian Corporate Finance, which has now posted details of the hostile offer to Plateau shareholders, said: 'Our position remains the same. We have no intention of giving up.'</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors The Volkswagen/Audi import franchise in the UK has appointed a new titular head little more than a month since the ink dried on its formal transfer from Lonrho to the German motor group itself. However, the appointment as chairman of Detlef Wittig (above), head of export sales at the Wolfsburg parent, will have little impact on the day-to-day running of the operation based in Milton Keynes. Wittig will be non-executive and remain in Wolfsburg. Previous VAG (UK) chairmen have similarly been non-executive, and drawn from Lonrho. Wittig himself is no stranger to the British operation, having been a non-executive director since 1989 - when VW first began flagging its intention to take back the franchise from Lonrho by beefing up its board with Wolfsburg appointees.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Leipzig's lyrical sound A pair of beautifully-matched flutes opened this concert, followed by wind chords exactly in tune and well together. It is not necessary for an orchestra to choose a showpiece to make an impact at the beginning of a concert and noisy music has never been the Leipzig Gewandhaus's forte. This year the orchestra is celebrating its 250th anniversary. It is worth stopping for a moment to consider what that means. Founded in 1743, the 'Konzertverein', as it was known in its earliest days, dates from the period when Bach was still active in the city. Among British orchestras, there is none that can claim a comparable tradition. London's oldest symphony orchestra (the LSO) was founded in 1904; the Halle dates from 1858, though it also had antecedents. Since 1970 the post of Kapellmeister in Leipzig has been held by Kurt Masur, who has proved a noble guardian of the tradition. It is easy to believe that the unforced musicianship that he obtains is a way of playing that stretches back through the orchestra's history. The sound is soft, lyrical, warm, discreet, if short of a cutting edge from wind or brass when the whole orchestra is playing. Each of the three composers on the programme for the first of the Leipzig Gewandhaus's two anniversary concerts at the Barbican either conducted the orchestra or had close connections with it. Mendelssohn presided over a crucial period as Kapellmeister from 1835 to 1847. Not only those first wind chords, but also the grace of the strings made his Overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream an ideal opening choice. Schumann was an important influence in the same period and his widow, Clara, continued to perform with the orchestra as a pianist until 1889. The Barbican has already seen some notable Schumann concerts this year and so Masur faced greater competition here. With their respective chamber orchestras, Leppard had more buoyancy, Harnoncourt more thrust and energy. What the Leipzig performance of the Second Symphony offered was a natural sense of scale, of how one phrase should relate to another, one passage to the next. Later in the 19th century Brahms played his piano concertos and conducted his symphonies in Leipzig. At this concert his Violin Concerto (premiere in Leipzig 1879) was played with impressive concentration, but a less than idiomatic range of colour by Viktoria Mullova. For the true Brahms sound one had only to listen to the orchestra, mellow and blended as ever: the Leipzig Gewandhaus tradition looks secure for many years yet.

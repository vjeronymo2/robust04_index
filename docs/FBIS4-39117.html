			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business SNARK Transcaucasia Economic News" 6th </F> issue for 28 May - 4 Jun]    [Text] Tbilisi -- A protocol has been signed between  Georgia and Russia on establishment of coordination center aimed  to distribute the financial and material aid. The decision was  assumed to realize the last-year September 14 agreement "On  economic reconstruction of region in the zone of  Georgian-Ossetian conflict".    However, as SNARK reporter was told in the International  Economic Relations Department of Georgian Foreign Ministry, the  Russian side has not yet allocated the 5b rubles promised for  reconstruction. Also the decision on Russian 20b credit to  Georgia for 1994 has not been made yet, though the corresponding  agreement was reached during Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia.  Russian side, the department says, puts forward the requirement  that Georgia should liquidate the 10b debt by credits granted to  her last year.</p>

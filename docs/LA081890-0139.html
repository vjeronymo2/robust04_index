			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Care Enterprises Inc., a Tustin-based nursing-facility company, posted a net  loss of $22,000 for the second quarter, compared to a net loss of $455,000 for  last year's second quarter. Revenue dropped 16% to $57.3 million from $68.4  million. The company attributed the decline to fewer Medicare patients because  of the repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act and to fewer nursing  facilities operated during the second quarter of 1990.  </P></p>

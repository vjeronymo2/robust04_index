			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, February 14 (XINHUA) -- UN Security  Council members today strongly urged an end to the siege of  Sarajevo, with some stressing the use of force while others  advocating dialogue and negotiation.    The debate took place in an urgent meeting, which was called  at the request of the Russian Federation, Bosnia and Herzegovina  and Pakistan.    Participants in the debate are ambassadors of the 15 council  members and representatives of 38 UN member states, including  Belgium, Hungary, Colombia and Senegal, which are interested in  the discussion.    Jean-Bernard Merimee, French ambassador to the UN, said that  "the conflict (in Bosnia) has now reached a turning point, which  we should all be aware of."    The first priority, he said, was to lift the siege of  Sarajevo, begin its demilitarization and progress toward placing  that city under temporary UN administration.    However, he stressed, this must not interfere with the  recent  NATO decision demanding the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their  heavy weapons from Sarajevo before February 20 or face air  strikes.    Bosnia's UN Ambassador Muhamed Secirbegovic said the  precedent set by the NATO threat was only a first step and he  called for the lifting of the siege around five other Muslim  cities designated as UN "safe areas."    He said relevant Security Council resolutions did not  require  any further action by the council, and "the withdrawal of the  Serbian forces and their weapons should be executed fully in a  timely manner."    Chen Jian, China's UN ambassador, said at the debate that  the  Chinese Government is opposed to the use or threat of force.    On NATO's threat of force, Chen said that NATO should "act  very prudently and refrain from taking any hasty action."    With regard to the use of air power in Bosnia, Chen said  that  it should be limited to self-defense by the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in that country.    The eventual settlement of the Bosnian crisis, Chen said,  should continue to be sought in accordance with the principles  set forth by the International Conference on the Former  Yugoslavia and relevant Security Council resolutions.    "The parties concerned in Bosnia and Hercegovina have  recently held several rounds of talks," the Chinese ambassador  said. "We hope all the endeavors of the international community  will genuinely help promote the peace process toward a political  settlement."    Russia's Ambassador, Yuliy Vorontsov, also spoke of a  political settlement, saying that "it is essential to time and  again spell out our support for the negotiating procedure in  order to reach a settlement to the Bosnian conflict as a whole."    In view of the fact that previous ceasefire agreements and  other agreements between the parties had frequently broken down,  Vorontsov said, "it is obviously extremely important for the  Security Council to back up its demands by a proper decision for  a ceasefire and a withdrawal of heavy weapons in and around  Sarajevo."    Madeleine Albright, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,  said during the debate that diplomacy alone was not enough and  it must be backed by a willingness to use force.    "It is only force plus diplomacy that can stop the slaughter  in Sarajevo and break the stalemate in Geneva," she added.    However, the U.S. ambassador said, her government believed  the Bosnian conflict should be resolved at the negotiating  table, not on the battlefield.    "Neither NATO, nor this council," she said, "can or should  impose a settlement upon the parties, for an imposed settlement  will not be a lasting settlement."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Mun Chae-chol from Washington] </F>   [Text] North Korea has agreed to resume the North-South  dialogue at the same time nuclear inspections begin, and, as a  result, it is expected that the North and South will be able to  exchange special envoys soon.    In the working-level contact which continued for the second  day in New York this morning, Korean time, the United States and  North Korea reportedly have virtually finished drafting the  letter of agreement which contains the four principles: The  International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear  inspections on 1 March; at the same time, the discontinuation of  the Team Spirit exercise for this year will be announced;  North-South dialogue for the exchange of special envoys will  start; and the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks  will resume next month.    In drafting the agreement, the United States and North Korea  had different views on the timing of the North-South exchange of  special envoys and on the third round of U.S.-North Korea  high-level talks. However, North Korea agreed that it would  affirmatively examine the North-South contact for the exchange  of special envoys in case South Korea so proposes. As a result,  a compromise was reached.    The United States agreed that the third round of U.S.-North  Korea high-level talks would be held late March on the condition  that North Korea resumes the North-South dialogue.    If North Korea obtains approval for the agreement with the  United States from the Pyongyang authorities, the sides are  expected to exchange the final letter of agreement at the  third-day working-level contact which will open late this  evening Korean time. However, Washington and New York sources  have said that the sides would not release a joint communique  because their meeting is a working-level contact.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign buying keeps Nikkei buoyant In spite of earlier cautiousness following Thursday's fall on overseas stock markets, active buying by foreign investors supported share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average rose a moderate 37.90 to 19,803.38, up 4.4 per cent on the week, on buying concentrated on multimedia related high-technology stocks. The index fell to a day's low of 19,579.16, then rose to a high of 19,890.89 as active foreign buying absorbed selling by institutional investors and arbitrageurs. Volume was 430m shares against 483m. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said buying orders from continental Europe were growing. However, most domestic institutions remained inactive as corporate profit-taking was expected to continue through to the first half of March. Declines led advances by 540 to 481 with 158 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 2.25 to 1,609.87 and the Nikkei 300 gained 0.55 to 298.07. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.39 to 1,345.23. High-technology issues gained ground. Hitachi, the day's most active issue, rose Y22 to Y937, while Sanyo Electric gained Y14 to Y486. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y1,000 to Y952,000 on reports that the company would apply for a price rise in local calls to the ministry of post and communications next month. East Japan Railway advanced Y2,000 to Y505,000. Car companies were also popular among foreign investors, with Toyota Motor up Y50 to Y1,990 and Nissan Motor rising Y22 to Y840. Banks were lower on corporate profit-taking. Sakura Bank declined Y40 to Y1,470 and Nippon Credit Bank Y70 to Y4,770. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 129.39 to 21,944.88 in volume of 62.4m shares. Roundup The region remained turbulent yesterday. Manila and Bangkok were closed for holidays. AUSTRALIA fell to its lowest close in seven weeks, driven down by declines on overseas markets and weaker futures and bonds. The All Ordinaries index lost 48.2 to 2,148.8, off 3.3 per cent across the week. Stocks were hit across the board, with some ADollars 480m of option expiries boosting volume to 387m shares valued at ADollars 1.1bn.

The blue chip index lost 331.77 to 10,100.25, for a 6.7 per cent fall on the week. Turnover climbed to HKDollars 7.22bn from Thursday's final tally of HKDollars 4.39bn. China Gas rebounded from a low of HKDollars 18.30 to end 20 cents higher at HKDollars 19.60 after announcing a 21.3 per cent rise in 1993 profits. SINGAPORE was weakened by worries about further US interest rate rises and the poor performances in other major markets. The Straits Times Industrials index fell 27.85 to 2,357.39, 1 per cent higher over the week. The market for speculative Malaysian shares traded over the counter was unaffected by a Malaysian 'Buy British Last' policy but institutional traders thought that British investors might be disinclined to commit more funds in Malaysian stocks. KUALA LUMPUR finished off the day's lows on afternoon bargain hunting after shares took a tumble in the morning due to weaker overseas markets and concerns over Malaysia's retaliation to British allegations of an 'arms for aid' controversy. The composite index closed 22.30 lower at 1,124.11, but still 3.5 per cent higher over the week. NEW ZEALAND reacted to losses elsewhere in the region with the NZSE-40 capital index down 52.99 at 2,216.28. The index has lost 3 per cent on the week. Carter Holt Harvey and Lion Nathan declined 15 cents to NZDollars 3.70and 23 cents to Dollars 3.75 respectively.

Volume rose to 9.3m shares from yesterday's 5.6m shares. Overseas funds took a keen interest in energy stocks after the government announced incentives to power industries. BOMBAY rose sharply on across the board buying by speculators and foreign and domestic institutions ahead of Monday's annual budget, which is expected to lower corporate income tax and the custom and excise duties. The BSE 30-share index rose 104.63 or 2.5 per cent to 4,236.96 for an 8.2 per cent rise over the week.</p>

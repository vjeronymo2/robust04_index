			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Yabloko group leader Grigoriy </F> Yavlinskiy by Pavel Kozlov in Moscow on 11 January: "Reforms To  Launch True Democracy"; first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, the 41-year-old economist and  leader of the Yabloko (apple) group, has brought 26 deputies to  the Duma.    [Kozlov] What do you think of the Duma's first day?    [Yavlinskiy] After 3-4 October there was no alternative but  to go to the polls, even with all their faults, of which we were  aware from the outset. I think that this Duma will do its job  if it acts basically as a constitutional body. It must create  items of fundamental importance for Russia, such as the  electoral law and the civil code; it must prepare Russia to  elect a real parliament, the president, and local governments.    [Kozlov] But, as of today, is it capable of getting on top  of  this job? We have already seen how the first few hours went by  in a state of tumult...    [Yavlinskiy] The Duma today represents a normal parliament  in  a country riddled with conflict. If you paid a visit to the  parliament in, say, South Korea or Taiwan, you would come away  with the conviction that, in comparison, today's session went  off perfectly smoothly. If this Duma will keep people from  shooting at one another, it will have achieved its goal.    [Kozlov] Is serious conflict likely to emerge between the  deputies and the president?    [Yavlinskiy] It is to be hoped that this can be avoided. The  Constitution is drafted to confer full powers on the president,  so the Duma hardly ever debates issues that impinge on the  president's functions. At the same time, however, the president  is responsible for what happens in the country.    [Kozlov] How long might this Duma be expected to last?    [Yavlinskiy] It was elected for a fairly short term, two  years. I do not know if it will last the full course, but in any  case I do not want to make pessimistic forecasts. If you think  that dissolution would be followed by a better Duma, I have  grave doubts on the subject. Moreover, we have had extremely  tranquil parliaments, a prime example of peace and quiet being  the Soviet Parliament, where even votes against the regime were  cast in a predetermined scenario.    [Kozlov] What would you like your role in the Duma to be?    [Yavlinskiy] I want the Duma to perform tasks that I regard  as extremely important. Actually, many things in the situation  that we are in invite objections and doubts, and these could be  handled in one of two ways. A number of inquiries could be  opened into a multitude of events and issues, or the situation  could be accepted as it is, bearing in mind that, however you  look at it, over the next two years Russia must prepare for free  democratic elections of both the president and a new, authentic,  parliament.</p>

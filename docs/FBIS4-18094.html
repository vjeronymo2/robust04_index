			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["laho"-signed report: "Talks With European Union </F> Concluded"]    [Text] Brussels -- The accession talks of the European  Union [EU] with Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway were  concluded on Wednesday evening [30 March] when the last open  chapter on institutions was settled. An improvement for Austria  was achieved regarding its representation in the EU bodies. It  will be allowed to send 21 (instead of 20) deputies to the  European Parliament, and 12 each (instead of 11) to the Economic  and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.  Austria's ambassador to the European Union, Manfred Scheich,  stressed that the compromise on the blocking minority in the EU  Council of Ministers adopted earlier is the "result of political  common sense."</p>

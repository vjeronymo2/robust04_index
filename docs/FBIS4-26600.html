			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that it was  extremely important to stabilize the ranks of Hong Kong's civil  servants in the transitional period.    "This is because Hong Kong's administrative work has to rely  on its civil servants.    "The smooth transfer of power and stable transition as well  as its special administrative region's management after 1997  will also rely on them," said Qian at a meeting with a  delegation from the Association of the Former Senior Civil  Servants of Hong Kong, led by former Secretary for Land and  Works Chan Nai-keong.    Qian said that both Sino-British Joint Statement and the  Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region make  clear stipulations on the continuous employment of civil  servants.    The aim is to maintain the civil servants' stabilization, he  added.    Qian described the delegation's visit to Beijing as of great  significance, adding: "We support you to set up the association  of the former senior civil servants of Hong Kong."    Qian said after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, civil  servants will serve the government of its special administrative  region and the Hong Kong residents as well. This is in  conformity with loving the motherland and loving Hong Kong, he  said.    Qian expressed the hope that the Hong Kong civil servants  will do their best to be responsible in their work and serve the  Hong Kong residents well in the remaining years of the  transitional period.    He stressed that Hong Kong is a center of finance, economy  and information and also an economic city, so administrative  management plays a leading role and its high efficiency should  be ensured.    Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  of the State Council, took part in the meeting.</p>

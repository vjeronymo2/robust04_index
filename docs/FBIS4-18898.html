			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Madness' To Scrap 3-Way </F> Bargaining, Modigliani Warns"]    [Text] (ANSA) Venice, April 9 -- The possibility of Italy's  new right-wing government doing away with Italy's traditional  three-way wage bargaining between the government, unions and  employers was today described as "madness" by Nobel  Prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani.    "The one madness of the new government would be eliminating  the three-way table with unions and employers. Only with joint  bargaining would it be possible to plan a further drop in  inflation and guarantee real wages via exchange-rate policy,"  Modigliani said on the sidelines of a conference here.    After noting that the pledge of media magnate turned  politician Silvio Berlusconi to create a million jobs in the  next two years is "conceivable, but extremely unlikely,"  Modigliani said that a separate Italian policy aimed at boosting  employment was "unthinkable unless the whole of Europe moves to  bring down interest rates."    "One of the causes of Italy's present crisis," he explained,  "is the 1970's incomes policy, with its logic of wages as an  independent variable compared to prices. This drove wages above  the country's productivity levels, spelling an increase in  inflation and the net result that Italy's international  competitiveness fell.    "But now even the trade unions have realised there is  nothing  to be gained from hiking wages. The three-way table allows the  `internationalisation' of problems, so that the overall effects  of demands are seen. This must be pursued."    Modigliani said he was not in a position to judge the  economic programme of Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, shaped  by monetarist Antonio Martino, "until they say what spending  cuts they are going to make after they've cut taxes." But he  stressed that "it will be fundamental to generate an increase in  domestic demand, while waiting for Europe to wake up."    He "did not know" why the government's economic report  (released yesterday) revised growth down from 1.6 to 1.3 percent  this year. "I am more optimistic, and am hoping for 2 percent,  because all the conditions for a small recovery are there. But  I don't think a real growth dynamic will start up if the  continent as a whole does not move."    Modigliani put pension reform high on the next government's  priority list. "You need to change the concept of welfare  state: you shouldn't promise a pension proportionate to what was  received during one's working years, but instead guarantee a  vital minimum for all. The rest should be left to voluntary  fund payments by the individual."    On privatisations, he expressed full confidence that "the  entire process was followed with the selfsame care." "I know  the Treasury experts who dealed with the procedures: there was  nothing murky going on. Of course, it was impossible to sell at  a higher price than the one set, otherwise you wouldn't have had  any buyers."</p>

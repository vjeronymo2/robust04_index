			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW COVER WON'T IMPROVE CONTENT  </P> <P> I read your article in last week's Long Beach section in absolute disbelief and  anger.  </P> <P> Instead of taking a look at external issues of "sprucing up Long Beach's tired  image," why doesn't the city address some of the internal issues that will make  Long Beach a more desirable and safe area to live?  </P> <P> The city can't just sit back idly and wish the real internal problems to go  away, especially when the statistics were on the following pages of the same  paper, "Murders Up 25% in L.B. From Same Period in '89."  </P> <P> Let's face it, to simply put up a wall to "cover up ugly spots" and call it a  "site enhancement" it will soon be a target of the graffiti kings. And how much  money will be needed to budget and continuously repaint our site enhancements?  </P> <P> I agree, it is essential to maintain a positive city image. One can always put  a beautiful cover on a bad book, but it won't change the content. It will still  be a bad book.  </P> <P> MINDY PERKINS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

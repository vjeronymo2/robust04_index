			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / SFO conviction rate falls to 59% The conviction rate of the Serious Fraud Office fell to 59 per cent in the year to April from 71 per cent in 1992/93, it was announced yesterday. After another controversial year in which the SFO was criticised for its handling of the prosecutions of Mr Asil Nadir, former Polly Peck chairman, and disgraced financier Mr Roger Levitt, Mr George Staple, SFO director, said the office should be judged on its overall performance. During the year 23 trials involving 54 defendants were completed and in 20 of them one or more of the principal defendants had been convicted. Of the 32 convicted, 12 pleaded guilty and 25 received custodial sentences. That was consistent with the SFO's record over the previous five years and represented a successful outcome in over 80 per cent of cases, he said. The Levitt and Nadir cases represented the low points of the past 12 months. It was 'difficult for a prosecuting agency to act in the glare of publicity which inevitably diminishes public regard (for the SFO),' he said, adding that he was confident that success in the majority of cases was acting as an effective deterrent against serious fraud. The SFO has seen a marked drop-off in its workload and had just 48 active cases on its books at the beginning of April, compared with 57 the year before. Mr Staple said he could not comment on the Treasury review of the SFO and the fraud investigation group of the Crown Prosecution Service. The review, believed to recommend merger of the two bodies, is being considered by the Attorney General and is expected to be published before parliament rises for the summer. The SFO accepts it will be judged over the coming 12 months on its handling of the high profile Maxwell and Brent Walker prosecutions. It also faces a possible change in its status to an executive agency. The SFO's Pounds 20.8m budget for 1993/94 was underspent by Pounds 1.97m due to the downturn in caseload. The 1994/95 budget has been set at Pounds 19.6m.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Market float likely to value Fenchurch up to Pounds 80m Fenchurch Group, which specialises in insurance broking and is a Lloyd's agent, is coming to the market later this autumn, writes David Blackwell. Before the flotation, which is expected to give it a market capitalisation of Pounds 70m to Pounds 80m, it will demerge Fenchurch Underwriting Agencies. It believes investors might be nervous about buying into a Lloyd's underwriting agency. Mr Tony Wheal, finance director, said the proceeds would be used to repay the remainder of the debt - about Pounds 20m - incurred in the Pounds 33m management buy-out from Guinness Peat in 1989. The company intends to be ungeared.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (10): Debilitating burden grows - Nigeria is now classified as a heavily indebted low-income country and is thus eligible for concessional relief STRUCTURAL adjustment may have gone some way to liberalising Nigeria's struggling agricultural and manufacturing sectors but it has failed to liberate the economy from its debilitating external debt burden. The dollar value of Nigeria's external debt has, in fact, grown by some 50 per cent since the structural adjustment programme began in 1986. The IMF estimates that Nigeria's total external debt stock was Dollars 28.9bn at the end of last year, equivalent to 113 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. The share in the total debt stock of official government debt owed to members of the Paris Club stock has grown steadily over the past five years to 62 per cent last year. The UK is the largest single creditor government. The share of multilateral institutional debt has also risen, to 14 per cent at the end of 1992. The trend towards official debts accelerated last year following last January's debt reduction agreement between the Nigerian government and the London CLub which represents commercial creditors. Nigeria's London Club debts have fallen from Dollars 5.96bn in 1991 to Dollars 2.2bn at the end of last year as a result of the agreement. This reduces the London Club share in Nigeria's total debts to 7.6 per cent. Without rescheduling, interest payments on Nigeria's external debts would average Dollars 5bn a year in 1993-96, consuming 36 per cent of Nigeria's total export revenue. This compares to an average 19 per cent for all developing countries last year and 30 per cent for severely indebted countries. The World Bank and IMF agree that Nigeria's debt burden is unsustainably high and that the economy will not be able to sustain such a high debt service burden. Previous debt reschedulings have been conducted using middle-income country terms. But World Bank estimates confirm that such reschedulings reduce the interest burden today by raising it in the future while leaving the debt stock little changed, as the charts show. Nigeria is now officially classified as a heavily indebted low-income country and is thus theoretically eligible for concessional debt relief. The charts track the likely effect on the debt service and debt stock of concessional rescheduling using the enhanced Toronto or the more generous Trinidad terms. The enhanced Toronto terms were agreed by the Paris Club in December 1991. They allow for a 50 per cent reduction (in net present value terms) of debt service payments on non-concessional official debt. The payment schedule is extended over 23 years, through either cancellation of 50 per cent of the consolidated or rescheduling at concessional interest rates. The World Bank estimates that rescheduling using the enhanced Toronto terms would reduce Nigeria's debt service ratio to 21 per cent in 1993-96 and cut the debt stock to Dollars 16bn. The Trinidad terms were proposed by the UK in 1991 but have never been applied by the Paris Club. They imply a one-off reduction of two-thirds of eligible debt and an extended repayment period. They would halve the dollar value of Nigeria's external debt by 1998.</p>

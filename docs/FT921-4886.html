			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour offers people of Britain an 'adventure' THE PEOPLE of Britain were offered an 'adventure' yesterday, as Mr Neil Kinnock launched a magazine called Your Land, My Land, featuring contributions from Labour-supporting celebrities, Alison Smith writes. Labour's leader is pictured with Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, Dr Penelope Leach, baby-care writer, businessman Mr Philip Hughes, novelist Mr Ken Follett, scientist Sir Martin Rees and Ms Douanne Alexander-Moore, a businesswoman. Mr Kinnock said he wanted Britain to 'greet the year 2000 as a fair and free society, a strong and productive economy and a confident and creative people'. Mr John Major had no vision for Britain, he continued, and his rhetoric about creating a 'classless society' did not match his record. The 10,000 print run of the glossy magazine will be distributed to constituencies across the country, and individual articles are also being offered to trade and professional publications. The contributors will be on parade at Labour rallies during the campaign. Among the celebrities appearing yesterday, Mr Follett said his vision was of a Britain 'fizzing and popping with fun', while Sir Anthony Scrivener QC, a former chairman of the Bar Council, wrote that his vision included a Bill of Rights - something that is not currently Labour party policy.</p>

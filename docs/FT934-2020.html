			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: The longest round of all 5 November: Geneva. Gatt members agree to establish a preparatory committee to draw up an agenda for the new round, but arguments persist over inclusion of services and the priority to be given to Third World interests. Paris signals worries on farm export subsidies. 1986 July: Geneva. Preparatory committee ends with two draft agendas, one compiled by OECD and the other by developing countries. Switzerland and Colombia produce compromise 'cafe au lait' draft finally vetoed by France over farm trade. August: Cairns, Australia. Fourteen food-exporting countries set up a group to represent their interests. September: Punta del Este. Uruguay Round launched in a fashionable seaside resort. US bulldozes services, intellectual property and foreign investment restrictions on to agenda despite objections from developing countries led by India and Brazil. EC reluctantly agrees to inclusion of agriculture as part of 'global package'. 1987 January: Formal negotiations begin in 15 subject areas. July: US tables audacious plan to scrap all farm subsidies within 10 years. EC reacts with incredulity. 1988 December: Montreal. Mid-term review. Agricultural discord prevents agreements on intellectual property, safeguards (emergency import protection) and textiles. Ministers agree a negotiating framework for services, lower trade barriers for tropical products, improved disputes settlement and country policy reviews. 1989 April: Geneva. US backs down on farm subsidies, with final agreement referring only to 'substantial progressive reductions' in trade-distorting farm supports. 1990 January: Geneva. US blocks majority preference for 'formula' approach to tariff-cutting across the board, which would have forced bigger reductions in high tariffs such as US textile duties. Negotiators obliged to bargain line by line, country by country. July: Houston. Leaders of the seven biggest industrialised nations pledge to complete the Round by the end of the year. This pledge will be repeated in 1991 (London), 1992 (Munich) and 1993 (Tokyo), stretching G7's credibility. December: Brussels. Ministerial meeting. Trade ministers from 107 countries accompanied by several thousand officials, journalists and hangers-on, acrimoniously fail to conclude the Round. Discussions again founder over agriculture. Argentina and other Latin American nations walk out. 1991 May: Washington. Congress grants President Bush a two-year extension of 'fast-track' negotiating authority. December: Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, attempts to force negotiators' hands by compiling a complete draft package of accords - the 'draft final act'. France denounces the agricultural text before it is published, and the EC later demands 'substantial improvement' to the Dunkel draft. 1992 May: Brussels. EC members agree plans for radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, virtually to eliminate export subsidies and cut support prices. November: Washington. US and EC agree terms for reducing EC exports of subsidised farm goods. The 'Blair House' accord paves the way for resumption of the negotiations but is bitterly contested by Paris. 1993 January: Washington. President Clinton takes office after an unsuccessful last-ditch attempt by the US and EC to patch up differences. June: Washington. US Congress grants new 'fast-track' negotiating authority requiring President Clinton to notify by December 15 his intention to sign a Uruguay Round accord and submission of the final deal to Congress by April 16. July: Geneva. Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner, takes over from Dunkel. July: Tokyo. G7 summiteers agree detailed tariff-cutting package which, though the interpretation is later disputed, acts as platform for country-by-country bargaining in the final months. December 15: Geneva. Countries formally agree to submit the final Uruguay Round package to their governments for approval. US negotiating authority expires.</p>

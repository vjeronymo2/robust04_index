			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Protest over Intelsat tender MATRA MARCONI SPACE, the Anglo-French joint venture, has protested to Intelsat, the Washington-based international telecomm-unications consortium, alleging it changed the rules in a Dollars 200m tender contract in a way that favoured US satellite makers. Intelsat will confirm in the next few days it has awarded the contract for the first of a new generation of satellites to the lowest bidder, GE-Astro, part of the US company GE. Matra Marconi alleges GE Astro only had a lower bid because it was able to cut its initial price in an unprecedented second round of bids. The Intelsat decision will be confirmed in a series of board meetings starting today and lasting until September 16. The Intelsat 8 communications satellites will be delivered from 1995 onwards. Four companies tendered earlier this year for the contract: Hughes Aircraft and GE-Astro at a little more than Dollars 200m, Loral at Dollars 240m and Matra Marconi Space at Dollars 198m. After these four bids were received, Intelsat eliminated Loral and announced a second round of bidding. In this round, GE-Astro cut its price by one third to about Dollars 145m. 'We are very disappointed at the way Intelsat has conducted the bidding,' said Mr Claude Goumy, chairman of Matra Marconi Space, which is 51 per cent owned by Matra of France and 49 per cent by GEC of the UK. 'We had it in writing that there would be one set of bids.' Another of the bidders confirmed that two rounds of bidding was 'unusual'. It said: 'Intelsat has previously only considered one round of bids and then chosen a lead contractor and a number two.' Intelsat replied to the criticisms saying it had an obligation to buy from the best value bidder and had used a two-round method in other contracts. 'We couldn't be happier with the way the procurement process has been conducted. We don't feel that anyone has been short-changed,' said Intelsat. Mr Goumy said he would be asking European Intelsat partners, which include France Telecom, British Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, to push the European satellite-making cause at the Intelsat board meetings.</p>

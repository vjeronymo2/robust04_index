			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / FT Law Report: Beware governments bearing gifts Industry used to take a rather detached view of the European Community's rules on anti-competitive government subsidies. These have not essentially changed since 1956 but, in the past, most companies were able to dismiss them as someone else's problem. Inertia is no longer wise. In the last few years, the Commission has given enforcement of the 'state aid rules' increasing priority in relation to manufacturing industry (problem sectors, such as steel and shipbuilding, and particular sectors such as transport and agriculture receive special treatment). It is now applying articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty to a wider range of cases. Companies should take care to be aware of them. The Commission's policy is not yet fully mature, and the European Court is still giving basic rulings on the extent of its powers. The subject remains a hot political issue: the rules give the Commission the role of enforcing competition rules between governments, which is unique among the competition authorities of the world. At company level, the state aid rules may pose a threat to a company lucky enough to benefit from public funding, whether by direct grant, tax concession, development zone benefits or whatever. The fact that a company can complain to the Commission about an unfair advantage being given to a rival enables the rules also to be used as a weapon. If the Commission decides not to act, the company may appeal to the European Court. Current examples on the Court's case list include a complaint by the French company, Matra, against approval of aid for Ford and Volkswagen to build a car factory in Portugal which will have the capacity to make up to 400,000 multipurpose vehicles a year. Matra, their main European competitor, argues that the Commission failed to apply the state aid rules consistently with the Treaty's overall competition policy (Case 225/91). The association of independent French courier companies, SFEI, is using the rules more indirectly. It alleges that the Commission failed to identify as a state aid the benefits conferred on a competitor in the form of cheap premises, staff time, etc, by the state-owned French post office. An expensive complication in this case is the need to bring two separate suits before the Court. Challenges to the Commission's decisions in competition cases involving companies now go to the Court of First Instance. State aid decisions, on the other hand, are addressed to member states and, although affected companies can challenge them, the case has to be brought before the main European Court. Most of the legal issues arise from the Commission's refusal to act on SFEI's allegations against the conduct of companies (TNT and five post offices) involved in a joint venture which the Commission had approved. These will be tried by the Court of First Instance in Case T-36/92, but the state aid issue is going to the main Court in Case 222/92. Another reason to invoke the rules might be to challenge a tax or levy, the proceeds of which are used to benefit specific producers or products. The Court has ruled that this can be classified as a state aid (Cases 149 &amp; 150/91, judgment of June 11 1992). Such a challenge would also involve the Commission since it alone has power to rule whether a state aid is unlawful: the national courts cannot strike down their own taxes on this ground in the way that they could, say, a tax that discriminated against imports from other EC countries. Article 92 of the Treaty says that 'any aid granted by a member state or through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between member states, be incompatible with the common market'. It goes on to say that aid for certain broad purposes (eg for areas of serious unemployment or development of certain economic activities) 'may be considered compatible'. This suggests that any others would be incompatible as a matter of law. However, this is weaker language than, for example, the 'prohibition' of anti-competitive conduct by articles 85 and 86. Moreover, the Court has ruled that, however much an aid may appear to contravene article 92, its unlawfulness is not absolute or unconditional since the next article lays down procedures for review of state aids and for declarations of incompatibility by the Commission (Cases 78-83/90, judgment of March 11 1992). In view of the Commission's increasingly creative recourse to the rules, it is important for companies to know what is likely to trigger an inquiry. It may result in a legal obligation to pay back to the government any subsidy the company is found to have received, possibly some years before. A particularly uncomfortable situation arises when an enterprise has been bought from the state at a price which makes it affordable but which contains a discount or allows past losses to be written off. This means that the state has conferred a hidden money benefit, as alleged in British Aerospace's acquisition of Rover. Only non-discriminatory aid given to consumers and disaster relief are specifically allowed by the Treaty itself. The Commission has issued some useful guidance, such as the blanket approval this May of certain low levels of aid to independent small and medium-sized companies and the temporary approval of higher levels of aid in Germany's new Lander. The Commission has power under article 93 to declare an aid which was granted in the past incompatible with the common market. This is why in practice a company may have to repay a subsidy, although in theory this should not happen, since all plans to grant new aid or alter existing schemes should be notified to the Commission. Two distinct procedures apply to 'old' and 'new' aids, and the Commission must select and follow the correct course of action from the start (Cases 312/90 and 47/91, judgment of June 30 1992). Politically the most contentious application of the state aid rules is to public enterprises and state shareholdings. The Treaty explicitly places the question of ownership beyond the reach of EC law (article 222): it passes no judgment of any sort on the public ownership of industry. The Commission's current purpose is to ensure that state enterprises compete with the private sector as nearly as possible on equal terms. In identifying payments which are to be treated as aid, the test to be applied is the 'market economy investor principle' by which a payment to an enterprise by the state is assessed as an investment made by a hypothetical private investor. The Court upheld the directive introducing the concept (Cases 188-190, judgment of July 6 1982) and it has since approved refinements in its application, for example by allowing an investment to be judged in the long term or from the point of view of the conglomerate holding company, rather than by the shorter-term criteria of the capital markets (Cases 305/89 - Fiat/Alfa-Romeo, and 303/88 - Lanerossi). The state aid rules show no signs of becoming depoliticised, especially in the light of the Commission's recent approval of the French government's injections of capital into the computer maker, Bull, which drew an immediate protest from the UK. The UK itself, however, is by no means immune from the rules: the suggestion of a development zone for Ravenscraig following closure of the steelworks drew an immediate adverse reaction from Brussels. The Commission's own deliberations are no stranger to controversy. Among the hard cases to face the commissioners on their return from holiday is the proposal to impose import duties on vans made in Austria at a plant which has benefited from subsidies. It is felt that this could operate to the detriment of EC producers. Austria has a free-trade agreement with the EC and is an applicant for membership. The result of this will pose new questions for the Efta countries due to participate next year in the European Economic Area, and may send ominous signals to the countries of central Europe.

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Colorgen acts to dampen speculation COLORGEN has sought to dampen speculation by forecasting a 9 per cent rise in annual profits before tax and exceptionals to about Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) for the year to the end of June. The announcement was made following the recent erratic trading of the USM-traded shares of this US-based colour matching specialist. Sales were estimated to have increased from Dollars 11m to about Dollars 14m. The results are expected to be published in October. Mr Peter Wall, managing director, said the board had decided to issue the forecast following speculation that profits might be as high as Dollars 2m. Colorgen has also been the focus recently of takeover speculation, which on one day last month sent its shares 5p higher to 33p. Mr Wall dismissed the rumours as 'absolute rubbish', pointing out that the board controlled more than 50 per cent of the shares. On Friday the shares closed 1 1/2 p up at 34 1/2 p.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS HIT PLAN TO CLOSE BASES  </P> <P> Six members of the California congressional delegation Wednesday protested the  proposed closing of military bases in the state, charging that the action would  not save money or serve national security interests.  </P> <P> Testifying with 15 other congressmen before a House panel considering the base  closings, the California representatives disputed the findings of the federal  Commission on Realignment and Closure, which in December issued a list of 86  military facilities that it said were an unnecessary burden on the federal  budget.  </P> <P> "There is no way that we can justify accepting this report in total . . . if  the savings are not there," said Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland), who defended  George Air Force Base in San Bernardino County, one of the bases on the list.  </P> <P> The lawmakers also criticized the commission for failing to provide the data on  which their recommendations were based. Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) declared  that "the commission cannot support its recommendations in a way that can  withstand scrutiny."  </P> <P> Under the legislation that created the special commission, Congress has until  45 days after March 1 to vote down the entire list or allow the closings to go  into effect automatically. The all-or-nothing arrangement was provided to help  insulate the review from political pressures and prevent congressmen from  attacking the list piecemeal to protect interests in their districts.  </P> <P> Because of the high priority on reducing the federal budget deficit, House and  Senate leaders have said it is unlikely that Congress will disapprove the list.  </P> <P> According to the commission, the proposed closings, along with substantial  scaling back at five others and "realignments" at 54 more, would save the  federal government $5.6 billion over 20 years.  </P> <P> Six military facilities in California have been targeted for closing.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's hearing before a subcommittee of the House Armed Services  Committee, several protesting congressmen complained that repeated attempts to  see material used by the commission were "stonewalled" by both the panel and  the Defense Department.  </P> <P> Lewis said he suspected that information on the facilities provided by the  Defense Department was "misleading" and that the decision to close George AFB  "may very well raise questions" about the validity of the rest of the  commission's report.  </P> <P> Posing a rhetorical question, Lewis asked: "When is it all right for the  Department of Defense to lie to Congress?"  </P> <P> Jim Abbee, a spokesman for the commission, said that "all the data" will be  made available. Members of the commission will testify before the subcommittee  next Wednesday about their findings.  </P> <P> Abbee defended the report and said that he is "confident that the analysis  process was not flawed and the data we worked with was accurate." He said that  the commission has received "a lot of praise" from members of Congress and that  it continues to stand by all of its recommendations.  </P> <P> Some of those testifying charged that the $5.6 billion in savings cited by the  commission is too small to justify the closings, considering the bases'  economic value to their communities and their contribution to national  security. Others disputed the savings estimate altogether.  </P> <P> "We contend that if the Presidio is closed, it will cost the taxpayers more  money," said Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), protesting the recommended  shutdown of 6th Army headquarters at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge.  </P> <P> Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said her figures show that it will cost an  additional $26 million each year if the military facility is closed and if the  site is operated as a historical site by the Interior Department.  </P> <P> The commission projected annual savings of $74.1 million by closing the  Presidio.  </P> <P> Other California congressmen protesting base closings at the hearing were  Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) and George E. Brown  (D-Colton).  </P> <P> The other California bases to be closed are Norton Air Force Base near San  Bernardino, Hamilton Army Airfield in Marin County, Mather Air Force Base near  Sacramento and the Navy's inactive Salton Sea Test Base.  </P></p>

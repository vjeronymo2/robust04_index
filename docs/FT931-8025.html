			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Heseltine defends 'market solution' for Leyland Daf: Belgian and Dutch package excludes UK MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, defended his decision to put his faith in the receivers of Leyland Daf yesterday after the Belgian and Dutch governments agreed a rescue package for the parent truck company that excluded its three British plants. The resurrection of the truckmaker as a new slimmed-down company backed by fresh equity and injections of capital from the Belgian and Dutch governments contrasted with Mr Heseltine's refusal to pledge financial support for the company's UK operations. 'I don't believe that intervening with money produces long-term solutions,' he said. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said: 'There could not be a clearer example of how Britain is losing out to countries with an industrial strategy because we have a government with none.' As union leaders and Labour opponents criticised his stance, Mr Heseltine appeared confident that what he called 'the market solution' led by administrative receivers would secure a future for the remaining British factories. The receivers of Leyland Daf said inclusion of the British plant in the new company would have offered a 'fast track solution' for the UK subsidiary. They would now concentrate on negotiations with potential purchasers. Talks should be strengthened, however, by potential outlets for the UK plants secured by the receivers with the new company. The receivers said yesterday they had secured the intellectual property rights necessary for the independent British operations and had potential supply agreements with the new company. These would cover axles and components from the Albion plant in Glasgow, pressings from Washwood Heath in Birmingham and components from Leyland in Lancashire. The new venture had also given an undertaking to look at ways for Leyland's 45 series light van to be distributed within its continental dealership network. The company's Dutch receivers reached agreement at the weekend with the Dutch and Belgian governments, banks and institutional investors on raising Fl 467m (Pounds 178m) in fresh equity for a new-style Daf. The new company, Daf Trucks NV, will concentrate on the market for medium to heavy trucks, and its industrial operations will be divided between the Netherlands and Belgium. The new company will employ 3,500 people, about half the original total in these two countries. The Dutch government is to put up Fl 195m in risk-bearing capital, while the regional government of Flanders in Belgium is contributing Fl 75m. Together, the two governments will own about 57 per cent of the new company, which is to be established later this week. Of the rest of the capital, Fl 110m will be provided by banks and insurance companies, Fl 50m by institutional investors and Fl 37m by Daf's suppliers, dealers and importers. On top of this risk-bearing capital, bank loans of Fl 400m will be made available by Dutch banks ABN Amro, Rabobank, ING Bank and the National Investment Bank as well as by the Dutch subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais. The original nine-bank consortium - including Barclays, Lloyds and National Westminster - is understood to have been paid Fl 340m for the assets of the old company in the form of cash, some debt for equity and some continuing loans. The consortium had a syndicated loan of Pounds 800m to the collapsed company. Dutch rescue keeps Daf on the road, Page 14</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> A LEAF FROM LOMITA'S BOOK: L.A. MAY BAN NOISY BLOWERS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE L.A. CITY COUNCIL IS STUDYING A REGULATION THAT WOULD  EFFECTIVELY BAN USE OF GAS-POWERED LEAF BLOWERS.  </P> <P> Four years ago, Lomita became the first city in the South Bay to ban leaf  blowers because of complaints from residents about dust and the high-pitched  snarl of the machines.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates and Hermosa Beach soon followed with prohibitions of their  own, and other South Bay cities imposed a host of restrictions on the blowers'  use. In Rancho Palos Verdes, for instance, it became illegal to operate the  machines on Sunday or during the evening.  </P> <P> Homeowners in Los Angeles also demanded regulations, but failed when the  gardening industry fought back and blocked a proposed ban on gasoline-powered  blowers in residential areas.  </P> <P> Now, thanks to Councilman Marvin Braude, opponents of blowers in Los Angeles  are getting a second chance.  </P> <P> Braude has introduced a motion to the City Council that industry officials say  would effectively ban gas-powered leaf blowers in the city. The measure, which  was referred to the council's environmental quality committee last week, would  reduce the maximum noise permitted by the blowers from 65 decibels to 60  decibels. (A busy street may generate 70 to 80 decibels of noise.)  </P> <P> "The continual use of gasoline-powered leaf blowers is a nuisance in our city  and a terrible imposition on the peace and quiet its residents want to enjoy,"  Braude said in announcing his proposal.  </P> <P> The measure is intended to force gardeners to return to traditional rakes and  push brooms or convert to electric blowers, which city officials said are far  less noisy than their gas-powered counterparts.  </P> <P> Most gas-powered leaf blowers generate more than 60 decibels and would not be  able to comply with Braude's proposed ordinance, according to the Police  Department, which enforces city noise ordinances.  </P> <P> "There is something about the noise level of the gasoline-powered leaf blower  that gets to everyone and drives them mad," said Joan Graves, who co-chairs a  group of Pacific Palisades residents advocating a ban on the machines. "I don't  know what it is. I would like a scientist to explain it to me. Lawn mowers  don't do it; even tree trimmers don't do it. It is the leaf blower that just  drives you out of your mind. It is just torturous."  </P> <P> In the canyons of Pacific Palisades, residents have taken to stuffing towels on  windowsills and doorjambs to keep dust from gasoline-powered leaf blowers from  invading their homes.  </P> <P> In Hancock Park, a homeowners group is organizing a telephone complaint line to  keep track of dozens of gripes from members about the blowers' noise.  </P> <P> And at Los Angeles City Hall, the blowers continue to rank as a major source of  irritation among many constituents, who write letters and make phone calls  complaining to council members.  </P> <P> "I have had six calls today from people who don't even live in our district,"  said Glenn Barr, an aide to Braude. "From the perspective of complaints we get,  it is reaching critical mass. People are at the point where they don't want to  deal with this anymore."  </P> <P> Braude's proposal has raised the ire of Southern California's gardening  profession, which has seen a growing number of cities impose restrictions on  the machines in recent years.  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, Claremont approved a ban on gas-powered blowers, beginning  in February, and last month Irvine officials began licensing the machines and  requiring safety classes for their operators. Other cities across the region,  from Beverly Hills to Cypress, have either banned the blowers or restricted  their use.  </P> <P> "That equipment is the livelihood of the gardeners," said Bill Kondo, executive  secretary of the Southern California Gardeners Federation, which represents  about 3,500 professional gardeners. "Yes, we are going to oppose it. We are  meeting Saturday to discuss it."  </P> <P> The federation, joined by other industry groups, killed a similar effort to ban  the blowers in Los Angeles four years ago. At that time, dozens of homeowner  groups opposed to the blowers were unable to overcome gardeners' and  manufacturers' objections that the measure would have a devastating economic  impact on the city's largely minority gardening industry.  </P> <P> At that time, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky sponsored legislation that would have  prohibited gasoline-powered blowers in residential areas, but he was unable to  garner enough votes for it on the City Council. Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, who  helped defeat the Yaroslavsky motion, said the debate was about nothing more  than affluent homeowners not wanting to be disturbed by "good, honest"  gardeners trying to earn a living.  </P> <P> Kondo said gardeners need the blowers because they are faster and more  efficient than push brooms, and he said it is often too difficult to find a  power source for electric models. "What do you do if nobody is home and there  is no outside outlet?" he asked.  </P> <P> Although Kondo said his group intends to fight Braude's proposal, the ultimate  fate of the blowers may actually be taken out of the city's hands. The South  Coast Air Quality Management District is expected to recommend next month that  a ban on all leaf blowers -- gasoline and electric -- be included in the  agency's 1991 clean air plan.  </P> <P> AQMD spokesman Tom Eichhorn said the blowers pollute the air by stirring up  dust and dirt. The gasoline-powered blowers, moreover, produce exhaust  emissions, he said.  </P> <P> Barr, Braude's aide, said the councilman was aware of the AQMD proposal but  decided to move forward with a city ban anyway. He said there is no guarantee  that the AQMD recommendation ultimately will be included in the clean air plan,  and he said it could be years before such a restriction would take effect.  </P> <P> "Most of our constituents aren't willing to wait," Barr said. "The noise is  driving them up the wall."  </P></p>

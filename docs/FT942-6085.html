			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Volvo Bus buys into Danish coachbuilder Volvo, the Swedish motor vehicle manufacturer, plans to take over a Danish operation making bodies for Volvo buses from the troubled German Kassbohrer Group. Under an agreement signed with Kassbohrer, Volvo Bus will take over all the activities of Aabenraa Karosserifabrik, the German company's Danish subsidiary, related to the production and marketing of bodies for Volvo bus chassis. Neither company disclosed the value of the deal, which is due to be completed by the end of this month. Aabenraa builds about 125 Volvo buses a year for sale mainly in the Danish market. It produces about 50 buses for Kassbohrer, but Volvo will not acquire those activities. Volvo says it will, however, take on a majority of Aabenraa's 220 employees and has plans to incorporate the operation as a Danish Volvo subsidiary. Volvo embarked on a strategy to concentrate on car, truck and bus manufacturing following the collapse of its previous plans to merge with France's Renault. Volvo has wholly-owned bus body-building operations in Sweden and Austria, as well as a joint venture in China.</p>

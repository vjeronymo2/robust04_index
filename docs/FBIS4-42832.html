			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed by B.L.: "Libya -- Reaction From the </F> Embassy"]    [Text] Following our article entitled "Strange  Belgian-Libyan Tension" published on 28 May, the Libyan Embassy,  or, to be more precise, "The People's Bureau of the Great  Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in Brussels,"  expressed its "regret" at our "insinuations" concerning  Belgian-Libyan relations which, according to the embassy, are  tension-free and, on the contrary, "under the sign of the  greatest serenity."    Notwithstanding a foreign visit of the Libyan ambassador  accompanied by a Libyan member of parliament that was made  without the Foreign Ministry authorization, an event that the  embassy's clarification does not deny, we had been impelled to  use the word "tension" by the Libyan ambassador's lament printed  on the front page of DE STANDAARD on 27 May. Here the diplomat  complained that Belgium was showing rather more zeal than its  European and U.S. partners in applying Security Council  Resolution 883 (requiring the toughening of economic sanctions  against Tripoli from last December). Indeed, the funds of the  Libyan Embassy were frozen around the end of April, thus  preventing the diplomatic mission from continuing to function.    On verification, it does appear that this Belgian "zeal" was  indeed excessive because of technical and administrative  confusion surrounding the freezing of the Libyan accounts. The  Finance Ministry charged with applying the royal decree of 17  March which set out the manner in which Resolution 883 would be  applied, finally last week had to reopen the embassy's current  account.    Was this a storm in a teacup, as all the interested parties  are now at pains to point out? Maybe it was. However, as we  mentioned, mystery still surrounds the "safe deposit box" in  which our sources, who request anonomity, claim the gendarmes  found some "strange" things. The Libyan Embassy says it does  not possess any such box in a Belgian bank.</p>

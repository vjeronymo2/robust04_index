			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Paris pales besides Tokyo We have been to EuroDisneyland and to Tokyo Disneyland. The weather was good for both visits, but it is easy to see why the French one is in trouble. Queues are one thing. At EuroDisneyland, men barge and climb over barriers. Two hours is not an unusual queuing time. In Tokyo, queues are shorter because everyone waits their turn properly. EuroDisneyland needs more staff. Getting food at Tokyo Disneyland is much easier and there is a bigger choice, including kebabs and rice and sushi. Once in EuroDisneyland, we went to get some tea and the queues were not moving. Our dad went to look at the front. No one was serving. So we went to another cafe. We do not think pickpocketing is such a problem in Tokyo. In EuroDisneyland, we were in a 90-minute queue for Pirates of the Caribbean and our mother thought she felt somebody touching her pockets. She turned round and the lady behind said: 'It's just me.' But mum was sure she was a pickpocket. The staff said that it just happens and that they were not going to do anything about it. In Tokyo, the staff smiled and gave us toys and sweets. The staff did not smile very much at EuroDisneyland. We think Tokyo Disneyland is cleaner. In EuroDisneyland, the boats in It's a small world had mud in them. There is more space in Tokyo Disneyland, 204 acres against 136 acres in EuroDisneyland. We thought they were equally crowded, but Tokyo felt emptier because everybody was polite. We think Tokyo Disneyland is more enjoyable to visit, because we were better treated there. Laura (10) and Sophia (8) moved from Paris to Tokyo in September.</p>

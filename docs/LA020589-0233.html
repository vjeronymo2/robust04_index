			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AUTHOR TAKES OWN ADVICE AS HE REBUILDS AFTER BANKRUPTCY, CORONARY  </P> <P> Charles R. Whitlock is a businessman who claims to have earned millions of  dollars from starting several small companies. On March 3, 1985, he suffered a  heart attack at age 42 while having dinner.  </P> <P> Whitlock survived the attack, and while he recovered he searched for one book  or magazine that had all the diet, exercise and psychological help that a heart  attack victim would need to stay healthy. There was none.  </P> <P> So as an inveterate entrepreneur, Whitlock last year started HeartCorps  magazine, "a self-help journal" for heart patients. The bimonthly publication,  which premiered last summer, is getting early raves from patients, doctors and  insurance companies, said Whitlock, who is the magazine's publisher. No less a  personage than Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the famous heart surgeon in Houston, has  lent his name to HeartCorps' advisory board.  </P> <P> Things are going so well that another health-related magazine, Hippocrates,  which is half-owned by Time, already has offered to buy HeartCorps for $2  million, Whitlock said.  </P> <P> The story of HeartCorps, in fact, would likely have made another chapter in a  book Whitlock wrote 2 years ago, titled "10 Ways You Can Earn $1 Million This  Year," in which he reveals his secrets of success. The book's cover shows  Whitlock standing next to a limousine in front of his $1-million house.  </P> <P> "He has a magic touch," said William L. Bush, a former hospital manager whom  Whitlock hired as HeartCorps' editor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Other Side  </P> <P> Maybe not. As Whitlock's book was coming out in 1987, he was filing for  personal bankruptcy protection in federal court in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, a  windmill-energy company he helped start a few years earlier also was filing for  protection from creditors in bankruptcy court. And just as embarrassing, the  house pictured on Whitlock's book doesn't belong to him anymore. His bankruptcy  led to foreclosure on it.  </P> <P> It wasn't the first time Whitlock had stumbled financially. He had filed for  personal bankruptcy in Green Bay, Wis., in 1969, although he neglected to  mention that in his book. Whitlock said he "elected not to include it."  </P> <P> And, Hippocrates says it has not offered to buy HeartCorps, it has only held  exploratory talks with the magazine.  </P> <P> Although his financial setbacks aren't in his book, Whitlock said recently that  "half the battle in this life is to be able to get back up and dust yourself  off." In many ways, his hopes of returning to financial health depend on the  success of HeartCorps magazine.  </P> <P> How did Whitlock find himself in such a deep hole? His problems stemmed from  Airtricity, a venture he helped start in 1982, which built and maintained  powered windmills in the aftermath of the oil-shocked 1970s, when alternative  energy was all the rage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tax Incentives  </P> <P> The windmills were popular with investors, largely because of tax incentives,  and Whitlock said about 3,000 of his windmills are among the wind farms that  populate the desert near Palm Springs. Whitlock was president and owned 39% of  Airtricity.  </P> <P> But in 1986, the tax incentives were repealed, world oil prices collapsed from  around $30 a barrel to $10, and interest in alternative energy waned. By May,  1987, Airtricity had fled to federal bankruptcy court amid a flurry of lawsuits  among the company, its management, creditors and investors.  </P> <P> Whitlock said some Airtricity investors and creditors sought damages directly  from him, and that most of his money had been invested in Airtricity, both of  which led to his personal bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> Whitlock claims to have made millions, but according to the filing, the  millions had vanished. He listed total assets of $1.22 million, but $1.2  million of that was the market value of his 5,500-square-foot house in the  exclusive North Ranch district between Westlake Village and Thousand Oaks. His  debts totaled $986,946, including a $738,276 mortgage on the house, and more  than $93,000 of bank and credit-card debt.  </P> <P> After filing for bankruptcy protection, he hoped to sell the house, pay off his  mortgage and use his $460,000 of equity in the house to pay off other  creditors. But he discovered that the house was built on loose, shifting land,  and he could not sell the property, Whitlock said.  </P> <P> So Whitlock's lender, Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan, foreclosed on the  property last August by purchasing it for the amount left on the mortgage.  Proceeds to Whitlock? Zero. And "the builder had gone bankrupt, so there was no  recourse through him," Whitlock said.  </P> <P> Whitlock's book recounts how he started each of his businesses, along with  advice and upbeat tips: "Be prepared to work hard, but be positive about your  own capabilities." Chapter 2 is titled "The First Million(s)," and Whitlock  lists in detail what "action steps" the reader must take to succeed.  </P> <P> The book also portrays a man constantly searching for greener pastures. Born  and raised in Chicago, Whitlock says he snuck into the Marine Corps at age 12  by altering his birth certificate, took basic training and then was honorably  discharged after admitting his true age. He claims to have done it again at age  14, only this time he joined the Air Force and studied electronics.  </P> <P> Over the next 25 years, Whitlock's resume fattened considerably. He says he  started a firm that made printed circuit boards in Illinois, started a  Chicago-area magazine devoted to the circuit board industry, briefly became a  police officer in Lexington, Ky., revitalized another circuit board company in  Eveleth, Minn., started a Green Bay, Wis., firm that serviced medical  equipment, and spent brief stints as a medical marketing officer at such large  industrial companies as Honeywell, Bendix and Baxter Travenol.  </P> <P> Next, having moved to Southern California, he started a Woodland Hills company  to sell add-on products for dialysis machines, started a company to extract  silver from hospital X-rays, started a firm that provided security guards for  hospitals and then started Airtricity.  </P> <P> Whitlock said some of the firms he started were later sold to other  corporations, giving him money to plow into his next venture. The security  business, for instance, was sold to Bekins, he said. Others, such as the  circuit board magazine, were unable to compete in their markets and were  discontinued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Poor at Maintenance'  </P> <P> "I'm a concept man," he said. "I'm very poor at long-term maintenance. I'm very  good at getting something launched and started and built up to a certain  level."  </P> <P> Whitlock says he got a bachelor's degree in business from LaSalle Extension  University in Chicago and an MBA from American University in Washington.  </P> <P> Whitlock's personal bankruptcy case was formally discharged by the court in  October, and, in the meantime, he managed to raise about $200,000 from  consulting jobs and loans to help start HeartCorps magazine.  </P> <P> Now, 125,000 copies of each HeartCorps issue are printed at a cost of $180,000,  but paid subscriptions total only about 10,000, editor Bush said. An additional  70,000 are being sent to hospitals, cardiac-rehabilitation centers and other  medical facilities nationwide in the hope of luring subscribers. Another 55,000  copies are handled by U.S. and Canadian newsstands and bookstores, with about a  third being sold, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Life Style Questions  </P> <P> HeartCorps addresses various life-style questions facing heart patients. Its  stories provide diet and exercise help, describe which medicines are "heart  healthy" and help family members cope with a relative who has heart trouble.  The current issue's cover story asks the question, "Should recovering  heart-attack patients have sex?" The answer: Yes, but carefully.  </P> <P> There is no question HeartCorps' potential audience is big. About 60 million  Americans have some sort of heart disease, and each year 1 million of the 1.5  million Americans who suffer heart attacks survive, according to the American  Heart Assn.  </P> <P> Whitlock said his priorities changed after his heart attack. "I don't work for  money," he said. "I work to enjoy my life style, to live a healthy life and to  help others do that."  </P> <P> Heart disease remains the nation's biggest killer, accounting for more deaths  than cancer and AIDS combined.  </P> <P> But that doesn't automatically build a magazine's circulation. Jim Martay,  executive publisher of Hippocrates, an 18-month-old magazine based in  Sausalito, Calif., said, "We probably could identify 20 million people  interested in health, but we're doing well at 500,000" circulation. In  November, Time paid $9 million to buy 50% of Hippocrates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Selling Ads  </P> <P> He said the hard part of making health magazines successful is selling enough  advertising. "That's part of the question we have, whether HeartCorps has  enough potential on the ad side to succeed," Martay said.  </P> <P> Whitlock and Bush asserted that HeartCorps' advertising is off to a fast start.  Although advertisers often agree to place ads in a magazine's first issue only  if it is free, 18 of the 24 ads in HeartCorps' 74-page debut issue were paid,  and paid advertising is now running about 30 pages, Bush said. The magazine  needs about 40 pages of ads to make money and Whitlock says that the magazine  will be making money in a year.  </P> <P> Most of the start-up and operating costs not covered by ads or subscriptions  are picked up by HeartCorps' printer, Amway Corp. in Michigan. Also, HeartCorps  is saving money by paying Amway with stock in the magazine instead of cash.  Whitlock and Bush each still own 25% of HeartCorps; the rest is owned by Amway  and other investors.  </P> <P> Ironically, giving a printer stock in exchange for its services is one of the  techniques Whitlock's book prescribes for budding publishers who want to save  cash. So Whitlock is following his own advice in the hope of making a financial  comeback.  </P> <P> Which brings to mind what B.C. Forbes, the late founder of Forbes magazine,  once said: "You make more money selling advice than from following it."  </P></p>

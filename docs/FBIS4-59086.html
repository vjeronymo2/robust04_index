			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid telephoned Foreign Minister Ahmad Salim  Basindwah to inform him of the resolution passed earlier today  by an Arab League extraordinary session on Yemen.    Tal'at Hamid, press adviser to the Arab League secretary  general, has stated that Basindwah pointed out that Yemen  welcomes the Arab League's resolution. Basindwah voiced Yemen's  readiness to receive a delegation from the Arab League's General  Secretariat and to adopt the necessary measures as soon as  possible to secure the arrival of the delegation in Sanaa.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid has formed a high-level delegation from  the  League's Secretariat led by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar,  assistant secretary general for military affairs, and assigned  it to exert efforts to stop the fighting there, but the closure  of the Sanaa airport precluded the arrival of the delegation.    During the telephone conversation, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid  underscored the interest of all member states to end the  fighting and find an appropriate settlement of the Yemeni crisis  that could ensure the unity, security, and stability of Yemen.</p>

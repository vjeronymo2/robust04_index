			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Background to the mysterious Mr Fixit MR DIETER BOCK has established a reputation in Germany as an effective, if mysterious Mr Fixit, with close links to Mr Ignaz Walter, head of the Walter Bau construction empire. In his greatest coup to date he played a key role in helping Mr Walter to promote his company to the second biggest construction group in the country. He began his real estate investment career in 1974 in Munich. He attracted considerable attention in 1989 when his Advanta Management, a modest property-based concern, bought a 10 per cent stake in Philip Holzmann, Germany's biggest builder. At the end of 1991, he announced Advanta's takeover of Dywidag, another construction concern, even though it emerged later that he held only about 25 per cent of the equity, bought from Philip Holzmann, at the time. This subsequently finished up in the hands of Walter Bau, which held a similar stake, and which finally won control of Dywidag in May this year. Although the deal has yet to receive final clearance from the cartel authorities in Berlin, Mr Bock, a lawyer, has been offered an option on a 10 per cent stake in Mr Walter's next empire-building project: Walter Holding. This will encompass all the construction interests of Mr Walter and his family - Walter Bau, Ed. Zublin, Heilit &amp; Werner, and Dywidag - in a group due to be floated sometime next year. Total turnover is expected to be about DM10bn (Pounds 4.1bn) a year. Another more high-profile adventure brought Advanta a 50 per cent stake in the Kempinski Hotel chain after the failure of attempts to merge it with the Meridien business owned by Air France. The deal was worth an estimated DM300m and again raised questions, still unanswered, about the source of Mr Bock's finances. According to Advanta's company reports, it made pre-tax profits of DM63.5m in 1991 on its main businesses: 'conception, planning and completion of property projects.' Its net asset at December 31, 1991, were DM200m. Mr Bock stressed yesterday he was making his investment in Lonrho as a private shareholder and not through Advanta. He has a direct 20 per cent personal stake in Advanta, and is reported to 'have influence' over a further 60 per cent held by Dutch-registered property concerns. The balance is held by BHF bank.</p>

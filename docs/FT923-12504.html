			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Letter: There must be no secrets in household of believers Sir, I was interested to read the article about the Church Commissioners ('Unholy Saga of the Church's missing millions', July 11). The Anglican Church has been lulled into a sense of unreal expectations: every year, we clergy are given a massive pay rise, but suddenly all hell is being let loose in the Diocese with panic-stricken requests for every parish to increase its giving. I am quite happy that congregations should be asked to give more cash, but I am very unhappy about the mis-match in information between the Church Commissioners' annual reports and publicity leaflets and the article which you published. Who is telling the truth? The commissioners seem to be telling parishes that the fall in income is wholly due to the recession, in the way which it has affected property values and rents. Your article implies a degree of culpability and incompetence. How are ordinary parishes like mine to judge the truth of the matter? I would be glad if you could extract further information from that very secretive body the Church Commissioners, who are, after all, servants of the Church. There should be no secrets in the household of the believers. Nicholas Richards, The Rectory, St Marychurch Street, Rotherhithe, London SE16</p>

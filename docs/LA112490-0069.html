			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISREAD SCULPTURE  </P> <P> In response to " 'Novel Ideas' Bound by Literal Works" by Cathy Curtis  (Calendar, Nov. 16):  </P> <P> With all my respect to one of (The Times') most vicious art critics, who knows  her stuff very well, I would like to set one very important item in that  article straight, which will completely change the distorted and wrong way she  reviewed my sculpture "The American Dream." The book I was given was a double  paperback by Edward Albee, the author of "Who Is Afraid of Virginia Wolf?" The  actual title of the book was "The Zoo Story" and "The American Dream" (two  stage plays).  </P> <P> The second one, which I focused my piece on, was written by Albee in 1961.  </P> <P> If you will read this short play, you will realize that I am not at all  interested in putting genitals where they do not belong or purposely getting  off on the trendy fad of explicitness and censorship. I had a very valid reason  for my "good measure" placement.  </P> <P> It's easy to categorize an artist's work when it's singled out of context or  put into the wrong context without knowing the overall guts of the artist's  work.  </P> <P> LILLI MULLER  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

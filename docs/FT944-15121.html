			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / French coal mining set to end Charbonnages de France (CdF), the state monopoly producer of coal, said yesterday it was confident of winning the support of a majority of unions for its plan to abandon mining entirely by the year 2005. Only 10 per cent of miners in the main Lorraine coalfields heeded a strike call on Tuesday by the left-wing CGT trade union. French coal mining has been in rapid decline for some time, and CdF - which had 41,000 employees producing 18.5m tonnes in 1986 - now produces only just over 10m tonnes with 16,000 employees. Under last July's government plan, which is only opposed by the CGT out of the five unions represented at CdF, employees can take redundancy money or stay on at CdF, which after 2005 will continue to run its electricity generating plants with coal imported from outside Europe. The latter is half the real price of French coal which is heavily subsidised, though the government is making a start to the planned phase-out of domestic mining by slashing this year's subsidy from FFr6.4bn (Pounds 770m) to FFr4.4bn next year.</p>

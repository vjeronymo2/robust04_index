			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Yoweri Museveni has warned that 1994 is  very important in Uganda's political calendar and a lot is at  stake. In a New Year message to the nation broadcast on radio  Uganda and Uganda television, Mr. Museveni strongly advised his  fellow countrymen not to allow their narrow interests to stand  in the way of a smooth transition to a democratic elected  government. He confirmed that a parliament and a president will  be elected under the new constitution made by the people this  year. He called upon all Ugandans to take the completion of the  constitution-making exercise as seriously as they took the  earlier phases of civic education and the submission of their  views to the constitutional commission. "We must now complete  the task we embarked upon more than four years ago and nobody  should divert you at this 11th hour", he said.    He commended the commissioner of the Constituent Assembly  elections and his staff for the civic awareness they have  generated, which has made the registration exercise successful.  He appealed to all Ugandans to take the Constituent Assembly  elections very seriously so that they elect people who are  committed to the nation and can competently debate the draft  constitution, which is the compendium of the views of the people  of Uganda, which they are at liberty to amend, add to, or  subtract from through their representatives or directly.    On the question of having a level playing field, the  president said the National Resistance Movement [NRM] government  is committed to free and fair elections. However, he added: "We  wish to appeal to the intending candidates not to tilt the field  through the bribing of voters. The level playing field we all  cherish", he went on, "will therefore very much depend on the  behavior of the candidates."    He said government policy is to have the best men and women  in the business of representing the people. On the future of  the country the president said the democratic system we are  building must be premised on peace and stability. We must  therefore, he said, eschew the politics of division of the past  and build political platforms on programs and not on ethnicity,  religion or region. In that way, peace, stability, and  democratic governance will take firm root in this country and  become enduring. He said in the excitement and noise of the  coming elections it will serve as well to remember the tortured  history of our country since independence. He said institutions  which we have always had and whose continuity some are  advocating did not give us the peace and stability we all  cherish.    Why should some people therefore, he asked, think that those  self-same institutions and the people behind them who in the  past have been the authors of chaos and tragedy can now lead us  along the golden path? We now have an opportunity to put right  the wrongs of the past. If we do not, he declared, history will  condemn us. He reiterated the NRM policy of reconciliation,  adding that Ugandans should never again be stampeded into exile  on baseless grounds.    On the question of monarchs in Uganda, the president made it  clear that the NRM government is not opposed to the restoration  and formalization of any of our cultural institutions, provided  the majority within the community concerned so desire.    On cooperation among the three east African countries:  Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, president Museveni said the NRM  government is fully committed to the revival and restoration of  the historical links between the three countries to promote  trade and common services.    On efforts being made to end minority rule in South Africa,  President Museveni said Uganda hopes and prays that the forces  of unity and reconciliation will prevail over disunity and  hatred in the months ahead.    On the situation in Africa, the Ugandan leader said Africa  has got one destiny and it cannot be realized until stability,  peace and order prevail everywhere. We therefore earnestly call  on the forces ranged against each other in fratricidal wars in  the Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, and Angola to sheath their swords.    President Yoweri Museveni has said that in terms of economic  performance, 1993 has been the brightest year for Uganda's  economy since the early 1970's. In a New Year's message to the  nation, Mr. Museveni said the last 12 months have been of  prosperity, tranquillity and peace, and he declared we should be  grateful to the Lord for all the blessings on our country.    He said over the last 12 months, the government has  accelerated the pace of macroeconomic and structural reforms  aimed at achieving increased stability and efficiency of the  country's economy. The main elements in the strategy of  maintaining macroeconomic stability, he added, are: firm control  over public expenditure, keeping a tight lid on monetary  expansion consistent with economic growth, and liberalization of  the foreign exchange market, which has allowed increased foreign  exchange inflows.    The president said that as a result of implementing this  strategy, inflation has been brought under control. He  disclosed that the rate of inflation dropped to 1.5 percent in  November last year compared to 52 percent in November 1992. He  promised that inflation will not be allowed to exceed 5 percent.  The sharp fall in the rate of inflation has resulted in the  reduction of interest rates. Due to these achievements,  considerable private inflows, estimated at 241 million dollars  in 1992/93, rose sharply, from 136 million in 1991/92. The  president added that the government has been able to service its  external debt obligations satisfactorily and has reduced its  external debt arrears from 585 million dollars in June 1992 to  253 million dollars in June 1993.    Mr. Museveni said, moreover, this has been achieved at a  time  when the country's external reserves at the Bank of Uganda are  also increasing, reaching a level of 135.5 million dollars at  the end of November 1993 from a level of only 60 million dollars  in September 1992. And for the period July 1992 to June 1993  our GDP is estimated to have grown by about 7.0 percent.    In the field of structural reforms the government has  undertaken a number of measures. These include a return of over  3,000 properties expropriated by the Idi Amin regime in the  early 1970s to their owners. As a result of this action the  country is beginning to see major rehabilitation and investments  in properties repossessed by their owners, which has opened up  opportunities for employment. Other measures taken are  rationalization of public expenditure to improve services  increasing the pace of divestiture reform of parastatals, and  reform of the civil service through the restructuring of  ministries, and the reduction of staff and the first phase of  the reduction of the size of the Armed Forces has been completed.    He said in the New Year 1994, the government intends to  pursue policies that will help us to consolidate macroeconomic  stability. The government will accelerate the pace of the  finance sector restructuring. In this connection Mr. Museveni  said the government will intensify the restructuring of the  Uganda Commercial Bank and cooperate [as heard] banks. He  disclosed that early in the year the government will table in  the NRC a non-performing loans recovery bill which seeks to  clear the Uganda Commercial Bank of all non-performing loans  from its balance sheet. The government will also sign a  performance contract agreement with the Uganda Commercial Bank  management: the government further intends to accelerate  economic growth by improving the incentive framework for the  private sector.    Accordingly, early in the year, the government will  implement  the following measures to reduce further the regulatory barriers  to trade and investment: the cotton subsector will be  revitalized through a change of policy relating to cotton  production, ginning and marketing. The Ministry of Trade and  Industry will to this effect table a cotton bill in the NRC  early next month which aims at abolishing the lint marketing  monopoly over exports and that of the unions over ginning.    The coffee subsector will be further liberalized through the  implementation of the following measures: the requirements that  coffee must be transported to ports by rail will be abolished.  Exports will be free to choose the mode of transport for their  coffee to the sea. The price formula used to calculate the  export flow price will be abolished. The Ministry of Trade and  Industry will announce the details in due course. The Uganda  Coffee Development Authority, UCDA, statute will be amended to  restructure its board so that the majority of directors  represent the coffee industry and to define UCDA's role in the  extension of coffee nurseries. The Coffee Marketing Board  Limited, CMBL, will also be structured to reduce its operating  costs to reflect current market realities.    Pump prices for petrol will be liberalized, and the minister  of natural resources will announce the detailed measures that  will accompany this policy.    The government will implement the final phase of the  divestiture of the custodian board properties in 1994. In this  regard the government will implement the following measures  early in the year: return of remaining properties with valid  repossession claims to their owners by the end of January 1994.  The government will also sell all unclaimed properties by  competitive tender beginning September 1994.</p>

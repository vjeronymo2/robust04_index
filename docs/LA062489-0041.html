			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLENBECK CENTER FUND-RAISER SCHEDULED  </P> <P> Seventeen years ago, the Hollenbeck Police/Business Council was formed with the  aims of providing alternatives to youths otherwise destined for gang and/or  criminal activities; involving adults and youths in physical conditioning and  keeping seniors active in community events and affairs.  </P> <P> The Hollenbeck Youth Center was created, at 2015 E. 1st St. in Los Angeles, and  the council now plans an expansion that will more than double the facility.  Fund-raising events largely finance the center's operation, and next Saturday  and Sunday, a benefit "Oldies Spectacular Against Crime" has been scheduled at  the track and field area of Cal State L.A.  </P> <P> "Oldies," of course, is a relative term: In concert both days will be Linda  Ronstadt, backed on Saturday by Dirty Dan (of Sha Na Na), the Crests, the music  of the Shirelles, Coasters, Drifters, etc. On Sunday, the supporting groups  will include the Solid Gold '50s Band, the Penguins, Rosie and the Originals,  the Del Vikings, the Marcels and Richard Yniguez. A grand finale fireworks  display also is planned.  </P> <P> Hours both days are 5 to 11 p.m. Tickets are $10, on sale at Ticketmaster  outlets, May Co. and Music Plus stores (no tickets sold at door). For further  information, call (213) 263-4989.  </P></p>

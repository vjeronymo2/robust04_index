			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Austrian banks hold merger negotiations ERSTE Oesterreichische Spar/Casse Bank, a large Austrian savings bank, is to start merger talks with Girocredit to form Austria's second largest bank. Erste, which holds 21.5 per cent of Girocredit, is planning to acquire the 30.5 per cent stake held by Bank Austria, the country's largest bank. Erste and Bank Austria plan to finalise the transaction in time for Girocredit's annual meeting in April. Erste is looking for other partners, such as smaller savings banks and insurance companies, to help finance the acquisition. A full merger would be postponed for several years, Erste said. The takeover of Girocredit by Erste would mark the largest change in the Austrian banking industry since Zentralsparkasse, another large savings bank, merged with Laenderbank last year, to form the new market leader Bank Austria. Girocredit, the product of a merger between Girozentrale and the much smaller retail bank OCI, has acted as the clearing house of the Austrian savings banks, but the wave of mergers between savings banks and commercial banks has left it without a franchise. The Erste-Girocredit group would be the third Austrian bank with balance sheet assets of more than Sch500bn (Dollars 44bn). However, banking analysts said the country's banks may be too small to survive in the more competitive environment of the European single market.</p>

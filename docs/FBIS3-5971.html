			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" of interview with President Suharto by Ruhut </F> Sitompul, member of Indonesian National Youth Committee, in  Jakarta on 12 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Sitompul] Mr. President, I would like to thank you  for giving me a chance to speak. I want to talk about the  constitutional issue. As national youths, we all believe that  you are a leader elected through constitutional means. Now we  want to discuss the issue of the national leadership succession.  Being your sons because we are from KNPI [National Youth  Committee], I want to discuss your earlier remarks on the  leadership succession, but first let me tell you that we are  impressed by the detailed explanation you gave us on our  national development stages. Our regeneration process is  natural, not by passing the baton as in a foot race. The  leadership mechanism proceeds smoothly every five years.  Therefore, if the People's Consultative Assembly, our highly  esteemed state institution, still wants you to serve as  president after 1998 for the second long-term development plan,  we beg you to be ready to serve for another term [words  indistinct].    [Suharto] In 1998, how old will I be? Seventy-seven years  old, right? I have thought about it, [words indistinct].  However, we cannot stop the law of nature, which I must take  into account [words indistinct].    [Sitompul] But we pray to the almighty God for your ...    [Suharto, interrupting] [Laughs] Thank you. As I once said  in the past, I knew nothing about economics, but now, the  younger generation is smarter and faster in learning things.  What did I do when I knew nothing about economics? I enlisted  the assistance of economists like Mr. Wijoyo and his friends. I  allowed them to carry out debates on economic matters, and I  just listened to them. [laughter] After a few months, I began  to take part in the discussions. Finally, because I had to make  decisions, I began to learn things in a gradual way. We should  not be discouraged, because God will certainly show us his way.  Besides, our struggle still has a long way to go.    [Sitompul] We do not want to talk about the heir apparent  issue, but in view of the leadership model that you have given  all of us, the beloved Indonesian people, we hope that at least  there will be somebody that will inherit your leadership  qualities, because after 25 years or even 30 years, we do not  want to see a new leader with new policies. We must firmly and  resolutely adopt the Pancasila [five principles] ideology and  the 1945 Constitution.    [Suharto] I think the system makes sense because what a  president does is bound to be within the GBHN [Broad Outline of  State Policy]. Therefore, if his actions are against the GBHN,  or he wants to do as he wishes, he must be corrected, and the  House of Representatives is entitled to summon him, but it is  the MPR [People's Consultative Assembly] that is authorized to  impeach him. So there is the safety valve system. We must  admit that nobody is perfect, and everybody must do his share to  help the country so that things will turn out smoothly.  Therefore, we should not be alarmed, and my duty is to create a  situation where everybody can work and show his achievements.  People can produce achievements in different areas, and the MPR  may begin to judge their performance and discuss them through  their parliamentary factions. As you know, I will certainly not  abandon our struggle in the second long-term development plan.    There are three main principles in the ABRI [Indonesian  Armed  Forces] leadership, and one of them is [words indistinct]. Even  if during my absence, we must still adopt the principle of Tut  Wuri Andayani [providing education to children by supporting  them from behind], and we will never abandon our responsibility  to our nation's struggle. Let us pray to God for his blessings.  Thank you, and peace be upon you.</p>

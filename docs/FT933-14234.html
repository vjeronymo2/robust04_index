			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: BT services already taken to air Sir, As many of your readers will have discovered for themselves, BT has offered a worldwide commercial in-flight telephone service since September 1990 ('Mercury to start in-flight phone lines', July 7). BT's Skyphone service, operated in conjunction with our partners, Singapore Telecom and Norwegian Telecom, is used by two leading airlines - Singapore Airlines and Air China. The consortium is also in detailed discussion with other airlines. Earlier this year, BT launched the world's first global airborne fax service, again with Singapore Airlines and Air China. BT and France Telecom are now in the final stages of implementing a dedicated, land-based pan-European digital service called Jetphone. The service is due to start in October 1993 and has the support of a number of European airlines. The system will provide 'the office in the sky', as well as on-board shopping, car and hotel reservations and in-flight entertainment. Colin Browne, director of corporate relations, BT, 81 Newgate, London EC1A 7AJ</p>

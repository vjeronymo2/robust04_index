			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ann Marsh: "Slovak Dam Project Remains a Source </F> of International Tension"]    [Text] Water traffic along the Danube river, blocked for  more than a month because of a malfunction at Slovakia's  Gabcikovo dam, lurched back into motion April 27, clearing the  way for hundreds of irate ship owners to complete their  deliveries.    Caused by a mixture of bad luck, bad blood and bad planning,  the breakdown of the dam's lock system has featured the  suspected murder of a ship captain, insinuations of espionage  and millions of dollars in damages claimed by shipping companies.    It also has fulfilled some of the worst predictions about  the  communist-era dam and hydroelectric project, which began  operating in 1992.    "The impact is tremendous," said Karl Brewi, general  director  of the Vienna-based Austrian Danube Shipping Company (DDSG),  which had 30 vessels delayed. Although Slovak dam officials say  80 vessels were stuck in queues--51 upstream and 29  downstream--shipping companies put the number in the hundreds as  crews waited in Hungarian or Austrian ports for the go-ahead.    The most recent trouble at the controversial Gabcikovo  hydroelectric plant--which has been the focus of a  Hungarian-Slovak transborder dispute for years--began Feb. 11  when a Ukrainian tugboat capsized in the dam's right lock. The  captain was found hanged inside the half-submerged vessel.    Slovak police are suspicious of the apparent suicide.    "A ship has an accident and the captain thinks he must hang  himself in the next couple of minutes?" said Miroslav Liska,  spokesman for the Bratislava-based Water Development Authority  (Vodohospodarska vystavba), which operates the dam. The captain,  Liska pointed out, was nearing retirement and had just bought a  car that he was bringing home to Ukraine.    "A Ukrainian who just bought a car would not hang himself,"  he said. "It shows that maybe he did not hang himself, but was  hanged."    Slovak police may never learn the full story, because the  Ukrainian crew left the scene shortly after the accident, when  Ukraine insisted on removing the crippled vessel without Slovak  participation. This operation took close to a month, while  Ukrainian ships arrived and then removed the tug. "We wanted to  remove it immediately," Liska said, "but we were too benevolent."    During this time, Gabcikovo's left lock slowly ferried the  dam's regular 20 to 30 ships a day back and forth, although it  had been scheduled to shut down Feb. 12 for a routine  inspection, Liska said. On March 20, just over a month after the  first accident, the left lock broke down, bringing all traffic  to a halt.    Shipping companies were outraged to learn that Gabcikovo has  no emergency gate--a standard feature of any lock system. Aside  from criticism about the dam's effect on local farmland and  water tables, this omission supported long-standing claims that  the dam was poorly constructed.    Under the terms of the original Slovak-Hungarian agreement  for constructing the cross-border waterworks, signed in 1979,  Hungary was to build an emergency gate on its side. After  Hungary unilaterally backed out of the agreement in 1992, a move  Slovaks continue to call illegal, no emergency gate was built.  One is under construction now on the Slovak side and should be  completed by late 1995, according to Liska.    Though Slovak dam officials have no explanation for the  breakdown of the left lock, diving teams claim to have found a  cable that may have interfered with the lock's seal. Espionage  is suspected. The final word is pending, however, while the left  lock is fully drained and an investigation is completed.    River traffic started moving again April 27 after the right  lock went back into operation and a Romanian ship passed through  a test run at 11 a.m. The last of the ships stuck in the  month-long queue was expected to pass through by the next day.    With delayed deliveries of steel, iron ore, agricultural  products and liquid fuel, DDSG puts its damages at more than $3  million.    "It is not correct to operate a lock system like Gabcikovo  without these doors," DDSG's Brewi said. Brewi plans to seek  damages from Gabcikovo and expects his Hungarian and Ukrainian  counterparts to do the same. "They have suffered even higher  losses than we have," he said.    One possibility may be to appeal through the technical  section of the Danube Commission, which oversees operation along  the river but has little authority to extract fines. Another  possibility is taking the matter to the International Court of  Justice in The Hague.    In either case, the shipping companies are ready for a  fight.    Gabcikovo has already rejected a $6 million claim from  Ukrainian shipping companies, Liska said. "I don't think anyone  can claim damages [from road authorities] when a big crash  happens on the highway and the traffic is delayed."</p>

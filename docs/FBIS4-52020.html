			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion by Hirohiko Okumura, research director at Nomura </F> General Institute; Kazuo Ogura, former director general of the  Economic Affairs Bureau, Foreign Ministry; and Yasuhiko  Nakamura, NHK commentator, on 7 March 1994; place not given]    [Text] It Is Like Both Sides of the Moon    [GAIKO FORUM] I would like you to look back over how the  Uruguay Round of negotiations' conclusion came about and discuss  the significance of the negotiations' conclusion.    [Ogura] I think there are three pillars to the Uruguay  Round.  The first is the necessity for some improvement in the world  trade system, or systems and rules that have been practiced for  30 or years following the end of World War II. Dumping is a  typical example.    The second is an inquiry made into a field where there have  been no rules, or into a field where the making of rules has  been too difficult to accomplish despite the desirability of  having rules. One is, of course, the problem of agriculture and  the other is the problem of voluntary restraints on exports  centering on textiles.    It is not that there have been no rules governing  agricultural trade, but the rules themselves have been ambiguous  and agricultural subsidies have been approved by GATT. There  have been no great restrictions and rules governing voluntary  restraints on exports have not been very explicit. Calling that  a loophole is a little too strong, but those problems have been  difficult to handle.    The third, intellectual property rights, is a great  achievement of the Uruguay Round. It is a new field that has  barely been covered by the GATT system or other world trade  rules. Of course, there have been various rules governing  intellectual property rights or patent rights themselves, but  these rules have not necessarily been explicit in their  connection with trade. The question is how to make rules to  govern such a new field.    Some said there was discussion about the idea of the GATT  system developing a fourth great pillar in addition to those  mentioned above; I think there is no mistake about it. For  example, a new world trade agency, the World Trade Organization  [WTO], is going to be established.    Despite all that, what generally has not been understood has  been international rulemaking. Rulemaking means an improvement  of existing rules in a particular field; or making rules in a  field where there have not been many rules; or making rules in a  field where people have wanted to make rules, but have been  unable to do so; or making new rules in an entirely new field.  Of course, since the Uruguay Round dealt with negotiations,  there are other problems in addition to rulemaking.    Therefore, the Uruguay Round is like the front and back of  the moon; seen from the front, it was rulemaking; seen from the  back, it was an adjustment of economic interests because there  were economic and political interests and motives among three  groups--the United States and the European Community, Japan, and  the least developed countries. Speaking from a political  standpoint, originally there may have been a motive for the  unity of the West, or a motive for opposition to regionalism.  And there may have been a motive for drawing the least  developed countries into the world trade system.    It is inevitable for the persons who participated in the  negotiations to think that their primary concern was rulemaking.  If the negotiations are viewed from a distance as political  scientists and economists do, it will be interesting to know  what the interests and motives were, to what kind of  negotiations these interests and motives led and under what  circumstances; and it will be necessary to analyze these matters.    [Okumura] These problems of trade and other international  transactions have something to do with the necessity of  implementing a change in the industrial structure, the method of  conducting business, and business strategy on the basis of the  principle of relative superiority in principle. Since this is a  kind of change of systems, there will be a fight between a small  number of people who have gained great profits under the past  system and a large number of people who will gain a little  profit under a new system. Any change in systems involves  tremendous effort, and it is only natural that it took a long  time to implement the current change. A system which can be  changed in an instant is not a great system. As you have  pointed out, this time we have had a great change in systems and  rules in three fields. What made this possible is the fact that  the process of the world economy's unification has been behind  the international trade transactions, which bred political  dynamics for a change in systems within each country. That, in  turn, made it easier to persuade a small number of people who  profited under the past system.    Various negotiations were conducted under the Uruguay Round  from 1986 to 1993. Looking back over what happened to the world  economy, we find that direct investment made rapid progress on a  historical scale. The second is the movement of capital, the  amount of which increased to an unprecedented degree. The third  is the fact that the exchange rate was forced to undergo a very  great adjustment in connection with the movement of capital.  The fourth is international policy cooperation, whose  evaluation may differ, depending upon one's position. However,  despite various problems, the effort to continue policy  cooperation has been carried on to this day, which shows the  true worth of policy cooperation. I would like to think that  the Uruguay Round has come to a successful conclusion under such  circumstances. An adjustment has been made so established  domestic rules can be changed into international rules. Japan  has adopted rules that are thought to be the best for its  country, but these were not found to be necessarily good rules  for foreigners in the midst of the process of  internationalization. That has resulted in an absolutely  necessary adjustment.    [Nakamura] What Mr. Ogura has said about rulemaking is  right.  What did Japan gain most from the conclusion of the rulemaking?  The protection of the free trade system. Japan said that to  protect the free trade system, it must make a decision on rice  which belongs to the agricultural field.    There is no mistake about the fact that the protection of  the  free trade system is the most important thing in a long-range  view. However, the protection of the free trade system is an  abstract idea, and, even though other regions or other countries  have clearly profited from that protection, it is not so easy  for Japan to understand it. If one says that it is not so easy  to understand it because it involves rule making, that would be  the end of it.    The conclusion of the negotiations may bring about some  results. For example, the United States may profit in the field  of intellectual property rights. IBM, for one, may gain a  certain amount of profit in software trade. As for France, it  was originally supposed that France would be asked to reduce the  export subsidy for agricultural products by as much as 24  percent. However, it turned out that they got off with a  21-percent reduction. And it was decided that the United States  should impose tariffs on certain waiver items. For those  concerned countries that are capable of exporting these items,  it may become possible for them to export these items to a  certain degree by overcoming the barrier of tariffication.    However, Japan knows that it could contribute to the  protection of the free trade system, but it does not know the  rest very well. That may be due to the lack of explanation by  the government. It is difficult for ordinary people to  understand: "In truth, the result will be the same in each  individual case. This is a better solution." In making a  speech, I can say: "The current situation is much better than  what it would have been if the negotiations had gone wrong and  had broken down." However, I cannot say very much beyond that.    Reference has been made to the Uruguay Round and its impact  on Japan's economy. I do not think there was much joy in the  industrial community, at business job sites, or in the financial  market because of the conclusion of the negotiations. The  Japanese economy is undergoing hard times after the collapse of  the bubble, so its mid-range project can cover only three years.  However, the Uruguay Round will not bear fruit quickly, but will  do so only gradually, taking five to 10 years. In that sense,  the Uruguay Round is not something eye-opening to Japan.    Although we do not currently applaud the Uruguay Round with  hand clapping, when we enter the latter half of 1990's after the  adjustment of the bubble's collapse, the Uruguay Round will  contribute to the enlargement of the world economy and world  trade, and the Japanese economy will be making satisfactory  development under the Uruguay Round. Such an understanding will  probably be accepted later, but currently it is not much in  vogue here in Japan.    [Nakamura] Concerning the agricultural field, which faced  rough going at the last stage of the negotiations, Japan is  conscious of the fact that it made a considerable concession in  opening its market to foreign rice--even if the opening of the  market is only partial. Foreign countries, on the other hand,  may feel that they have bestowed a considerable favor on Japan  on the grounds that they have provided such a special measure  only for Japan and South Korea. There is a great imbalance of  perception between Japan and other countries in that respect.    [Ogura] There may have been such an aspect to some extent.  However, there are several reasons, one of which is that Japan  has a current accounts surplus. Practically speaking, it is  politically very difficult for Japan to say that unless it gains  such and such a thing, it will not participate in the  negotiations. Meanwhile, the United States and Europe want to  take such and such a thing, and they have to say with great  emphasis that they must take such and such a thing to persuade  their own countries. Actually the EC as a whole is running a  deficit with Japan, and it has recently had a trade deficit with  the United States. There is also a problem with newly  industrialized countries.    Japan had wanted to say, "What will Japan gain from the  success of the Uruguay Round?," but if Japan had brought that  matter up for negotiation, it would have been improper.  However, I think that Japan should have made its share in the  agricultural field clear, instead of saying: "The partial  opening of the rice market was all right because profits can be  made in the field of industrial products." "The free trade  system has been preserved." We should have had more discussion  in our country.    However, if we had pursued this line of thinking, we would  have been obliged to adopt "a struggle on certain conditions."  However, in the case of the rice problem, Japan could not  politically engage in such a struggle from the beginning. The  general public was of the opinion that Japan would be absolutely  opposed to the partial opening to the end; or that was a  political reality. But as Mr. Nakamura has said, if we take  such and such a thing because it brings us such and such a  profit--in short, taking something corresponds to giving  something--that constitutes a struggle on certain conditions. I  wonder if Japan could engaged in such a struggle in the field of  agriculture.    I have a feeling that Japan should have begun the  negotiations a little earlier. Since Japan imports a large  quantity of agricultural products such as food, it had  bargaining power. We should have made good use of it. However,  great restrictions would probably have been imposed if Japan had  tried to exercised such bargaining power in the Uruguay Round  negotiations.    [Nakamura] For one thing, Japan was superficially  optimistic about agriculture when the Uruguay Round began in  1986. Despite the fact that for some reason or other, Japan did  not at first clearly declare its intentions that "Japan's stance  on the agricultural field is like this," it suddenly began to  say "this is the maximum permissible limit for Japan as far as  agriculture is concerned." Since Japan did not mention this  when the negotiations began, I do not think that it could  explain its position internationally. Moreover, a Diet  resolution took place during the negotiations. It is impossible  to have a resolution without a dissenting voice on this kind of  problem, and such a resolution does not restrain the decision of  the government. Despite that, too much emphasis was placed on  the resolution even at the end of the negotiations. It was very  unfortunate that behind-the-scenes negotiations had to be  conducted on the basis of that resolution. Therefore, Japan  should have engaged in a struggle upon certain conditions on the  way however complicated the matter became within Japan. In  return for that, Japan should have accurately explained its  position that "this is the maximum permissible limit for Japan,"  and then it should have conducted discussions with the process  of diplomatic negotiations open to some extent.    The tariffication of rice is to be postponed for six years,  but I wonder what the result will be. The amount of minimum  access six years after the postponement is 800,000 tons, which  is a considerable amount. Such a consideration makes one think  that tariffication from the beginning would have been better.  Then the minimum access of 5 percent will suffice six years  after the postponement. The tariff rate six years after the  postponement will become quite high. Even if we had set the  tariff rate high at the time of the negotiations' final  conclusion, that would have been internationally acceptable.  The negotiations' conclusion that makes one think that  tariffication from the beginning would have better is  unfortunate.  <H5>  Japan's Negotiations Began With Food Security </H5>   [Ogura] As a line of thinking, Mr. Nakamura has said that we  could have engaged in a struggle upon certain conditions. After  all, GATT is ultimately negotiations in the interest of  exporting countries. Of course, importing countries have  various interests, and they have the right to speak in  rulemaking concerning the problem of dumping, for example.  However, the negotiations card is held overwhelmingly by  exporting countries.    Under the GATT system, primary negotiating power is  traditionally given to the main supplying countries.  Negotiations are realized when there are exports between  countries, so negotiations are out of the question when  agricultural products are not exported. It is worthwhile to  listen to the opinion that we should have engaged in a struggle  upon certain conditions earlier. One of the problems with that  opinion is whether it was really advantageous for Japan to  engage in a struggle upon certain conditions, leaving Japan's  agriculture situation of importing agricultural products as it  was. As an extreme case, Japan should think of further  enhancing the added value of agricultural products economically  and rationally to export them, although I do not mean to say  that the government should provide export subsidies; otherwise,  under the existing circumstances, Japan will not be able to  enter into international negotiations concerning agriculture.    Another thing is what Japan said when it first raised the  problem of rice: it was not the environment, but food security,  which is not only an economic theory, but social psychology and  a kind of political theory. In short, a certain degree of  supply and demand and the maintenance of the food control system  are already included in food security as a tacit premise. Since  Japan entered into the negotiations on the basis of a food  security theory, it could not assume a quite different  negotiating attitude later.    It is possible to discuss what was most advantageous to  Japan  from a purely economic viewpoint when calculations were  made--minimum access of 5 percent or minimum access of 8  percent, for example. However, it is a little doubtful whether  such a discussion was meaningful in actual negotiations.  Therefore, opinions may differ as to what kind of negotiation  was possible for Japan.    However, since Japan entered into the negotiations on the  basis of a food security theory, it had to bid at that point, so  to speak. If Japan had entered into the negotiations on a basis  other than a food security theory, it could have argued for  comprehensive tariffication instead of the choice it had made.  However, since Japan started from the position--"Food security  is everything. Japan will preserve the food control system," it  set a limit on its solution of the matter, although that limit  was not clear.    [Nakamura] Preservation of the food control system is  only a temporary measure; tariffication of rice will be  inevitable in six years. Japan should discontinue what it has  undertaken. If the present situation continues for six years,  there will be tariffication. Since there will be no minimum  access then, there is no knowing if the current food control  system can be preserved. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry,  and Fisheries will say that the food control system can be  maintained since national trade is recognized. However, I do  not think that rice producers will gain vigor under the present  circumstances. Such a situation is not very conducive to  Japan's agriculture as a whole.    Japan is already a country established on the basis of trade  and is also an advanced industrialized nation. The question is  what to do with agriculture in such a situation. Furthermore,  Japan still holds inefficient sectors and cannot neglect them  since its political power is still very strong on the surface.  Nevertheless, Japan must grow on the basis of behavior  befitting an advanced industrialized nation, while it is obliged  to say "agriculture is very important." I am very sorry that  the negotiations were conducted under such a situation.    [Okumura] Japan's agriculture is now very weak in  international competitiveness. There are various reasons for  its weakness. For example, the exchange rate has undergone a  successive change -- 360 yen, 240 yen, and 120 yen; Japan's  agricultural production costs suddenly become high in terms of  labor costs and the current exchange rate. This does not  necessarily mean that Japanese farmers are lazy. We must spend  time and use a careful strategy to improve agriculture. I know  that it would have been better if we had entered into the  negotiations with an agricultural policy on our part, but now it  is useless to say so. We must improve the competitiveness of  Japan's agriculture by means of a careful strategy for some  years to come. It is very difficult to decide whether we should  improve competitiveness while rice is being partially  liberalized or while a high tariff with a high rate of  transparency is being imposed on rice.    [Ogura] One method is to improve competitiveness while the  measure of minimum access is being taken as it is now.    Therefore, I do not necessarily think it a good choice to  continue a price competition for some years to come. An  important prior condition, however, is to implement a policy to  improve competitiveness during that period.    [Nakamura] The most important thing to do is to thoroughly  discuss again what the Uruguay Round's conclusion was all about  as far as agricultural policy is concerned. The past  agricultural policy as a whole is now being questioned.    [Okumura] If some agricultural sectors are liberalized  through deregulation, the prices of raw materials will be  reduced by one-fourth for consumers and producers, and high  value-added products with international competitiveness will be  made. The presence of regulations, however, makes the prices of  raw materials unusually high, which makes it impossible to make  high value-added products. Such agricultural sectors exist,  therefore, the government should turn to deregulation so that  those sectors can have an international competitive edge,  instead of maintaining regulations for protection.    [Nakamura] The food industry is dissatisfied with the  recent conclusion. The tariffication of butter and powdered  skim milk, for example, has not made them very cheap. The price  of sugar is the same as it has been. Candy makers say: "Raw  materials are very expensive and we cannot compete with European  products at such prices." We should at least say to such  people, "Please be patient for six or 10 years, because the  competitiveness of agriculture has been weak." "We will do our  best after that." Unless we do that, consumer prices will be  influenced. In truth, the recent conclusion ignored consumers  in the agricultural field. It is necessary for the agricultural  people to acknowledged "that fact" and act accordingly.    However, instead of procrastinating, we should have made  more  requests to Europe and the United States, saying: "We will  accept tariffication, in return for which, you too...," by  playing our strongest card, tariffication. For the past few  years, the opinion has been held that food security could be  accomplished so long as the opening of rice markets was  prevented. For the future, however, we should ask ourselves  what food security really means and think of food security as a  whole without confining our concern to rice only.    [Ogura] Both the United States and Europe had their own  agricultural policies. The framework of the Common Agricultural  Policy, a famous European agriculture reform policy, had already  been made. The task of Europe was how to tide over the Uruguay  Round negotiations within the framework of that policy. The  United States had a new agricultural policy based on the  Agricultural Law of 1985, which led to the security of incomes.  The United States wanted world trade rules to go along with its  agricultural policy.    However, did Japan really have an agricultural policy prior  to the negotiations? Is it not true that, because of the  Uruguay Round, Japan delayed working out an agricultural policy  or an agricultural policy vision? If there had been a new  agricultural policy vision 10 years before and the Uruguay Round  negotiations had been conducted accordingly, the situation would  have been different.    [Nakamura] That is right. Japan could have said like Europe,  "That is our framework." This time Japan could not say, "This  is our limit."  <H5>  Momentum Was Given by the Tokyo Summit </H5>   [Nakamura] What led the Uruguay Round negotiations, which  had had difficult sailing, to a successful conclusion at the end  of last year? I have a feeling that the conclusion came  suddenly.    [Ogura] Well, in a word, what moved international politics  ultimately is time, that is, a time limit. In short, the  successful conclusion was due to the schedule that stipulated  that a conclusion must be reached by 15 December. Of course,  there were schedules prior to that, but then it was possible to  change the schedules politically. The reason was the demand of  the U.S. Congress for a fast-track decision on the measure.  Europe was still in the process of its 1992 integration. Of  course, all had a deadline in a way, but it was a goal, not a  deadline in the true sense of the word which meant a catastrophe  if it was not observed. This time the negotiators of the  Uruguay Round drove themselves into a corner--to the brink of  success or failure.    Another reason is that times were bad. Clearly, grave  concern was aroused during the Tokyo summit in September: "It  is not right if we cannot even bring the Uruguay Round to a  successful conclusion in the face of such a recession." I have  a feeling that such a mood had been growing steadily since last  spring.    [Nakamura] The change in GATT directors general, from Dunkel  to Sutherland, produced a certain amount of flexibility. An  atmosphere was born in the secretariat which allowed it to  decide to drop tasks that could not be accomplished despite a  series of efforts--audiovisuals and U.S. marine transportation  business, for example.    [Ogura] That is right. In looking back, we find that the  Tokyo summit played an important role. At that time, I was a  little doubtful about the effects on the Uruguay Round caused by  the summit. Of course, the summit had an effect on the Uruguay  Round, but, when the summit was over, I did not know whether  such an effect could bring the Uruguay Round to a successful  conclusion. In truth, the commitment of the world's prime  ministers and presidents to the Uruguay Round was a very  decisive element.    [GAIKO FORUM] I have the impression that the problems  between  Japan and the United States became complicated as soon as the  Uruguay Round negotiations were concluded and establishment of  the WTO was decided.    [Ogura] A very serious problem in the future will be  cross-retaliation: When one country feels dissatisfied with the  other in the trade of goods, it takes countermeasures against  that country in the services sector; when one country has a  complaint about the other in financial matters, it imposes  restraints on the trade of goods. If a dispute arises about  licenses such as intellectual property rights, the problem is  how the dispute is settled when the WTO will be entwined with  the unified procedures for settling disputes, procedures which  have just been stipulated. The GATT has concerned itself  primarily with goods. Now, however, intellectual property  rights or services such as finance and maritime transportation  have become important. For this reason, the method of settling  disputes itself will become a very important problem  internationally. At the same time, the problem of exchange  rates will become important.    The average U.S. and Japanese tariff rate on industrial  goods  now stands at 3 to 5 percent. Thus, even if the 3-percent  tariff rate is decreased by 30 percent, the average tariff  rate--of 3 percent--will then fall to no more than about 2  percent. What is the movement of exchange rates compared to  that? The movement of tariff rates does not bear comparison to  that of exchange rates. Ours is a world in which a fluctuation  of 1 yen or 2 yen is a daily occurrence. At the time of the  Tokyo summit, everyone asked me, "What is the value of a  reduction of only 1 percent despite years of serious  negotiations?" Since the time of the Tokyo summit, it has been  decided that it is better to make business easier through  harmonization, such as the elimination of nontariff barriers and  business uncertainty, than to engage in talks to reduce tariff  rates by such and such a percentage. Thus, a sector where the  results cannot be expressed in terms of figures has been  broadened and this time has come to include services and  intellectual property rights.    In this way, the problems of the substance of trade  negotiations have undergone a great change with the change of  the world economy. To me, the big question is what type of form  the next negotiations will take.    [Okumura] Negotiations on services have not been conducted  under GATT. That has become possible starting with the recent  negotiations. This means that a country which is strong in the  service sector in terms of comparative advantage has gained an  advantage over others. It will become possible for a country  which is not strong in the production of goods, in terms of  comparative advantage, to tide over difficulties, even if it  encounters difficulties in the goods sector, as long as the  liberalization of the services sector is further promoted.  Because each country has its own strong and weak sectors  according to its industrial structure, it has become impossible  to conduct multilateral negotiations only in the goods sector  without including collateral services. In that sense, the  recent conclusion of the negotiations was inevitable.    Now, the next question is what kind of benefit will the  recent conclusion confer on the world economy. According to the  calculations of the GATT Secretariat and the OECD, the volume of  trade will be increased by 10 percent 10 years from now.  However, when the development of the economy for the next 10  years is considered, policy adjustments and the stability of  exchange rates will have a much greater impact. In short, it is  impossible to say that the recent conclusion of the negotiations  has paved the way for stable development of the world economy.  With the growth of services progressing at a such rate among  industrialized nations, exchange rates and policy adjustments  will become more important than ever.    [Nakamura] The OECD's forecast is based on the premise of  the smooth liberalization of the existing 15 sectors.  Therefore, the liberalization of audiovisual products, maritime  transportation, and banking were not touched on. The  liberalization of agricultural products will progress much  further than it has, but we cannot expect too much; its effect  will not be so great.    [Ogura] Although there are many things that cannot be  quantified, the recent conclusion will contribute very little to  the development of the world economy in terms of quantity. Why,  then, is such a thing necessary? It is because the present  international trade order is being barely maintained through  negotiations after doing something--at least something  accomplished through forward movement. If such negotiations  fail, or if we do nothing, protectionism, regionalism, or  selfish unilateralism will prevail. Such a phenomenon will occur  everywhere and will create confusion. In a sense, the Uruguay  Round is like a safety valve.    [Okumura] What would have happened if the recent  negotiations  had failed or if they had not been on the Uruguay Round  negotiations themselves? We can find the answer by looking at  the reactions of the markets after the breakdown of the  Japan-U.S. negotiations. Because of uncertainty about the  future, the exchange rate rose to 102 yen to the dollar, and the  stock market index decreased by about 1,000 yen to 18,900 yen  immediately after the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework  talks. After a few days, however, the yen returned to nearly  106 yen as of today, and the Nikkei-Dow Jones average returned  to the 20,000 level.    As is evident from the above figures, the markets became  calm  because of the calculation that even if the United States  threatens Japan with its trade act, either it will not be able  to carry out the threat or after a time it will adopt a policy  to urge Japan to make a drastic policy change, no matter how  serious such a threat may be now, because the United States  sooner or later has to adopt a policy which conforms to the  results of the Uruguay Round talks.    If the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks had  occurred in the absence of the GATT system or the Uruguay Round  negotiations, there would have been great turmoil in the foreign  exchange markets and stock markets. Because the GATT system and  the Uruguay Round negotiations had a tremendous effect in  calming the situation, their potential supportive power is great.    [Nakamura] In this way, it has become possible to bring a  case such as the Super 301 to the WTO. A system that is  understandable internationally to some extent has come into  being. Nobody will think it unpardonable for Japan to appeal to  the WTO. At least, a system has been established under which  the general thinking is "The U.S. behavior is rather funny."    [Okumura] Will the WTO be strengthened in terms of its staff  and authority compared to the present establishment?    [Ogura] Radically speaking, GATT has not been recognized as  an international agency so far. In differing from the IMF, GATT  has a secretariat but has never been a big international agency.  That may have prompted GATT to recognize the fact that it has  not been recognized formally, to improve its organization as an  international agency, to establish a supervisory organization,  to increase its staff, and to establish more committees.    [Nakamura] However, the United States really does not like  the idea.    [Ogura] That is a difficult question. As you have said, the  WTO has a negative aspect. At the same time, what the United  States wants the most now is in the fields of services and  intellectual property rights. Therefore, the United States will  prefer the WTO with new improvements to a GATT which remains  unchanged.    [Nakamura] Ultimately, the chances are: "The WTO will do.  We will ratify it through a fast-track process."    [Ogura] That has a lot to do with the fact that the WTO  covers new sectors. It is developing countries that offered the  strongest resistance to the WTO covering new fields. That is  because things which are left largely unattended to, such as  intellectual property rights and medical supplies, will be  placed under the control of the WTO. It is very likely that  these countries will venture into the services sector in areas  such as banking. Another great problem remaining to be solved  is the movement of unskilled laborers.    The Need for Adjustment of Macroproblems and  Microproblems    [Nakamura] What about the problem of developing countries?    [Ogura] Opinions differ on this matter. One important  problem which the recent Uruguay Round did not discuss was "the  theory of graduation," which was a kind of taboo. However, this  problem cannot be a taboo after five years. This problem will  have to be handled in the same manner as other problems. After  five or seven years, some of the developing countries will  surpass the so-called industrialized nations in terms of income,  will they not?    [Nakamura] Aside from countries which have graduated or are  graduating, what did the recent negotiations mean to countries  which have not yet graduated? Tariffs on fibers, for example,  were not lowered very much, although tariffs on tropical  products were lowered a little. On the other hand, however,  developing countries had to accept the conditions laid down by  industrialized nations concerning intellectual property rights  and services. If the labor markets had been opened a little  more, developing nations would have gained an advantage. I do  not think that developing countries gained very much.    [Ogura] In short, developing countries have been divided  into  about three groups. Even aid is not provided for cumulative  debt-plagued countries; the debts to be paid are growing larger.  It is such a vicious circle. To the second group of countries,  aid is more important than trade. Vietnam, for example, is  receiving aid from various countries, but it is still not yet  mature in terms of trade.    It is about time for South Korea and Taiwan to live on  trade.  These countries, which belong to the third group, will gain much  from the Uruguay Round. The second group of countries, which  gets along on aid, will have a very hard time, although the  Uruguay Round is trying to gradually reduce the barriers to  their export of fibers, for example, which has already become a  sensitive issue. To countries with a heap of debts, the  question is surely how much demand there is for their tropical  products. Japan is in a position to import a considerable  amount of primary products, and it gives special consideration  to buying the products of the least developed countries,  although the amount of its orders is not necessarily great. The  reason is that Japan could afford this and that it has an  appropriate stand on placing orders.    In the negotiations held on 15 December in Geneva, the  developing countries said, "Japan has done very well." However,  when we looked at the contents of the trade products involved,  we felt ashamed because we had not paid careful attention to the  so-called tropical products as well.    [Nakamura] Is Japan in favor of Taiwan, China, Russia, and  others joining GATT?    [Ogura] The situation will become very unstable if China,  which has a population of 1 billion, and a giant like Russia  remain outside of the GATT system. When viewed in perspective,  it will be better if they follow the international rules.    However, there is an opinion that conditions for competition  should be equalized through the unification of different  conditions now existing in each country because of the  intensification of mutual dependence in the world economy. For  example, an opinion prevails that environmental regulation,  product liability laws, and labor standards law are different;  it is unfair to compete under such a situation; therefore, these  laws and regulations should be unified to some extent.    It is all right if the situation stays at this level.  However, if one says, "The method of the application of the  antimonopoly law is different, so make it identical," the other  retorts, "What about the social conditions?" In short, it is  like unification in Europe. An opinion prevails that conditions  must be the same to effect a smooth unification. In addition,  discussions are under way about the North American Free Trade  Agreement [NAFTA]. Some hold a view which is close to social  dumping [business seeking to sell goods in foreign markets at  low prices by unfairly lowering their production costs through  low wages and poor labor conditions]. What we think of social  dumping is very important. In a certain sense, the Japan-U.S.  Structural Impediments Initiative talks were held on the basis  of this idea. However, if we talk to developing countries, such  as the least developed countries, about social dumping, they  react very strongly.    Speaking of the post-Uruguay Round era, people concerned  with  trade mention the following: environmental, labor, and  competition policy; in other words, the problem of the  environment and trade, the labor standards law, and competition  policy. They say that if competition policies differ greatly,  the behavior of enterprises will become different. In my  opinion, such an idea is somewhat problematic. I believe that  Japan should think about the problem of regionalism, which is an  issue of longstanding, and the theory of graduation.    [Nakamura] I understand that the problems of the  environment and labor will come up in the post-Uruguay Round  era. The point is that if the Uruguay Round in its present form  has a role to play internationally, what is its relationship  with the regionalism of today? In short, there is NAFTA for the  United States and the European Union for Europe, and their  member nations will increase. There is nothing but GATT for  Japan. That makes the recent conclusion all the more meaningful.    Therefore, Japan should rectify the closed nature of  international trade, although that may be difficult in reality.  Of course, because Japan itself has a lot to reflect on, it  should do what it ought to do. Also, it will be splendid if  Japan becomes a leader in creating a new order or rules for  international trade.    [Okumura] If the WTO is really recognized as a third  international agency, it will exist alongside the IMF and the  World Bank. And things will not function well unless these  three agencies coordinate their work. Following the recent  Japan-U.S. negotiations, a high-ranking U.S. official seems to  have led the negotiations to the advantage of the United States  through the instrument of the exchange rate. How do you assess  this? I think what the United States did was absolutely wrong.  If such a thing is permitted, it may lead to a situation  similar to that of the Great Depression in the 1930's.    [Ogura] The trouble is that the group that discusses  macroeconomics internationally through policy coordination is  different from the group that discusses trade.    [Okumura] Of the international agencies, if the trade sector  of the WTO and the policy coordination sector of the IMF do not  cooperate closely, the situation will become all the more  difficult.    [Ogura] It is important for those two international  agencies,  or for the people working in them, to discuss things together.  For example, the two agencies can make use of the process of  discussions within summit meetings. With the establishment of  the WTO, if the two agencies act without close cooperation, a  serious problem will arise.    [Okumura] Now, let us suppose that the exchange rate  overshoots itself. Let us, for example, suppose that the yen  rises to 100 yen to the dollar through speculative transactions  of the yen in Japan because of the utterances of a U.S.  Government bureaucrat or official. It is essentially impossible  to maintain the rate of 100 yen to the dollar unless there is a  change in macropolicy. However, when capital transactions are  conducted on a colossal scale all over the world as they are  today, and when there are many uncertain elements concerning the  future, those who engage in foreign exchange speculation by  utilizing the comments of statesmen will win the game for a  certain period. Then the psychology of enterprises will be  shaken. Now, when, for example, Japan changes its strategy and  decides to manufacture goods in China instead of in Japan, this  poses the large question of whether that choice is good for the  Japanese.    There is a great difference between plants that are trying  hard to streamline themselves and cut production costs, and  international transactions that could wipe out the profits of  companies overnight in the wake of severe exchange rate  fluctuations. Therefore, I can fully understand plant  officials' cries to the effect that they cannot conduct regular  economic activity unless exchange rates are stable. Unless  global trade arrangements like the Uruguay Round, world trade,  and the WTO are connected with exchange-rate stability, they are  really meaningless to the welfare of the Japanese people. I  believe that moves toward direct investment are also meaningless  to the welfare of the Japanese if the exchange rate remains  unstable.    Another problem is a relationship between macroproblems and  microproblems. Let us suppose that the United States is in a  hysterical situation because of it being a colossal debtor  nation, when it has failed to take the most proper policy in the  matter of macropolicy. Then the United States tends to engage  in a sector-by-sector approach, which is quite understandable  emotionally. On the other hand, the creditor nation which  pushes the United States around is thinking in a coolheaded  manner and tends to say nothing but that "the other party is in  a hysterical mood." The country which is being pushed around  has no alternative but to take a sector-by-sector approach.  This is exactly what has happened now between Japan and the  United States.    It is the logic of a coolheaded person to say, "It is  impertinent for the other party to talk about numerical targets"  and "It is against GATT's rules." People who are in an abnormal  state in the matter of macroproblems will not listen to such a  claim. Then, because macroproblems and microproblems begin to  influence each other, discussion that coordinates the two will  be necessary. You have engaged in international negotiations.  What do you think of this?    [Ogura] That is the most difficult thing to do, because we  have no place to hold such discussions except in the preparatory  stage of a summit meeting. The IMF has recently begun to  discuss the problem of trade. However, unless the IMF, the  OECD, and GATT have a joint meeting in a multilateral place,  they will reach the limits of their resources under the current  practice.    There is another problem between the two countries. For  example, macroproblems and microproblems are clearly separated  in the case of Japan and the United States, a case which is very  problematic. It is a little unusual now for the two countries  to treat macroproblems bilaterally. We should include Europe to  make negotiations really multilateral. How to coordinate  bilateral and multilateral negotiations may be the greatest  problem of the post-Uruguay Round period.    [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.</p>

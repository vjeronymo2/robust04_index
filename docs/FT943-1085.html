			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Churchill China plans to raise Pounds 15m Churchill China is coming to the market next month. It is the third oldest Staffordshire-based china company to float in the last year, after Royal Doulton and Denby. Churchill, founded under the Sampson Bridgwood name 200 years ago, wants to raise Pounds 15m via a placing. About Pounds 5m of the proceeds will be used to carry out an investment programme to improve capacity and quality. The balance will go to the three brothers whose family have run the company since 1922. After the float, the Roper family will have about 55 per cent of the enlarged equity. Mr Stephen Roper, chief executive, says a flotation would also give the group the flexibility to attract and keep management expertise with incentives such as share options. Churchill has three divisions - tableware, hotelware and fine china. Tableware produces the cheaper earthenware product in traditional floral or blue willow patterns. Churchill intends to invest about Pounds 800,000 in this division. In 1993 hotelware contributed Pounds 1.7m to group profits of Pounds 2.9m. Churchill would invest about Pounds 5.5m in the division to expand capacity. The flotation will include a profits forecast. Mr Roper said Churchill would show an improvement on last year's Pounds 2.9m profit and Pounds 36m in sales. Hoare Govett is sponsor. Other companies revealing plans to come to market include Brunner Mond, the UK's biggest soda ash group, New Look, a womenswear retailer, and Ennemix, an aggregates company. Sold by Imperial Chemical Industries in 1991 to Penrice, a management buy-in company since renamed, Brunner could be valued at about Pounds 250m when it floats early in 1995. New Look is to launch a placing and open offer by the end of the year, valuing the company at Pounds 150m-Pounds 180m and involving some 35 per cent of the equity. Founded by deputy chairman, Mr Tom Singh, the company has 221 retail outlets in the UK and 10 in France. In the year to March 26 last, sales were Pounds 88.4m and profits was Pounds 10.9m. Ennemix's previous flotation proposal to raise almost Pounds 9m from a rights issue offered to shareholders of Anglesey Mining for a 15 per cent stake in the quoted mining group, received insufficient institutional support. Instead it is planning a placing to raise about Pounds 4.45m.</p>

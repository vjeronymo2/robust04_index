			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weaker on dollar's low against yen The rise of the yen, and the fall in the dollar to a new post-war record low of Y99.85 late on Tuesday in New York took Japanese equities to their third successive decline yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. The Nikkei 225 average ended 231.84. or 1.1 per cent, lower at 20,581.32 in rising activity, volume climbing from 318m shares to an estimated 500m. Brokers said there was heavy arbitrage selling, but that the Bank of Japan's active intervention in the currency markets, in support of the dollar, had invited buying on the dips in equities. This 'bottom-fishing' allowed the index to close well off the day's low of 20,371.37, although it also registered a high of 20,742.65 in the process. The broad market was also weak, the Topix index of all first section stocks closing 15.00 down at 1,648.97. Declines led advances by 887 to 152, with 115 issues unchanged. The Nikkei 300 fell 2.24 to 299.28 and the second section index shed 22.44 to 2,407.27 in 17.15m shares, but later in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index finished 3.43 up at 1,346.99. Japanese equities had risen this year on hopes that the economy would improve dramatically, said an analyst at a Big Four brokerage; but this scenario was formed on estimates that the dollar would stay at around Y105. Many companies would be forced into downward earnings forecast revisions if the yen stayed around Y100. Failing a recovery in the dollar, said brokers, the Nikkei 225 could fall to 20,000. Foreign investors were net sellers of Japanese stocks yesterday, and it took active domestic buying linked to the launch of new investment trusts and other institutional investment requirements to prevent equities from falling further. The key declines were in the transportation, rolling stock, fishery and steel sectors. Also, many high-technology issues were weaker as investors sold off exporters' shares on a higher yen. Oki Electric dipped Y7 to Y779 and Sony, in spite of its legal victory in the George Michael case in England, fell Y90 to Y6,070. Mitsubishi Oil, which performed well on Monday and Tuesday, closed unchanged at Y1,050: it announced on Monday that it had drilled a successful test well yielding 10,346 barrels per day of oil off the coast of Vietnam. Roundup Interest rate uncertainties remained, but the region offered indications of recov-ery. Colombo was closed for a holiday. PAKISTAN climbed on bullish sentiment in blue chips, as institutions moved in before the close of corporate books on June 30. The KSE 100 index rose 38.21, or 1.65 per cent, to 2,348.70. Higher cement prices, and privatisation in the fuel and energy sector, took constituent stocks into an uptrend. SYDNEY rose for the first time in a week on a steadier bond market and an advance in the gold price. The All Ordinaries index was ahead 17.3 at 2,010.9, after slipping to 1,988.1. Industrials, resources and golds were strong performers, the golds index putting on 35.1 at 2,259.1 after the rise in the bullion price on Tuesday night. HONG KONG overcame overseas selling and negative sentiment to end modestly higher. The Hang Seng index closed 19.06 better at 8,876.84 after falling below the 8,800 level in the early morning. Turnover was a light HKDollars 2.57bn. Uncertainties about US interest rates and gloomy financial markets worldwide kept foreign investors at bay. SINGAPORE was mixed. It featured a strong rebound in Malaysian shares traded over the counter, but the Straits Times Industrial index, composed of domestic blue chips, ended 6.57 easier at 2,255.30. Brokers said Malaysian OTC stocks benefited from bargain hunting, and from rumours that a date for Malaysia's general election would be announced this week. BANGKOK finished 1.3 per cent down in moderate trade, with stocks falling across the board. The communications sector was the biggest loser, while the finance group was the most active. NEW ZEALAND tested its 2,012.82 low for 1994, the NZSE-40 index bottoming at 2,017.9 before ending 14.21 down at 2,029.53. Turnover was healthy at NZDollars 51.6m. TAIPEI was mixed in thin trade.

United Microelectronics continued its run of strength with a rise of TDollars 3 to TDollars 128.50.

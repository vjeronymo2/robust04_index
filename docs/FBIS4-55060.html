			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Svetozar Sarkanjac: "The Zagreb Agreement Is </F> Being Tested in Bosanska Posavina"]    [Text] It is not necessary to waste too many words on how  the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina are being reflected on the  peace process in Croatia. The enthusiasm for peace created  after the Washington and the Zagreb Agreements -- coordinated by  the military and political regimes from Belgrade, Pale, and Knin  -- were signed, has not only slowed down, but has almost come to  a halt. Exactly those negative things have happened that were  foreseen by the initiators of this peace process -- the U.S. and  the Russian representatives.    In spite of certain problems, the first stage of the Zagreb  Agreement has materialized in Eastern Croatia since an agreement  on the demarcation line in this sector was signed. On behalf of  "the two sides" the agreement was signed by Major General Djuro  Decak, the commander of the Osijek region, and Major General  Dusan Loncar, the commander of the Slavonija-Baranja Corps of  the Krajina army. On behalf of the UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] it was signed by Brigadier General van Dyck, the UN  commander of Sector East. The demarcation line, around 410 km  long and between several hundred and 2 km wide, was defined in  detail by this agreement. This flexible width of the so-called  buffer zone was reached after numerous specific requirements of  both sides had been fulfilled.    If both sides had insisted on the 2 km width, which was  foreseen by the Zagreb Agreement on buffer zones, the  demarcation zone would have included parts of many urban areas  on both sides. In that case, the Krajinans would have lost  parts of the occupied Baranja village of Bilje, parts of Tenja  near Osijek, as well as of parts of Mirkovci near Vinkovci. The  Croatian side would have lost certain suburban Osijek areas,  parts of important roads and manufacturing facilities, and a  part of the town of Osijek. In order to avoid such illogical  situations, it was decided that the demarcation line be flexible.  <H5>  Unease About Gorazde </H5>   The agreement concluding the first stage of the Zagreb  Agreement was signed after a delay of several days since the  events around Gorazde, especially the NATO bombardment of the  Serbian positions there, upset the Krajina Serbs. Their  reaction was -- at least in Sector East -- relatively  tempestuous. A meeting of commissions at the UNPROFOR control  point between Nemetin and Sarvas, which had already been agreed  upon, was canceled, and, according to unofficial information,  the Serbs blocked UN movements throughout the sector that day.  Apart from that -- according to the first confirmed, but then  denied statements by UN soldiers -- the Serbs took weapons  already put away between Tenja, Mirkovci and Baranja. Since the  local UNPROFOR denied the allegations of the Zagreb UNPROFOR,  and since the Croatian Army representatives did not openly  respond to the reported "exhibition" of Serbian weapons, nothing  serious occurred. Even if something had happened, the weapons  had already been returned to the warehouses.    This does not mean that something more serious cannot  happen.  Since the "Krajinan state" is very narrow in eastern Croatia,  the Serbs were enabled by the Zagreb Agreement to store heavy  weapons in Beli Manastir, Dalj, and Vukovar (something similar  was made possible for the Croatian Army in Starigrad, Zadar, and  Sibenik). We must not forget that not so long ago similar  experiences with storing of weapons behind double locks proved  to be extremely negative in this area. UN soldiers are now  having the same experience in Sarajevo. What does it mean for  security if, for example, a tank at full combat readiness is  under a simple lock in a warehouse guarded by several frightened  UN soldiers? Nothing! Just as if you had left your suitcase at  the railroad station left luggage office for when you needed it.  The only difference between checking in a tank and a suitcase  is that you have to pay to reclaim it at the railroad station.  <H5>  Bad Storage of Weapons </H5>   The proper storage of heavy weapons under UN control would  include a completely different procedure, which has,  unfortunately, never been applied in the former Yugoslavia.  Fuel and lubricants, for example, have to be drained out of a  tank and put into storage. After that, the communications system  should be removed and stored in some other place together with  ammunition, if possible far from the central warehouse. When  the owner of the tank stored in this way wants to take it by  force, he needs at least two or three days to get it ready for  combat. At the same time, the other side, which should be  granted security by this kind of storage, has enough time to see  what the enemy is up to. Such an example of heavy weapons  storage is nothing new or unknown. On the contrary, this system  has already been applied in some earlier UN peacekeeping  operations in other crisis areas.    A great many things, which in other crisis areas ended with  peace, have not been successful in the former Yugoslavia.  Therefore we should be pleased with the agreement reached in  eastern Slavonia since even such a situation was inconceivable  some time ago. Especially significant is the cooperativeness of  the Serbian negotiators, who are ready to grant certain  concessions to the Croatian side, although they always expect  something in return. Generally speaking, life is easier in  eastern Slavonia now.    Commenting on the new situation, Milan Martic, the  "president  of the republic of Serbian Krajina," told journalists during his  visit to Baranja that he wished the peace process to continue,  especially those parts of it which concern economic issues. As  usual, the Serbian side imposed new conditions. The first was  that the negotiations should not be held at the Russian Embassy  in Zagreb.  <H5>  Martic's Blackmail </H5>   "Negotiations on the establishment of economic relations  with  the Croatian side can be held at any Russian embassy in the  world, except for those in Croatia and Germany," Martic said,  and added another condition. "We can negotiate with Croats only  as equal partners, as two equal states. In order to meet this  condition, the UN Security Council has to lift the sanctions  imposed on the "Krajinans" according to Resolution 820. If  normal communications with Hungary and Slovenia are not made  possible, we cannot negotiate on the second stage," Martic  stated decisively.    It does not matter whether the Krajina leadership is serious  or whether they are only dragging out the peace process since  the result is, at least for the near future, the same. The  events in Bosnia-Herzegovina support them since they have  "objective" reasons for stalling for time.  <H5>  The Key Is Bosanska Posavina </H5>   Apart from all this, further negotiations between Croatia  and  the "Krajinans," especially in this part of Croatia, can be  seriously affected by new activities by the Bosnian Serbs in  Bosanska Posavina. The aim of the latest military movements of  the Bosnian Serbs in this area is perfectly clear: the  enlargement of the "life corridor" to a width which will  guarantee them free passage between Banja Luka and Belgrade and  beyond to Knin. The present corridor is too narrow for the  Serbs. It can easily be closed by the coordinated action of the  HVO [Croatian Defense Council] from the northern part of the  corridor (the unoccupied area around Orasje) and of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina from the southern part (from the direction of  Gradacac or Tuzla).    During his recent visit to the occupied Bosanski Samac and  Brcko, where the Serbs celebrated the second anniversary of  "liberation," General Manojlo Milovanovic openly threatened  Croatia with attacks against targets in Croatian territory.  Without any scruples he stated that he could bring 20,000  soldiers to Bosanska Posavina to widen the corridor. In other  words he warned the Croats against attacking the northern  corridor line as long as they are widening the corridor toward  the south.    As soon as the Gorazde action is completed, the Bosnian  Serbs  will have a large number of soldiers at their disposal who can  be deployed in Bosanska Posavina. After the massacre in Gorazde  it cannot be expected that the Serbs can be scared by  international community threats, especially if they remain at  the present level.</p>

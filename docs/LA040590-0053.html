			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SECTION: BASEBALL TOP 10;  </P> <P> UNDEFEATED MIRA MESA BEST OF THE BEST  </P> <P> Spring vacation tournaments, such as the annual Lions tournament, normally give  teams an inkling as to where they stand heading into league play. But with  Easter falling in the middle of April this year, most teams have already begun  league play before Saturday's start of the Lions.  </P> <P> Some, like powerful Mira Mesa in a down City Eastern League, can already figure  a reasonable magic number for wrapping things up.  </P> <P> But most of the other top-ranked teams should find themselves in a battle with  as many as four teams. The Metro Conference, where early favorites Sweetwater  and Castle Park have been upstaged by Hilltop and Montgomery, is a perfect  example. Those two clubs were ninth and 10th in the Metro last year, but are  now tied for first.  </P> <P> Grossmont and Santana in the Grossmont 2-A League have just one loss each and  seem headed for a collision on April 27 when they meet at Santana.  </P> <P> Helix has slipped since making the section 3-A final the past two years, and  the Highlanders must now reckon with upstart Monte Vista as well as Granite  Hills in the Grossmont 3-A.  </P> <P> After the death of senior pitcher Ben Pai, Oceanside might become an emotional  favorite in the Avocado League. But the Pirates (7-2-1) will still have to  contend with El Camino, San Marcos and Escondido. Carlsbad, the defending 2-A  champion, is 3-6.  </P> <P> In the Palomar, perennial favorite Mt. Carmel, the defending 3-A champion,  should be tested by Orange Glen, Poway and Fallbrook.  </P> <P> USDHS might have figured to have an easy go in the City Western, but that was  before Monday, when Mission Bay, just 4-6 this year, ripped them, 17-2. La  Jolla and Kearny might also be factors.  </P> <P> Crawford (9-2) stands to crack the top 10 soon, but should feel some heat from  San Diego before things are through in the City Central.  </P> <P> Three games into the first ever City Harbor season, things are bunching up and  there does not appear to be a favorite as yet.  </P> <P> The Times' San Diego Section Baseball Top 10:  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1 MIRA MESA 1990 record: 13-0 League:  </P> <P> City Eastern  </P> <P> Coach: Mike Prosser  </P> <P> Mira Mesa, which was 22-5 last year and lost in the 3-A semifinals to eventual  champion Mt. Carmel, might be on top for a long time considering it has only  two senior starters -- Beau Champoux (.413 average) and pitcher Jimmy Escamilla  (26 strikeouts). Of the juniors, versatile Marc Nielsen is hitting .416 and is  3-0 on the mound. Though Prosser says hitting is the primary reason for the  fast start, pitching hasn't been shabby. Junior Mike Bovee leads the county at  6-0. "I'd have to say it's the best team I've had," Prosser said. "They play  real well together and they get along well. It's a real team effort."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 GROSSMONT 1990 record: 13-1  </P> <P> League: Grossmont 2-A  </P> <P> Coach: Jeff Meredith  </P> <P> Grossmont can score runs in bunches. Junior catcher Todd Cady is leading the  county in runs batted in (27), is tied for the lead in home runs (five) and is  tied for third in stolen bases (12). Senior third baseman John Tatum has three  homers and 16 RBIs, senior outfielder Lenny Van Every is hitting .475 with 15  RBIs and 12 stolen bases, and senior first baseman Jim Earley has two homers  and 13 RBIs. That production has made life easy for pitchers Danny Lennon (4-0,  0.69 ERA), Jason Eskridge (3-0) and Mike Spears (26 strikeouts). Meredith is in  his second season but guided the Foothillers to the 2-A title game last season.  A return to that game is possible this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3 MT. CARMEL 1990 record: 10-1  </P> <P> League: Palomar  </P> <P> Coach: Sam Blalock  </P> <P> For the past decade, the Sundevils have won four section titles. In the six  other years, they were eliminated by the eventual champion. So the road to the  title goes through Rancho Penasquitos. Although catcher Matt Miller (.275, nine  RBIs last year) is the only returning field player and Doug Hill (9-0, 2.56 ERA  last year) is the only returning pitcher, Mt. Carmel will rely heavily on a  junior varsity team that finished 19-2 in 1989. Blalock said this is his best  defensive team ever. Mt. Carmel has held opponents to two runs or less in eight  of 11 games, and only three runs in another.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4 SANTANA 1990 record: 11-1  </P> <P> League: Grossmont 2-A  </P> <P> Coach: Jim Saska  </P> <P> Before last year, Santana had made it to the 3-A title game four out of five  years, and won it all in '84 and '86. By its standards, Santana was down last  year finishing 15-10-1, including a first-round playoff loss. In 12 games this  year, the Sultans are hitting well and will challenge Grossmont for the league  and possibly the section title. Junior outfielder Gabe Hernandez is hitting  better than .500 and senior Ferdie Hollis has three home runs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5 MONTE VISTA 1990 Record: 10-3  </P> <P> League: Grossmont 3-A  </P> <P> Coach: Rob Phillips  </P> <P> With a new coach, a new field and renewed enthusiasm, Monte Vista broke a  16-year playoff drought last year. This year, the Matadors look to continue  those winning ways. Senior all-purpose player Vern Mullis (.434 average last  year) is second in the county with a .545 average and has three home runs and  13 RBIs. Darren Rucker is hitting .474 with 16 RBIs. On the mound, though, is  where the Matadors excel. Senior Ernie Reyes is 3-0 with a 1.91 ERA, junior  Robbie Stone is 4-1 with a 1.18 ERA, Mullis is 2-1 with a 1.51 ERA and senior  Neal Svalstad has a 0.88 ERA.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 6 USDHS 1990 record: 9-3  </P> <P> League: City Western  </P> <P> Coach: Richard Serrano  </P> <P> After finishing third in 1988 and second last year, there's no reason USDHS  can't take that final step and win its league. The Dons' have the enviable  balance of heavy hitting, fine pitching and all-around experience. Scattered in  the lineup are three of the county's top 25 hitters. Juniors Gavin Millay and  David Sanchez and senior Jeff Desjardins are all batting over .420. Tom Shanner  and Gary Remiker join Millay for a solid pitching staff. And there are six  players who were starters last year. Serrano's outlook is optimistic, but  cautious: "We can play with the best, but we can lose with the best, too."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 7 ORANGE GLEN 1990 record: 9-3  </P> <P> League: Palomar  </P> <P> Coach: Ken Walker  </P> <P> The strategy for first-year coach Ken Walker is pretty simple: keep other teams  from scoring. His pitching staff can do it. The Patriots have three solid  pitchers -- Scott Coleman (1.92 ERA), Jim Roby (2.10) and Damon Vinje (2.04).  The team allows less than two runs per game. Coleman set a section record  earlier this year by posting 16 consecutive no-hit innings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 8 HILLTOP 1990 record: 8-3  </P> <P> League: Metro  </P> <P> Coach: John Baumgarten  </P> <P> After dominating the South Bay in the early 1980s, it has been five years since  Hilltop last won a league title. The Lancers, ninth last year at 8-16, appear  ready to make a run. "We have a nice pool of talent," said Baumgarten, in his  19th year. "They are young, but they do think pretty well, and that's so  important in this game." Juniors Jose Silva (4-2) and Jose Gallegos (2-0) and  senior Martin Villanueva (2-1) form a solid staff. There are only three senior  starters, but they are up the middle -- catcher Paul Stojsavljevic, shortstop  Rich Dare and center fielder David Chapman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 9 MONTGOMERY 1990 record: 9-3  </P> <P> League: Metro  </P> <P> Coach: Manuel Hermosillo  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest surprise has been the turnaround made by the Aztecs. Tenth  last year in the league at 9-15, 4-10, Montgomery has posted big victories  already over Bonita Vista, Sweetwater and San Diego and is tied for first with  Hilltop at 3-0 in league. "I'm real surprised," Hermosillo said. "The kids set  their own standards after finishing last last season." Senior catcher Miguel  Perez (.481) leads six Aztecs hitting over .340. The others are seniors Luis  Arroyo (.400) and Mauricio Martinez (.350), juniors Saul Rodriguez (.372) and  Luis Contreras (.353) and sophomore Jose Laranzana (.342).  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10 POWAY 1989 record: 6-3-1  </P> <P> League: Palomar  </P> <P> Coach: Rudy Casciato  </P> <P> Poway returns three infielders and a catcher and should be among the favorites  to win league. Matt Schwenke, who has already signed a letter of intent to  UCLA, Greg Sorrell, and Brock Marsh all batted over .300 last year. Since  returning from a broken wrist before the season started, Schwenke has played in  two full games and hit two three-run home runs. Danny Miller is 3-1 and has 41  strikeouts in 32 innings.  </P></p>

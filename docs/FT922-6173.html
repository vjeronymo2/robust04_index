It is the largest export order won by the Weir Group company since it was set up four years ago, and is the first time it has supplied equipment to the Arctic regions. Weir Materials will supply pipes, fittings and flanges to the Point Mclntyre project, the Lisburne field expansion and the Prudhoe Bay development. The order has been placed by Arco Alaska Inc and its partners BP and Exxon. Contract delivery is scheduled for this summer. Initial orders will be serviced by a British and European manufacturing consortium co-ordinated by Weir Materials. The company has already signed agreements to transfer manufacturing and fabrication technology for Zeron-100 to steel mills in the United States with the aim of establishing an indigenous manufacturing capability.</p>

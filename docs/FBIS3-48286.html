He said: "Privately, I can accept any (compromise).  The most important thing is to change the election system." In  this way, he explained his view that the ruling coalition  parties should try to have the political reform bills approved  even at the risk of having to accept all the demands of the  Liberal Democratic Party for revision of the bills.    Moreover, regarding how the government should deal with the  situation if the bills are scrapped, Hata said: "We should not  create a (political) void because we have a pile of work to do.  However, since the political reform bills are worth making an  appeal to the confidence of the whole nation, I will not rule  out any possibilities." In this way, he referred to the  possibility of dissolving the lower house and holding a general  election.</p>

Mothers Against Drunk Driving and others have  correctly increased our social awareness and laws are being more strictly  enforced.  </P> <P> Now, the Supreme Court says the Fourth Amendment to the Bill of Rights should  be interpreted to read that citizens are only protected against "unreasonable  searches and seizures" that are too intrusive. Are we completely giving up on  the concept of "probable cause?" If our government continues to weigh "for the  greater good" over the danger of any evil, can we expect to give up even more  rights? This thinking is dangerous. What's next?  </P> <P> JOHN CELICK  </P> <P> San Marcos  </P></p>

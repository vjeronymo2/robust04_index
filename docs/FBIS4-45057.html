			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "`Coupon Book' for Bread"] </F>   [Text] Bread is in short supply in Bordj Bou Arreridj. The  governorate's 135 bakeries, which are literally besieged by the  citizens every day beginning at 0400, are no longer able to  satisfy demand. In the 35 communes, the same scenes of genuine  "stampedes" to buy bread are being observed. Some bakers have  already chosen the "coupon book" system giving their loyal  customers priority.    The phenomenon is explained by the shortage of semolina,  which has restricted breadmaking at home, and by the layout of  the governorate, whose largest towns are located on RN [National  Highway] 5, a major traffic artery generating an irregular and  unquantifiable demand that statistics are unable to predict with  any certainty.    The sales management of Eriad [five food industry  enterprises] reports, however, that it has increased its  deliveries of flour, which now border on 1,600 quintals per day.  The obvious inability to keep up with demand is being reflected  in the price of a baguette of French bread, which now sells for  5 dinars [DA]. Because of the complicity of a number of bakers  who prefer to sell their production "at wholesale," bread is  being found--at prohibitive prices and in dangerous hygienic  conditions--in grocers' stalls and for sale by street vendors.    Despite its efforts, Eriad says that for the present it is  unable to overcome the crisis, which cannot be eliminated except  by the arrival in the near future of large quantities of  semolina, deliveries of which will enable families to resume  their usual food habits.    The Bordj Bou Arreridj Governorate will be able to relieve  the small local bread "factories" when the industrial bakery now  nearing completion goes into operation. It will supply school  cafeterias and local communities. It will produce 35,000 loaves  per day.    The phenomenon is also explained by changes in the rural  population's food habits due to the gap between the cost price  of bread and of pastry/crepes. [sentence as published] The  peasants in the region have given up the practice of growing for  their own consumption because of the clearly superior advantage  they gain by selling their quintal of wheat for close to  DA1,400. There is a definite advantage in selling their entire  harvest with the added bonus of "lower domestic household  expenses."</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Accounting practice on assets highlighted MORE companies are adopting the controversial practice of not depreciating fixed assets such as buildings, an analysis by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based accounts monitoring service, indicated yesterday. It said that 22 per cent of a sample of 630 companies showed in their latest annual accounts evidence of assets that were not depreciated. The practice appears to be taken for granted by water companies, which do not depreciate infrastructure assets such as water mains, sewers, pipelines and reservoirs. Accounting standard SSAP 12 stipulates that a charge for depreciation should be shown in the profit-and-loss account for assets with a finite economic life - including for buildings. However, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the policing arm of the UK's new accounting standards regime, appeared to endorse the practice of non-depreciation on certain assets when it cleared Forte, the hotels group, of breaching that standard in February.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Vasilyeva: "One Way Out: An Ingush Enclave"] </F>   [Text] Despite the state of emergency existing in the zone  of conflict, a "quiet war" continues between the Ossetians and  Ingush. According to data from the Russian Ministry of Internal  Affairs, from December 1992 through January 1994, 167 homes of  Ingush and 107 of Ossetians were blown up, and more than 100  people were killed. Arms purchases and attacks on military  facilities continue. Many times the situation has been on the  verge of renewed armed clashes due to a failure to provide  accommodations for refugees in Ingushetia and Northern Ossetia.    Both sides continue to preserve their paramilitary  formations--"officially" in Northern Ossetia and "unofficially"  in Ingushetia. The leadership of Northern Ossetia explains its  refusal to disarm the republic guard (presently termed "units  for safeguarding economic facilities") by virtue of the absence  of borders with Chechnya and attacks on economic facilities by  armed individuals from Chechnya.    Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the State Committee on  Nationalities and Regional Policy Affairs, noted that until such  time as the sides engage in constructive negotiations, "Russia  is financing the conflict." We should add that in 1993, R100  billion from the federal budget was appropriated to finance  accommodations for refugees, and R23 billion--for upkeep of the  provisional administration.    The positions espoused by the parties have not undergone any  special change. The Ingush side has not abandoned the idea of  the return of Prigorodnyy Rayon--Article 1 of the Constitution  of Ingushetia, approved 27 February 1994, states that it is the  objective of the state to effect the return by political methods  of illegally seized lands. As before, the Ossetian side believes  that the status of Prigorodnyy Rayon within Northern Ossetia  must be consolidated in order to resolve the conflict, and  following this must come the demarcation of Ingush borders. The  North Ossetian leadership is insisting on the need for a  political assessment of the events of 1992 and on holding the  initiators of the conflict accountable. An agreement was reached  at the latest bilateral talks of 2-3 April on the return of  Ingush refugees to four villages: Chermen, Dangaron, Dachnoye,  and Kurtat in Prigorodnyy Rayon, as required by the Russian  Federation presidential edict of 13 December 1993. However,  Northern Ossetia is declaring its readiness to accept only those  Ingush who "did not participate in the conflict." In this  regard, in the opinion of the Ossetian side, resolution of this  issue should be comprehensive, i.e., should take into account  the problems of 47,000 Ossetian refugees from Georgia and  consideration of the opinion of the rural (Ossetian) population  that remains in Prigorodnyy Rayon. From all appearances, the  leadership of Northern Ossetia intends to torpedo resolution of  the problem of returning Ingush refugees to their homes. This is  seen by the slogan advanced one year ago of the "impossibility  of joint habitation" of Ossetians and Ingush.    The Ingush side, in turn, supports the introduction of  federal rule as the only measure capable of resolving the  problem of phased return of the Ingush to Prigorodnyy Rayon.    Most representatives of federal structures of power also  consider it necessary to introduce federal rule in the territory  inhabited by the Ingush in Prigorodnyy Rayon. However, they are  not raising this issue at trilateral meetings out of fear of  destabilizing the situation in the region. In addition, the  legal basis is lacking at present for effecting federal rule in  the territory of a nation-state formation in the Russian  Federation.    A full settlement of the conflict is impossible at the  present stage. To stabilize the situation in the zone of the  Ossetian-Ingush conflict, it would be advisable to drag out the  question of demarcation of borders of Northern Ossetia and  Ingushetia, since a "definitive" resolution one way or another  with respect to borders could aggravate the situation in both  republics and lead to new armed conflict.    It is necessary in the zone of conflict to return to the  idea  of creating a "purely Ingush" enclave of villages. Judging from  the decree adopted by the Northern Ossetia Supreme Soviet on the  "impossibility of joint habitation of Ossetians and Ingush," the  Ossetian side supports such a decision. The Ingush side will  likely come out against it since they are counting on a return  to the borders of 1944. However, creation of a "purely Ingush"  enclave of villages in the development of local self-government  will in time enable resolution of the problem of forming a broad  autonomy of Ingush in Northern Ossetia and will thus remove the  question of clashes of the Ingush populace with "Ossetian"  organs of authority, which was the immediate cause of the  military operations in 1992. In the future, the "Ingush enclave"  could fall within a dual jurisdiction--subordinate to Northern  Ossetia for administrative matters, to Ingushetia for cultural  affairs.    It is necessary that efforts begin in the construction of  housing and in the return of refugees to control of the federal  authority. In this regard, the financing of such measures must  be public and effected directly out of the federal budget.  Otherwise, it is highly likely that the leadership of Northern  Ossetia will reject the return of Ingush refugees under pretext  that the construction was proceeding "at the expense of the  republic budget" (although the budget of Northern Ossetia in  1993 was subsidized by the federal budget to the extent of 57  percent) and that its organs of authority have the right to  decide which refugees--Ossetians from Georgia or Ingush--are to  be settled into new homes.    The search for a resolution to the conflict must be based on  bringing the situation and the legal norms regulating it into  conformance with the general federal laws and Constitution of  the Russian Federation, not on historical research from various  points of view.    One of the most immediate tasks of the Federal Assembly is  to  draw up a legislative base to allow the federal center to  effectively play the role of arbiter in the event one of the  sides refuses to seek compromise. In addition, it is necessary  to develop a legal basis for the interrelationship between the  center and regions in order to overcome the lack of regulation  of the activities of local organs of authority on the part of  the federal center.    Periodic hearings in the Federation Council on settlement of  the Ossetian-Ingush conflict could become an effective mechanism  of accelerating the procedure for coordinating the positions of  the sides. This measure would enable the federal center to avoid  ill-considered decisions in the region, exert pressure on the  conflicting sides prior to the formulation of general federal  legislation on conflict resolution, and avoid accusations of  application of a unilateral approach in resolving the crisis.</p>

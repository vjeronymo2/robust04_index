			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Berlin avoids early poll Berlin's coalition government yesterday averted early elections after reaching a compromise about the future of the city's senator for interior affairs. Deputies from the Social Democratic party (SPD), the former communist Party of Democratic Socialism, and the Bundnis 90 environmental party had demanded the resignation of Mr Dieter Heckelmann, the interior senator, after it was disclosed his press spokesman had ties to a far right group of intellectuals known as the Tuesday Circle. But Mr Eberhard Diepgen, the Christian Democrat mayor of Berlin, and Mr Ditmar Staffelt, head of the SPD, had threatened to call elections, probably for October, if a no-confidence vote was called in the senate. The prospect of early elections worried both parties which are concerned about their popularity. Rather than go to the polls, the CDU and SPD agreed that Mr Heckelmann need not resign, but at the same time he can no longer have responsibility for protection of the constitution, a brief normally held by the interior ministry.</p>

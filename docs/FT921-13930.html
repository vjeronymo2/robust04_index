			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Cityvision Cityvision, the UK's largest chain of video rental stores, could be heading for a footnote in corporate finance manuals, if only as another example of belated intervention by the institutions. A few of them are backing a group of ex-managers in an attempt to oust a board which recently agreed to a Pounds 75m bid from Blockbuster, a US chain. Given that the bid resulted in Cityvision's share price doubling, the institutions might appear ungrateful. Instead, the two-year collapse in the shares from over 140p to a low of 22p last October has caused them to feel cheated by the 48p bid price. If the counter-attack is successful, the shares will presumably fall back again while the company is rebuilt. But with around a quarter of City-vision's shares in the hands of arbitrageurs, the institutions have their work cut out. Since they could simply have sold their shares, the obvious question is why it took a bid to spur them into action. The sad answer is that it almost always does. One only has to recall the case of Ultramar; had that company not produced one set of disastrous six-month results, it would presumably still be independent. The institutions claimed to have been concerned for years at levels of executive pay and the underperformance of Ultramar shares; but they achieved nothing to compare with the brutal simplicity of the Lasmo offer.</p>

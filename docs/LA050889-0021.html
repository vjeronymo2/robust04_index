			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DAVEY ALLISON ENDS DRY SPELL IN WINSTON 500  </P> <P> Davey Allison ended a 14-race streak without a victory Sunday as he held off  Terry Labonte and Mark Martin to win his second Winston 500 at Talladega, Ala.  </P> <P> Allison, from nearby Hueytown, Ala., last won in September at Richmond, Va.  </P> <P> But on the 2.66-mile, high-banked Talladega Superspeedway oval Allison won in  front of his father, longtime NASCAR star Bobby Allison, who won this event  three times -- the last time in 1986.  </P> <P> Bobby Allison is recuperating from serious injuries suffered in a racing crash  last June 19 at Long Pond, Pa.  </P> <P> "It's been a real up and down season and I can't think of a better place to  finally get things going," Davey Allison said.  </P> <P> "This is a brand new race car and it just came out here and drove perfect. All  I had to do was steer it and mash the gas.  </P> <P> "I'm just so happy my dad and mom are here. I only wish he was out here racing  with me again."  </P> <P> The younger Allison, who won the Winston 500 in 1987, drafted past Morgan  Shepherd into the lead on lap 180 of the 188-lap event and went on to his fifth  career victory and first of the season.  </P> <P> It was also his sixth career victory at Talladega, including four in ARCA stock  cars.  </P> <P> He finished only 0.22 seconds ahead of Labonte, who was just in front of  pole-winner Martin in the single-file battle of Ford Thunderbirds.  </P> <P> World Formula One champion Ayrton Senna of Brazil led from start to finish to  capture the Monaco Grand Prix at Monte Carlo for the second time.  </P> <P> Senna, driving a McLaren-Honda, was timed in 1 hour 53 minutes 33.251 seconds  for the race, shortened to 77 laps because of a restart.  </P> <P> Alain Prost of France, also in a McLaren-Honda, was runner-up, 52.529 seconds  behind Senna. Prost set a blistering lap record of 1:25.501 during the race.  </P> <P> Stefano Modena of Italy, in a Brabham-Judd, was third, more than a lap behind  Senna. Italians Alex Caffi and Michele Alboreto were fourth and fifth,  respectively. Martin Brundle of Britain was sixth.  </P> <P> It was Senna's 16th career Grand Prix victory. He and Prost are tied for first  place in the drivers standings this year with 18 points each.  </P> <P> Darin Brassfield of Los Gatos, Calif. took the lead as the green flag fell and  then held off a spirited charge by Dorsey Schroeder to win the Trans-Am race at  Sears Point International Raceway in Sonoma, Calif.  </P> <P> Max Jones of Long Beach was third in a Chevrolet Beretta. His teammate, Tommy  Kendall of Glendale was fourth.  </P> <P> Bob Glidden and Gary Ormsby continued winning in the National Hot Rod Assn.  national event competition and Kenny Bernstein regained his formula for success  at Memphis Motorsports Park.  </P> <P> Bernstein, the four-time and defending Funny Car champion from Dallas, won his  first race this season and the 28th of his career when he defeated Mark Oswald.  </P> <P> Ormsby, of Roseville, Calif., won for the third time this season when he  defeated Eddie Hill in Top Fuel. Glidden, of Whiteland, Ind., defeated Warren  Johnson for Pro Stock honors.  </P></p>

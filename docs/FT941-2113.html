			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (3): Growth centre of finance industry - There are now some 760 separate investment pools, many of them tied together under umbrella structures / Fund Management Collective funds moved to the growth centre of Jersey's finance industry last year, gaining from the big rises in most of the world's securities markets and the parallel loss of appeal of bank deposits. At the end of December, Jersey-based funds were worth Pounds 23.4bn; up 48 per cent in 12 months. Of the total, Pounds 19.5bn was accounted for by open-ended funds and the remaining Pounds 3.9bn by closed-end vehicles. There are now some 760 separate investment pools, many of them tied together under umbrella structures. Jersey's funds are largely invested in equities, reflecting a different approach and clientele from that of, say, Luxembourg, which is heavily orientated towards bonds. Just under 30 per cent of Jersey's open-ended fund assets are bonds, with another 7 per cent in money funds. Equity funds are mainly orientated towards Europe and the Far East. The figures, incidentally, do not cover private funds, including offshore institutional vehicles. These 'Cobo' funds, so-called because they are set up only under the control of borrowing law rather than the collective investment funds legislation, could be worth another Pounds 10bn, industry experts say, although no statistics are available. A survey published last month by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand showed, unsurprisingly, that members of the Jersey Fund Managers Association are in a buoyant mood. Some 84 per cent recorded higher profits in 1993, and 80 per cent expect more gains in 1994. The survey suggested that the industry was looking equally to three sources of business - the retail market, institutional investors and private portfolio management. Four geographical client categories were picked out: the UK, UK expatriates, the Far East and the European Union, ranked in that order of importance. The importance of the UK market exposes the Jersey fund management industry to the consequences of mainland regulatory changes, so local managers are closely watching the proposals for the introduction of open-ended investment companies (oeics) in the UK and accompanying changes such as the introduction of single pricing. Although oeics already exist in Jersey along with unit trusts, access to the UK market is through designated territory status under Section 87 of the Financial Services Act, a route which at present rules out single pricing. 'An area of concern is whether funds from the designated territories will be required to be equivalent to unit trusts or to the new oeics,' says Mr Jonathan Overland, spokesman for the JFMA and a marketing executive at Capital House. There have been talks with the Treasury and the Securities and Investments Board in the UK. Access to other markets is clearly important to Jersey's future as an offshore centre, and the authorities have been talking to several jurisdictions. So far, Japan, Ireland, Switzerland and the Netherlands have granted at least restricted or fund-by-fund marketing rights. 'We are all looking over our shoulders to se what happens on oeics,' says Mr Alastair Torvaney, who runs Perpetual's Dollars 400m Jersey offshoot. Mr Torvaney thinks individual deals with countries will prove costly and time-consuming, however. In the meantime, he perceives opportunities for third-party administration, for example for institutional funds which do not require day-to-day attention. 'All retail funds in Jersey must be looking at this as an add-on,' he says.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions PROFIT-TAKING at Titon follows a period of sharp outperformance in which the shares have all but trebled in value over the last 12 months to around 65p. Since then, the company has announced final results which revealed an impressively resilient performance - profits up 64 per cent and earnings up 72 per cent. An increase in the number of directors selling and exercising options may indicate that directors are uneasy about the outcome of the UK election. Almost exactly one year ago, Peter Nicholson, a director of the housebuilding group Crest Nicholson, sold 250,000 shares at 92p. This week, he appears in our column having bought back 100,000 shares at just 30p. The company recently reported record losses of almost Pounds 6m. It is not often you see the chairman of a large company such as BP buying his own stock. Bob Horton paid 263p per share for 20,000 shares after he reported 'extremely disappointing results'.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel V. Vorontsov, candidate of military </F> sciences, under rubric: "To Assist Those Entering the Academy"]    [Text] The system of fire, structured in accordance with  the commander's concept and with consideration of capabilities  of all kinds of organic and attached weapons (see diagram), is  one element in aligning the battalion defense.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-028-09A>      System of Fire of Motorized Rifle Battalion in the Defense (variant) </FIG>     It includes the following: artillery (including mortar)  concentrated and defensive fire sectors on approaches, ahead of  the FEBA [Forward Edge of the Battle Area], on flanks, in gaps  between company strongpoints, and in the depth of the defense;  zone of fire of antitank weapons and zone of continuous  multilayered fire of all kinds of weapons ahead of the FEBA, in  gaps, on flanks and in the depth of the defense for destroying  first and foremost enemy tanks and other armored targets; and a  prepared maneuver of fire to concentrate it on any threatened  sector or axis in a short time.    The system of fire is structured with consideration of fire  capabilities of all kinds of battalion weapons, attached  weapons, and fire strikes planned by the senior commander, and  in combination with manmade obstacles and natural barriers. Its  basis is the fire of tanks, BMP's, ATGM's, grenade launchers and  antitank guns and the direct fire of artillery with  consideration of employment of the regiment's antitank reserve  and mobile obstacle detachment on a likely avenue of tank  approach.    The necessary density of tanks, antitank weapons and BMP's,  established in advance and maintained in the course of battle,  is of decisive importance in achieving the goals of a modern  defense. It depends above all on the makeup of the attacking  enemy grouping. A battalion defense area may be assaulted by one  and one-half to two battalion task forces--mechanized or tank.  The expected number of tanks and IFV's (APC's) and their density  are shown in the table.    Table   Battalion      Width of    Number              Densities per Kilometer  Task Forces    Zone of                 Advance                 (km)   IFV's          Tanks       IFV's     Tanks     Total   Mechanized     3           39        14        13        5        18  battalion  task force  (3  mechanized  companies, 1  tank  company)   Tank           3           13        42        4         14       18  battalion  task force  (3 tank  companies, 1  mechanized  company)   Total          -           52        56        17        19       36      In connection with the fact that capabilities of one  antitank  weapon permit fighting 2-3 armored targets, then based on  exercise experience the density of antitank weapons per  kilometer of frontage should be 6-9 to repel tank and IFV (APC)  assaults. Organic battalion weapons permit creating such  densities (17:3; 19:2) on likely avenues of tank approach.    The effectiveness of a system of fire also depends largely  on  selection of firing positions on the terrain for available  weapons. Their disposition in the battalion defense area should  be concealed and dispersed, support the creation of fire sacks,  conduct of fire to maximum range and engagement of the enemy  with high-density flanking fire, cross fire and surprise  close-range concentrated fire, and there should be mutual  contact. Their linear disposition is inadmissible.    Alternate and temporary firing positions and routes of  forward movement to them are prepared for weapons in addition to  the primary positions. The battalion may assign roving guns,  tanks and BMP's to mislead the enemy regarding the system of  fire. All weapons must be ready for wide, swift maneuver and for  conducting fire at night and under other conditions of limited  visibility.    Organizing the system of fire is a very important duty of  the  battalion commander. He performs this work based on the decision  made in the course of ground reconnaissance and when assigning  missions to subunits and organizing coordination.    In conducting ground reconnaissance, the battalion commander  clarifies company fire zones, fire concentration sectors, and  primary and alternate (temporary) positions of organic and  attached artillery. He personally points out on the terrain  firing positions and sectors of fire for tanks, BMP's (BTR's),  ATGM systems and grenade launchers on the most probable avenues  of enemy approach. Here, too, he gives instructions for  organizing subunit small arms fire; outlines for them sectors of  concentrated and defensive fire intended for securing flanks and  boundaries with adjacent subunits and gaps between companies;  and clarifies places for arranging fire ambushes and the lines  of firing positions for the tank company and BMP-equipped  motorized rifle company located in the second echelon (reserve).    In assigning combat missions for first and second echelon  subunits, the battalion commander indicates zones of fire,  secondary sectors of fire and fire concentration sectors, what  forces and assets to use to secure flanks, boundaries and gaps  and who is responsible for them. The procedure for engaging the  enemy on his approaching the FEBA, deploying into battle  formation, launching the assault and penetrating company  strongpoints, and the procedure for engaging the enemy when  supporting a counterattack by the second echelon is communicated  to attached artillery subunits and the mortar battery. The  battalion commander assigns the grenade launcher subunit primary  and alternate positions, a zone of fire, secondary sector of  fire, fire concentration sectors and defensive fire lines; he  assigns the antitank subunit its place in the battle formation,  deployment lines, and missions which it must be ready to execute.    In organizing coordination, the commander determines lines  for commencing fire against the enemy from tanks, BMP's, ATGM  systems, grenade launchers and other antitank weapons, and also  company fire concentration sectors on the most important axes,  time of commencing fire and procedure for conducting it. When  the enemy comes right up to the FEBA, subunit operations are  coordinated in such a way that a zone of massed, multilayered  fire forms here--each point on the terrain in a zone of up to  400 m should be under effective fire. Such a zone also is  created in the most important sectors ahead of the third trench.  Dead ground not covered by direct fire of guns and by small arms  fire is engaged by artillery and mortar fire from indirect  firing positions.    Readiness of the system of fire is determined by the  occupation of positions by weapons, the personnel's knowledge of  their missions, preparation of firing data, and availability of  ammunition. The content of the system of fire is reflected in  greatest detail in the battalion defense area diagram.    If a subunit shifts to a defense in direct contact with the  enemy, the system of fire is organized during the assignment of  missions to companies for consolidating a favorable or  accessible line. It is developed subsequently in accordance with  the decision made for defense.    COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 2 1994</p>

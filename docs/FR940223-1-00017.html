			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The purpose and intention of location adjustments is to provide the incentive to move milk from one area to another for fluid uses only. Generally speaking, this means moving milk from outlying production areas to the more heavily populated market centers. It is not the purpose of location adjustments to facilitate the movement of milk to a distant location for manufacturing uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness for the proponent testified that the proposal was being made because of the opening of the Darigold plant in Sunnyside in December of 1991 to help balance the increased production in the Pacific Northwest and the increase of milk in Yakima County. Prior to the opening of the Darigold/Sunnyside plant, milk from Yakima County was sent to plants in Seattle and Chehalis, Washington, which have no location adjustment. The witness testified that the 15-cent-per-hundredweight location adjustment at Sunnyside in effect constitutes a ``penalty'' to the Darigold producers who financed the Sunnyside plant. In light of this, however, Darigold producers now have access to the local Sunnyside plant without having to incur the costs of hauling milk to Seattle and Chehalis, Washington.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current conditions indicate harmonious relationships within the marketplace. The location adjustment change proposed is not needed to prevent disorderly marketing conditions in Yakima County or anywhere within the marketplace. Fluid milk needs are being more than adequately met, and there appears to be no need to encourage production of milk in the Pacific Northwest market by increasing the level of returns to producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, we find no compelling reason to reduce the location adjustment in Yakima County based on this record. Yakima County should remain in Zone 4 with a 15-cent-per-hundredweight location adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While no exception was taken to this conclusion, two cooperative associations did comment on it. Portland Independent Milk Producers Association (PIMPA) stated that the department was correct in denying the proposal, while Darigold Farms wrote that it was ``puzzled'' by the department's rationale in denying the proposal and would like to revisit the issue of location adjustments at a future hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was stated in the recommended decision that the record evidence indicated there was no need to move milk for fluid use from Yakima County to any of the population centers in this market: i.e., Seattle, Portland, Eugene or Spokane. However, PIMPA points out in their exception that a significant amount of their Yakima County milk does, in fact, move to a number of handlers in one or more of these population centers, and this point is supported by record evidence. Consequently, it cannot be concluded on the basis of this record that location adjustments are no longer necessary in this market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren today told visiting Hungarian Chief Public Prosecutor  Gyorgyi Kalman [spelling of name as received]: "we should handle  the relationship between reform and stability in a better way."    Meeting with a Hungarian delegation led by Kalman at the  Great Hall of the People here this morning, Rong said China will  use stable and proper methods to control its annual national  economic growth rate at about nine percent, so as to ensure its  social stability and steady economic development.    He said that building up the legal system was an  indispensable part of maintaining the country's social stability  and economic development.    Over the past few years, he said, China has drawn up a great  number of laws, but they still did not fully meet the needs of  its economic growth.    Rong said: "we will rely on our own efforts to build the  legal systems. At the same time, it is necessary to absorb  foreign countries' useful experience."    On bilateral relations, Rong said China and hungary are  friendly countries. In recent years, the two countries have  enjoyed very good cooperation in the field of economy and sound  exchanges in building up legal systems.    The frequent exchanges of visits between the leaders of the  two countries have boosted bilateral friendly ties and  cooperation, he said.    Rong expressed the hope that the delegation's current visit  will play a role in furthering bilateral relations.    Kalman said Hungary places great importance on developing  its  ties with China, adding that it is of great significance to  develop such ties because China is one of the countries in the  world which are playing a decisive role and also a permanent  member of the United Nations Security Council.    He said Hungary was attentively watching China's building up  of its legal system and was willing to develop its ties with the  country's law departments.    Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of China's Supreme People's  Procuratorate, participated in the meeting.</p>

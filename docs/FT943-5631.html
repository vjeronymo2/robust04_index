			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Further downward pressure put on bunds Although the Bundesbank's decision not to change official interest rates was widely expected, the news put further downward pressure on German government bonds, which had already received an early knock from stronger than expected west German industrial production figures. The data showed a 2.2 per cent monthly rise in July, compared with market forecasts of between 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent and was seen as a further confirmation that the economy was growing rapidly and the Bundesbank would have even fewer reasons to cut official interest rates further. Dealers said the central bank's decision to stick to a fixed rate of 4.85 per cent for its next two securities repurchase tenders added to the argument that its priority had shifted from further easing to managing smoothly the trough of the interest rate cycle. Mr Kit Juckes, of SG Warburg, said the shape of the German yield curve suggested that the market was still fairly relaxed about the monetary outlook. 'Bunds are complacently priced given the likelihood that German rates will start to rise next year,' he said. On Liffe, the September bund future fell 0.48 points to 91.27 in modest trading. UK gilts outperformed their continental European counterparts thanks to a late rally which dealers had difficulty in explaining. Sterling's resilience in the face of a falling dollar and a newspaper report that 10-year gilt yields could fall to 7 1/2 per cent were given as possible reasons. The rise in gilts caused a further narrowing of the yield spread between gilts and bunds to 132 basis points, which forced more dealers to close their short positions. 'The bears are being squeezed out of the market,' said one analyst. On Liffe, the December long gilt future was  9/32 higher at 101 7/8 in the late afternoon, below the day's best of 102 1/16 . Elsewhere, Italian government bonds fell in nervous trading as a result of renewed infighting in the government. Italian futures fell by nearly a point. By contrast, French government bonds were steady following an uneventful monthly auction of OATs. US Treasury bonds drifted yesterday as traders awaited today's report on August conditions in the labour market. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/16 at 100 1/2 , with the yield rising to 7.452 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 to yield 6.132 per cent. The market was hoping today's employment data would provide it with clear-cut guidance on the strength of the economy. Beforehand, trading remained light, though a negative tone was cast over the morning's activity by fresh evidence of inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector. The National Association of Purchasing Management said the prices-paid component of its August survey had climbed to its highest level in six years. However, the overall index of business activity was weaker than expected, completing a pattern which had emerged in a regional Chicago survey released on Wednesday. The net impact on bonds was modest losses across the yield curve. Still, yesterday's data revealed nothing to change expectations about today's report. Economists are forecasting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 225,000, suggesting a moderate pace of economic growth.</p>

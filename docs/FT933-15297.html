			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Technology: Smoother ride for compact discs - Worth Watching Some drivers while away hours on the road with rock music, others with the classics or jazz. For those who prefer compact discs rather than tapes, Sanyo of Japan has produced what it claims to be the world's smallest multi-disc player. It fits into most glove compartments - conventional CD players have to go into the boot or under the seat - and can take six discs. The FXD-C100, with a single-lead connection, also has an anti-shock mechanism to prevent discs jumping on rough rides. Costing Pounds 309.95, it can be linked to a radio cassette player with Sanyo's FM modulator/CD commander which has a credit-card sized remote control unit. Sonicare (UK distributor of Sanyo car entertainment systems): UK, 021 552 9797.</p>

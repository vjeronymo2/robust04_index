			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE AWARDS FETE DESIGNS THAT GO BEYOND MERE STYLE  </P> <P> A variety of projects, from a residential remodel in Santa Monica to a major  branch library in Berlin, West Germany, took top honors in this year's design  awards program of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of  Architects (AIA).  </P> <P> Honors also went to an addition to an artist's studio in Venice that was once a  gas station, an ocean-side fourplex in Malibu and a commercial complex in Santa  Monica that includes an art museum. Also awarded were seven citations to a  variety of other projects by local architects.  </P> <P> The designs, selected from a total of 135 submissions, "went to those projects  which weren't necessarily avant-garde, but to those which the jury felt were  well executed, beyond stylistic concerns," commented Larry Schlossberg and  Herbert Nadel, co-chairmen of the chapter's awards committee.  </P> <P> The jury was composed of three out-of-town architects, Joseph Esherick of San  Francisco, A. Eugene Kohn of New York City and Myron Goldsmith of Chicago. All  are honored Fellows of the AIA, with Esherick also a recipient of the coveted  AIA Gold Medal.  </P> <P> Concerning the overall quality of the submissions, Kohn said the large  commercial architecture category was "most disappointing."  </P> <P> "It looks like buildings are still being transplanted from other places," he  said, and that "tall buildings here tend to still be objects."  </P> <P> The jury also said it was disappointed in how few quality residential projects  they saw. However, the three that did receive awards were cited for being  firmly in "the great tradition of Neutra and Schindler."  </P> <P> These were a remodel of a 1960 tract home into a studio and residence for the  Edwards family, designed by the firm of Appleton, Mechur &amp; Associates; the  Seacliff Homes in Malibu, by Stephen Kanner of Kanner &amp; Associates, and the  Tanaka/Ho residence in Venice, by Ted Tanaka. The former two received honor  awards and the latter a merit award.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transformed House  </P> <P> "The architect and an equally creative owner have succeeded in transforming an  old tract house into a single unified house-garden design," said Esherick of  the Appleton, Mechur &amp; Associates project. Kohn noted in particular how the  design "provides a sense of privacy and street wall along the street and a  sensitive relaxed and light-filled response to the terraced gardens at the  back."  </P> <P> The Seacliff design by Kanner was praised by Kohn for, among other things, "its  simplicity of form, its clarity of plan and section, its feeling for light."  Esherick added that "The project is a model of what can be achieved by a  compact row house scheme, admittedly opulent but graceful and elegantly  handled." The design also has been honored in this year's state AIA awards  program.  </P> <P> In bestowing an honor award on the Okulick Studio in Venice, designed by Steven  Ehrlich, the jury cited how the renovation and addition captured the essence of  its uses, "vertical spaces, natural translucent light and large wall surfaces  to feature objects of art."  </P> <P> Also honored were the designs by Frank O. Gehry &amp; Associates of the Edgemar  commercial and museum complex in Santa Monica, and Moore Ruble Yudell of the  Humboldt Bibliothek in Berlin. The latter is the first phase of a cultural  center for an ambitious government-sponsored master plan.  </P> <P> The Gehry design was praised by juror Goldsmith for its "mixture of simple  buildings with sculptural elements," and the Moore Ruble Yudell design by Kohn  for being sensitively sited, and for its interior.  </P> <P> Besides the Tanaka design of his own residence, other merit awards winners were  Maris Peika of Gruen Associates for a parking structure in Beverly Hills; Leroy  Miller Associates for the Leonard I. Beerman Early Childhood Center off of  Sepulveda Boulevard in Bel-Air and the O'Leary Terasawa Partnership for the  Marymount High School library, north of UCLA and Sunset Boulevard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parking Structure Cited  </P> <P> The parking structure adjacent to Santa Monica Boulevard between Linden and  Beverly drives was praised by Esherick for greatly improving the street  environment rather than degrading it, "as too often the case with parking  structures"; the center by Goldsmith as "very appropriate for children," and  the library by Esherick for fitting "gracefully" into a setting of older  structures.  </P> <P> Other winners of merit awards were David Lawrence Gray &amp; Associates for the  adaptive reuse of the landmark Sunset Tower on Sunset Boulevard in West  Hollywood from an apartment house to a hotel; Dworsky Associates for an  expansion of an engineering building on the State University campus in San  Jose, and Frank O. Gehry &amp; Associates for the Herman Miller office  furniture distribution center facility in Rocklin, Calif.  </P> <P> The reuse of Sunset Tower was called by the jury a "sensitive" and "faithful  restoration"; the San Jose State expansion "a most successful solution, well  executed" and "very professional," and the Herman Miller facility "refreshingly  unconventional."  </P> <P> In a summary of the program, Schlossberg, a member of the firm of Gruen  Associates, noted that of the 12 projects honored this year, at least five had  been submitted last year but did not win.  </P> <P> "This brings up at least two points," Schlossberg observed. "First, persistence  pays off, and second, we should all bear in mind, winners and losers alike,  that these design awards while justifiably coveted, largely represent the  opinions of three individuals on a particular day."  </P></p>

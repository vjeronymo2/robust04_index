			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / UK isolated as Spain agrees EU vote compromise The UK found itself isolated and under intense pressure last night to accept a compromise over reforms to European Union voting procedures as Spain signalled it was ready to accept a deal. After two days of talks in Greece, Britain was faced with a proposal that falls well short of its demands and leaves the planned enlargement of the EU on a knife-edge. The UK government will now decide at a cabinet meeting tomorrow how to react to the compromise, arranged by the Greek presidency. EU foreign ministers said they wanted to complete a deal by 6pm tomorrow. The UK met immovable opposition over its requests to maintain a threshold of 23 votes as the blocking minority after the admission of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the Union next year. Spain, which had also resisted voting reforms, and Britain are being offered a 'reasonable' delay on decisions that are opposed by countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes, the proposed new threshold to block legislation. During this period, the European Commission and the presidency will be obliged to seek a consensus, 'always respecting the rules of procedure', according to the text. Senior Union officials said this language expressly excludes an open-ended discussion. British demands for an indefinite delay on controversial decisions also ran into strong resistance. Current rules would still apply whereby one member state can call for a vote on controversial legislation, on the basis of a simple majority. The proposed deal attempts to strike a delicate balance. It recognises the need to protect large countries from being outvoted easily in an expanded Union. But it tilts decisively against introducing rules which could paralyse decision-making. The deal does not meet UK demands for legally-binding guarantees preserving the power of two large states to join with one small country to block decisions in the Council of Ministers. The latest twist in the power-sharing dispute confronts Mr John Major, the prime minister, with an acute dilemma. Either Mr Major accepts an offer which could trigger a revolt among Tory Euro-sceptics, or he rejects the compromise and risks bearing sole responsibility for delaying enlargement, which has long been supported by the British government. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said 'serious work' had been accomplished over the weekend, but he declined to predict the outcome of the cabinet meeting. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, echoing comments from other EU foreign ministers, suggested Britain had received the best terms available. Without agreement on voting rights this week, he forecast 'an absolute crisis' in the EU. Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign minister, spoke of a 'breakthrough', but Mr Hurd was more cautious. He said the UK's partners now accepted that the relationship between the size of member states and their votes could not be brushed under the carpet. This issue had to be tackled 'root and branch' at the 1996 conference to review the Maastricht treaty, said Mr Hurd. Although Britain's position will be crucial, other countries voiced some reservations about the deal, raising the danger of amendments later this week which could delay settlement.</p>

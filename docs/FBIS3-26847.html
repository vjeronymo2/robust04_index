			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In order to rejoin the GATT as soon as possible and  to restore China's status as a signatory to the GATT, Beijing  once again has urged provinces to stop randomly giving  preferential treatment to foreign businessmen in the areas of  trade, investment, and taxation. A ranking government official  in Beijing said that this year, work will be done to standardize  trading policies for same industries in different parts of the  whole country. He also disclosed that China will change some  special economic zones [SEZs] into internationally recognized  free trade zones.    Over the past few years, the central government in Beijing  differed from provincial authorities in foreign trade and  investment policies, resulting in the withdrawal from China of  some foreign investors who did not like the ambiguous policies;  on the other hand, some foreign businessmen reaped huge profits  from the special and preferential policies granted to them by  local government departments. The official, who asked to remain  anonymous, said he did not want to see either such situation  happening in China.    China hopes to restore its status as a signatory to GATT in  1995, so it is an urgent duty this year to standardize the  trading policies for the same industries in different parts of  the whole country.    The official disclosed that China will change some SEZs into  free trade zones, which are acceptable to the international  community, so that they can be recognized internationally. The  official pointed out that except in the free trade zones,  foreign businessmen will enjoy equal treatment when engaging in  a same industry in any other parts of China.    The new policy will benefit the vast interior. In recent  years, the interior lagged far behind the coastal region in  attracting foreign capital.    By the end of 1993, 120 countries and regions had invested  in  China, and the investments went mainly into energy, light  industry, electronic industry, mechanical spinning and weaving,  clothing, metallurgical industry, construction materials, and  real estate.</p>

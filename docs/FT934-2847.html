			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Migraine factor Sir, In an otherwise excellent review on employee health (December 6) you failed to mention the major problem of migraine, which affects up to 12 per cent of the population at some time in their life. It results in absenteeism with indirect costs estimated at Pounds 1bn annually in the UK alone. Education initiatives are currently exploring the true impact of migraine as a measure of severity of pain and the disability it causes. With the advent of new acute treatments and preventative strategies, it becomes necessary to inform sufferers that they can be helped and that they are likely to receive a much more sympathetic approach than was once the case.

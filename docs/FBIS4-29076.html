			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Vijayan Menon, Chan Cheng Tuan and Esther Tan] </F>   [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Fri -- The Barisan Nasional [BN]  Supreme Council today unanimously accepted Parti Demokratik  Sabah, [PDS] [Sabah Democratic Party] and Parti Bersatu Rakyat  Sabah [PBRS] [Sabah United People's Party] into the coalition.    PBRS, launched on March 15, is headed by former PBS [Party  Bersatu Sabah -- Sabah United Party] secretary-general Datuk  Joseph Kurup while PDS is headed by former PBS deputy president  and Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Bernard Dompok.    The PDS has 12 Assemblymen and four MPs while Kurup is the  only Assemblyman in the PBRS.    With their entry, the ruling coalition has 49 State  Assemblymen in the 54-seat house. Apart from the 13 from PDS  and PBRS, UMNO [United Malays National Organization] has 22,  Sabah Progressive Party (six), Angkatan Keadilan Rakyat [Akar]  [People's Justice Organization] (six) and the Liberal Democratic  Party (two). The PBS, in Opposition, has five Assemblymen. BN  chairman and Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said  the council considered applications from three parties to become  components of the coalition.    "After discussing at length, we unanimously decided to  accept  the PDS and the PBRS but rejected the application of Parti Setia  [Loyalty Party]," he told reporters after chairing an hour-long  meeting of the BN Supreme Council at the UMNO headquarters in  the Putra World Trade Center here.    Parti Setia, headed by Suhaidin Langkap, was formed in  October last year and it contested 15 seats in the Sabah State  elections but faired miserably with nearly all the candidates  losing their deposits.    Asked whether any conditions were attached to the acceptance  of the two parties, Dr. Mahathir said there were none and they  were accepted as full members.    Earlier, Dr. Mahathir said the UMNO supreme council had also  made its stand on the applications by the PBRS and PDS to join  the BN.    On whether the council discussed the appointment of a Sabah  deputy chief minister, he replied: "This is not the  responsibility of the BN Supreme Council.    "It is up to me to decide on the post and other vacant  positions in consultation with the Sabah chief minister," he  said.    Asked whether the acceptance of the two parties would cause  problems as there were other Sabah BN parties which had  expressed reservations on the inclusion of the two, he said:    "The decision was unanimous... as such we do not think there  will be any problem." On the objection of Akar, he said Akar,  like the other two component parties, gave their views.    "After we listened to all their views we made the decision  and everyone agreed."    Asked whether this would further consolidate the coalition's  strength in Sabah, he said it would become stronger.    Questioned on whether this would encourage the call for an  early general election, he laughed and quipped: "There are so  many encouraging signs that even I am confused."    On whether the council discussed the general election, Dr.  Mahathir said, there were questions about the election.    "I explained about the elections ... how to hold elections,  what needs to be organised, election machinery and co-operation  among the component parties."    On whether there was a possibility of a general election  being held this year, he replied: "Maybe. Perhaps next year."  [passage omitted]</p>

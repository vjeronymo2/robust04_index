			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes Cadbury Schweppes is in a bind. Its trading this year has been better than that of most food manufacturing companies, yet the immediate future looks troubled. The shares are down 8 per cent in the past month and nearly 18 per cent in the past year. Investors' concerns are understandable, if overdone. They centre on Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages, the UK bottling operation 51 per cent owned by Cadbury. While this has been the motor of the group's growth in recent years, the reliability  - and therefore the quality of earnings  - from this business has clearly deteriorated. The culprit is the outbreak of Cola wars as the supermarkets bring out their own products in an attempt to undercut the traditional premium prices enjoyed by Coke. Packaging prices are rising and next summer's weather is unlikely to be so clement as in 1994. It is thus probable that CCSB's operating profits will fall sharply next year. The impact on Cadbury's earnings per share will however be diluted by the fact that CCSB is not fully-owned. Moreover, trading is strong in confectionery and Cadbury's earnings are likely to beat those of the sector as a whole next year, notwithstanding brokers' reduced profits forecasts. The period of underperformance for Cadbury should be coming to an end.</p>

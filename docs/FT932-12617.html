			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Congress threatens end to EBRD funds THE US Congress is likely to refuse further money for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as a result of the outcry over excessive spending on salaries, private aircraft and office fittings. The Clinton administration has requested Dollars 70m (Pounds 45.1m) in its 1994 budget for the US's share of the EBRD's paid-up capital, but senior members of Congress warned yesterday that they would almost certainly refuse the request. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said he shared Congress's concerns about the EBRD, calling its spending 'absolutely unacceptable'. He defended the capital subscription, however, and said the US was insisting on restructuring of the EBRD's budget process, much tighter oversight and outside auditing. As the US issued its warning, Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's chairman, promised in London to reinforce budgetary controls and introduce greater transparency. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Senate committee that controls foreign aid spending, said he planned to reduce the EBRD budget allocation to zero unless very substantial changes in the bank's management were made. He said: 'I will not vote for one cent of money from the US for the EBRD unless I see very, very substantial movements towards reform - not promises of reform. There will not be one cent in my proposal unless I see that, and frankly I don't think I am going to.' Mr Leahy delivered a scathing indictment of the EBRD's spending and of Mr Attali. 'I want to know why we should entrust another dime of the public's money to Mr Attali,' he said. 'It's almost like this money that has gone in there is a slush fund for personal use.' The US is the largest of the 56 shareholders in the EBRD. It accounts for 10 per cent of the bank's capital. Republican members are likely to follow the Democrats on the EBRD. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Mr Leahy's Republican counterpart on the foreign operations spending committee, said: 'Short of immediate changes in the policies and practices of the EBRD, I - like the chairman - cannot support the administration's request for Dollars 70m.' Foreign aid remains one of the least popular areas of the budget in the US Congress. Members warn that it remains politically impossible to reduce aid to Israel and Egypt, which receive the lion's share of the US aid budget, but Congress is warning that Dollars 1.8bn needs to be found to fund the US's recent promise of new bilateral aid at the Tokyo G7 meeting. The administration has not yet specified where it wants the money to come from. Mr Leahy said he might not support the administration's request for Dollars 1.25bn this year for the International Development Association, a third of the US's contribution to the tenth replenishment of this concessional loan arm of the World Bank. Mr Bentsen argued, however, that the money was essentially the same in real terms as the last contribution, negotiated in 1986. He added that the US's ability to influence the multilateral development banks was impaired by its position as the only leading industrialised country in arrears in its payments to those institutions, to the tune of Dollars 374m. 'These arrears damage the standing of the US in the international community,' he said. Mr Attali, speaking after the bank's annual meeting, said that the bank would increase its private-sector investment. He was warned by Ms Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister who has taken over from Mr Theo Waigel of Germany as chairman of the bank's board of governors, that 'the time for grand designs' was over. 'I would like the bank to focus on the operational aspects of its activity,' she stressed. Mr Attali said that after the criticism of the bank, there was now no question of his quitting until his 'baby' can 'go it alone'. Attali pressed to get on with main task, Page 2</p>

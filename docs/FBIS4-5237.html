			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev warned Friday [8 April] that some leading Russian  politicians' attempts to stir up nationalistic sentiments among  Russians residing in Kazakhstan and other former Soviet  republics may trigger an exodus of refugees.    "If Russians, Ukrainians and Germans residing in Kazakhstan  took Russian politicians' campaigns at face value and opted to  move to Russia or other areas, they would plunge into a more  severe situation than now," Nazarbayev said.    "Although such an exodus has not yet begun, my biggest  anxiety comes from this issue," Nazarbayev told the Japan  National Press Club on the final day of his four-day visit to  Japan.    At present, some 5 million Russians, or more than a quarter  of Kazakhstan's population, reside in the country which has a  population of 17 million. Germans and Ukrainians each account  for some 5 percent of the populace. Under the 19-century  colonial policy of Czarist Russia, Russians were ordered to move  to the central Asian country.    Nazarbayev accused Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  and other politicians of having tried to rekindle Russian  nationalist sentiments in a bid to lure Russian voters during  1993 parliamentary election campaigns.    Kozyrev said last November 22 -- three weeks before the  parliamentary vote -- that Moscow would "protect the Russian  population and Russia's interests in a tough manner, wherever it  is needed and whoever is concerned, even if it (concerns) our  friends."    "The treatment of official Russian representatives,  servicemen and our compatriots on the territory of any state, be  it near or far abroad, is the litmus paper on which good  neighborly relations with any state will be tested," Kozyrev  said.    Nazarbayev told the press conference, "these Russian  politicians tried to draw strength from the theme of the  interests of 'Russia' in view of the December 11 parliamentary  election."    Nazarbayev said there is no rationale for any calls for an  exodus of Russians from Kazakhstan, as the Kazakh Government has  taken a "policy of providing free plots of land to enable all  residents to build homes and plow fields," whatever ethnic group  they may belong to.    Nazarbayev refused to comment on press reports that Russia  and the former Soviet Union bought U.S. security secrets from  alleged U.S. Central Intelligence Agency turncoat Aldrich Ames  over the past eight years for 2.5 million dollars.    Asked about U.S. congressional arguments calling for a halt  to aid to Russia following the reported espionage case,  Nazarbayev said, "I am not in a position to give advice to other  countries on their aid policy to Russia."</p>

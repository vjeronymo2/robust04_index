			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Management: More power to the team - Christopher Lorenz explains why managers do not always know best Performance measurement systems for multi-functional teams should not be designed by managers, but by the teams themselves. Nor, except in extreme circumstances, should managers intervene when measures show that problems are developing: the teams should be left to take the necessary remedial action themselves. These are two of the many far-reaching changes which companies must make, according to Christopher Meyer, an American consultant, if they are to succeed in the popular attempt to replace their traditional 'functional' (departmental) structures with cross-functional, or 'process-focused' organisations. Many executives have not yet even realised that they need new types of measures if multi-functional teams are to succeed, Meyer claims. But even where this need has been recognised, managers often use the new measures to reinforce their own power, rather than that of the teams, he argues in an article in the latest Harvard Business Review*. A measurement system designed to support a process-based organisation should help teams overcome two basic obstacles to their effectiveness, says Meyer: getting functions to provide expertise when it is needed; and getting people from different functions on a team to speak a common language. As Meyer argues, traditional measurement systems fail to solve these problems in several respects. First, their primary role is to pull 'good information' up the organisation, so that senior managers can make 'good decisions' that flow down it. To that end, each relatively independent function has its own set of measures. Marketing tracks market share, operations watches inventory, finance monitors costs, and so on. Such 'results measures' tell the various parts of an organisation where they stand, but not how they got there or what either they or the organisation as a whole should do differently. As Meyer puts it, the few cross-functional 'results measures' in most organisations are financial: revenues, gross margins, cost of goods sold, capital assets, debt and so on. They 'exist only to help top managers'. By contrast, 'process measures' monitor the activities throughout an organisation that produce a given result. They are essential to help cross-functional teams deliver an entire product or service, such as order fulfilment or product development. Staffing is a far more helpful measure than most companies realise, he suggests. If it covers not just the number of people, but also the years of experience in main job categories, it can have a marked effect on a team's performance, he says. If particular staff are missing at a particular stage in a project, time-consuming and expensive problems arise later. Contesting the popular view - especially in the US - that 'what gets measured gets done', Meyer advises strongly against the temptation to pile measure upon measure. Otherwise, team members end up spending too much time collecting data and monitoring their activities, and not enough time managing their projects. In general, a team should have no more than 15 measures. Meyer illustrates his warnings against relying on traditional measures, and also against managers using a team's measures to reinforce their own control, with episodes that have occurred at Ford in the US. In one case, the result of executive intervention in a product quality project was frustration for team members and managers alike, and also delay. Meyer fails to explain how an organisation can avoid incompatibility and chaos when it allows teams of various shapes and sizes to design their own measures. But his overall message is powerful all the same: that 'managers must never make the mistake of thinking that they know what is best for the team'. *How the right measures help teams excel.

Inspection by supervisory organs throughout Yunnan of 6,631  entities and 391,970 persons since last June have found that a  total of 1,854 entities had been discovered where public funds  were owed by 17,938 individual cadres or workers including  officials of local department level, county division level,  township section level and general cadres and workers. The  number of persons owing debts put at over RMB [renminbi] 5,000  was 1,377, with the greatest debt put at RMB 560,000. Persons  who had outstanding debts for longer than five yers numbered  2,240 with the longest time for an outstanding debt was put at  some 20 years. Public debts mainly occurring as the result of  natural disasters or accidents or due to living difficulties  were few and most of the debts were used to buy flats, fund the  construction of a building, undertake economic activities or  deposit public funds in personal accounts.    The Yunnan government recently asked various places to  settle  their own debt problems in cases where individuals had borrowed  public funds or owed public debts under various kinds of guises.  Inspection teams were set up by supervisory departments in a bid  to ensure effective efforts to solve these problems.</p>

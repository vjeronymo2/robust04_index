Bakyt Abdrisayev told INTERFAX on Wednesday that Kyrgyzstan  was giving the matter careful consideration, since the Central  Asian republic had commitments under CIS collective security  agreements.    Kyrgyz Defense Ministry spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Akzhal  Isayev told Interfax the same day that the ministry was still  unfamiliar with NATO's program and therefore had no position on  it.</p>

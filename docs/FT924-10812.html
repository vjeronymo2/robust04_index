			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford of Europe plunges into loss FORD's European automotive operations plunged into a loss of Dollars 479m in the third quarter after struggling back into profit in the first half of 1992. The return to loss is a severe setback for Ford of Europe, which suffered a record loss last year and which has slipped from fourth to fifth place in the west European new car market in the first nine months this year. Mr Harold Poling, Ford chairman, said the 'uncertainty resulting from the instability in European currency markets has led to lower sales in most of Ford's European markets and will continue to affect the operating environment for the near-term'. Ford's European car sales have declined by about 6 per cent in the first nine months this year, which has depressed its market share to an estimated 11.6 per cent from 12.1 per cent a year ago. Jaguar, its UK luxury car subsidiary, suffered a loss of just over Dollars 100m in the third quarter, while Ford of Britain's financial performance deteriorated sharply in the third quarter in the face of continuing weak UK new car sales and further heavy discounting. Jaguar lost around Dollars 300m in the first nine months this year, although its deficit in the third quarter was slightly lower than in the corresponding period a year ago. The loss of Dollars 479m on Ford's European automotive operations in the third quarter compares with a profit of Dollars 108m in the first six months this year and a loss of Dollars 560m in the same quarter a year ago. Ford of Europe's automotive operations, including Jaguar, slumped to a net loss in the whole of last year of Dollars 1.079bn from a net profit of Dollars 145m in 1990 and a profit of Dollars 1.19bn in 1989. In the first nine months this year, Ford's European automotive operations lost Dollars 371m, against a loss of Dollars 765m in the corresponding period a year ago. Ford of Europe is being forced to cut production at most of its assembly plants in the UK, Germany, Belgium and Spain, to reduce excessive stocks.</p>

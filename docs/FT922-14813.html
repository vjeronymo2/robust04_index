			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons provision hits Invesco MIM THE FUTURE of the Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust, a leading UK investment trust in the development and venture capital sector, hangs in the balance following a 23 per cent decline in profits at the fund's manager and 12 per cent stake holder, Invesco MIM. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 14.5m for the year to December 31, on turnover 59 per cent higher at Pounds 2.77bn. The result was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 13m on potential losses at Drayton Consolidated, which invests in small and unquoted UK companies. Invesco, headed by Lord Stevens of Ludgate, said yesterday the trust had appointed brokers County NatWest Wood Mackenzie and Cazenove to review proposals on its future. Earlier this year, Drayton Consolidated revealed that about 11 per cent of its portfolio - or Pounds 19.8m - was virtually irretrievable following the collapse of its largest investment, the Scottish confectionery company, Alma. The trusts shares have fallen from 204p in January to last night's 176p. The troubles at Drayton Consolidated masked strong performances around the world from Invesco's main operating divisions. Stripping out exceptional provisions of Pounds 16.6m, which included Pounds 3.6m for losses on Invesco's employee share option trust, pre-tax profits rose by 39 per cent to Pounds 31.1m. Funds under management grew by 24 per cent to Pounds 31bn. The proposed final dividend was held at 3.7p for a total of 6p. Earnings per share fell from 5.4p to 2.3p. The retained loss for the year was Pounds 8.3m, compared with a profit of Pounds 2.65m last time. The North American operations increased profits by 45 per cent to Dollars 47m (Pounds 27m). Mr Ratan Engineer, Invesco's finance director, said the company had benefited from a mutual fund boom in the US. 'We also had an outstanding investment performance.' Trading in the US continued to be very strong, he said. Cost-cutting in the UK helped the European and Pacific division increase profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 10.3m. Mr Engineer dismissed the prospect of a pick up in the UK in the short term. 'I do not see much of a change even after the election,' he said. The move into Japan was proving successful, but would not return significant profits for some time, Mr Engineer said. He added that Invesco had become the first foreign manager in Japan to win a corporate pension fund account. Debt at the year end was Dollars 60m and comprised a convertible loan note held by the group's US partners.</p>

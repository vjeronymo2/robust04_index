			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / As they say in Europe: Germans savour a French farce 'ENGLAND means to keep its place as top European nation' is not what one expects to see in a French paper, even one as fair-minded as Liberation. But then last November I noted the honesty and restless search for truth that characterises French rugby writers. In other areas things have to come to a pretty pass before the British are held up for admiration. The Georges Habash affair did it. Le Figaro finds it hard to maintain a steady output of hysterical contempt for the government day after day, so the decision to allow an alleged top terrorist into France for hospital treatment was a gift. It gave Alain Peyrefitte and the French language the opportunity to deploy their talent for sustained abuse. Ridiculise', which has to be translated as 'made ridiculous,' became the title and leitmotif for Peyrefitte as he worked steadily through government ranks to spread the blame for this embarrassing incident as widely as possible. He ended up with Francois Mitterrand. 'What hits us between the eyes are the vices of a system where the President of the Republic himself declares, 'I have no cabinet, I have only colleagues who work directly with me.' In other words: 'L'Etat c'est moi.'' Peyrefitte concluded: 'When officials of the 'Foreign Office' committed the error of not foreseeing the invasion of the Falklands, it was not they who paid the price. Lord Carrington nobly resigned. He was, however, on the basis of all evidence, totally innocent. Such is the greatness of political responsibility.' The Germans enjoyed all this, in their rather gloomy way. Die Welt, never exactly Francophile, wrote: 'At first Paris played the role of good Samaritan to a world-famous terrorist. Then it pledged to investigate this hangman. And finally it refused the promised 'humanitarian aid' and sent the malingerer George Habash back to Tunis without investigation.' The paper expatiated on what it saw as backstairs dealing by France in the Middle East peace process: 'The damage to French foreign policy is great, the position of the socialist government of President Mitterrand has again been shattered.' The German word for this sort of thing is Schadenfreude; in Italian the enjoyment of others' discomfiture is piacere maligno and it is what L'Indipendente'of Milan felt on Tuesday. Germany had tried to make the world forget its history and now the rebirth of nationalism meant 'the Germans regard the chaos in France next door with indifference rather than anger. The power of habit, the weight of inertia and automatic reflexes could prolong the special relationship between France and Germany. But sustaining the Franco-German marriage in the new reality of the international system demands much political goodwill between the two countries. And today that goodwill seems to be missing.' Footnote: In the spate of forced resignations, Andre Frossard had a solution in his column in Figaro: 'France will have to resign, she presents herself as great and hospitable. So France is responsible and guilty. She must be removed.' President Yeltsin's trip to the West last week was seen as a triumph - in the West. In Moscow it was different. Pravda wrote: 'Boris Yeltsin succumbed to a temptation familiar to us from the last resident of the Kremlin - go abroad and seek solutions to domestic problems. His entourage has concluded that the fate of Yeltsin's reforms, and hence his government, is now in the hands of the west.' The paper is disillusioned with the 'peace dividend.' 'What economic gains will Russia's inhabitants get from cuts in nuclear weapons? None in the short term. Any savings will be felt, at best, in ten years or so. And before that we shall go through the inevitable social unrest caused by the speedy fulfilment of disarmament promises.' Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote: 'While nuclear Russia quickly gained understanding and money, market Russia gets very little. Only Major and Mulroney displayed any loyalty to the economically-doomed Russian President. Others of the 'seven' have refused to set up a stabilisation fund for Commonwealth currencies.' Izvestia reported that the proportion of Muscovites dissatisfied with their existence had risen from 61 per cent to 81 per cent in a month. But of those polled less than 1 per cent said: 'Enough is enough,' 'a military coup is needed,' or 'let's get the government off its chairs and into the sausage queue.'

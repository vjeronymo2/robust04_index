			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: IT'S A $17-MILLION BEDTIME STORY  </P> <P> Ron Miller can relax now. The 36-year-old Little York, Ill., man turned in one  of the four winning tickets for Illinois' record $69-million Lotto jackpot. "I  feel better now than I did yesterday," Miller said. When he realized his was a  winning ticket in the drawing Saturday, Miller said, he "kept it on the  headboard of the bed" all night and put it in a safe on Sunday. Miller, who is  part-owner of a hog-buying firm in Monmouth, Ill., said he will share his  portion of the prize with his sister and brother. Also claiming a share of the  jackpot was a Chicago engineer who said he had a hard time convincing his  family of his good fortune. Dan Dixon, 38, and his wife, Mary Ann, plan to  share their winnings with her parents, brothers and sister in New Jersey. Dixon  said the family buys chances on big jackpots all over the country, and he  bought 15 tickets for the Illinois game. "I sat down at the kitchen table  Saturday night and checked all the tickets except one," he said, "and then we  got to one with a perfect match." Dixon said he called the rest of the family  and "nobody believed me." Each of the winning tickets is worth $17.5 million,  to be paid over 20 years at $864,000 a year. The other winners have yet to be  identified.  </P> <P>  -- An earlier lottery winner is learning that good luck can be the cat's meow.  Sheelah Ryan, winner of the biggest single jackpot in a U.S. lottery, dipped  into her $55-million prize and donated $1,000 to University of Central Florida  students in Orlando who are trying to find homes for more than 100 stray cats.  "She said she is really interested in the project because the students have  gotten involved in something positive," said Bill Morris, project coordinator.  Ryan, 63, of Winter Springs, also has set up a foundation for needy people. She  won the jackpot in the Florida lottery Sept. 3, 1988.  </P> <P>  -- Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has filed a libel suit in London  against Time Inc. over an article in the March 13 issue of Time magazine, his  American attorney, Leonard Boudin, said. Boudin said the suit stems from a  report in the magazine's international edition about Greek banker George  Koskotas' charge that Papandreou drained the Bank of Crete, in Athens, of  millions of dollars in payoffs made to him and party officials. "The  international edition had a little different story than the American edition of  Time, and it was accompanied by a lurid cover (photo) showing Koskotas behind  bars," Boudin said. Koskotas, jailed in Massachusetts, is fighting extradition  to face embezzlement and forgery charges in Greece. A Time spokesman had no  comment. SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Some 45 foreign and 255 Bulgarian journalists  covered the 41st Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] Congress, which  opened today. Our reporter Lilyana Yancheva, who will summarize  the first day of the congress, was among them.    [Yancheva] I would like to say that the report that party  leader Zhan Videnov read today was well-received by the  delegates, despite the fact that statements made during the  afternoon debate were rather critical. This is precisely what I  want to ask Mr. Videnov, who is sitting next to me: What do you  think were the most essential and critical elements in the  statements of the delegates who came to the congress from all  parts of the country.    [Videnov] I think that it is too early to say precisely what  the focus of the discussion was, what the basic conflict it  engenders is, and what direction the possible resolution will  take. I think that the congress will determine the country's  political calendar for the current year, and our resolution will  contain the opinion of the Bulgarian Socialists regarding the  tests that lie ahead. The fact that the congress agenda was  amended today proves this. Now it contains the BSP election  platform.    A dispute broke out regarding the question of whether the  democratic character of the transition will be guaranteed if a  governmental and parliamentary crisis develops; guarantees were  sought for a future leftist or leftist-centrist government,  including listening to the opinions of our present and potential  coalition partners. I think that this subject will unfold  tomorrow, during the second day of the congress.    [Yancheva] There were some very interesting statements on  the part of Roma delegates to the congress; they voiced  interesting claims.    [Videnov] The Bulgarian Romas have the right to present  claims to all political forces, state institutions, and public  organizations. They have an exceptionally unequal social  status, and they are also subject to serious discrimination,  against which Bulgarian society as a whole and its institutions  do not fight. Thus, I think that each party should think about  this, and our party will certainly do so.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia is due to start dismantling two nuclear  reactors in Paldiski on the Estonian coast in just under a  month's time. The Estonian Environment Minister Andres Tarand  says that experts are ready for this. It is believed that the  dismantling of the fuel rods will take three months. Tarand  suspects, however, that Russia may start slowing down the  dismantling of the nuclear reactors. Tarand says that because of  difficulties that have emerged in the negotiations between  Estonia and Russia, Russia may think of some pretexts to delay  the start of the work.</p>

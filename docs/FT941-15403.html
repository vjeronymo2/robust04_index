			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Yeltsin ushers out cold war with N-accord We have put the last full stop to the last chapter of the cold war,' said President Boris Yeltsin yesterday, on signing the agreement between Russia, Ukraine and the US on the transfer of Ukraine's nuclear weapons to Russia. Is it the last full stop? It promises to be so. But, as officials from all sides privately admitted yesterday, there are uncertainties and dangers ahead before the agreement becomes a reality. Worked out over the past year, with intensive negotiations between the three sides in Washington this month and last, the deal creates a trilateral relationship in which all sides both give and receive. First, Ukraine will, over the next 10 months, ship at least 200 warheads - including those from the the largest, SS24 missiles - to Russia. Russia will reprocess the highly enriched uranium from these warheads and supply Ukraine with 100 tonnes of low-enriched uranium for its civilian power stations. The US will pay Dollars 60m to Russia for this contract - to be recouped from payments due to Russia under a separate contract for the supply from Russia to the US of highly enriched uranium. Under separate agreement, the newly-formed US Enrichment Corporation will pay Dollars 11.9bn over 20 years to the Soviet Union for 500 metric tonnes of HEU over the next 20 years. In constructing the deal, US officials were careful to put the deliveries of the SS24 warheads at the front - since these are weapons which the Ukrainian nationalists would most like to retain and which should thus be hastened out of the country. Ukraine, with a decision of its parliament last year not to fully ratify the Start 1 treaty (which would cleanse it of nuclear weapons) until some 13 conditions were met, has taken the largest leap. Mr Leonid Kravhcuk, Ukrainian president, yesterday said he was justified in signing the agreement because he had met these conditions and that a new parliament would agree to that. Ukraine has received security guarantees from the US ad Russia, which are essentially those already available to it as a member of the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and as a signatory to the Non-Proliferation treaty. These, in sum, come down to guarantees of assistance in the case of attack - though Mr Kravchuk stressed its best guarantee was in continued good relations with its neighbours and in reviving its economy. Quite how much financial and other compensation it will receive is cloudy. It is due some Dollars 175m for the dismantling of the tactical nuclear weapons it has already undertaken, and will have that topped up to Dollars 300m in bilateral assistance. It may receive as much as Dollars 1bn in further compensation. The US has privately told the Ukrainians that they will ask the Wold Bank for Dollars 300m in import adjustment support - even before a credible plan is on the table. However, once economic reform, long stalled, does come to the forefront, 'several billion dollars' (according to one senior offical) will be put up by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Once this happened, international investment would begin to flow. Mr Kravchuk also said that a component of the agreement would be a reduction of the Rbs3,000bn energy debt which his country owes to Russia - though Mr Andrei Kozyrev, denied it to Interfax News Agency yesterday. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, is said to have agreed at the Commonwealth of Independent States summit last year, to supply cut-price oil and gas to Ukraine. Beyond these substantive possibilities, there is the more intangible one of Ukraine setting an example for other nuclear powers - one to which Mr Kravchuk attached great importance. Finally, as Mr Kravchuk admitted, the status of Crimea and the ownership of the Black Sea Fleet remains contentious between the two countries. A nationalist-minded parliament in Russia and a possibly fearful one in Ukraine may not see it, as Mr Kravchuk does, as a 'potential bridge of friendship. The full stop has been put to the agreement on paper: not yet in practice.</p>

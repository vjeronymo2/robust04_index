			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: CRH up but warns on second half CRH, the international building materials group and one of Ireland's biggest companies, yesterday provided a small ray of light in what is expected to be a gloomy reporting season for the construction sector. The announcement that pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 had risen by 7 per cent from IPounds 21.1m to IPounds 22.6m (Pounds 21.4m) sent the group's share price up to 200p at one stage before falling back to close 1p up at 197p. Mr Tony Barry, chief executive, said that market conditions in Ireland, the UK and parts of continental Europe, remained very difficult. As a result group profits in the second half were likely to be lower than in the corresponding period last year. The UK in particular was 'a disaster area' with sales falling faster than costs could be reduced. A further 600 jobs had been cut - a workforce of just over 3,000 has been reduced by 1,200 during the past 18 months. A further small number of redundancies were likely to be made in the second half, said Mr Barry. Turnover fell by 3 per cent to IPounds 554m (IPounds 571m). Earnings per share were 7 per cent ahead at 6.17p (5.78p) and the interim dividend is increased from 2.15p to 2.25p. The company is likely to be one of the few UK-quoted building materials groups which will be able to announce increases in both interim profits and dividends. The first half benefited from a lower finance charge, down almost 16 per cent from IPounds 11.8m to IPounds 9.98m. Associate companies, mostly in the US, contributed IPounds 553,000 compared with a loss of IPounds 1.33m last time. This more than compensated for the reduction in trading profits to IPounds 32m (IPounds 34.3m). Lower first half profits from Ireland, UK and continental Europe were offset partially by an improvement in the US where cost reduction and higher sales helped push profits higher. Mr Barry said that a fragile recovery in US construction appeared to have begun led by increased expenditure on infrastructure by some states - notably in the north-east where CRH was strong. Building material volumes held up in Ireland despite lower construction activity. This was due to harder times for agriculture as a result of changing EC policies on farm subsidies. Agriculture accounts for just under a third of all construction investment in the country. Sales in Spain had fallen by about 5 per cent as government expenditure had come under pressure and construction programmes for the Barcelona Olympics and the Seville Trade Fair had finished. Markets in Germany, however, remained strong. Sales also held up well in the Netherlands despite lower investment in commercial building. COMMENT CRH's share price, deservedly, has outperformed most UK rivals in a deeply depressed building materials sector. The company's strengths are its wide spread of European and US businesses combined with a healthy balance sheet. Strong cash flow has enabled it to cut debt, which, including convertible capital bonds, fell to 42 per cent of shareholders' funds in the first half compared with 60 per cent a year ago. The company has not been slow to take the axe to costs in the UK and US which should help as US construction output improves. Recovery in the UK looks a long way off; the Netherlands and Germany should remain relatively firm markets but Spain and Ireland appear weak. Pre-tax profits of IPounds 58m for the year, compared with IPounds 62.6m, put the company on a prospective p/e, fully diluted, of about 11, which would look cheap if sentiment were not flowing so much against the sector.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Dame Shirley leads Westminster auditor down legal side street: Hearings over allegations of 'homes-for-votes' could now be shelved Dame Shirley Porter, the former leader of the Conservative 'flagship' council of Westminster, is a formidable opponent. Monday was to have seen the start of hearings by the council's district auditor, Mr John Magill, on whether he was correct in his provisional ruling that she and eight others should pay Pounds 21.25m in surcharges to repay money wasted on an alleged scheme to rig the 1990 local elections by selling homes in the borough. At the hearings on Monday he would have allowed both sides to give their version of events before making a final decision on the surcharge, which he can enforce. But yesterday afternoon Mr Magill announced that he was postponing the hearings after requests from Dame Shirley's legal team. Her lawyers are arguing that Mr Magill, who now has 'quasi-judicial powers' should not officiate as he has already investigated the case and given a provisional view. Mr Anthony Scrivener, the barrister and former chairman of the Bar, who has been retained by Dame Shirley, last week tried to persuade Mr Magill that he should disqualify himself from taking any further part in the case. Mr Scrivener said: 'A judge does not announce his findings, provisional or otherwise, halfway through a case.' Mr Magill appears to be taking the arguments seriously, and so Monday's session, in the Westminster city council chamber in Marylebone Road, will be devoted to legal arguments over whether he should hear the case. If he disqualifies himself, he said yesterday, the hearings into the homes-for-votes allegations 'will not take place'. The hearings are potentially deeply embarrassing for a government now preoccupied with rebutting allegations of 'sleaze', as the national Conservative party had strong links with Dame Shirley's regime. Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, hailed Dame Shirley's council as a 'flagship', and the Tories' victory there in the 1990 council election was proclaimed as a vindication of the poll tax, which was introduced that year. Dame Shirley and her colleagues protest that they did nothing wrong, merely implemented policies which they were elected to put in place. If the hearings do take place, they are expected to last between six and eight weeks. Labour councillors who made the first objections to the policy will make their case first. They have hired Mr Andrew Arden, a barrister, who will be able to quote from the 6,000 pages of documentary evidence collected by the auditor but not previously published, including confidential council documents. Their attack will concentrate on the policy of 'designated sales', in which council flats were left empty until a buyer could be found for them. The objectors say that the aim was to replace council tenants, likely to vote Labour, with owner-occupiers who would be more likely to vote Conservative. After 1987, when the policy was expanded, these properties were concentrated in eight marginal wards, where the Tories believed the next election would be decided. Mr Magill's provisional view endorsed this allegation. He said he was minded to find that electoral advantage was 'the driving force behind the policy of increased designated sales' and that this also influenced the selection of properties designated for sale. Provisionally, he said the council had been engaged in 'gerrymandering', which was 'a disgraceful and improper purpose'. The recommended surcharge relates to spending on the designated sales programme between 1987 and 1989. The 10 people recommended for surcharge were Dame Shirley, Mr Barry Legg, now MP for Milton Keynes SW; Mr David Weeks, council leader after Dame Shirley resigned in 1991; former councillors Mr Peter Hartley, Michael Dutt, who has since died, and Ms Judith Warner; Mr Bill Phillips, former managing director; Mr Robert Lewis, formerly the council's deputy solicitor; Mr Graham England, housing director; and Mr Paul Hayler, divisional director in the housing department. According to professional valuations commissioned by Mr Magill the council lost Pounds 13.3m by selling the properties at a discount to their open-market values. Homeless families were put into temporary hotels while council flats were left vacant. Accommodation costs were more than Pounds 2m. Mr Magill added that the number of homeless households placed in temporary accommodation increased by 172 each year while the policy was in force and that the net revenue costs to the council increased by more than Pounds 1.5m each year. But the objectors will also say that the designated sales were only part of a broader strategy of 'social cleansing' which involved planning and environmental policies. Dame Shirley will also have the chance to put her case. Westminster council started the designated sales policy, in a limited form, in 1974 and it continued until January. Dame Shirley and her colleagues were elected on a platform of selling council houses. Westminster officials say the council has unique problems. House prices are among the highest in the UK, more than half being valued at Pounds 120,000 or more, making it prohibitively expensive to accommodate homeless people in the borough. Space for new housing developments is limited. According to the council only 21 per cent of Westminster homes were owned by their occupiers in 1981. This figure rose to 35 per cent after the designated sales policy was implemented - still well below the national average of about 60 per cent. The council says designated sales were intended 'to generate home ownership opportunities to meet the massive unfulfilled demand'.</p>

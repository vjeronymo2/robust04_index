			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS: AVOIDING CONSUMER CONTRACT WOES  </P> <P> As contracts go, it's pretty specific: People who sign up with a Los Angeles  pest control company for "a minimum" of a year are billed and serviced every  two months, with "additional services" necessary to "control pest activity"  included. After that year, service continues until canceled in writing 30 days  ahead. "Customer satisfaction" is guaranteed.  </P> <P> But the pests weren't party to the agreement, and when bugs continued to  appear, some customers canceled their contracts and stopped paying. In return,  the company kept billing, threatening late penalties, "collection" and "legal  action."  </P> <P> "Can they keep harassing you?" asks one customer, overlooking the fact that one  man's harassment is another's righteous pursuit. Of course they can, but  consumers have any number of possible responses, from paying the bill to filing  a lawsuit.  </P> <P> The obvious problem with consumer contracts involving installment service --  pest control, security, dating services, weight-loss clinics, educational  seminars, even magazine subscriptions -- is that one buys future performance.  Satisfactions or dissatisfactions don't surface until next month, the month  after or later -- well after any applicable "cooling off" period that gave the  consumers several days to rescind an agreement.  </P> <P> Some companies ease the situation with money-back guarantees -- magazines, for  example, which often refund the "unused" portion of subscription fees. Some  offer trial periods of service free or for nominal fees.  </P> <P> Consumer contracts in general present some problems. For starters, says Richard  Elbrecht, supervising attorney of legal services in the state Department of  Consumer Affairs, "most don't cover anything of importance to the consumer but  a host of things important to the seller."  </P> <P> Specific restrictions must be noted. When a contract, such as the one above  from Day &amp; Nite Pest Control, has such specific instruction for  cancellation after the first year, this probably doesn't mean it can be  canceled any time.  </P> <P> General promises should be questioned. In California's pest control industry,  "satisfaction guaranteed" usually means "if pests come back between service  (visits), we'll come back out," says John Munro, director of education for the  trade group Pest Control Operators of California. But when and how often?  customers might ask, their patience sorely tried by "the limited number of  times the company could come," says Los Angeles dentist Kathleen Stambaugh.  Sometimes, furthermore, they "didn't come, or came two hours late," says public  relations executive Frank Widder.  </P> <P> "Customer satisfaction guaranteed" may actually be more generous than most  companies intend, if they don't limit what they'll do if someone is not  satisfied or what constitutes "satisfaction." Will they just come out again? Or  cheerfully refund money? Is satisfaction objectively defined by an absence of  pests? If not otherwise qualified, "satisfaction guaranteed means subjective,  not objective satisfaction," says Herschel Elkins, California's assistant  attorney general in charge of consumer protection.  </P> <P> Given a form contract, consumers had better add their own concerns and  expectations, trying to "come to a real understanding with the other party,"  says Elbrecht, "about what they're getting and what comes along with it." Day  &amp; Nite's president, Kevin O'Connor, for example, says he sometimes  negotiates "open contracts" with people who "might be moving" or who are "not  sure if (they're) going to stick with you."  </P> <P> Even when they're not expressed, consumers may have rights under such  contracts. Under state warranty laws, most consumer goods are sold with an  implied warranty of "merchantability" guaranteeing that they'll do what they're  supposed to do; i.e., toasters should toast. Conceivably, pest control should  "control" pests; most such laws deal with goods, not services, but one can,  says Elbrecht, "apply them by analogy, and courts have done it."  </P> <P> Many people, unfortunately, do their roughest negotiating -- if that's the  right word -- when the arrangement falls apart. Companies start by threatening,  over and again, to turn the account over to a collection agency. They also  threaten dire effects on the customer's credit rating if either they or their  collection agency report to a credit reporting agency, and some threaten to  sue.  </P> <P> These are significant threats. Indeed, consumers fighting small bills suddenly  find themselves weighing the possibility that something will end up on a credit  report or in court, and their involvement will become very time consuming, if  not a full-time job.  </P> <P> They have similar weapons, of course, starting with the threat to contact some  pertinent government office. The state Structural Pest Control Board, for one,  sends such complaints to companies involved, giving them 10 days to respond,  usually with a promise to treat the place again.  </P> <P> But with five investigators statewide, that's it: "If someone's willing to come  out again," says Los Angeles social worker Susanna Des Jardien, who has had  trouble with both pests and pest control companies, "the fact that he's coming  out to treat them with snake oil is not of interest to them."  </P> <P> Consumers can fight adverse credit reports (if not very effectively) by  inserting a letter of denial in their credit file. They, too, can threaten to  sue; in fact, "everybody threatens suit now," says Kevin O'Connor, "even over  $40." Given such amounts, small claims court (typically, for disputes involving  less than $2,000) may satisfy either party, since it can not only require  compensation for those injured but performance or cancellation of a contract.  </P> <P> Still, the most efficient resolution of contract disputes is to argue it all  out before signing. No one can think of everything, but they should try.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CHICAGO COMMODITIES PROBE;  </P> <P> CLOSEUP: FROM PLATINUM TO PORK BELLIES  </P> <P> The trading pits in Chicago may seem far away from most consumers, but many of  the farm and financial products represented there and elsewhere in the futures  markets are part of everyday life.  </P> <P> When traders talk about pork bellies futures, they are speculating on the  eventual price of bacon. When investors show interest in frozen concentrated  orange juice futures, they are betting on whether a cold freeze this winter in  Florida will affect the price of juice. They even speculate on the price of  heating oil and cocoa.  </P> <P> Take corn futures, for instance, traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. Long  before a farmer's corn crop is ready for harvest, he makes a contract to  supply, say, 5,000 bushels of corn on a certain date at an agreed upon price.  </P> <P> That contract to supply the corn then develops a financial life of its own. For  months, while the corn is still growing, the contract is traded back and forth  and its price goes up and down. The national outlook for the corn crop,  weather, international demand, crop diseases and government subsidies all  affect the supply and demand for corn and, thus, the price of the futures  contract.  </P> <P> Here is a look at some of the more popular and better-known items traded in the  futures markets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JAPANESE YEN: The yen is the official currency of Japan. The U.S. trade deficit  and the strength of the Japanese economy cause the yen to rise and fall against  the dollar on foreign exchange markets. Speculators buy yen futures on the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange's international money market.  </P> <P> </P> <P> T-BONDS: Treasury bonds are issued by the U.S. government with maturities of 10  years or longer to finance long-term debt. Trading in T-bonds futures  represented about 30% of major futures trading in 1987. Traded on the Chicago  Board of Trade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> S&amp;P 500 INDEX: The Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating firm has compiled an  index of 500 stocks intended to represent broadly the stocks traded over the  counter and on the New York and American stock exchanges. This index goes up  and down based on the prices of the 500 stocks. Trading in futures contracts is  based on expectations of how the S&amp;P 500 will perform. Traded on the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOYBEANS: Used extensively as livestock feed in the form of soybean meal.  Soybean oil is used to make such food products as shortening, margarine,  cooking and salad oil and other products such as paint and varnish, resins and  plastics. Futures and options are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COCOA: Cocoa is primarily used in chocolates and candles of all kinds, as well  as in semiprocessed products such as cocoa liquor, butter and powder. Traded on  the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PLATINUM: Platinum and its associated metals, rhodium and palladium, are used  in catalytic converters in cars. Japan is the world's largest consumer of  platinum jewelry. Platinum and palladium futures are traded on the N.Y.  Mercantile Exchange, and platinum futures are also traded on the Tokyo  Commodity Exchange for Industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PORK BELLIES: The layer of meat and fat from the underside of hog from which  bacon is sliced. Prices are sensitive to inventory of bellies in cold storage  and how much is being turned into bacon. Bellies generally account for about  12% of a hog's live weight. Traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CORN: Sold primarily as feed for livestock and poultry and is processed to make  sweeteners, starch, fuel and alcoholic beverages. The United States is the  world's largest producer and exports corn to South Korea, Mexico and Japan.  Futures and options are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade and futures on the  Mid-America Commodity Exchange.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SILVER: Used in photographic materials, electrical and electronic products such  as contacts and conductors, batteries, sterling tableware, jewelry, mirrors,  coins, dental and medical uses and brazing alloys and solder. It is traded on  the N.Y. Commodity Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the Mid-America  Commodity Exchange and the London Metal Exchange.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COFFEE: The second-largest cash commodity in the world, after oil. Weather  problems such as drought or frost will decrease production and the price will  increase. Traded on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.  </P></p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Bhutto urges political clean-up THE PAKISTANI opposition leader, Ms Benazir Bhutto, yesterday appealed to the new caretaker government to stop drug money being used to buy votes in mid-term elections set for October, Reuter reports from Islamabad. 'We don't want dirty money, drug money, smuggled money to taint the political life of Pakistan,' she told a news conference just hours after the country's two top leaders resigned to pave the way for fresh elections. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan stepped down and the prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, dissolved parliament on Sunday in a deal negotiated by the army to end a feud between them that had paralysed government for six months. The caretaker prime minister, Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former World Bank vice-president, met the acting president and former senate chairman, Mr Wasim Sajjad, to discuss forming a cabinet to govern in the run-up to elections on October 6. Shares on the Pakistani stock exchange closed higher on a brisk trade after the appointment of Mr Qureshi. Ms Bhutto said she met Mr Sajjad yesterday to discuss her demands for electoral reforms to prevent horsetrading and to ensure free and fair polls, and requested a meeting with Mr Qureshi to raise similar issues. 'We need confidence-building steps to develop a process not tainted with drugs money,' Ms Bhutto said. In 1990, Mr Qureshi visited Pakistan in his capacity as World Bank vice-president and issued a scathing attack on the nation's economic problems. He voiced dismay at the prevalence of drugs, bribery and corruption. Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / People: Non-executive director for The Economist Professor George Bain (right), the principal of London Business School, has been appointed a non-executive director of The Economist Newspaper Ltd, publisher of one of the world's most influential business weeklies. He is the first non-executive to join the board since Sir Evelyn de Rothschild retired in July. Bain, 53, joins the board just as the 149-year-old magazine begins its search for a new editor to replace Rupert Pennant-Rea who has been appointed deputy governor of The Bank of England. The Economist is half-owned by the Financial Times.</p>

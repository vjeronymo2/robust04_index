			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Voting rules leave public perplexed The new election laws are in the best tradition of Italian legislation - complex and confusing. The Ministry of the Interior has been obliged to run daily television spots explaining how the voting system works. It has also obligingly published a 544-page booklet on all the electoral laws since 1947. The impression remains that many people remain perplexed. They certainly do not understand the finer points of the new system which is split between majority voting (first-past-the-post) and proportional representation. Although constituency boundaries have been redrawn for these elections to accommodate population changes and create smaller electoral colleges, the number of seats remains the same. The Chamber of Deputies has 630 seats with roughly 130,000 voters per seat. The Senate has 315 seats with broader regional constituencies. Under the new system 475 seats in the chamber are elected by majority voting and 155 by proportional representation. The same 75/25 per cent split applies in the Senate. For the chamber, voters are given two voting slips - the first has candidates on the majority list, the second candidates on the proportional list. The majority vote is straightforward: the candidate with the most votes wins the seat. The complex part relates to the seats elected by proportional representation. Before the proportional votes are totalled at national level, a mechanism is introduced which favours the small parties and penalises those parties which have already seen their candidates win seats in the majority vote. This is on the principle that the smaller parties will win few seats in the majority vote, which favours candidates in big parties or in alliances controlled by a dominant party. To qualify for any of the 155 proportional seats, each party must have 4 per cent of the vote nationally. Two of the traditional minor partners in government, the Liberals and Social Democrats, have been well below this threshold since 1987. The proportional candidates for parliament are selected from party lists, according to the dictates of the leaders. Candidates can contest one majority seat, which they must accept if they win or risk losing it to the runner-up party. However, majority vote candidates can also stand in up to three proportional lists to hedge their bets. All the leading candidates in the parties are standing in both the majority and the proportional lists - often in two or three. For instance, Mr Gianfranco Fini, the MSI/National Alliance leader, is a majority candidate in Rome, and a proportional candidate in Lazio and a Trieste constituency. Mr Achille Occhetto is a majority candidate in Bologna and then a proportional candidate in Lazio.</p>

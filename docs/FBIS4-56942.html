			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 10 May (NA) -- Finance Secretary  Ricardo Gutierrez today denied reports indicating that the IMF  would ask for a 10 percent cutback in the 1994 budget to be  implemented. He emphasized that the fiscal surplus targets  agreed upon for the first quarter "were surpassed."    Gutierrez noted that the surplus agreed upon with the IMF  "totaled $640 million, and this target was surpassed by $60  million as a $700 million surplus was achieved."    The finance secretary also believes that the IMF delegation  will issue a favorable report on Argentine fiscal accounts.    Gutierrez added: "What we have done so far will not  represent any problem or be deserving of any remarks from the  IMF."    The finance secretary described as "entirely inaccurate" the  reports on IMF concerns over the first quarter's fiscal results.  He confirmed that this "is entirely mistaken information."    Gutierrez emphasized that "the first quarter's targets were  surpassed."    The finance secretary said the IMF delegation would meet on  12 or 13 May with the financial team. In addition to Gutierrez,  the financial team also includes Economic Programming Secretary  Juan Llach and Public Revenues Secretary Carlos Tacchi.    Gutierrez made these remarks after an economic team meeting  at the Economy Ministry today. [passage omitted]</p>

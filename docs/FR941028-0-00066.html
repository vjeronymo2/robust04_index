			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While OSM appreciates commenter's concern, OSM disagrees that the process provided in the proposed rule will impose an unnecessary burden upon the States. Under the proposed regulation, OSM is assuming the responsibility to entertain challenges to ownership or control information shown on AVS. In the absence of OSM's assumption of such responsibility, the States would have to hear such challenges. Further, regardless of which party assumes responsibility for addressing such challenges, that party would have to obtain complete documentation from all other parties which might have relevant records. Thus, each State would have to provide copies of essential documentation to the participants and to whichever regulatory authority was reviewing the case, be it OSM or a specific State, to enable the challenges to be fairly considered and resolved. It is in the interests of all concerned with the process_including OSM, the States, the challengers, and the public_that determinations of such challenges are based upon a complete administrative record. OSM is confident that the cooperative relationship between OSM and the States which has characterized the development and implementation of AVS would be carried forward with respect to challenges of ownership or control information on AVS made before OSM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters representing State regulatory authorities also questioned whether proposed &sect;773.24 was inconsistent with other provisions of the proposed rules which would allocate responsibility to State regulatory authorities to make ownership or control decisions. In support of these positions, the commenters cited the provisions of proposed &sect;773.26(b) which they considered to be inconsistent with proposed &sect;773.24. As is noted elsewhere in this preamble, proposed &sect;773.26 is being modified, renumbered, and adopted today as final &sect;773.25. The commenters were concerned that there would be confusion in the permit application process if OSM would be the deciding agency with respect to ownership or control information on AVS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis. The provisions of proposed &sect;773.24 were designed to avoid confusion. In substance, the proposed rule would provide challengers with a single forum, OSM, before which they could contest ownership or control information shown on AVS. The alternative to the proposed rule's approach would be for challengers to challenge ownership or control links shown on AVS before the various States. There is a greater likelihood of inconsistent results with multiple jurisdictions making such decisions as opposed to a single agency making such decisions. Further, the content of AVS would be subject to such inconsistency, since the resolution of challenges would have to be reflected in the AVS database. Given that AVS is a national database which is used across State lines, there is a need for consistency in the decisionmaking which forms the content of AVS. Moreover, the approach provided in proposed &sect;773.24 is consistent with that provided in proposed &sect;773.26(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 would provide that the regulatory authority before which an application is pending has authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of the applicant. Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 would provide that the regulatory authority that issued a permit would have authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of the permittee. As will be discussed below in detail, OSM's final regulation adopted as final &sect;773.25 modifies this language to refer to ownership or control of applications, permits, and violations, rather than ownership or control of applicants, permittees, and violators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.26, the authority of the regulatory authority is initial authority, subject to OSM's oversight. Under that paragraph of proposed &sect;773.26, a regulatory authority would analyze the facts and make an initial decision with respect to the ownership or control links of an applicant or a permittee. Such decision would be subject to OSM's oversight. Then, the regulatory authority would enter such information into AVS, to the extent necessary to update the system. The entry of such information into AVS would also be subject to OSM's oversight. Since OSM has ultimate authority, through the exercise of oversight, as to the content of the ownership or control information on AVS, it is consistent for OSM to be the single forum for the challenge of ownership or control information shown on AVS as provided by proposed &sect;773.24. If OSM later amends the AVS to reflect a different conclusion with respect to a particular ownership or control link than that reached by a State regulatory authority, that reflects OSM's exercise of its oversight authority and its responsibility for the ownership or control information contained in AVS. If a regulatory authority would then consider a subsequent application, it would be required to review AVS and to factor the information shown in AVS, as amended by OSM, into the regulatory authority's decision with respect to the later permit application. Thus, proposed &sect;&sect;773.24 and 773.26 are consistent with each other and will not lead to confusion in the permit application process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter representing State regulatory authorities also proposed a revision of proposed &sect;773.24 such that OSM's decisions made under the proposed regulation would be considered preliminary decisions which would become final within 30 days thereafter if the person challenging the link could show no valid reason why the decision should not become final. The commenter asserted that such a provision would enable the challenger to provide supplemental information which could lead to a corrected final decision and, thus, obviate the need for an appeal to OHA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

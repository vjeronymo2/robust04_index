			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government plans to spell out a "tripartite  cooperation" to deal with the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea)  suspected nuclear arms development during talks with top defense  authorities from the United States and the ROK who plan to visit  Japan successively in late April. It has decided to carry out  this plan in consideration of results of the Japan-ROK summit  meeting, which concluded on 26 March. The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, the Defense Agency [DA], and other relevant government  ministries and agencies plan to make analyses of the current  situation and future trends regarding the DPRK's nuclear  development. In addition, they plan to hasten research efforts  to get ready for "firm responses" which Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa expressed in talks with ROK President Kim Yong-sam in  the event a resolution should be passed by the UN Security  Council [UNSC] to impose economic sanctions against North Korea.    U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry plans to visit Japan on  19 April immediately after his visit to the ROK which begins on  16 April. He will hold talks with Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime  minister and concurrently foreign minister, and Kazuo Aichi,  director general of the DA. After Perry, ROK National Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae is scheduled to visit Japan in late April.    By the time these top U.S. and ROK defense officials visit  Japan in late April, it is expected that tensions will have  mounted over the question of whether economic sanctions should  be imposed against North Korea if that country should continue  to take a tough stance, such as by rejecting the International  Atomic Energy Agency's reinspection of its nuclear facilities.  Because talks have been scheduled in succession between top  U.S. and ROK defense officials, between top Japanese and U.S.  defense officials, and finally between top Japanese and ROK  defense officials all around this time, it seems this is an  attempt to apply "pressure" on North Korea to make it soften its  attitude.    The reason is that Japan has its own problems. In the event  of the "worst case" when the UNSC should adopt a resolution to  impose economic sanctions against North Korea and a naval  blockade should be enforced, it would be nearly impossible for  Japan to participate in such endeavors under its current legal  restrictions. If the United Nations were to request Japanese  cooperation by asking for deployment of the Self-Defense Forces  [SDF], circumstances are such that the SDF could "do only as  much as to collect information within Japanese territorial  waters."</p>

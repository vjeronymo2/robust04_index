			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television Presumably the only people not cheering on Richard Branson in his fight to break into the air travel business are those employed by other airlines. Faced with such wickedly high prices, especially in Europe, the rest of us would be only too glad to see him succeed against the cartel. This Week (8.30 ITV) considers Virgin's latest efforts, directed at the South African route, and consults one of Branson's predecessors in the cartel-busting business, Freddy Laker. His advice is straightforward: 'Sue the bastards'. Switch to Channel 4 when that ends and you will find television's beady eye fixed upon another example of big business taking the small man to the cleaners: The Barlow Clowes Affair. A fresh batch of the Western series Paradise (11.20 BBC1) begins with the supposedly retired gunfighter Ethan Cord tangling with a corrupt lawman to prevent the hanging of a Texas Ranger who once saved his life. Since television Westerns are now as rare as dragon's teeth it is a pity this one is not better. Oddly enough, BBC2 begins the evening with Bonanza: The Next Generation (6.00) which should irritate 'Bonanza' fans since it stars none of the familiar cast.</p>

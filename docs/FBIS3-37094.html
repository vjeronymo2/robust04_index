			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Moldova" column] </F>   [Excerpt] "In the event of a large-scale military  conflict, regardless of who might provoke it, the 14th Russian  Army shall reserve the right to cool the hotheads."    This was announced by the 14th Russian Army Military  Council.  The statement, circulated on 9 February, was prompted by the  emergency situation in the region. The statement is addressed  to residents on either bank of the Dniester. In the run-up to  parliamentary elections in Moldova, the statement stresses that  "the flying wheel of military psychosis is being spun both by  Dniester and Moldova TV." The authors of the document cite  political negotiations as the sole method of achieving accord.  As Aleksandr Baranov, 14th Army assistant commander, explained  to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, this statement has been  forwarded to the leadership of Tiraspol and Chisinau.

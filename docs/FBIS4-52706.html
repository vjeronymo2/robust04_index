			<p>BFN     [Text] The government plans to ask Taiwan, which hopes to  gain membership in GATT, to abolish its discriminatory trade  measures aimed at Japan, and lower its tariff rates. Japanese  officials plan to conduct negotiations with Taiwanese officials  at the same time as a working-level meeting is being held 17 May  in Geneva to discuss Taiwan's bid for GATT membership. The  Japanese officials plan to submit a list of Japan's requests at  that time.    Taiwan has prohibited the importation of automobiles and  several other products from Japan. Unless Taiwan abolishes such  protectionist measures, the Japanese Government does not plan to  support the country's bid for GATT membership.    In addition to automobiles (excluding those with engine  displacement exceeding 3,000 cubic centimeters), Taiwan has  prohibited imports of motorcycles, liquor, cigarettes, and  apples from Japan to protect its domestic industries. The  country has also placed restrictions against Japanese firms'  entries in bids for government procurement contracts. However,  Taiwan has opened its markets to automobiles and motorcycles,  among other products, shipped from Europe and the United States.  Therefore, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  considers "Taiwan's measures are discriminatory against Japan."    The government also plans to ask Taiwan to lower its tariff  rates in addition to abolishing such discriminatory measures.  Although the average tariff rate is 5 percent in Taiwan, tariff  rates on durable consumer products are still very high. For  example, the tariff rate is 30 percent on automobiles, 42  percent on trucks, and 22.5 percent on video tape recorders.  The government plans to ask Taiwan to lower tariff rates  especially on these items.    Along with Taiwan, the PRC has been making preparations to  gain membership in GATT by the end of this year. GATT member  nations have agreed that "Taiwan will join GATT after the PRC  has joined." The PRC has also virtually approved Taiwan's  membership in GATT.</p>

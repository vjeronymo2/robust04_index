			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / The Jobs Crisis: The 22m question awaits a creative answer - Europe's unemploymnet rate is heading for post-war highs, with the OECD forecasting that it will hit 12 per cent next year. In response governments are unveiling jobs initiatives in part familiar and in part radical, with policy-makers no longer able to rely on economic growth, FT writers report. GERMANY ATTEMPTS by the German government to stem the rise in unemployment are limited, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. Bonn wants to curb the widening budget deficit, and at the same time make German industry more competitive. The former demands cuts in social spending, the latter requires higher productivity with a leaner work force. To achieve both, Mr Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, unveiled two draft laws in August designed to cut social spending in western Germany. The package, spread over three years, would reduce spending by DM77bn (Pounds 30.8bn). Unemployment benefits are included in these cuts. For instance, for those with dependents, unemployment benefit and social security payments will be reduced to 55 per cent of the employee's last net pay. Those without dependents will in future receive 53 per cent. Any attempt to reduce the growing levels of unemployment in eastern Germany is hampered by high wage levels, despite continuing low levels of productivity. FRANCE A FIVE-YEAR jobs plan unveiled by France this month reveals the dilemma facing the government of Mr Edouard Balladur as it tries to contain the rise of unemployment while leaving social security and worker protection intact, writes John Ridding in Paris. The government's proposals are now being discussed with trade unions and will go before parliament next month. At the heart of the plan is a series of measures to increase the incentives for employers to hire workers and increase the flexibility of the rigid French labour market. The principal proposals include: the transfer of social security payments from companies to the state for workers paid up to 1.5 times the minimum salary of FFr5,880 (Pounds 677); the replacement of the 39-hour working week with an equivalent annual total, designed to increase the flexibility of production while reducing overtime costs; The increase in the number of tax-deductible hours that part-time employees can work; the decentralisation of the management of training and apprentice schemes and tax incentives for employers to participate in these schemes. BRITAIN THE British government believes the best way to cut unemployment is through reducing the cost burdens on business through deregulation, writes Robert Taylor. But it also runs programmes to reduce the jobless total. These include a business start-up scheme to help the unemployed to start businesses with training and financial advice and community action linked to unemployment benefit. ITALY THE Italian government last week took it first step to combat unemployment by accelerating spending on a stream of public works projects, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Foremost is Italy's ambitious L23,800bn (Pounds 10bn) high-speed train network, due to link the country's biggest cities in the next six years. Spending for a variety of other transport projects has also been accelerated. The conventional railways will receive about L5,000bn a year for the next two years, while about L7,500bn will go on upgrading motorways over five years. Money is also destined for various public building projects. SPAIN JOBS currently being lost in Spain are those created under relatively new laws allowing employers to hire people on temporary contracts, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. Under the Francoist labour system, inherited by Spain's democratic rulers, people already in jobs were guaranteed them for life - a strong disincentive to the creation of new jobs which the Socialist government tried to redress by introducing temporary jobs contracts in the mid-1980s. Roughly 1m jobs were created using these contracts, especially during the economic boom triggered by Spain's admission to the EC in 1986. Being the most vulnerable, however, they have been the worst affected by the current recession. While the government does have a number of old job creation schemes in place - primarily one which pays employers a subsidy for hiring apprentices on short contracts - it has not responded to the current crisis with new incentives. NORWAY THE Norwegian government last week announced plans to introduce a package of measures, valued at an estimated NKr600m (Pounds 55m), to create jobs, boost the competitiveness of industry and increase non-oil exports, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Since 1990 the government has reduced industry taxes and tariffs by an estimated NKr8bn and is planning a large-scale transport infrastructure investment programme during 1994-97, which it claims will reduce the annual transport costs of industry by NKr17bn, besides creating new jobs. DENMARK THE Danish government expects to 'break the unemployment curve', as the prime minister, Mr Poulf Nyrup Rasmussen, puts it, through an unprecedentedly expansive fiscal policy, including substantial income tax cuts, in 1994-95, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. It has backed the fiscal policy up with labour market reforms which are designed to increase flexibility and prevent a resurgence of inflation once demand recovers. FINLAND UNEMPLOYMENT in Finland has reached a level that was unimaginable even two years ago for a country that traditionally prided itself on being a model welfare state, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The Finnish government has faced intense union opposition to a scheme allowing employers to pay jobless youths 30 per cent below minimum levels. In any case, the country's employers have so far proved reluctant to take advantage of this freedom.</p>

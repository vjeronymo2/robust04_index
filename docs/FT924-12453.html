			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Wells Fargo hit by debt provision WELLS FARGO, the California bank that has been hit by commercial property loan problems, yesterday disclosed a sharp drop in third-quarter net profits. The bank's net income was Dollars 24m, down from Dollars 86m a year ago, while earnings per share fell to 21 cents from Dollars 1.59 in the third quarter of 1991. Wells said the main reason for the steep decline was a Dollars 400m bad debt provision, double the level a year ago. Mr Carl Reichardt, chairman, said the bank's pre-tax earnings before provisions remained high by historical standards. But he said the California economy, especially in the southern part of the state, 'continues to decline and increased reserves appear prudent'. For the first nine months of 1992, Wells Fargo's net income was Dollars 225m, compared with Dollars 252m a year ago. Return on assets at Wells was 0.18 per cent, while return on equity was just 1.5 per cent. A year ago, the return on assets was 0.62 per cent and the return on equity was 10.62 per cent. Net loan write-offs in the third quarter amounted to Dollars 264m, double the Dollars 123m of write-offs a year ago. The slump in commercial property continued to be the main problem for these write-offs. On Wall Street, the Wells Fargo share price fell Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 65 1/8 . By contrast, third quarter net earnings at the Pittsburg-based Mellon Bank more than doubled, from Dollars 70m to Dollars 156m. Earnings per share were Dollars 2.57, against Dollars 1.10 a year ago. Mellon said the quarterly results included Dollars 76m in gains on the sale of securities and an Dollars 18m charge related to cost-cutting at the bank. But even excluding these special items Mellon still achieved a 42 per cent increase in third quarter net earnings, to Dollars 98m. Mellon's bad debt provisions were Dollars 40m in the quarter, or half the previous year's level. Loan losses were up only slightly year-on-year, from Dollars 59m to Dollars 61m. The Mellon share price was Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 45 7/8 . In Ohio, Banc One, the rapidly-expanding retail banking group, said its third-quarter net earnings were Dollars 186.2m, or 87 cents a share. This was an improvement on the third-quarter net profit of last year, although the figure has been restated at Dollars 140.4m to reflect two acquisitions. Banc One's return on assets was 1.49 per cent, one of the highest in the US and nearly twice the national average. Return on equity was 17.14 per cent. Mr John McCoy, chairman, said the bank continued to see an improvement in both its own profits and the credit quality of recently-acquired affiliates in the process of being integrated into the group. Banc One's bad debt provision was Dollars 115m, up from Dollars 95m a year ago. On Wall Street, Banc One's shares were up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 46 1/4.</p>

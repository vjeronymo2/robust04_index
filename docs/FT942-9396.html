			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / International Company News: Australian satellite-TV group plans placing Australis, the would-be Australian satellite broadcaster, has secured commitments from both international and domestic institutions, which would allow a ADollars 175m (USDollars 126m) private placement of shares or debentures to go ahead. The stock was priced at ADollars 1.30, a small discount to the current Australis share price of ADollars 1.40. The placement, of 135m shares or debentures, is subject to approval by Australis's existing shareholders, and a meeting will be called shortly. The fundraising marks a further step towards the company's goal of having a satellite pay-TV system up and running by the end of this calender year. The fledgling company, which was floated on the stockmarket last year, became the surprise owner of one of the two publicly-available satellite licences. In recent weeks, Australis has put out a flurry of announcements, suggesting that its plans are beginning to crystallise. It announced that Tele-Communications Inc, the largest US cable company, was making a small direct investment in Australis, and unveiled a programming tie-up between itself, TCI and TCI-related companies.</p>

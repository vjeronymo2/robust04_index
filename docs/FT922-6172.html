			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Radio system for Africa A contract worth about Pounds 1m has been won by RACAL RADIO, Reading, Berkshire, to supply and install the main HF radio system for use along the full length of the Tazama oil pipeline in Africa. Funded by the African Development Bank, the contract was awarded to Racal by Tazama Pipeline following an international competitive tender. The order calls for the supply and installation of eight 1kW HF radio systems for voice and data transmission, including Group 3 fax, with the hub station located at N'dola, Zambia. Refurbishment of antennas and training support are also part of the package. The systems to be supplied are Racal Adaptive Communications Equipment (RACE), with an HF installation being located at the six pumping stations along the pipeline and at the main control installations at each end. The pipeline runs a total distance of 1,710 kilometres from the port of Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, to the refinery at N'dola. The Tazama eight-system HF network requirement forms the intial phase of what is expected to grow into a larger order. A future phase is likely to include the introduction of a Racal-designed automatic, remote dial-up telemetry acquisition capability, enabling the pipeline control station in N'dola to monitor the inlet and outlet pressures at each of six pumping stations. In the current contract the monitoring requirement is met by voice reporting or by manual data messaging. Delivery is due to be complete by the second half of the year.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The fate of about 1,100 workers in two factories in  Bekasi is now up in the air since their wages have not been paid  for the last two or three months. Workers in the Orchid  Beatifull [as published] Garment, Inc in Tambun and in Matra  Prianangarindu [as published] Garment, Inc in Pondokungu, have  been given "leave," uncertain as to whether they have been laid  off or not.    Statements gathered by KOMPAS yesterday indicate that the  workers complained in turn to the Bekasi office of the  Department of Manpower and to the All-Indonesia Workers' Union  (SPSI) within the last week. But no solution to their problem  has been found yet. The two companies have refused to discuss  the issues.    "Besides that, when I asked whether they had the money, the  companies answered that they didn't have it yet. Come on! As the  arbitrator, I wouldn't find it hard to solve the problem. If  they have the money, the company should pay the salaries!," said  A. Aziz, an official of the Bekasi office of the Department of  Manpower, who is the arbitrator in the Orchid Beatifull Garment,  Inc case.    There are 600 workers in the Orchid Beatufill [as published]  Garment, Inc factory. They had been getting paid 3,800 rupiahs  per day, without any additional money for food, transportation  or health insurance. Since they have not been paid for the last  two months, the workers admitted that many of them had resigned  and were looking for jobs in other companies.    "Usually, we are paid on the 5th and 20th days of the month,  but we haven't been paid for two months. We're actually used to  the salary being late by one week," Sulistiwa, Chairman of the  Work Unit Directorate (PUK) of Orchid Beatifull Garment, Inc's  SPSI, told reporters.    Below the UMR [Regional Minimum Wage]    Meanwhile, 500 workers at the Matra Prananggurindu Garment,  Inc factory said they were paid about 2,300 to 2,600 rupiahs per  day. This means that the company gives them a wage below the  regional minimum wage for 1994 which the government set at 3,800  rupiahs per day.    "We've already told the personnel department about the  problem of wages which are often late and have not been paid at  all for the last two months. Uh, I was not allowed to come back  to the company. In fact, I can't work unless I know whether I've  been laid off or not," said Noni, a female worker who was  chairman of the PUK of Matra Prananggurindu Garment, Inc's SPSI.    She was the leader of about 20 female workers who complained  to the Department of Manpower at SPSI's Bekasi office; Noni and  her companions carried posters which stated that the company's  managers were cowards. They don't want to be responsible for the  fate of 500 workers.</p>

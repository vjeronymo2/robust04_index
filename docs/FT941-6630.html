			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Are you agog to know why the relationship between the American president and the White House press corps is so bad? Assignment will tell you (7.45 BBC2). I shall watch The Long Summer, Channel 4's repeat of a series about Britain between 1919 and 1939 most of which I missed on initial transmission. This opening episode considers changing feelings about home and suburbia (8.00). ITV offers three drama series, one on top of the other. The Bill, (8.00) a half hour police drama, sustains a remarkably high standard. In September Song comedian Russ Abbot plays the straight man and straight actor Michael Williams is the comedian. 'Bitter sweet' we said of the first series: can they keep it up? (8.30) Peak Practice is an unremarkable soap about rural doctors (9.00). 'The ultimate sexual symbol' is considered by Camille Paglia at 9.30 in the second half of Without Walls: 'The Penis Unsheathed' (C4). ITV's Tuesday documentary Network First follows Britain's representative to the Prix Pierre Taittinger in Paris, said to be the world's top cookery contest (10.40).</p>

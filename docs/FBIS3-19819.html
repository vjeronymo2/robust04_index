Meeting to approve their annual accounts, five companies  from  the IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] stable -- SIP  [Italian State-Owned Telephone Company], Italcable, Iritel, SIRM  [Italian Maritime Radio Company] and Telespazio -- agreed to the  complex swap mechanism. The final vote on the merger should be  approved at shareholders' meetings in mid-May.    Yesterday, the government set some guidelines for the  flotation. They included the assignment of a "golden share" to  institutional investors without any telecom interests and a  ceiling on individual stakes "much lower" than the three percent  set for the Banca Commerciale and Credito Italiano.    After the meeting, the forecast was that the flotation could  be ready in the autumn. Reliable estimates of Telecom Italia's  sale value will only be available when the official consultants  make their assessment known.    For STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company], the holding  company which controls IRI's telecom interests and will control  Telecom when it has been created, last year's market  capitalisation was 21-23 trillion lire (12-13 billion dollars)  of which IRI has about 52-53 percent. The flotation will be  achieved by putting STET on the market.    Yesterday, too, reliable sources said that, in what one  commentator described as a "hot weekend" for moves to re-draw  the Italian telecom map, the government was now hoping to name  the second GSM portable phone licence holder -- there is now a  SIP monopoly -- early next week, or at least before the  elections next weekend.    The further developments expected in May and after the  Summer  represent the end to a saga that began 6 years ago. The debate  on grouping IRI's telecom interests under a single roof began in  March 1988. A major step in December 1992 was the passage of  ASST [State Telephone Services Agency], the state-owned  telephone service company which handled a slice of international  traffic, to newly created Iritel.    Further outlines in TI's profile were sketched in on April 2  1993, when a ministerial committee said the public stake could  be reduced "gradually below the threshold of 51 percent" and  required a separation between the future group's telecom and  manufacturing activities. Details of the whole operation were  released last September. At about the same time, IRI set up  Tecnitel to handle STET's manufacturing activities.    According to a plan released on February 4 by STET Chairman  Michele Tedeschi in a letter to the directors of the companies  to be merged into TI, the new telecom giant will be divided into  seven divisions under the strategic control of the streamlined  corporate structure. With the corporate holding overseeing  general strategy and seeing to it that there is no overlapping  in the services provided by the various sectors, Telecom  Italia's various divisions will function in the fields of  private clients, business clients, international services,  mobile phones and satellite communications. These sectors will  be flanked by divisions dealing with the telecommunications  network and with services.    SIP marked today's new progress towards Telecom Italia by  announcing record profits of 657.4 billion lire (390 million  dollars), 42.7 percent up on 1992 and the highest announced by  any Italian company for last year. The telephone company said  it would pay ordinary stock a dividend up from 75 to 85 lire and  savings shares one up from 95 to 105 lire. The year's accounts  also saw net indebtedness reduced by 1.1 trillion lire (660  million dollars). SIP, whose shares have been outperforming most  other stock on the Milanese bourse for months, produced few  figures that were not some sort of record.    Pre-tax profits were up 47.4 percent to 1.470 trillion lire,  debt dropped for the first time below revenue to give a ratio of  0.948 and enable the company to finance its own investments, and  gross profits per share grew by 26.2 percent to 106.4 lire, 22.1  lire more than in 1992.    Surveying its technical results, SIP said 94.8 percent of  Italian homes now have a telephone, over 1,100,000 km of optical  fibre cables have already been laid, while mobile telephones  grew by 54.2 percent, one of the highest rates in Europe, to top  1,207,000 subscribers.

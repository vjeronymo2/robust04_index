			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: European insurance Equity markets are always wary of the argument that the current business cycle will be different from the last, especially when the proponent is an insurer with shares to sell. UK insurance companies have already come cap in hand to the market. Since continental European insurers started to raise prices perhaps 18 months after the UK, European bourses might now look forward to a clutch of equity issues. The recapitalisation of Norway's Uni Storebrand and the attempted rights issue by La Fondiaria of Italy are special cases of distress. Allianz's proposed rights issue announced over the weekend suggests others are not far behind. But capital-raising has barely started to repair the damage done by severe underwriting losses. The likes of Sun Alliance and UAP of France have been bruised by falling property prices. Since insurers such as Commercial Union are devoting capital to the developing life and pensions markets of southern Europe, there seems little danger of overcrowding in other areas. With their government anxious to privatise, French state-owned insurers may be more inclined to put profits before market share. On that basis European insurers might look forward to several years of rising profits. It still requires a leap of faith, though, to believe the companies will maintain discipline on prices for long. The behaviour of UK insurers will be the leading indicator in that regard. After three years of price increases many are close to underwriting profit on some lines of business. How they react to such an uncommon situation will be a crucial test of resolve.</p>

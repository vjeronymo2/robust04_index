			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: SERENDIPITOUS MEETINGS A LONG WAY FROM HOME  </P> <P> "It's a small world" is a large cliche. Yet like other words grown trite, it  was born of truth.  </P> <P> Returning travelers tell tales of mind-boggling coincidences and  confrontations: They were waiting for a light to change on a Paris corner when  they saw an office pal waving from across the boulevard. They went to the  theater in London and who should they see at intermission but . . . .  </P> <P> Two women in my aerobics class just came back from Europe; one was visiting her  mother in Germany and the other was touring Bulgaria. They ran into each other  in a mall in Munich on the only day that both were in that city.  </P> <P> I know the syndrome well. As I signed a leather-bound register at a country inn  in Denmark I saw that friends from my city and street had been guests the week  before.  </P> <P> As I walked up the cobbled streets of Sveti Stefan, the Yugoslav fishing  village turned resort, my companion was hailed by a college classmate from  Carmel.  </P> <P> And once, when I was bargaining badly in Bangkok, a merchant interrupted the  proceedings to inquire about the health of an antiques dealer in my hometown.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Predictable Paths  </P> <P> In some harder-to-reach destinations, crossed paths are even more predictable.  Roads may be few. Train seats are limited. Riverboats always dock at the same  villages. And Western travelers have little choice but to head for the same  clutch of hostelries. For me, this does not lessen the magic; it adds to the  wonder.  </P> <P> On a long flight to Egypt a few Novembers ago I reread a newspaper account that  my aunt had written about her week on the Nile. It was accompanied by  photographs of children playing on the river bank at Idfu.  </P> <P> When our boat stopped there, youngsters came racing from their homes. Two girls  wore matching dresses of a bold floral print. I recognized the fabric; it was  in my aunt's picture.  </P> <P> I returned to my cabin to dig out the clipping, and gave it to the girls. I  knew from their squeals that the identification was right.  </P> <P> And what, if any, is the moral of all this far-flung happenstance? According to  some travelers, it's "beware."  </P> <P> A fellow I know was in Moscow for the first time, standing at dusk in Red  Square, feeling alone at the end of the world. Suddenly he was hailed by a  raspy voice that he thought he'd left behind in California, a gadfly who had  been fighting him in city hall over a public parking issue.  </P> <P> "And another thing! . . .," she cried, waving her umbrella as she raced toward  him from the shadows of the Kremlin.  </P> <P> "At that moment I decided that no place on earth offers anonymity," he told me.  "Thank goodness I wasn't buying black-market rubles or chasing Russian girls."  </P> <P> Surprise encounters can have exuberant charm, but not always. I heard of a  couple who checked into a European hideaway and were greeted warmly.  </P> <P> "Wonderful to see you," gushed the proprietor. "The same room as last year?"  The woman, for whom it was a first visit, was aghast. The man, ever fast on his  feet, said solemnly: "It's not what you think, my dear."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Familiar Face  </P> <P> Recently, I was climbing the stairs in the labyrinth of Jimmy's Harborside  restaurant in Boston when a voice called: "Judith?"  </P> <P> I turned and saw a familiar face in an unfamiliar setting. It was a businessman  from Oklahoma, there with his wife and daughter, a student at Boston  University.  </P> <P> "We thought we'd see you," he said, laughing. "Your mother's a witch, you know.  She said you were in Boston and we'd probably run into you."  </P> <P> Serendipity reached out and touched me in Norway one July evening. My husband  and I arrived in Oslo by train and had no hotel reservation. We took a cab to  the Bristol because the name was familiar and the location central. Yes, they  had a room.  </P> <P> I had kicked off my shoes and was eyeing the down comforter when a call came  from the front desk. Some San Diego friends were downstairs and wanted to toast  my birthday with champagne. I had forgotten that our trips might overlap. They  had assumed that we would stay at the same hotel.  </P> <P> After hugs in the lobby they led me around the corner to a club named Zebra or  Zodiac or Jaguar. It was almost midnight. All I remember for certain is that  the maitre d' greeted me with, "Telephone call for Judith Morgan." I knew it  was a joke. No one knew where I was, including myself.  </P> <P> When I picked up the receiver, my parents broke into a long-distance chorus of  "Happy Birthday."  </P> <P> "How did you find me?" I asked in amazement.  </P> <P> "You were staying at the Bristol in Bergen," said my father, the reporter. "So  I thought we'd try the same name in Oslo."  </P> <P> And the alert desk clerk who had welcomed us had given him the phone number of  the club.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Branka Andjelkovic: "A Hand Outstretched to the </F> Russian Brethren"]    [Text] Mirko Marjanovic, general director of the  export-import firm Progres, who last year was proclaimed to be  one of the 15 most successful businessmen in Serbia, has been  named by Slobodan Milosevic to fill the vacant office of Serbian  prime minister, thereby emerging as the winner of the lottery  that has been going on in recent days.    Although he has not been praised to the skies by the  government media, as is the custom in such situations, Mr.  Marjanovic, we have learned, charmed the Serbian president so  much that in a responsible post like that of Serbian prime  minister he wanted to see none other than the candidate we have  mentioned. If Slobodan Milosevic had had his way at once, the  news that Mirko "Miki" Marjanovic was the choice for new prime  minister would have been stale by now, at least a month old. But  it was obviously difficult for the director of Progres to give  up his old post, where he was now in his fourth term, and, as  the employees themselves say, even they do not remember when Mr.  Marjanovic came to that firm as a promising young executive.  <H5>  Gas </H5>   In actuality, the director of Progres, contrary to many  people's impression, has not spent his entire working life in  that position. He began his brilliant career as an economist in  his native Knin, where he worked for 12 years in TVIK [Knin  Screw Factory], climbing to the position of commercial director  thanks to his zeal and knowledge.    But in 1973 he exchanged Knin for Moscow and TVIK for  Progres. In the years that followed he lived in Russia, where he  became manager of the Progres representative office, and it is  assumed that his now-famous "Russian" connections date back even  to that time.    Here is how he described his passion for that country in an  interview :    "A love for Russia was nurtured among the people of Krajina  and passed down from generation to generation, so that it was  also a dream of mine to see that country and to work in it."    Conceiving that slender thread between the Serbian and  Russian identity as something very ancient, as general director  of Progres Mr. Marjanovic built his career after 1970 on that  cornerstone. When almost all Yugoslav firms began to turn their  backs on the Russian market as the 1980's were coming to a  close, he embraced it with still greater fervor, so that in the  last few years Russian-Serb business collaboration has been  flying like the wind.    Apart from the 1992 signing of what published sources called  the biggest contract ever between Russia and Serbia, calling for  commodity trade of $3.5 billion a year, a joint Russian-Serbian  venture Gastrejding was also formed under the sponsorship of  Progres and acquired a monopoly over the importing of gas from  Russia. At that time the total value of that transaction was  estimated at $180 million in both directions. In late 1993 a  contract was signed with the Russians for a gas pipeline through  Bulgaria to southern Serbia which is supposed to bring  incredible prosperity to the "southern railroad line," and rumor  has it that Belgrade has been heated this winter with Russian  gas.    All of this is certainly thanks to Marjanovic the  businessman, "since he is a man in whom the Russian side and the  government of the Russian Federation place the greatest  confidence." And the Russians who have confidence in Miki  Marjanovic are not be underestimated. The list of those who are  his friends includes Yuriy Brezhnev (Leonid's son), with whom he  had a wild time drinking French cognac at Crazy Horse in Paris,  Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, and Gennadiy  Shikin, Russian ambassador in Belgrade, with whom he spent New  Year's Eve in 1994 in the restaurant Dva Jelena, singing in his  powerful tenor voice a mixture of old Serbian songs from the  city and Russian ballads.  <H5>  Aid </H5>   When all that is taken into account, it perhaps becomes  clearer why Marjanovic the businessman is so much in favor with  the Serbian president. After all, in addition to all those  transactions known to the public, there have also been those  others, which are perhaps a guarantee to Serbia that the  Russians still have a keen interest in them on both the economic  and political fronts. "After all, everyone who knows Mirko  Marjanovic says that he makes his biggest moves in such a way  that few people find out about them."    But the successes of Progres and its general director in  Russia and elsewhere (32 representative offices in the world) do  not seem to be so applicable on home ground. We have learned  that 70 percent of the work force of approximately 1,200 are on  mandatory leave. Malicious tongues would say that in Progres  there are many people from Krajina to whom Director Marjanovic  has entrusted good positions within the country and abroad.    Someone has called Marjanovic "mother of the Serbian people"  for all he has done for the Serbs in Bosnia and the krajinas. In  terms of food, clothing, medicine, and perhaps other things,  those Serbian lands have received from the director of Progres  aid valued at $3 billion, "since aid to the needy is our debt  and our obligation as human beings."    Aside from all, Miki Marjanovic is also a distinguished  sports figure as president of the Partizan Soccer Club since  1989, and, according to his worshippers, he put that team on a  sound footing: "Success in competition must be aimed at profit,  but profit must in turn be used to create a strong team that can  achieve the greatest success."    For all his success and ability, Mr. Marjanovic lives  modestly in a four-room apartment on Banjica, although, it is  said of this man "of stature," that a smallish villa is in the  works and will be built by Progres.    In view of this portrait of a business executive, it comes  as  a surprise that some of the opposition (the SPO [Serbian Renewal  Movement] and DSS [Democratic Party of Serbia]) should say that  they would withhold support from him. This perhaps lends  credence to the rumors that Milosevic's real candidate is after  all someone else. But, as Mirko "Miki" Marjanovic once said: "At  this point we all need to be on the same line, the line of  Serbia, the line of patriotism in defense of the country and our  people. And as Dr. Mira Markovic has said: `Even the wolves  stick together in a blizzard.'"</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 9 June (MTI) -- The National Presidium of  the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the leading party in the  outgoing government coalition, met on Wednesday [8 June] evening  to elect a new acting Presidium, spokesman Karoly Herenyi said  late on Wednesday.    On Wednesday evening, the acting Presidium of the MDF  presented its resignation to the National Presidium, which  accepted it. MDF acting chairman Sandor Lezsak had resigned a  week earlier.    Instead of a new acting chairman, the National Presidium  chose to give the chair to a five-strong acting Presidium until  the next, unscheduled National Convention. The five are Laszlo  Salamon, Laszlo Medgyasszai, Ivan Szabo, Geza Jeszenszky, and  Zoltan Bogardi.    Herenyi said that no members of the former acting Presidium  have applied to be reelected. Thus neither Sandor Lezsak, nor  the five deputy chairpersons of the Presidium (Prime Minister  Peter Boross, Peter Nahimi, Gabriella Farkas, Ferenc Kulin,  Tamas Szabo) stayed in their posts. The five on the new acting  Presidium are all equal in rank. The date of the next,  unscheduled National Convention will be set at the July session  of the National Board.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Channel tunnel express trains suffer further delay The Channel tunnel has suffered yet another delay with the announcement yesterday that long-distance passenger services will not start before September at the earliest. Passenger services had been expected to start in July following the launch of freight shuttle services in May and of long-distance container services at the beginning of June. The British, French and Belgian railways said the additional delay had been caused by the complexity of the testing and commissioning programme for the Eurostar trains. The trains - which will run between London, Paris and Brussels - cost Pounds 24m each. They can run on three different national electrical power systems and four signalling systems. Jean-Francois Benard, managing director of SNCF, the French railway, said: 'The three networks concluded that there could be no Eurostar opening during their summer schedules. It won't happen before the last Sunday in September.' Tests have been carried out in the three countries but there has not yet been intensive testing through the tunnel. 'We need to do a lot of continuous running between the city centres,' European Passenger Services (EPS), the British partner in the three-nation rail consortium, said. 'We have got to get the miles on the trains and ensure they are reliable.' Eurotunnel, which owns and operates the tunnel, said the Folkestone-Calais shuttle would not suffer as long a delay, and the setback to the long-distance passenger services would not have a significant impact on its revenues. 'The contract between us and the railway companies provides for us to seek penalties and covers at least part of the losses,' it said. However, Eurotunnel will have to further revise the financial projections most recently updated for its Pounds 858m rights issue earlier this month. The launch of passenger services still depends on Eurotunnel obtaining government approval for the tunnel and its operating systems. The company hopes to obtain approval by mid-July. According to French railway officials, the failure to obtain government clearance for passenger services was a factor in the delay. The intergovernmental security commission demanded new requirements for tests of evacuation procedures. Once Eurotunnel has obtained its licence for passenger services, EPS and the French and Belgian railways plan to step up their testing programme and start their marketing campaign. That is expected to take a further eight to 10 weeks, EPS said. Passengers will be invited to travel on the Eurostar trains during the marketing period but tickets will not go on sale to the general public until the autumn at the earliest.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Factory orders up 0.7% in September US factory goods orders rose for a second straight month during September, and shipments of finished products hit record high levels, the Commerce Department said, Reuter reports from Washington. The 0.7 per cent rise in September orders to a seasonally adjusted Dollars 255.2bn (Pounds 172bn) followed an upward revision to 1.2 per cent for the gain in August and pointed to a rising tempo of national manufacturing activity. With the exception of a 1.9 per cent fall in July, factory orders rose in three of the four months from June through September. Meanwhile, US non-farm productivity jumped by 3.9 per cent in the third quarter, and a second quarter fall of 1.3 per cent was revised downwards to 0.4 per cent, the Labour department said. Shipments in September were 1.4 per cent at Dollars 260.2bn, the highest on record. But unfilled orders were down by 1.1 per cent in September, a seventh fall in a row in backlogs as companies continue to operate leanly. Transportation orders suffered the biggest fall in September, down 1.6 per cent after a 7.4 per cent August rise. A drop in demand for new aircraft more than offset stronger orders for new cars, ships and military tanks. Excluding transportation, orders in September were up one per cent following a gain of 0.3 per cent in August. In September, shipments of new cars climbed by 6.6 per cent after a 9.4 per cent rise in August. Defence contractors' orders fell 2.1 per cent.</p>

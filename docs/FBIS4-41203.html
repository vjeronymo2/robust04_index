			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, June 22 (SNARK) -- Today Eduard  Shevardnadze made the statement at the press conference which  took place in the Georgia's parliament.    "Speaking on the reasons of the Abkhazia's tragedy we should  take into consideration the general political context, the  background of the tragic events taken place in Abkhazia", said  the Head of the Georgian state. "The most important factor is  the syndrome of some alienation and distrust between Russia and  Georgia arisen in the period of the USSR's break-up and just  after it has taken place. This confrontation during a long  period of time wasn't overcome but, on the contrary, was  strengthened". But the authorities of two states did their best  to overcome this dangerous tendency and establish relations of  good neighbors. The visit of Boris Yeltsin which took place in  February 1994 became the decisive factor, according to the  opinion expressed by Eduard Shevardnadze.    The basic point in the conflict's settlement is the  effective  cooperation which was established between Russia and Georgia,  from the one hand, and the UNO [United Nations Organization],  its General Secretary and the Security Council, the CSCE and the  whole international community from the other. The cooperation  will settle the military, technical, humanitarian and other  problems connected with settlement of the conflict.    Answering the questions of journalists, Eduard Shevardnadze  stated that the decisive word to the settlement of the conflict  will be said by the Russian peace-keeping forces. Russia may be  trusted in. The guarantee is the fact that "great political  forces" are united round the conflict. The introduction of the  peace-keeping troops into the zone of the conflict doesn't  touch the political status of Abkhazia. The latter will be  solved at the negotiations under the aegis of the UN with the  intermediary role of Russia and "friends of Georgia" -- the  Western states.</p>

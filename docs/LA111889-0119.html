			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT JUSTICE KAUFMAN WILL RETIRE;  </P> <P> JUDICIARY: HE SERVED ON STATE HIGH COURT LESS THAN THREE YEARS. WANTS TO SPEND  TIME WITH FAMILY, HE SAYS.  </P> <P> Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, a conservative, outspoken and sometimes  unpredictable member of the California Supreme Court, announced Friday he will  retire at the end of January after less than three years on the court.  </P> <P> In a letter to Gov. George Deukmejian, Kaufman, 60, cited a "myriad of personal  reasons" for stepping down -- primarily a desire to spend more time with his  family.  </P> <P> The justice, sworn in as a member of the high court in March, 1987, after 17  years on the state Court of Appeal, noted that he had undergone surgery for  colon cancer two years ago.  </P> <P> "While follow-up tests have all been excellent, such an experience brings one  face to face with the fact of our mortality and argues persuasively against  continuing in work so demanding that little time exists for family life or  recreation," he said.  </P> <P> Kaufman's retirement had been widely rumored in recent months but the justice  had declined comment until Friday. He is the second Deukmejian appointee to  decide to retire after relatively brief service on the Supreme Court. Last  March, Justice John A. Arguelles stepped down at age 61 after two years on the  high court and 25 years on the state judiciary.  </P> <P> By retiring in January, Kaufman will have completed 20 years as a judge and  thus be eligible for enhanced pension benefits.  </P> <P> It will also enable Deukmejian to choose a like-minded and perhaps younger  successor who could serve far longer. The governor thus could leave his imprint  on the high court for many years beyond his own tenure, which will end in  January, 1991, after eight years in office.  </P> <P> Deukmejian followed this pattern when he selected Appellate Justice Joyce L.  Kennard, now 48, to succeed Arguelles earlier this year. Legal authorities say  the governor is likely to consider such candidates as Ronald M. George, 49, and  Reuben A. Ortega, 47, both former prosecutors and trial court judges now  serving as justices on the state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> When Deukmejian was seeking a successor for Arguelles, he also considered  Appellate Justices H. Walter Croskey, 56, Los Angeles; Fred H. Marler, 57,  Sacramento; and Patricia D. Benke, 40, San Diego. Benke, however, was reluctant  to move or commute to the court's headquarters in San Francisco from her home  and may no longer be in the running for the high court.  </P> <P> Whoever the governor does choose is not likely to have a dramatic impact on the  philosophical balance of the court. For decades dominated by judicial liberals,  the court underwent a marked ideological shift after the 1986 election in which  the voters refused to retain three court liberals -- Chief Justice Rose  Elizabeth Bird and Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph R. Grodin.  </P> <P> The Republican governor then named Kaufman, Arguelles and Justice David N.  Eagleson to the court. While its voting alignment often shifts from case to  case, the court generally is viewed as including five Deukmejian-appointed  conservatives -- including Kaufman, Kennard, Eagleson, Chief Justice Malcolm M.  Lucas and Justice Edward A. Panelli -- and two liberals, Justices Stanley Mosk  and Allen E. Broussard, appointed by Democratic Govs. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and  Edmund G. Brown Jr., respectively.  </P> <P> Kaufman was expected to be among the most conservative of the Deukmejian  appointees, but he has proved to be something of a judicial maverick. While  frequently joining the majority in upholding the death penalty and limiting the  rights of criminal defendants, he broke ranks and joined liberals in some  important civil rulings.  </P> <P> He wrote majority opinions when the court permitted police to erect roadblocks  to catch drunk drivers and allowed a corporate farm to restrict the access of  union organizers to workers camps on its property.  </P> <P> But he disagreed with far-reaching high court rulings that restricted  wrongful-termination suits against employers and barred the use of state  antitrust laws against corporate mergers.  </P> <P> "Kaufman's been an independent, free-thinking justice, pretty much at the  center of the court," said UC Berkeley law professor Stephen R. Barnett, a  close observer of the justices. "He's been a bundle of sometimes conflicting  streaks . . . He's backed the little guy against employers, unions, the  government, the State Bar and even a church. On the other side, he has showed  sympathy for insurers and growers he apparently thinks were victims of liberal  bias."  </P> <P> Barnett speculated that Kaufman's retirement could be linked, at least in part,  to the court's heavy backlog of death penalty cases. While the court under  Lucas has trimmed its overall caseload from 382 to 314, the number of capital  cases pending has increased from 171 to 180. Although the justices have worked  hard to decide such cases -- issuing 60 death-penalty affirmations and 24  reversals in little more than two years -- capital appeals continue to stream  into the high court.  </P> <P> Like other court experts, Barnett gave high marks to the craftsmanship of  Kaufman's writing and research. But he also cited a "streak of intemperance" in  some opinions and Kaufman's sometimes relentless and bellicose questioning of  attorneys before the court. "The scholarly quality of his opinions has been  high, but he would have benefitted from lowering his voice, both during oral  argument and in some of his writing," the professor said.  </P> <P> In a recent opinion, Kaufman issued one of the sharpest attacks in memory,  criticizing a dissent by Broussard that had accused the majority of failing to  show "any awareness" of the impact of its rulings on jury selection and racial  bias. Kaufman accused Broussard of an unjustifiable attack "on the motives and  integrity" of the court and of violating a judicial tradition of avoiding  personal accusations in opinions.  </P> <P> Ironically, Kaufman's feisty questions and opinions contrast sharply with his  open and friendly manner off the bench. For example, less than a week after he  strongly criticized Broussard, he was seen chatting amiably with Broussard at a  public appearance the justices made at Santa Clara University Law School.  </P> <P> Lucas, in a statement, hailed Kaufman's written opinions as "consistently  concise yet complete, compassionate yet practical." Kaufman's questions during  oral argument are "keen, incisive, provocative and stimulating," the chief  justice said.  </P> <P> "I am grateful to Justice Kaufman for all his endeavors, and I wish him a  successful and prolonged retirement," Lucas said. "He certainly has earned it."  </P> <P> In his letter to Deukmejian, Kaufman said he hoped the governor would appoint a  successor within 30 days of the justice's retirement. Kaufman added that he  would stay on the court beyond that time, by special assignment, to complete  work on pending cases in which he has participated.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Deukmejian said the governor was unavailable for comment. But  it was believed that, as in the past, Deukmejian will send a list of potential  candidates for a non-binding review and evaluation by a special commission of  the State Bar and then select one of those candidates as his nominee.  </P> <P> The governor's choice then would be sent to the state Judicial Appointments  Commission, made up of Lucas, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Justice  Lester W. Roth, senior presiding justice of the state Court of Appeal. If  confirmed, as is likely, the nominee would be sworn into office.  </P> <P> Kaufman acknowledged that the work on the court had been "arduous" but he  praised his colleagues and the court staff for helping make his tenure "the  most thrilling, stimulating professional experience of my life."  </P> <P> He said he had no definite plans, but hoped to perform some writing, teaching  and practice of law. He added that he plans to "speak out occasionally on  issues of significance" involving the court and the administration of justice.  </P> <P> Under Lucas' tenure, there has been "much progress" in the morale and attitude  of the justices and their staffs, Kaufman said. "In large measure public  respect for and confidence in the court has been restored, and I am very proud  to think that I have played some small part in that important achievement."  </P> <P> The justice added, however, that the court was being deprived of "essential  facilities and amenities." Since the Oct. 17 earthquake, the court's work had  been disrupted and the justices have been left with "even less adequate  quarters than before," he said.  </P></p>

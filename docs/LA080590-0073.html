			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. VS. ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> "One in six . . . commute to earn an L.A. paycheck and enjoy it in Orange  County" is a strong argument for an L.A. income tax -- on O.C. and other  commuters. This is in fact a practice in some eastern cities.  </P> <P> Capital is generated by L.A., drained into O.C. by commuter spending and tax  flight, leaving L.A. with a permanent tax imbalance. Amenities not affordable  by L.A. communities are enjoyed in O.C., paid by taxes whose source is L.A.  </P> <P> DON MANNING  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

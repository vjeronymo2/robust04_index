			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY AGENCIES GET $500,000 IN GIFTS  </P> <P> Orange County should be smiling pretty by now.  </P> <P> Fifteen thousand toothbrushes and 6,000 spools of floss were among the nearly  $500,000 in gifts, services and cash donated to county agencies this year,  according to a report from the county auditor presented Tuesday to the Board of  Supervisors.  </P> <P> Among the more unusual gifts were $2,000 worth of Captain EO T-shirts and  toddler toys from Disneyland, $1,330 in free tickets for the opera in  Fullerton, five truckloads of dirt and $1,733 worth of men's and women's  personal hygiene kits from the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force.  </P> <P> The county's Social Services Agency collected the most in cash, gifts and  services with a total of $175,744. The big winners within that agency were the  county's annual Operation Santa Claus and the Orangewood Children's Center,  both of which serve disadvantaged or abused children.  </P> <P> Fire departments in the county donated 239 bikes to Operation Santa Claus;  about half of the remaining donations to social services were contributions of  less than $100 from private individuals.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department collected the second most among county agencies. Cash  and other contributions to the department totaled $154,293. Most of that came  from local construction firms that donated time and supplies to help build  Laser Village, a state-of-the-art shooting range that uses lasers to train law  enforcers. The Sheriff's Advisory Council also donated $20,000 worth of pistols  and vests for the shooting range.  </P> <P> The report does not include political donations to the supervisors, who submit  separate reports to a state political watchdog agency.  </P></p>

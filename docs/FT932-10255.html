			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Arts: The Chinese Wolf - London pub theatre Given the temporary closure of the Gate in Notting Hill for refurbishment and modest expansion, the Bush has become standard bearer of pub theatre in West London. It will be fascinating to see whether it follows the Gate's example and seeks permission (and funds) from its landlords for some improvement in the premises. For pub theatre has become something of a paradox. Here are places where we see some of the best directing and acting in London, yet where the conditions are distinctly uncomfortable and there is room for an audience of scarcely 100, sometimes much less. The Gate and the Bush are by no means the only examples. There are others, some of which reach very high standards, like the Hen and Chickens in Islington and the Etcetera in Camden Town. Even leaving the physical discomforts aside, a modest expansion of seating capacity could change the economics. The Gate, in particular, has had frequently to turn people away. A rise in box office takings could increase the theatre's freedom to do what it likes and reduce the time spent on fund-raising. What we don't know, however, is whether expansion and a general improvement of the facilities would spoil the atmosphere which the Gate and the Bush have built up. Maybe the idea of working on a shoestring is crucial to the effect. Certainly watching good work in a cramped space makes you feel literally hooked: there is no escape, even if you wished to leave. At its best, this confinement is one the most exhilarating experiences in contemporary theatre. Such thoughts occurred, not for the first time, at the Bush on Saturday. The performances and the direction are immaculate, but the play is good only in parts. How much of the magic is achieved by the special nature of the place? Here, after all, is Desmond Barrit fresh from his triumphs in The Royal Shakespeare Company's Comedy of Errors. Practically the entire cast has had experience of either the RSC or the National Theatre; they have all made frequent appearances on television. The director, Dominic Dromgoole, has been leading the Bush for the last three years, and has a string of successes behind him - probably ahead as well. And yet there may be an imbalance. The play is The Chinese Wolf by David Ashton, a writer who has had a previous work, A Bright Light Shining, at the Bush and has also written extensively for the small screen. This latest piece was commissioned by the Bush Theatre. In many ways it is immensely enjoyable. It would be hard not to admire Barrit's performance as a huge, bullying property developer. There is imagination, too, in the creation of Max, the hunch-back son of an Italian mother by a one night stand with a car salesman. Max, wonderfully played by Ronan Vibert, is left to mind the south London junk yard while his mother is off on a bank holiday jaunt to Brighton and the property developer moves in. There is a lesbian mechanic from Scotland and a bisexual girl called Claire who sometimes dresses as a nun. Again the performances, by Maureen Beattie and Julia Ford respectively, are impeccable, but merely to describe the action suggests that we not watching the best of plays. Much of The Chinese Wolf is derivative and nostalgic: repeated playing of The Platters, including a witty juxtaposition of their two best known songs, Only You and The Great Pretender. Ashton draws heavily on Hollywood westerns, notably High Noon, and on horror movies - hence the title and the idea that there is a chinese wolf outside the junk yard. He sees additional horrors in Disneyland. It is all great fun while it lasts, though a section on Claire's first orgasm should be cut. But the question remains: is it the place, the directing and the acting that make the play? It is definitely not the other way round. When the Gate reopens in the autumn, we shall learn more about whether pub theatre can keep its spell in less primitive conditions. Bush Theatre, (081) 743 3388</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDY SHOWS ARTS GROUPS GIVE MUCH MORE THAN THEY GET  </P> <P> San Diego arts organizations benefit the local economy more than they do  themselves, pumping more than a quarter of a billion dollars into the economy,  according to a study by the newly formed San Diego Cultural Arts Coalition.  </P> <P> Arts organizations throughout the county return $10 to the local community for  each $1 contributed, according to the survey. But, despite having enriched the  local economy in 1988-89 to an estimated tune of $270.4 million in direct,  indirect and related spending, most arts organizations are barely surviving.  </P> <P> Even when $31.7 million in the form of earned income (admissions, fees,  teaching and merchandise) is added in, only a collective $4.2 million stands  between the 70 organizations surveyed and red ink. Among theaters, that figure  is more like $400,000, according to Alan Ziter, executive director of the San  Diego Theatre League.  </P> <P> The La Jolla Playhouse's $750,000 deficit announced this year may be only the  latest in a series of crises that could continue to plague theaters in this  funding climate. According to Ziter, even the largest theaters are only  $100,000 away from being in the red, and the smallest theaters have only a  $10,000 margin.  </P> <P> "All it takes is one show where the income doesn't come to what is expected for  an organization to go out of business," Ziter said, commenting on the  slenderness of the financial cushion for most local organizations.  </P> <P> Adrian Stewart, managing director of the San Diego Repertory Theatre and  founder of the San Diego Arts Coalition -- a newly formed group of more than 70  local arts organizations -- hopes to use the survey's figures on both economic  impact and the dedication of individuals to the arts to rally corporate and  city support. (The survey showed patronage of 4 million, a volunteer corps of  9,000 and $11.4 million in individual donations -- the biggest source of the  groups' income.)  </P> <P> "What we have to move away from is a series of crisis fund raising," Stewart  said. "This sets our agenda for the '90s. There are a lot of people who care.  There are certain organizations that need to play a role to keep institutions  that people care about going.  </P> <P> "It's a fragile situation, and I believe that the real onus is back on the arts  organizations to advocate to a whole new level of corporation (support), the  small-size corporations, mid-size corporations," he said. "A partnership has to  happen, and it's about more than money. It's about giving San Diego a  reputation as a cultural destination."  </P> <P> Ziter was reluctant to separate funding for different art forms, because the  purpose of the coalition is to locate new sources of support for the arts as a  whole, but the survey does show that dance is the least supported of San Diego  arts, receiving a scant 1% of all contributed income and 2% of the earned  income.  </P> <P> Dance organizations are more dependent on earned income than any other  organizations, with 76% of their money coming from ticket sales.  </P> <P> Theater is nearly as dependent on earned income, at 73%. Music organizations  and museums have the most stable base, with only 60% of their money coming from  ticket sales.  </P> <P> With figures like these, it's no wonder that, despite the much-ballyhooed  health of the San Diego arts scene, there has been a financial crisis in one  organization after another: the San Diego Opera, the San Diego Symphony, the  San Diego Repertory Theatre and now the La Jolla Playhouse.  </P> <P> The $270.4-million figure in the arts coalition report may seem high to those  who remember a survey done just last year by the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.  Max Schetter, director of the chamber's economic research bureau, used  guidelines from the California Confederation of the Arts to come up with a  $96-million estimate of the arts' direct and related impact in 1988.  </P> <P> Some of the differences between the two surveys are that the Chamber of  Commerce used the most conservative multiplier possible -- 2 times the number  of admissions -- to determine related audience spending on meals, drinks, gifts  and parking.  </P> <P> The arts coalition used a multiplier of 2.78, taken from the Harvard Graduate  School of Business Administration model used in Boston in 1986.  </P> <P> Also, the chamber did not take into account indirect audience spending.  </P></p>

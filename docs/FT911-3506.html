			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / North expected to recover soonest THE NORTH of England, the last UK region to go into recession, is likely to be the first to come out of it, according to a survey of the region's first-quarter industrial and commercial performance published yesterday. That would reverse previous experience, when the region - which comprises the north-east and Cumbria for government statistical purposes - was always 'first in, last out' when the national economic cycle turned downwards. The survey of 800 manufacturing and service companies was carried out by local chambers of commerce and the Northern Development Company, the regional agency supported by government, local authorities and the private sector. It found that exports held up 'encouragingly well' in the first quarter. Although unemployment increased, the situation was expected to stabilise before July. The longer view of profits and turnover was encouraging. The change reflects the reconstruction of the regional economy since the early 1980s. In the 1980-82 recession, the north-east in particular suffered because a third of its workforce was in coal, steel or shipbuilding, which were immediately affected when demand fell in the south. Only 3 per cent of the workforce is now in those traditional industries and the economy is widely based, as well as having many more smaller and medium-sized businesses with which to absorb the shock of a downturn. The north-west chambers of commerce economic survey of the first quarter is more cautious about recovery. Loss of staff from computing services companies is slowing, suggesting that the UK recession may be starting to bottom out. Figures for the first quarter of the year collated by the Computing Services Association indicate that for the first time since 1989 the rate of change of staff numbers has not worsened.</p>

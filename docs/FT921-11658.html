			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Zurich jet service brings boost for City airport LONDON City Airport yester-day received a further boost with the announcement that Crossair, the Swiss regional carrier controlled by Swissair, will start operating two daily flights between Zurich and the Docklands airport from March 30. Crossair also said it was dropping its current daily service from London's Stansted Airport to Basle next month because of inadequate demand. The move will mean the first use of the British Aerospace 146 regional jet at London City Airport. This follows the recent extension of the airport's runway. In November Crossair will take over the Basle-London Heathrow service currently operated by Swissair. It is also considering starting a service from Geneva to London City. Confirmation of the services at London City came hard on the heels of Air France's announcement on Monday that it would operate up to seven daily services a week from the airport using ATR 42 turboprop aircraft. Air France also said it was suspending its services from Stansted from the end of March. The decision of the two airlines to suspend their Stansted services is a blow for the image of the Pounds 400m Stansted Airport complex which BAA, the former British Airports Authority, opened last year. While conceding that it was a 'public relations blow', Stansted Airport emphasised that the decision of the two airlines was not a 'business blow'. It said the Air France and Cross-air services accounted for 3 per cent of passenger traffic at Stansted, which has continued to grow steadily since the opening of the terminal complex. Nearly 1.7m passengers used the airport in the 12 months to the end of December, compared with 1.1m for the 12 months to the end of March last year. The start of jet services at London City is expected to lead to an expansion of services from the loss-making airport, which is owned by Mowlem, the construction group. Only about 170,000 passengers used the airport last year but it needs about 450,000 passengers a year to break even.</p>

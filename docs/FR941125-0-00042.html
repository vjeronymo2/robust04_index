			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Substantive Revisions to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained below, the Secretary has not made any substantive changes from the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the NPRM, 23 outside parties submitted timely comments on the proposed regulations. Fifteen commenters explicitly support the consensus reached at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding, and one commenter particularly finds the preamble to the NPRM helpful. None of the commenters oppose the proposed regulations as a package. Some of the comments suggest minor adjustments to the proposed regulations, and an analysis of those comments follows. Other comments deal with matters not relevant to the regulations proposed in the NPRM. In the spirit of the consensus reached at the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Secretary has decided not to address specifically the other comments at this time but may consider alternate approaches such as these when the impact of the regulatory changes made here is evaluated based on actual experience. Accordingly, they are not discussed in the following analysis, although all comments will continue to be available for public inspection as stated in the NPRM (59 FR 41187).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous comments refer to an additional rule to implement section 422(g)(1)(C) of the HEA and to a system of uniform financial projections for guaranty agencies. The commenters request a formal comment process or at least an opportunity to be consulted before the rule or system of projections is adopted. The NPRM (59 FR 41184, 41186) describes these items and the Secretary's plans for them and explains that the additional rule is not subject to negotiated rulemaking. Because of the need under section 482(c) of the HEA to publish these regulations by December 1, it was not possible to keep the negotiated rulemaking proceeding open on a voluntary basis, as a number of commenters suggested. New regulations are generally subject to public comment under the Department's normal rulemaking procedures; and, as stated in the NPRM, the Secretary intends to engage in prior consultation with interested parties on an additional rule under section 422(g)(1)(C) of the HEA. In the meantime, as pointed out in the Conference Report on OBRA, the Secretary already has the ability to deal with improper expenditures of reserve funds and assets. Authority for a system of financial projections already exists under section 428(b)(2)(C) of the HEA and 34 CFR 682.414(b)(5), and the matter is more appropriately viewed as a request for information from a guaranty agency under that authority than as a new regulatory requirement. A preliminary version of a system of financial projections is currently under discussion with guaranty agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, who was a representative of the guaranty agencies at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding, went so far as to argue that the later promulgation of a new regulation under section 422(g)(1)(C) of the HEA ``would be changing one of the essential terms in the `deal' struck in these negotiations,'' and that ``[h]ad the non-federal negotiators known of the Department's intention to proceed with a separate rulemaking . . . we would not have been so forthcoming in our concessions.'' Although the Secretary appreciates that concessions were made by all negotiators, including the Department's, in achieving consensus, this commenter misunderstands the operation of the negotiated rulemaking process. Any interim agreements reached as the proceeding progressed were tentative only, subject to final confirmation with respect to the entire package. In this case, consensus was achieved at the final negotiating session, while the Secretary's draft proposal on improper expenditures had been withdrawn at a prior meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.410 Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 682.410(a) Fiscal Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 682.410(a)(1) Reserve Fund Assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter requested the Secretary to define sources of guaranty agency reserve funds that can be considered ``non-federal.'' Another urged that funds received from a State be included in the reserve fund only if they are ``used'' for guaranty activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary does not see any need to define any portion of guaranty agency reserves as ``non-federal'' in these regulations. The term ``non-federal'' does not appear in the new section 422(g)(1) of the HEA but instead in pre-existing section 422(a)(2), dealing with a previous authority for the provision and recall of Federal advance funds and other reserves. Although the excerpt from the conference report on OBRA quoted in the NPRM (59 FR 41184) did use the term ``federal portion,'' it is not clear what was meant by this reference, or what significance it should be given in light of the unqualified language of section 422(g)(1) itself and of prior court decisions defining the Federal interest in guaranty agency reserve funds. In any event, the long-standing definition of reserve fund in &sect;682.410 was based on sections 422, 428, and 432 of the HEA as they existed even prior to OBRA and does not require any additional authority from section 422(g)(1). All of the sources specified in &sect;682.410 of the regulations may be applied only to the uses also specified there. The particular subject of State sources was extensively discussed at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding, and the proposed language represents a compromise of competing positions that was agreed to at the proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.410(a)(2)&blank;Uses of Reserve Fund Assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter elaborated on the explanation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new paragraph (a)(2)(xi) in the preamble by stating that the ``good faith'' proviso in the paragraph ``is a restatement of the basic rule of non-retroactivity. *&blank;*&blank;*''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees with the commenter's observation that this protection against application of certain new regulatory provisions to conduct that occurred prior to their effective date is unavailable if the conduct was not consistent with the ``laws, rules, standards, customs, and practices prevailing'' at the time of occurrence. It would not be appropriate to offer a safe harbor to conduct that was questionable even when it occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 682.410(a)(3) Accounting Basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Numerous commenters urged that guaranty agency published financial statements continue to be based on generally- accepted accounting principles. A few even urged that ED Form 1130, the basic form for guaranty agency financial reporting to the Secretary, be changed to require reporting on an accrual basis, or at least in accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles, and that other reserve fund assets be considered in determining satisfaction of reserve ratio requirements. One commenter requested a specification of the first fiscal year to which this new paragraph is applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

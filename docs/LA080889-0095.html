			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> A LITTLE TASTE OF THE TROPICS STARTS SOUTHLAND'S WEEK  </P> <P> If it seemed to you like uncommonly nice weather around here on Monday, you  were wrong.  </P> <P> According to the people who study such things, those balmy temperatures and  relatively blue skies are pretty typical in the Los Angeles area at this time  of year.  </P> <P> Take the high temperature at the Civic Center on Monday -- 84 degrees.  </P> <P> According to the National Weather Service, that's the normal high for the date.  Monday's overnight low -- 68 degrees -- was only two degrees above the norm.  </P> <P> The maximum and minimum humidity readings -- 79% and 34% -- are not that  unusual either, according to meteorologists.  </P> <P> And the folks over at the Air Quality Management District say the smog readings  were pretty typical too.  </P> <P> So why did it seem so pleasant?  </P> <P> There are a couple of possible reasons, the experts say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subtropical Air  </P> <P> A large high-pressure system has been pumping moist subtropical air into  Southern California from Mexico, according to the people at WeatherData Inc.,  the private meteorological service that provides forecasts for The Times. They  said it is the sort of situation that occurs fairly often around here in  August.  </P> <P> This subtropical moisture has meant scattered high clouds and haze that have  blocked a lot of the direct sunlight, reducing the scorching effect often felt  from exposure to the sun.  </P> <P> While the maximum humidity readings are not abnormal, they result from this  subtropical air, rather than from the more familiar overnight incursion of  marine air from the Pacific. This subtropical humidity, felt during the middle  of the day, can give the weather a "soft" feel if the temperatures are not too  high.  </P> <P> As for the bluer skies, that is probably due, in part, to a relatively weak  inversion layer, again prompted by the subtropical air, according to Claudia  Keith at the AQMD.  </P> <P> "But just because it doesn't look smoggy, that doesn't mean it's not smoggy,"  she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Invisible Ozone  </P> <P> Keith explained that, under these weather conditions, the brown haze of  nitrogen dioxide can disperse quickly into ozone, which is colorless and  invisible to the eye. And ozone, which irritates and impairs breathing, "is the  worst component of smog, the one we're most concerned with," she said.  </P> <P> According to WeatherData's Rick Dittmann, the weather could get a lot more  dramatic -- and less pleasant -- in a hurry.  </P> <P> He said the subtropical moisture was creating thunderstorms in the inland  desert areas that could cause serious flash-flooding in some areas. And some of  these thunderstorms, which were straying into the San Gabriel Mountains above  Los Angeles late Monday, could spill over into the San Gabriel, San Fernando  and San Bernardino valleys.  </P> <P> And Dittmann said temperatures should be a little warmer today, in the upper  80s and low 90s.  </P> <P> That's probably enough, he said, to convert that nice, "soft" feel into plain,  old "sticky."  </P></p>

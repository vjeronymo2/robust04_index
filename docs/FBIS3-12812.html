			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, March 6 (AFP)--The PLO on Sunday [6 March]  ruled out a meeting between its leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres because of the tensions stirred  by the Hebron massacre.    The Israeli newspaper HA'ARETZ reported that Peres wanted to  meet 'Arafat in Cairo on Monday to put the peace talks back on  track.    "The atmosphere is not suitable for such a meeting," the PLO  representative to Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, told AFP, referring to the  February 25 mosque massacre in Hebron on the Israeli-occupied  West Bank.    Kamal criticized the UN Security Council, which has been in  session for the last week, for "not adopting a resolution  condemning Israel after the massacre."    The proposed resolution condemning the massacre by an  Israeli  settler has been held up by a disagreement between the PLO and  United States over a reference to Jerusalem and to an  international presence in the occupied territories.    HA'ARETZ said the call for an 'Arafat-Peres meeting was  passed on to the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis by  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who has been touring  the Middle East.    Peres said meanwhile that Israel was ready to respond to the  Palestinian conditions for a resumption of the autonomy talks  which were broken off in the wake of the mosque carnage.    "We have no reason to oppose demands which can advance the  peace process and calm the situation," he told Israeli radio.    "We can for example agree to enlarge the ranks of the  Palestinian police and to ban armed settlers from entering a  Palestinian village under curfew," said Peres, who signed a  security deal with 'Arafat in Cairo on February 9.    'Arafat was expected in the Egyptian capital later Sunday  for  talks with President Husni Mubarak on the Hebron massacre.    He was also due to meet Nabil Sha'th, his political adviser,  who travelled to Washington last week for talks with US  Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the Palestinian  demands, said Kamal.    The PLO wants Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip and West  Bank  to be disarmed after a settler shot dead dozens of Muslim  worshipers in Hebron.    It has also called for international protection and the  dismantling of some Jewish settlements, notably Qiryat Arba'  near Hebron, where mosque killer Barukh Goldstein lived, and  settlements in the town centre.    Peres told the US television network CNN on Saturday that  Israel accepted Palestinian demands for security guarantees,  including the presence of international observers, but the  details would have to be discussed. He was in favour of "the  presence of a temporary foreign or international group" in the  territories.    But Prime Minister 'Yitzhak Rabin has ruled out any armed  observers saying the only international role in the territories  would be to monitor how the Palestinians spend money from donor  countries during autonomy.</p>

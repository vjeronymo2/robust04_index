			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE GAINS FROM ERRORS BY PANORAMA CITY  </P> <P> Each time American Legion District 20 opponents Glendale and Panorama City  meet, it turns out to be an exercise in baseball eccentricity.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, Panorama City used three Glendale errors to win, 6-3.  </P> <P> On Saturday at Monroe High, it was Panorama City's turn to prove that misses  are at least as important as hits in determining the final score.  </P> <P> Despite belting 12 hits, four for extra bases, Panorama City also dished out  four errors. The final miscue, a three-base error by center fielder Robert  Kite, was more than enough to allow Glendale to win, 6-4, and tie the season  series. Glendale improved to 10-5 and Eastern Division opponent Panorama City  dropped to 11-5.  </P> <P> "They hit us, we win the game," Panorama City Coach Scott Smith said  matter-of-factly. "We hit them, they win the game. Errors have been the  difference."  </P> <P> Despite a solo home run by Panorama City's Russell Ortiz in the fifth inning  and two triples by pitcher Sean Henson, Glendale entered the seventh with a 3-2  lead. Shane Cowsill opened with a walk and promptly stole second. After  advancing to third on a ground out, Cowsill tried to score on Brent Overfelt's  suicide squeeze. Panorama City first baseman Roland De La Maza pounced on the  ball and fired home, getting Cowsill and ending the rally. Or so it seemed.  </P> <P> Overfelt stole second and scored on Dan Evans' base hit for the first run in  the two-out rally. John Aquilar then followed with a line single to center that  should not have scored Evans, let alone Aquilar. Both scored, however, when  Kite swiped futilely at the ball, which rolled to the center-field fence.  </P> <P> Those runs turned out to be the difference in the game after Panorama City  scored twice in the eighth.  </P> <P> Overfelt relieved starter and winner Daniel Gray in the eighth, retiring four  of the last five Panorama City batters to earn the save.  </P> <P> Henson, who was relieved by Ortiz in the sixth, allowed only four hits and  three runs, including one earned run.  </P> <P> "Our pitchers did a really good job -- they are in no way responsible for  today's loss," Smith said. "There are a lot of good teams in the Eastern  Division. A couple of errors to anyone will mean a loss."  </P></p>

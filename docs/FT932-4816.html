			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Key town falls in Azerbaijan: Rebels raise the red flag REBEL troops in Azerbaijan have taken control of the oil-producing former Soviet republic's second-biggest town after intense fighting, seizing four top government officials, Azeri and Russian reports said, Reuter reports from Moscow. The troops, led by rebel commander Suret Guseinov, captured Gyandzha in the west at the weekend and hoisted the red flag of the former Soviet Union over several buildings, according to the Azeri news agency, Turan. Reports said Mr Guseinov, a former army general sacked after defeats in fighting with neighbouring Armenia, had captured four top government officials, including the prosecutor-general and first deputy ministers of security and the interior. Russian TV said Mr Guseinov forced the prosecutor to sign an arrest warrant for President Abulfaz Elchibey. Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said 60 people had been killed in Gyandzha in weekend clashes. It said the rebels had also taken over the southern town of Lenkoran, near the border with Iran. Government troops and special security ministry troops had been sent to Gyandzha to crush the rebellion, it added. A defence ministry spokesman in the capital Baku, contacted by telephone, declined to confirm the reports. The rebels distributed leaflets in the nearby towns of Yevlakh and Mingechaur calling on citizens to start a campaign of civil disobedience, the agency added. The Transcaucasian republic has been volatile since it became independent after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. Fighting with Armenian forces over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh has killed at least 2,500 people since 1988. In neighbouring Georgia, a Russian-mediated ceasefire between government troops and rebels in the Black Sea region of Abkhazia appeared to have collapsed at the weekend. Hundreds of people have been killed in Abkhazia since last August when Georgian troops moved into the region to counter claims for more independence.</p>

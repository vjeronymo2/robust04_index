			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance and The Family: Directors' Transactions FOR EVERY sale of stock by a director during the month of July, there were 3.9 purchases. Historically, that is a ratio which has marked the low point for the UK stock market. The largest sale this week was recorded in Argyll, the Safeway and Presto supermarket group. Chairman Sir Alistair Grant and deputy chairman David Webster sold 100,000 and 50,000 shares respectively at 345p. They are left with 800,000 and 645,000 shares respectively. Food retailing is one of the very few areas to have bucked the recessionary trend in recent years. Three directors in DC Gardner, the training and consultancy group, bought a total of 160,000 shares the day after announcing their interim results. The shares have fallen sharply since the beginning of last year, but the interim results showed a return to profit after a Pounds 2.8m loss at the same time last year. However, no interim dividend will be paid. Colin Hope, a non-executive director of Ibstock Johnsen, bought 20,000 shares at 47.5p. Over the past two weeks, there have been three small purchases by directors at around this level. Directors were selling heavily between September last year and up to May this year. The most notable vendor was Paul Hyde-Thomson, the chairman, who disposed of 670,000 at prices between 90p and 94.5p.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               No of Company                Sector      Shares      Value          directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argyll Group           FdRe          150,000       518             2 Barbour Index          BuSe           75,000       164             1 Cassidy Brothers       Misc          604,500       390             2 Etam                   Stor            8,000        20             1 Highcroft              OthF            9,300        16             1 Highland Distillers    Brew            5,750        14             1 Yule Catto             Chem           13,560        31             1 Dunhill                Stor           15,703        67             1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Brown &amp; Jackson        Stor          523,385        46             5 Burton Group           Stor          100,000        35             1 Ellis &amp; Everard        Chem            9,300        15             2 Forward Group          Elec           66,500        53             1 Fulcrum (ZeroDiv)      InvT           16,769        11             1 Gardner (DC)           BuSe          160,000        43             3 Hawtin                 Text        1,350,000       155             1 Ibstock Johnsen        BdMa           20,000        10             1 Lasmo                  O&amp;G            24,595        34             4 London Intl            Hlth           10,000        17             1 M &amp; G                  OthF            2,000        10             1 Marling Ind            OthI          120,000        20             1 Shield Grp (CRP)       n/a           250,000        19             1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in pounds000s.

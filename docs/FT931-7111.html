			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Kohl visit to Japan may strengthen ties JAPAN aims to initiate an extension of its political ties with Germany through talks over the next few days between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and government officials. Chancellor Kohl's visit, which starts today, could mark the start of a shift of emphasis in Japan's policies towards Europe. Foreign ministry officials stress bilateral relations between Japan and the UK will not be affected by the more active approach Tokyo is taking towards Germany. However, the plan to establish a broader political dialogue with Bonn marks a recognition in Tokyo that the future of Japan's relations with the EC as well as its involvement in eastern Europe will largely turn on its relations with Germany. Chancellor Kohl and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, are expected to launch a bilateral discussion forum as the immediate focus for efforts to strengthen ties. Such a move by the Japanese government is expected to encourage private sector initiatives to strengthen bilateral ties. The talks are likely to focus on trade issues, particularly Japan's growing surplus and market-opening measures in Japan, as well as the promotion of foreign investment in eastern Germany. Chancellor Kohl is likely to call for more Japanese aid to the former Soviet Union and to suggest Japan should invite President Yeltsin of Russia as an observer to the world summit in Tokyo in July. Senior officials at the finance ministry and the foreign ministry are in favour of more aid, but this is strongly opposed by senior figures within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The leaders will also discuss possible revisions to the United Nations charter which could increase their influence within the organisation.</p>

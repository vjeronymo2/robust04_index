			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F> Fini by Stefano Caviglia in Rome; date not given: "`That Motion  Is in Bad Faith'"]    [Excerpt] "Great, magnificent work! Send me the document  in all the languages immediately." Gianfranco Fini is on the  phone, standing in the middle of his office in Via della Scrofa,  almost radiant. He has just discovered the mystery behind the  European Parliament motion. It seems that the motion that won  majority approval in Strasbourg and which calls on Italy to  stand by the "fundamental values that informed the foundation of  the Community after the horrors of fascism and Nazism" was not  worded quite like that after all. The reference to fascism and  Nazism is present, in fact, only in the Italian version. "From  what I have just heard," explains Fini with mounting  satisfaction, "the speaker of the European Parliament has just  ordered an inquiry."    [Caviglia] So in your view, the motion is little more than a  gaffe?    [Fini] Let us say that someone has obviously been acting in  bad faith. But even before I knew about this addition, I said  from the outset that the Strasbourg motion is nothing but a  left-wing initiative designed to give the Italian "comrades,"  who were so soundly beaten at the election, a last-minute  helping hand. The only statement made by a government official  came from the French foreign minister, who has said quite  clearly that he will judge the Italian government by how it  behaves and what it does, not by the names of those forming it.  This does not worry me at all. However, I concur absolutely  with Scalfaro's reply.    [Caviglia] Nevertheless, you have had some problems with the  foreign press, including papers that are not left-wing.    [Fini] A distinction must be drawn here between those that  are in bad faith and those that are ill-informed. There are  papers that do not even have a correspondent in Italy and merely  copy what the Italian dailies write. As soon as the government  has been finalized, I will ask for a meeting with the foreign  press, and you will see that everything will go more smoothly  afterwards.    [Caviglia] So Italy runs no risk whatsoever of international  isolation?    [Fini] None at all. The debate has arisen partly with an eye  to the Italian political battle and partly in view of the  European elections. There are fears of a heavy defeat for the  Left in France and Spain. It will all die down once the  government has taken its first foreign policy measures and  everyone has realized there is no need to worry. Anyway, all  they need to do is look at what the four MSI [Italian Social  Movement] deputies are doing in Strasbourg. The one thing that  cannot be said is that they have been singing the praises of  fascism. One is Pino Rauti...    [Caviglia] Who, nevertheless, still regards himself as a  fascist, does he not?    [Fini] He is the one to ask about that.    [Caviglia] And what about your views on Europe? Is there not  a risk that they will widen the rift between Italy and  Strasbourg as well?    [Fini] The functioning of the European Union is an extremely  serious matter. Political unity is practically nonexistent in  Europe. There is strong financial, but not economic unity.  Anyway, who is to decide what Europe must be like? The German  central bank or the national parliaments and the various  peoples? Italy is paying the price of a European policy without  originality, which in some cases has even sacrificed our  national interests. We do not want to withdraw from Europe, but  Europe as it is emerging is serving the interests of its peoples  less and less and those of the financial centers more and more.    [Caviglia] And what about your relations with the Right in  the other countries? Which is preferable: Chirac's Right or Le  Pen's? Kohl or the Republikaner?    [Fini] Everyone knows I have no political regard for the  Republikaner in Germany. As far as France is concerned, in a  European context I certainly prefer Chirac's Right to that of Le  Pen. It is more difficult to judge at the national political  level. [passage omitted]</p>

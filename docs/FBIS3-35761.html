The president told reporters at the airport that "we were  received well and had interesting discussions at the NATO  headquarters."    Brazauskas confirmed reports that NATO experts are scheduled  to come to Vilnius next week, to help work out the program of  Lithuania's participation in the Partnership for Peace plan.  Lithuania signed up for NATO's partnership plan Thursday.    Commenting on his visit to the Netherlands, the president  said it was "very necessary" because "very little is known about  Lithuania" in that country.    Brazauskas said the Dutch leadership expressed readiness to  develop cooperation with Lithuania when they found out about the  present state of Lithuania's relations with Denmark, Sweden and  Finland.</p>

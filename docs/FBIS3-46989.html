Rice production figures this year are almost  the same as those in 1991 -- the year in which central and  southern rice fields were devastated by floods. The natural  disasters were felt in almost all provinces. Some provinces  were ravaged by floods, while others suffered drought or pests.  As a result, many provinces, such as Savannakhet, Sayaboury,  Saravane, Bolikhamsai, Houa Phan, and Luang Prabang Provinces,  are expected to face rice shortages. As for Champassak,  Attopeu, Luang Namtha, Vientiane, and Khammouane Provinces, they  are expected to be self-sufficient in rice.    The Agriculture Ministry also reported that this year the  national shortage is expected to be approximately 299,520 metric  tons of paddy or 179,712 matric tons of rice. It is estimated  that some 350,000 people in the cultivated areas and fallow land  destroyed by pests are expected to face rice shortages beginning  in the middle of the year.</p>

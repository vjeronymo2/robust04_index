			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Serbs say UN aid in Bosnia can continue: Canadian troops will not be allowed into Srebrenica to end siege of town UNITED NATIONS officials appeared yesterday to have succeeded in maintaining the flow of aid in Bosnia after urgent talks with Serb leaders. The talks in Belgrade followed the discovery by Serb soldiers on Thursday of smuggled ammunition on board a UN relief truck delivering aid to a Moslem area of Sarajevo. Last night Dr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, promised that shipments would continue to flow, although 'it is obvious that we have to make detailed inspections of convoys'. Meanwhile, General Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army, yesterday said Canadian UN troops would not be allowed to enter Srebrenica as part of an effort by General Philippe Morillon to end the Serbian siege of the town. Speaking after meeting UN military chiefs in Belgrade, General Mladic said the 120 Canadians could only enter the eastern Bosnian town, which they have been trying to reach for three days, 'over my dead body, or the bodies of my family'. During the talks on the flow of aid, General Lars-Erik Walhgren, commander of the UN force in former Yugoslavia, expressed his 'dismay and regret' at the use of the convoy by unnamed parties to smuggle ammunition. General Walhgren said he had asked Bosnian Serb military forces to help in an investigation into the issue. Earlier, some Bosnian Serb officials had threatened to ban the passage of aid convoys if more smuggled arms were found. Any prolonged disruption of the convoy system would call into question the survival of the Tuzla enclave, the biggest stronghold of the Bosnian government and main destination for the thousands of refugees fleeing the siege of nearby Srebrenica. Once a major industrial centre of former Yugoslavia, Tuzla's population of 125,000 has increased by half with refugees, mostly from eastern Bosnia. Refugees make up 25 per cent of the 850,000 population of the whole Tuzla enclave, which includes parts of central Bosnia under nominal governmental control. The city itself is nearly cut off by Serb forces, while Croat troops occasionally take control of the narrow dirt road, the only open route to the city. Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, a top official of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said Tuzla's authorities had performed 'miracles' in coping with the influx of refugees. But he conceded that 'we cannot supply the city with food indefinitely. The Croats must be pressured to stop the continuing harassment and halting of aid to Tuzla'. Some 80 per cent of food aid was delivered through Serb lines from Belgrade, he added. Plans to bring another convoy of refugees out of Srebrenica today are reported to have been postponed, but officials in Tuzla can expect little permanent relief from the flood of refugees from the besieged town. Conditions in Tuzla are spartan, but the town has been spared the destruction of Srebrenica and the refugees are happy to be in its relative security. Clutching her frail two-year-old daughter, Mrs Azreta Habibovic yesterday described her exodus from Srebrenica. 'The Serbs threw stones at us in Zvornik. They screamed and one woman was badly hurt,' she said. 'But anything was worth getting out of there. The Serbs are shelling all of the time. It is hell.' More divisions appeared yesterday in the international effort to force Bosnian Serbs and their allies in Belgrade to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia after Russia said tighter sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro would be counter-productive.

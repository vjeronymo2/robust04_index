			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Observer: Incredible Dun and Bradstreet, the business information group, has just written to Cheltenham hotelier Patrick Roach, advising him that an important customer has just gone belly up, thereby underlining the need to keep a close eye on the creditworthiness of his clientele. The letter, from one David Gelstharp, marketing communications manager of D&amp;B, turns out to be a spoof, offering Country Home Hotels the chance to insure against the real thing happening by subscribing to an information service which claims to keep tabs on anything that moves in corporate Britain. Trouble is that Roach's company itself went into liquidation at the end of 1990. Having set up a new business, which is now thriving, Roach can afford to see the funny side of the Dun and Bradstreet's botched marketing ploy. Let's hope Dun and Bradstreet can laugh it off as easily.</p>

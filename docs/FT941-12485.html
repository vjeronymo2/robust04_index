			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: F&amp;C makes it clear - Personal pension plan is so easy to understand Despite the many individual pension products on the market, it is always welcome to see new plans that combine the two features investors seek most: good long-term performance and clear, flexible charges. Foreign &amp; Colonial* Investment Trust, operated by the oldest and largest company in the field, has extended its popular share-savers scheme to offer the first investment trust pension products. The F&amp;C personal pension is available to the self-employed and to directors and employees who are not members of a company scheme. The free-standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) plan can be used by employees who are members of company schemes but wish to top up their benefits. Investment trusts, which are companies quoted on the stock exchange, can borrow to provide gearing, invest in a very wide range of listed and unlisted securities, and hedge any currency risk. Of the 5m personal pension plans sold, an estimated 97 per cent are life office products, including most of those sold by building societies and banks. But the large sale commissions associated with personal pensions, combined with hefty management charges and punitive early termination penalties, have undermined their potential success. The track record of the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust is solid and consistent, offering prospects for long-term growth that rival the best in the insured sector. The charges are so low, and expressed so clearly, that they put to shame the notoriously convoluted life office structure. The trust has been operating for 125 years and has a broadly-based international portfolio worth Pounds 1.7bn, with more than 70,000 shareholders. UK and international equities form the bulk of the portfolio and account for the consistent top quartile performance in the international sector for investment trusts over a 10-year period. For both the personal pension and FSAVC, there is a Pounds 100 set-up fee for any investment size plus a Pounds 50 annual administration fee from year two and a plan management fee of 0.5 per cent. The dealing charge on share purchases is 0.2 per cent, with stamp duty of 0.5 per cent. There is no penalty for varying or stopping contributions and no loading for sales commission. Minimum contributions are Pounds 100 a month, Pounds 1,000 a year, or Pounds 5,000 for lump sums. Personal Pension Management will act as scheme trustee and administrator. The plan is divided into 10 segments so that individuals can phase their retirement. They are granted full shareholders' rights to vote and attend the annual general meeting of the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust. Provident Life is launching a product which aims to overcome one of the most inflexible aspects of money purchase pensions such as personal pensions, retirement annuity contracts and executive pensions. Under a money purchase pension, contributions are invested to build up a fund which, in turn, is used immediately at retirement to buy an annuity. Once this is purchased, it cannot be changed. Moreover, the level of income provided by the annuity depends on the value of the fund and annuity rates at the time. Unfortunately, these rates, which are determined by underlying interest rates, can fluctuate dramatically. Provident Life's flexible annuity portfolio is expected to be launched in February. The concept of flexible or managed annuities is still relatively new - Equitable Life launched the first of these in October 1993. Provident's plan allows the client to retain control over investment of the fund while providing a basic minimum annual income of Pounds 7,500 (higher for those who need more). It offers a wide choice of investments. These include managed equity funds run by Schroders, commercial property, fixed interest and deposit funds, authorised unit trusts and investment trusts, and UK and overseas equities. The initial set-up charge is 1 per cent of the fund value, while the subsequent annual charge is 0.5 per cent. There is no loading for sales commission. Provident Life is unlikely to consider funds under Pounds 200,000 for the flexible annuity portfolio. A note of caution, though: investors approaching retirement who have substantial money purchase pension funds, and who are interested in the control and flexibility offered by this type of product, should seek professional independent advice. *Foreign &amp; Colonial has set up a pensions helpline for savers on 0722-320 102. It will answer technical questions on eligibility, contribution amounts, tax relief etc. It will not give investment advice.</p>

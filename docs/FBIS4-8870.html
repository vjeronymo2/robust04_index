			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Trade: State-Owned Companies Facing </F> Bankruptcy"]    [Text] Up to 95 percent of the state-owned trade companies  are expected to go bankrupt soon. The reason for this is the  rapid development of the private trade which finds it easier to  evade paying tax and customs. If the legal trade calculated  25-50 percent fiscal dues in its retail prices, it would not be  able to sell its products, unlike those who fully or partially  avoid the dues.    The money in circulation in the field of trade is  insufficient and their structure is unfavorable. The largest  part goes to short-term demand (over 50 percent), the supplies  are approximately 30 percent, and the funds only seven percent.  [sentence as received]    The non-liquidity of the companies is enormous. By the end  of February, 991 companies with 9,856 employees had debts, while  578 companies had their accounts blocked for more than 60 days,  which automatically fulfills the obligation to initiate  bankruptcy proceedings.    Concerning the wages, 26.4 percent of the employees in this  sphere have not received wages since December 1993, and this  average is 15.4 index points above the average for the entire  economy. The retail trade, in terms of wages, received 21  percent less money that the average in the economy.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN DIMAS;  </P> <P> PLANNERS' MISTAKES CITED  </P> <P> Two apparent zoning code violations approved in error by city planners are  being considered by the City Council and the Planning Commission.  </P> <P> The council must decide whether the city will pay to lop three feet off a  townhouse deck on Calle Adriana that extends too far.  </P> <P> In August, the development plan review board recommended that the deck be  trimmed at the city's expense to comply with the zoning code.  </P> <P> Also, the Planning Commission will consider whether to grant a variance for  room additions to a house on Calle Cristina. The additions were constructed too  close to a neighbor's property.  </P> <P> City officials say planners failed to go through the proper procedures before  issuing the deck permit and misinterpreted the law when approving the room  addition. They would not name the planners involved in either case.  </P></p>

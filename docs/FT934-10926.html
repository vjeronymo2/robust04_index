			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Stiffelio' at the Met - Opera At the Met, as at Covent Garden, early Verdi suddenly seems to matter. I Lombardi is to be presented by the company for the first time in December; Stiffelio has just opened in a production which, at least in textual terms, goes a step further than last season's Royal Opera House version towards restoring the work that the composer refashioned as Aroldo in 1856, after several years of having his original bowdlerised. What we were hearing, indeed, was the first performance anywhere of what he wrote. At its premiere, in Trieste, the piece was stymied by censorship (unsurprisingly, given that it is set in Austria and puts clerics, albeit Protestant clerics, on the singing stage), and in subsequent revivals the minister Stiffelio became a prime minister, necessitating the wonderful new title of Guglielmo Wellingrode. The Aroldo adaptation has generally been regarded by Verdi experts as a desperate attempt to retrieve a messy situation, and certainly the resulting score remains the least loved of Verdi's post-Rigoletto operas. According to those same experts, Stiffelio, written immediately before Rigoletto, is the real thing. For them, then, this will have been an occasion of some moment. Here at last is the piece, with the music not used in Aroldo - music long thought ditched or lost, and recoverable only from copies - played from a new edition that has benefitted from the rediscovery last year of the autograph material. Whether Stiffelio will now become as familiar as La Traviata, or even La forza del destino, is, however, uncertain. It's a strange piece. Some of the orchestral writing seems frankly experimental - not so much in the overture, which is a miscellany (little wind pipings cruelly hard to play, a broad trumpet tune, a bright unashamed dance), but certainly at the start of the second act, where a moonlit churchyard calls up chromatic curlings from divided strings and a jamming of unlike themes, or in the third, where dissonance is an emblem of the doubt felt by two audiences - that in the church on stage, and that in the theatre - as to what Stiffelio will do and say when he goes up into the pulpit after the catastrophes that have abruptly befallen him: learning of his wife's unfaithfulness, and having his conciliation pre-empted by his father-in-law's murder of her lover. Another curiosity of the opera is that these things aren't substantiated by what we see. The lover, Raffaele, is an exceedingly shadowy figure. In the first act he features prominently in just one tiny scene; in the second his main function is to prompt the lady, Lina, from her cantabile into her cabaletta; and in the third he gets killed almost without opening his mouth. One has the impression of a character who is refusing to take part for fear of incriminating himself. His silence, and his burying of himself in the work's majestic ensembles (other characters are buried there too: Dorotea and Federico), help to create the pall of guilt that gives the opera, right from the start, a quite particular colour. Or maybe this is only the pall of our own ignorance of the work, though I doubt it, since Verdi seems here to be placing us quite actively in ignorance, so that we may sympathise with Stiffelio in his gradual awakening to the truth, and also in his moral resolve to deal with the present and not rake over the past. The role is, again, unusual. Lyricism is the way Stiffelio behaves under delusion: in a beautiful barcarolle near the start, with an orchestra mellowed by horn tone, he tells of seeing an amorous escapade which he does not know involved Lina and Raffaele. Thereafter, along the line of his discovery and self-discovery, his big numbers are all duets and ensembles, and his vocalism becomes urgent, declamatory, baritonal. The part could have been made for Placido Domingo at this point in his career: what might otherwise be faults - the hefty projection, the top beginning to waver - become the means by which he conveys the man's solidity holding against extremes of pressure. There is no refuge here in piety: his great cry of 'Sacredote sono]' (perhaps not the likeliest words for Piave to have put into the mouth of a Protestant pastor) sounds out with the force not of self-restraint but of self-realisation. The other leading principals in this production are Sharon Sweet as Lina and Vladimir Chernov as her father Stankar. Ms Sweet makes a big and often beautiful sound: she has no trouble in scaling above full ensembles, but she does have problems when something more gentle might be useful, or something more accurately on the note. Chernov, though asking our indulgence at the opening performance on account of a throat infection, gave a magnificent performance: his grey, severe tone was vigorously focused, his phrasing pliant and moving, his pacing of the large-scale third-act aria unerring. James Levine, conducting, lets us enjoy the score's extravagances and even its banalities. The production is strong in both these categories too. Michael Scott provides sets in the Met's fossilized naturalist manner (a vast Gothick panelled library for most of the indoor action, a light-filled creamy church interior for the final scene); Giancarlo del Monaco's work as director is in the same vein.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (23): Looking east - and west - Sally Bowen meets two Bolivian visionaries Like President Sanchez de Lozada himself, two of Bolivia's most far-sighted men are entrepreneurs who, after spending many years outside their native land, have returned and succeeded in transforming a personal vision into reality. One is Mr Joaquin Aguirre, author, philosopher, playwright, businessman and now the owner of Bolivia's only genuinely functioning port on the Paraguay River: it bears his name, Puerto Aguirre. 'The Paraguay-Parana hidrovia (waterway) is to our continent what the Mississippi is to the US,' he says, 'but over the centuries Latin Americans have done everything possible to ignore it.' Aguirre found plans for a river port and waterway already gathering dust in the foreign ministry's archives when he was a young man. Only after 30 years of globe-trotting - during which he built the gas pipeline to Argentina, founded a supermarket chain in Colombia and patented sugar made from bananas - did he return to Bolivia to explore the waterway route in the mid-1970s. Since 1983, Mr Aguirre says he has invested Dollars 10m in Puerto Aguirre from his own savings and loans: other private entrepreneurs have put in another Dollars 28m. The 1986 World Bank report on the eastern lowlands of Bolivia, which gave the green light - and initial credit - to soya farming in the zone, described him as 'a man of vision, passion and action'. Mr Aguirre, now in his seventies, believes integration will be achieved by entrepreneurs rather than governments. A permanent, five-country 'hidrovia' commission now exists and is already moving ahead with waterway improvements. This year, he says, his 'pipe-dream' Puerto Aguirre will move 200,000 tonnes of cargo, mainly soya. Like Mr Aguirre, Mr Julio Leon Prado made most of his money in other Latin American countries over a 30-year period - chiefly in power transmission lines and construction. His many-tentacled Banco Industrial group is now Bolivia's leader in financial services. But Mr Leon Prado is a frontiersman at heart. Although he is nearly 70 years old, in the past few years he has spearheaded Bolivia's booming soya industry and is now the country's largest individual farmer. 'When I expanded to 2,000 hectares, they said I was crazy. But I told them, if you need two tractors for 2,000 hectares, you need twenty for 20,000: it's that simple.' With yields of 3.2 tonnes a hectare, Mr Leon can match the world's most productive soya farmers. He praises the Japanese settlers in the region east of Santa Cruz for realising the land's rich potential: 'They revolutionised alised Bolivian agriculture, proving how fertile it is.' For Mr Leon, soya represents the future of Bolivia. 'It's a primary industry and best of all, it's forever because it's sustainable. There's business here for everyone.' He is lending money, supplying seeds, sharing technology and weather reports with small farmers in a push to get a million hectares of Bolivian lowlands under soya. 'That means 3m tonnes of beans a year, which is a point of no return,' he says. Bolivian soya, plus the produce from south-west Brazil, will exert irresistible pressure on governments and private companies to get adequate transportation infrastructure in place. 'Joaquin Aguirre is one of Bolivia's great visionaries,' Mr Leon acknowledges. 'But I think time will prove him wrong. I believe Bolivia's future lies westwards, out through Peru to the Pacific.'</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / M&amp;S and ABB win most respect in Europe: Executives name rival companies they admire Marks and Spencer, the British high street retailer, and Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss multinational industrial group, are the most respected companies in Europe, according to a peer-group poll published today. M&amp;S and ABB emerged as the clear winners when top executives were asked to identify European companies they most respected, in a survey undertaken by the Financial Times in association with Price Waterhouse, the accountants. The study, the first of its kind, is based on responses to a questionnaire sent to almost 2,000 chairmen, chief executives and finance officers from 637 European companies, including the largest quoted, state-owned and private companies in 17 nations. The results provide a fascinating insight into senior management attitudes and the qualities they judge to be important to business success in the 1990s. Almost all the top 25 companies were identified as committed to their shareholders, customers and employees. The most frequently cited attributes across all industry sectors were consistent growth and long-term profitability, clear policy and objectives and high customer loyalty. Conversely, for most respondents, a commitment to equal opportunities, progressive policies regarding childcare and a strong stance on social issues hardly rated a mention. Perhaps more surprisingly, research and development and design were also low scorers in most sectors. Some interesting differences also appeared at national level. Customer loyalty was rated the most important quality for a successful company in the UK and was equal second in Sweden, but came lower down for respondents in other big European countries. Growth and profitability were cited as most important by German and French respondents and ranked second in the UK and Italy, but came eleventh in Spain where market leadership in terms of products or services and displaying a positive management style were rated equal first. In the Netherlands, the most important attribute was judged to be having a satisfied staff which was also high on the list in France, Germany, Sweden and Belgium. It was not seen as being particularly important in either the UK or Italy. In Germany, training and development were rated as the third most important qualities, but were only tenth for UK respondents. Providing employees with the means and facilities to deliver high quality services and products was the top attribute in Italy and was fourth in the UK, but was viewed as being less important in France and Germany. Italian executives also rated making good use of technology in providing customer services as being fairly important. Europe's most respected companies, Page 8-9</p>

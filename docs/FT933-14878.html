			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Scottish Water The government's proposals for Scottish water suggest it has come round to the view that the sledge hammer of privatisation is not required to crack the public spending nut. Scotland's three new water authorities will remain in public sector control, but with powers to attract private capital. That will conveniently remove up to Pounds 5bn from the public sector borrowing requirement over the next decade with less risk of opprobrium from voters north of the border. Since only 1 per cent of respondents to last year's consultation paper were in favour of privatisation, a compromise was always on the cards. On what terms private sector capital will be invited to participate remains an open question. The new authorities might offer three big, long-term operating contracts - on the French model - or a series of smaller contracts for building and operating individual plants. Either way, the private sector will be responsible for providing capital as well as manpower. The bigger water companies may thus enjoy some competitive advantage by dint of their lower average cost of funds. The French giants Lyonnaise and Generale des Eaux will doubtless jostle for position near the front of the queue. Since English water companies are anxious for unregulated earnings, the likes of North West and Thames cannot be ruled out of the running. Building a water treatment plant in Strathclyde may be viewed in much the same light as processing sewage in Kuala Lumpur, only rather less risky. The return they are prepared to accept under such competitive conditions will be a telling pointer to whether the English regulator has kept them on a tight enough rein.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ruediger Moniac: "Confusion About Arms Exports: </F> Ebenhausen Foundation Contradicts SIPRI Statistics"]    [Text] The news from the Stockholm International Peace  Research Institute [SIPRI] received widespread attention in  Germany. Even in the German Bundestag it was accepted as true  and authentic by most parliamentarians: In 1992, the FRG moved  into third place behind the United States and Russia in  worldwide arms exports.    Overall, united Germany has exported weapons and weapons  systems for about $1.9 billion to all parts of the world. The  former USSR was slightly ahead with an export volume of $2  billion. According to the SIPRI researchers, the United States  was the unchallenged leader with $8.4 billion.    What really lies behind these SIPRI statistics was now  studied by the Foundation of Science and Policy (SWP) in  Ebenhausen with surprising results: First, the German arms  industry "is involved" in global arms exports "only to an  infinitesimally small degree" and, second, Germany's top ranking  computed by SIPRI results "from applying a questionable method  of calculating revenues."    Therefore, the SWP analysis sees the SIPRI work as a  "distorted picture of German arms export policy." The public  discussion ultimately does not even take note that the  modification of the arms export policy desired by the Federal  Government "in its core aims at reestablishing Germany's  alliance and cooperation capability and not, as imputed, at  unrestrained expansion of arms exports." According to SWP, Bonn  so far has neglected to clarify "these correlations."    The SWP study is based on data of a register kept by the  United Nations since 1992 on exports of conventional weapons.  They showed that "the German arms exports" reported by SIPRI  "consist almost exclusively of used NVA [National People's Army]  and Bundeswehr equipment passed on" to NATO allies and  Scandinavian countries.    As a result of disarmament agreements, the Bundeswehr had to  muster out considerable weapons inventories and passed this  materiel on to NATO allies with less modern equipment. The  result: The Bundeswehr saves the costs of scrapping; the  receiver country, for little money, gets more modern armed  forces; and NATO ultimately has better equipped armed forces  overall.    SWP uses a second example to illustrate the criticized  "distorted picture" painted by SIPRI: Among other things, this  deals with exports of "demilitarized" NVA ships, especially to  Indonesia (six) and Tunisia (four). SIPRI had calculated  this--like other--materiel on the basis of a "hypothetical  revenue volume of 40 percent of its potential new value" and had  thus arrived at an "exorbitant total sum of $1.9 billion." SWP  judges this method: "If SIPRI had looked at the actual revenue  obtained, the FRG would have landed on one of the lower places."</p>

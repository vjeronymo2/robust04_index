			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Tube may drop tunnel method London Underground may decide to stop using the 'new Austrian' tunnelling method for its Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Line extension even before the Health and Safety Executive has completed its inquiry into the construction technique. London Underground said last night it was considering a number of options. An important consideration must be the length of time the safety executive may need to complete its investigations. The inquiry was launched after a tunnel under construction using the 'new Austrian' method collapsed under Heathrow airport two weeks ago. Jubilee Line contractors have halted work on two of 12 stations planned for the extension. These are at Waterloo and London Bridge stations, the ones planning to use the method. Work on two new stations planned for Heathrow, part of a Pounds 300m rail link between Heathrow and Paddington station in central London, has also been halted. A long delay in restarting work could cause serious financial problems if the two projects were unable to open on time and start earning expected revenue. London Underground, therefore, might decide to change to traditional tunnelling methods to get work moving again. The safety executive said it would complete its investigations as quickly as possible but has not said how long this might take. A decision to abandon the 'new Austrian' method would increase the cost of both projects, but by tens of millions of pounds rather than by hundreds. The cost would be considerably higher if they were unable to start on time. The two stations planned for Heathrow are part of a Pounds 60m contract awarded to Balfour Beatty which includes about four miles of rail tunnel to be excavated using conventional methods. Both BAA, the airport operator, and London Underground have stressed that work has halted on only a small part of their projects. This, however, still leaves the issue of who pays for the cost of the Heathrow tunnel collapse if the project's insurers do not pick up the bill. Insurance premiums for contracts using the 'new Austrian' method may rise, even if the technique is eventually given a clean bill of health.</p>

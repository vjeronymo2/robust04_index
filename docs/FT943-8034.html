			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: British Coal British Coal has accumulated a host of non-core activities during its half-century of state ownership. Now with the company's privatisation imminent, the non-core businesses are coming into their own. One can question how necessary it was for the old British Coal to branch out into areas like computer services and fund management. But many of these are now fairly attractive businesses, whose sale should boost the modest sums the government can expect to receive from selling the mines. Collectively, the non-mining businesses have turnover of Pounds 700m and made operating profits of Pounds 40m last year. Coal Products, which went on the block yesterday, is the largest non-core business so far to come up for sale. Its leading position in smokeless fuels may appeal among others to Anglo United, which owns the rival Coalite brand. The other large businesses due for sale are CIN Management, whose Pounds 17bn of assets under management could be attractive to many fund managers, and British Fuels, the solid fuel distributor. But the British Coal asset with the greatest potential is its vast property portfolio. Its 150,000 acres cover everything from agricultural land to sports fields, former colliery buildings and city-centre office blocks. If it can overcome the perception that it is selling disused pits and ugly open-cast collieries, the property arm could turn out to be the real gold mine.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cyanamid to spin off Dollars 1bn chemicals arm AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, yesterday said it would spin off its Dollars 1bn chemicals business to shareholders later this year. Although the company had announced a restructuring of its chemical operations as far back as December 1991, and a spin-off was widely expected, the announcement came earlier than anticipated. Cyanamid has steadily distanced itself from its chemical operations over the past two years. It has already sold eight chemicals businesses and last year its remaining chemical operations were set up as a separate unit, with its own headquarters, under the Cytec Industries name. Cyanamid's chemicals business had 1992 operating earnings of Dollars 34m, up 6 per cent from 1991, while sales slid 8 per cent to Dollars 1.05bn. In contrast, the company's medical group saw sales rise 10 per cent in the year to Dollars 2.89bn although operating earnings rose a more moderate 3 per cent to Dollars 395m. The decision to move away from chemicals to concentrate on higher-margin drugs and life sciences operations was widely applauded in 1991, at a time when many pharmaceuticals companies saw earnings growth in the 20 per cent range. In recent months, however, Cyanamid's stock price has fallen, along with other pharmaceutical company issues, amid concern that the Clinton administration's criticism of high drug prices will translate into slower earnings growth. On Wall Street, shares in Cyanamid rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 1/4 yesterday. The stock was unavailable for late trading, following the spin-off announcement. The spin-off, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed towards the end of the year.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Budget delays healthcare reform plan PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is delaying release of his healthcare reform plan in order to concentrate on winning Senate approval for his deficit-cutting economic plan, the White House indicated yesterday. Mr Clinton said he did not expect a 'sustained delay', but refused to set a date for publication of the healthcare plan. 'I'm focused right now on passing the budget in the Senate,' he said, adding that the administration intended to remove as many kinks from the plan as possible before sending it to Congress. The Senate is unlikely to vote on the economic plan until the beginning of July so the health plan is likely to be delayed until at least mid-July. However, this would be only a fortnight before the August recess and the plan may be postponed until September. Mr Clinton originally promised to send the healthcare reform proposal to Congress within 100 days of his inauguration. It was then delayed, first to mid-May and then to the middle of this month. The latest delay reflects the tough fight the administration faces in the Senate if it is to pass the economic plan without too many concessions. Mr Clinton said this week he would accept a shift in emphasis from tax increases to spending cuts. But a delay is also opportune because Mr Clinton has yet to make crucial decisions on the shape of the healthcare reform. The administration is still debating the nature of the benefits to be guaranteed, the details of reforms to the insurance system and the plan's finance. Some advisers want a payroll tax on employers and employees to displace corporate health premiums.</p>

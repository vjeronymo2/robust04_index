			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Meeting rallies Rank shares 12p SHARES in Rank Organisation, the leisure group, gained 12p to 586p yesterday after the company held a well-received meeting with analysts ahead of its financial year-end today. Rank said trading conditions had hardly changed since July, with the company remaining cautious about any upturn. There were, however, signs of improvement in the US. Rank's video distribution division, while still loss making, had improved its trading levels from last year. In the past, Rank has held a series of individual meetings with analysts ahead of its 'close' season. This runs from the financial year-end to the announcement of results, expected in January. But the company decided to brief analysts, and release a trading update, at the same time. 'We felt it was much fairer,' said Mr Nigel Turnbull, finance director. Mr Max Dolding, analyst at James Capel, said the meeting went well, although little new information was provided. The broker is leaving its profits forecast unchanged at Pounds 243.5m. Despite falling through the year, Rank's borrowings are set to increase sharply to about Pounds 1bn. About 60 per cent of borrowings are USDollars denominated, rising at year end.</p>

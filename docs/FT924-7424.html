			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Brazilian left gains ground in local polls RESULTS of the final round of voting in municipal elections held across Brazil on Sunday showed a considerable shift to the left in most of the country, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. The left-wing Workers party (PT) won in the major state capitals of Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre and Goiania, as well as in the important industrial town of Ribeirao Preto. Mr Luis Inacio da Silva, the PT leader who narrowly lost the 1989 presidential elections, described the party's performance as 'extraordinary'. However, the PT lost Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city and the party's birthplace, to Mr Paulo Maluf from the Social Democrats (PDS), despite Mr Maluf's association with past military regimes and successive defeats in democratic elections. Mr Maluf is expected to use his position to build up a base for presidential elections.</p>

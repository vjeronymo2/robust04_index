			<p>BFN     [Text] Szczecin, April 22 -- President Lech Walesa paying a  several-hour visit to Szczecin said that this visit is not the  start of his election campaign but a "wise campaign of balance."    Asked if he intends to run for presidency if the Non-Party  Reform Bloc (BBWR) wins the June 19 local elections, the  president replied: "There are still the parliamentary  elections," and explained that he would have to have "executive  capabilities" to implement his programme.    Following a meeting with supporters and members of the BBWR,  the president met with the Szczecin-Kamien metropolitan,  Archbishop Marian Przykucki.    Next the president left for a local military unit for a  meeting with officers and representatives of police, border  guards and fire fighters.</p>

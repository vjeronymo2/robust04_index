			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME ARTISTS FEELING LEFT OUT OF SEPTEMBER'S L.A. FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> ARTS: HUNDREDS OF ARTISTS AND PERFORMING GROUPS WHO APPLIED WERE REJECTED.  OBSTACLES TO THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A CONNECTED FESTIVAL INCLUDE A LACK OF  FUNDING.  </P> <P> A week after the Los Angeles Festival made its first announcement of programing  for the Sept. 1-17 arts festival, many of the more than 600 artists and  performing groups who had applied but were not included are undecided as to  whether to take part in the connected Open Festival, which offers no financial  subsidies for artists.  </P> <P> In making such decisions, artists contacted this week said that they faced  several obstacles, including lack of funding, not enough time to find venues, a  lack of information from festival planners and inability to compete with  curated events for audiences once the festival rolls around next fall. Some  said that they had already decided not to participate.  </P> <P> "I had applied for the L.A. Festival and hoped to be included, but I don't  think I will do the Open Festival at all," said Francisco Martinez, whose  10-member Francisco Martinez Dance Theater is in residence at East Los Angeles'  Plaza de la Raza. "I don't think I would be able to gather any kind of audience  because there will already be so much going on in terms of dance."  </P> <P> Despite such obstacles, however, Open Festival coordinator Aaron Paley, who  also ran the Open Festival's precursor, the 1987 Fringe Festival, said that he  expects about 500 artists and groups totaling about 10,000 individuals to  participate (about the same number involved in 1987, when 450 events were  produced). Any and all artists are welcome, but all will have to produce their  events themselves. Paley hopes, however, that the Open Festival's guidance may  make the difference for artists who wouldn't be able to do so otherwise.  </P> <P> "Our responsibility is to ease those burdens of production as much as we can,"  said Paley, adding that the Open Festival's $260,000 budget will be used to  promote and provide publicity for all Open Festival activities and to hold  workshops dealing with production aspects such as ticketing and finding a  venue.  </P> <P> The Open Festival is also producing a how-to manual, "Doing it Right in L.A.:  Self-Producing for the Performing Artist," and a list of about 900 venues in  Los Angeles County ranging from churches and community centers to traditional  theaters and museums.  </P> <P> In addition, L.A. Festival Executive Director Judith Luther has said that some  Open Festival programs may be selected to appear on the same stages as curated  programs, and thus would receive free use of the stage and some technical  support. Paley said that details for such arrangements were still up in the  air, however, because matters such as who would insure those Open Festival  artists had not been determined. But, Paley added, a main activity of the Open  Festival staff is networking with venues throughout the city to find spaces in  which artists can present their works for reduced costs.  </P> <P> With only a little more than six months to go, most artists contacted had not  yet decided whether to be part of the Open Festival.  </P> <P> Culver City-based contemporary composer Paul Des Marais is in the position of  many artists contacted this week. He had hoped to present his "Two Fables," a  moveable theater piece featuring a narrator and three musicians, in the curated  portion of the festival. He is interested in the Open Festival, but doesn't  know much about it.  </P> <P> "I received a letter that was so complicated and baroque that I didn't quite  know what it meant, but I think it was a rejection notice (from the L.A.  Festival)," he said. "I'm still interested in the Open Festival, but I don't  quite know how to move from here. I thought I would get a little more  information and recommendations (from Festival organizers) on what to do."  </P> <P> To that end, Paley said he and his staff (which includes five paid people and  six interns) produce a monthly newsletter that is sent out to more than 700  artists who have expressed interest in the Open Festival. In addition, they  speak in depth with more than two dozen artists a day, both by phone and in  person. And an average of 15 additional "intent to participate forms" arrive  each day.  </P> <P> Of those already familiar with the concept of the Open Festival, many said  their participation is contingent on receiving funding from sources such as the  city's Cultural Affairs Department.  </P> <P> "It's going to be at least $7,000 for me to produce my piece (for a weekend  run) and I don't think I can do it if I don't get the funding," said  dancer/choreographer Donna Sternberg, who has applied for a $10,000 grant  through the Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts and hopes to collaborate with a  composer, singer and other dancers.  </P> <P> Also waiting to hear about Cultural Affairs grants is Santa Monica-based  performance artist Sharon Kagan, who is working on a large-scale piece  involving about 25 performers, called "As I Recall."  </P> <P> "If I can get the funding in time, I would like to do it," Kagan said, noting  it would cost about $15,000 to produce the piece. "But right now I'm really up  in the air."  </P> <P> According to Al Nodal, general manager of the Cultural Affairs Department, Open  Festival projects will be given some priority when the more than $2 million in  grants is awarded July 1, but they will not take precedence over other  priorities, including artists with special needs, such as minorities and the  handicapped.  </P> <P> "The Open Festival is one of many (priorities)," said Nodal, noting that  Cultural Affairs had already given grants of $150,000 to the L.A. Festival and  $10,000 to the Open Festival. "We want to support the Open Festival and we've  encouraged people to apply, but we can't limit all our funding to things going  to the Open Festival. . . . We have not set a specific amount aside (for the  Open Festival)."  </P> <P> Funding is not the artists' only concern, however. Some worry that the time is  too short to prepare works for the festival. Such is the case with  writer/director Teresa Chavez, who has spent the past year working on her  theater piece "L.A. Real," but still doesn't know if it will be ready by  September.  </P> <P> "If I can get the funds for the work, then I'm considering being in the Open  Festival," said Chavez, part of the collaborative theater group About  Productions. "If it comes together by then, then great, but I'm not going to  kill myself to get it ready in time for the festival."  </P> <P> But while she said there is about a 50% chance that her piece, focusing on  Mestizo history in Los Angeles, will be included in the Open Festival, Chavez  added, "I don't really think I have time to find a venue -- unless something  just pops up in the air -- because venues get booked up."  </P> <P> In addition, she said, "I'm not sure if it's worth being attached to the  festival. Being in the Fringe Festival in 1987 did not attract a different or  better audience. So unless you're in the larger (L.A.) festival, I'm not sure  what kind of an audience you can get (in the Open Festival)."  </P> <P> Taking a different view is performance/conceptual artist Elisha Shapiro. Like  everybody else, he had hoped for funding from the Los Angeles Festival. But he  said that lack of funding wouldn't stop him from producing his "Nihilism Expo  90" during the Open Festival.  </P> <P> "We'll do it one way or another; I've done things on no money before," said  Shapiro, who said his "world's fair" will include interactive installations by  artists including Jeffrey Vallance and Michael McMillan and performance pieces  by artists such as Linda Albertano  </P> <P> Also set on being in the Open Festival is Burbank-based performance artist  Deborah Marsh, who didn't find out about the L.A. Festival until it was too  late to apply, but decided about a month ago to be in the Open Festival.  </P> <P> "The idea of the (Open) Festival goes back to the grass root arts, when art was  performed just for the love of the craft. So much of the art now is commercial,  but here are a bunch of artists saying, 'Hey, I love my craft. I love my art.'  That's what makes me want to be in this festival -- my love for my art."  </P> <P> Marsh is now looking for a venue in which she can produce her one-woman show,  "The Final Mission of Mother Jones," which she has been touring since 1986. She  says she may not have time left to find a traditional house, however.  </P> <P> "It might be a little tight," said Marsh. "But if I can't get into a theater, I  might end up doing it at one of the community centers or libraries, just to put  it on for the festival."  </P> <P> Some of those who have decided to join the Open Festival had already planned to  present works independently, so foresee no problems with their participation.  </P> <P> "I don't know if our work fits in with the standard 'festival' work, but we  want to be under the umbrella of the thing," said Lenore Carlson, who is  working with director Lisa James in developing "Palladium is Moving," a theater  piece that Carlson plans to open in the Spring.  </P> <P> "We'll be open long before the festival, but if we close down for any reason in  the summer, we want to reopen in September. We just want to be a part of it,"  said Carlson.  </P> <P> Still another view was that of dancer/choreographer Naomi Goldberg, who  participated in the Fringe Festival but has decided not to present work this  time around.  </P> <P> "At this point, really, I'd just like to have the time to go and see stuff  during that time. The stuff they're bringing is wonderful, and I really want to  see it, but when you're involved in a production, that's really hard. So I  think this time it might be good just to be a nice attendee."  </P> <P> Said Open Festival coordinator Paley: "Not everybody has to be in the festival.  It's important that people consider the context, and the factor that there will  be a lot of competition for audiences.  </P> <P> "But we're helping people look at ways of cutting costs so they can be in the  festival. Ways like being a better producer, sharing costs, finding venues at  less cost, and maybe even scaling down expectations. These things are just as  important as getting grants."  </P> <P> However, noted Paley: "People have to get in gear. There is definitely a  critical time frame here."  </P> <P> The deadline to register for the Open Festival is the end of May, and Paley  said he hopes to compile a final list of events by July. He urges those  interested in information about the Open Festival or who need help finding a  venue to call his office at (213) 315-9444.  </P></p>

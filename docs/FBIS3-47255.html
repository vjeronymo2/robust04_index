These and other policies are contained in a New Year report  to Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae,  made by Kim Kwang-hui, administrator of the Rural Development  Administration (RDA) yesterday [10 January].    The RDA administrator said that agriculture-related research  would be centered on how to strengthen competitiveness of  farming products, a departure from the traditional emphasis on  how to increase farming yield.    To do so, he said, the administration plans to expand the  ratio of R&amp;D funds for the farming sector to the nation's  total  agricultural production from this year's 0.42 percent or 73.3  billion won to 0.88 percent or 175.9 billion won in 1998.    He also reported that production costs of rice per kilogram  would be reduced from the current 862 won to 441 won by 2001,  while rice yield per 10 acres would rise from the present 461kg  to 510kg by 2001.    Production costs of beef per kilogram would decline from the  current 5,152 won to 3,723 won in seven years, he said.    The administration plans to drop production costs of barley  by 52.7 percent from the present 417 won per kilogram to 197 won  by 2001 and those of beans and potatoes by 48.6 percent and 63.7  percent from the present 1,078 won to 554 won and from the  current 342 won to 124 won, respectively.    It also plans to reduce production costs of pork per  kilogram  from the current 1,294 won to 924 won by 2001 and those of red  pepper from the current 3,578 won per kilogram to 1,800 won by  2001.    The RDA also will put priority on the development of  environment-friendly farming technologies while expanding trial  farming-products specialization projects by region.</p>

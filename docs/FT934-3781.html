			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (7): High profits for Thai banks It is rare for commercial banks to be allowed to make such consistently high profits as Thailand's: the top six banks could triple their combined profits between 1990 and 1994. The conservative central bank, the Bank of Thailand, waged a short but surprisingly sharp and public campaign with the 15 listed banks earlier this year over their stunning profits, with central bankers even quoted in the Thai press as accusing the commercial banks of 'ripping off' their customers. Most Thai banks started life either as the financing arms of Sino-Thai business empires or to cater for an institution like the military, as in the case of the Thai Military Bank. Complacent managements preferred to deal with loyal corporate or trade customers rather than trim rates and fight for market share - an attitude which had developed by the 1990s into a highly successful quasi-cartel. The Bank of Thailand has particularly disliked the widening spread between deposit and lending rates, which appeared to hit smaller, non-prime borrowers disproportionately hard. The average spread between all earning assets of the top six banks and all deposits widened from 3.07 per cent in 1991 to 4.74 per cent in the second quarter of 1993, twice what most western bankers would feel lucky to get away with. Unfortunately for the Bank of Thailand its influence over politically well-connected banks is of only limited effectiveness because, in the name of deregulation, it has deprived itself of the usual mechanisms used by central banks to control interest rates. Mr Graham Catterwell, country representative of Crosby Research calls it 'deregulation without competition." The global interest rate decline has relieved some of the pressure on borrowers, but the banks have generally maintained the wide spreads between deposit and lending rates. If earnings growth does slow over the next few years, as many stock market analysts predict, Thailand's 15 listed commercial banks are likely to remain hugely profitable for the foreseeable future. For all its avowed determination to make its banks more competitive the Bank of Thailand has yet to expose local commercial banks (whose retail operations are notoriously inefficient) to real competition from international banks. Most foreign banks are only allowed one branch. This is likely to change in time, as the much trumpeted opening of the offshore banking system known as Bangkok International Banking Facility this year suggests, but not before Thai banks have had time to hone their competitive skills.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             The top six Thai banks' profits in billion baht  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year                      Net   Percentage         Loans   Percentage                        profit       change       (Bt bn)       change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991  .........         17.10         25.6       1,426.2         20.8 1992  .........         27.08         58.3       1,691.6         18.6 1993 estimate           35.41         30.8       2,002.5         18.4 1994 estimate           39.51         11.6       2,368.1         18.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thailand's top six banks with total estimated assets this year of Bt 2,219bn, represent 77.4 per cent of total assets of 15 commercial banks.

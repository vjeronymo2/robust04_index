			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Hostile bid starts a drugs re-evaluation - Paul Abrahams and Richard Waters size up AHP's unthinkable move This week's Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.55bn) bid by American Home Products, the secretive US healthcare and consumer group, for American Cyanamid, sent a shiver through the boardrooms of medium-sized drugs' companies. If successful, the purchase of the US drugs, agrochemicals and consumer products company would be the largest outright acquisition in the pharmaceuticals industry. It is also the first unsolicited bid in the sector since Roche offered Dollars 4.7bn for Sterling in January 1988. Hostile bids in the sector had been viewed as inconceivable: but the rapid deceleration of growth in the pharmaceuticals industry, and the consequent collapse in drugs companies' price/earnings ratios, have made the unthinkable thinkable. This is not the first bid since the slowdown in the sector. In May, Roche made an agreed Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex, but the target was in deep difficulties. Quarterly sales of Naprosyn, its top-selling product, fell 82 per cent after its US patents expired in December. In contrast, American Cyanamid is not in more difficulty than half a dozen others. The 50 per cent premium being offered by AHP sent shares up sharply in a number of other medium-sized groups. In the UK, Wellcome's share price rose 17p to close at 676p; Zeneca's 13p to close at 771p; by lunchtime in New York, Warner-Lambert was trading at Dollars 71 7/8 , up more than 12 per cent from the bid announcement. Upjohn, a repeatedly touted takeover candidate, was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 32 7/8 . Even a comparatively successful mid-sized company such as Schering-Plough saw its shares rise 6.5 per cent to Dollars 66 7/8 . Mr Jonathan Gelles, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said: 'Paying 40-50 per cent premiums is not unreasonable.' The sector remains curiously fragmented, with the top 10 groups controlling only 28 per cent of the Dollars 200bn world market, according to brokers James Capel. For AHP, the deal's industrial logic seems impeccable. The combined group would have drugs sales of about Dollars 7bn, making it the world's fourth largest after Merck, Glaxo and Bristol-Myers Squibb. AHP would be able to broaden its product range, allowing it to sell more drugs to managed care customers. There would be few product overlaps. AHP's drugs arm, Wyeth-Ayerst, is strong in cardiovascular medicine, osteoporosis, anti-depressants, arthritis and oral contraceptives. The strengths of Lederle, American Cyanamid's drugs subsidiary, are antibiotics, cancer and vaccines. But if the industrial logic makes sense, is the price right? The revelation that Mr Jack Stafford, AHP's chairman, has not yet full board approval suggests Tuesday's announcement was rushed. SmithKline Beecham's leaked interest in an assets swap with American Cyanamid probably precipitated AHP's statement. Mr Stafford can partly finance the deal by breaking up American Cyanamid. He would probably sell the animal health businesses. American Cyanamid's agricultural business is among the most profitable in the industry with margins over 17.3 per cent. It is fast-growing, with an niche in soya bean herbicides, The agrochemicals business, the seventh largest in the world with annual sales of about Dollars 1.7bn, could command a premium of one to one and half times sales, according to brokers Wood Mackenzie. The animal health operations, with sales of about Dollars 305m would command a lower premium. A further option is to sell American Cyanamid's generics operations. AHP already has its own generics arm, ESI-Pharma. Earlier this year it acquired Siegfried Pharma, a generics group in Germany, and is in the process of setting up a European generics wing based in the UK. However, the acquisition only really makes sense if Mr Stafford can slash costs. He could cut American Cyanamid's marketing force, primarily aimed at doctors, and rationalise its research and development. Mr Albert Costello, American Cyanamid chairman, has engaged Morgan Stanley to help him consider his response and a possible defence. Given the size of the premium over the market price, the Cyanamid directors would almost certainly face shareholder lawsuits if they rejected the bid out of hand. Mr Stafford's bid may prove to be a turning-point for sentiment towards the pharmaceuticals sector. Roche's 50 per cent premium for Syntex was widely viewed as an eccentric move by a cash-rich Swiss company prepared to make long-term strategic moves. If Mr Stafford has done his sums correctly, AHP's 50 per cent premium may force analysts to change their valuations.

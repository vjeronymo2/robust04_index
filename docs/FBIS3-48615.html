This  is our radio editor's editorial:    Senator John Kerry has many times visited Vietnam and  excavation sites to settle problems relating to POW-MIA or the  missing-in-action issue. He has met with leaders of the  Vietnamese party and Government as well as ordinary Vietnamese  citizens. More than anyone else, he understands and correctly  assesses the Vietnamese people and country. After his recent  visit to Vietnam, he declared in Washington on 25 January that  it is time we lifted the trade embargo because it is no longer  against Vietnam -- thus against us [sentence as heard].    The selection committee on POW/MIA issue of the U.S. Senate  headed by Senator Kerry drew the conclusion after one year of  investigation that there was no evidence of American  prisoners-of-wars living in detention camps in Vietnam. He also  said 123 of 196 discrepancy cases had been solved. So, the four  preconditions for lifting the trade embargo put forth by the  U.S. President have been satisfied. So there is no reason for  the continued U.S. embargo.    Senator Kerry said he would submit a report on his latest  field study in Vietnam and raise that issue with President Bill  Clinton. He also said that besides cooperating with the United  States on the MIA issue, Vietnam was expanding its economic  relations with other foreign countries. That is why the United  States might lose the opportunity for doing business with  Vietnam. Senator Kerry's viewpoint is shared by many  politicians, scholars, and businessmen in the United States and  other countries who have come to Vietnam.</p>

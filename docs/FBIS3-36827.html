			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Pritula Commentary: "There Will Be No Change of </F> Priorities"]    [Text] Hanoi -- Thirty years after the beginning of the  aggression in Vietnam, the U.S. Administration has announced the  lifting of the economic embargo against Hanoi. This is  unquestionably an historic event, as was shown by the  unprecedented number of foreign journalists and diplomats who  attended the press conference given by Le Mai, Vietnamese deputy  foreign minister.    However, despite the significance of Clinton's decision, it  aroused no undue euphoria in Vietnam. Deputy Minister Le Mai,  who read out the Vietnamese Government statement, stressed that  Vietnam welcomes this move, which it considers important and  useful both for the peoples of the two countries and for the  cause of peace in the region. Answering journalists' questions  afterwards, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the lifting of the  embargo will have no effect on the foreign policy doctrine of  Vietnam, which advocates the development of relations with all  countries in the interests of peace and cooperation. In other  words, a cardinal shift of priorities is not on the cards.    But Vietnam does have its priorities. After the collapse of  the socialist community and the disintegration of the Soviet  Union Vietnam turned firmly toward the Asia and Pacific region.  Last year there was a perceptible economic rapprochement with  the West European countries, too. Thus Vietnam's integration  into the system of world economic cooperation has begun without  any participation by the superpowers, one of which meanwhile  lost that status while the other continued to maintain its  anti-Vietnam embargo.    When President Clinton asserts that the lifting of the  embargo is dictated solely by a desire to speed up and complete  the solution of the problem of Americans missing in action  during the Indochina war, there is a definite element of  craftiness in his words. The Vietnamese leadership has  repeatedly stressed that the solution of this problem on  Vietnam's part is purely humanitarian in character and has no  political or economic motives. The search for the remains of  the U.S. MIA's would have continued regardless of the lifting or  extension of the embargo.    In the opinion of many analysts the lifting of the embargo  was dictated more by the economic interests of U.S. business,  for whom Vietnam is the key to Indochina. The dynamic  development of the Vietnamese economy, which is far from  overheating, the pragmatism of that country's leadership, its  great natural and human resources, and, most important, absolute  political stability make Vietnam one of the most attractive  targets for foreign investors today.    Vietnam is available for cooperation with America. But it  must be mutually beneficial cooperation, not one that is  conditioned by any political requirements. I was told that by  the leaders of Hanoi enterprises with whom I have talked in the  past few days. They stressed that they are not expecting  miracles from Washington. In the opinion of some Vietnamese  directors it would be naive, not to say stupid, to change the  economic priorities today. America is a superpower of course,  my interlocutors said, but in the economic sphere there are  other superpowers, such as Japan in Asia. There are also the  new Asian "tigers," whose rapprochement with Vietnam is evident.  In January the Japanese granted Vietnam a credit of 0.5 billion  [currency not specified] on preferential terms and they are now  first among its trading partners. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and  Singapore are top of the list of foreign investors.    The lifting of the U.S. embargo, in my view, demonstrates  first and foremost the pragmatism of Washington politicians, who  know how to listen to the opinions of their country's  enterprises. U.S. business will now begin to try to secure a  position in the promising Vietnamese market, even if it is  somewhat late starting.    It will bring its capital and technologies here for reasons  that are far from philanthropic. But it is more advantageous  for it to come to a still poor and backward Vietnam than to the  vast expanses of a former superpower where, in the words of its  president, the "idol of communism" has already been destroyed.  U.S. businessmen are afraid of wreckers and prefer creators  even if the latter have retained a loyalty to communist  ideology. This, too, is one reason for the lifting of the  anti-Vietnam embargo.</p>

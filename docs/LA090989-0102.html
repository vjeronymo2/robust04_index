			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Confusion is mounting in Irwindale, and it doesn't only involve whether the  Raiders are moving there.  </P> <P> The other day, Mexican flags were supposed to be hung in front of City Hall  alongside triangular banners for the city fiesta honoring Mexico's independence  days (Sept. 15-16).  </P> <P> Somehow, Hungarian flags were hung, instead.  </P> <P> When he learned of the mix-up Friday, Vice Mayor Pat Miranda rushed down to  City Hall with his wife to see what could be done. Nothing, it turned out,  because offices in the San Gabriel Valley city were closed in honor of  California's Admission Day.  </P> <P> "I guess they'll just stay up there until Monday," Miranda said from his car as  he drove off.  </P> <P> While the flag flap sounds as though it were scripted by Woody Allen, there was  speculation that it resulted from a mix-up at the company hired to hang the  flags.  </P> <P> The flags of both countries feature green, red and white stripes. But Hungary's  are horizontal, while Mexico's are vertical. The Mexican flag also has an  eagle-and-serpent emblazoned across the middle.  </P> <P> One woman, talking to a friend outside City Hall, looked at the positive side:  "At least they got the colors right."  </P> <P> History doesn't record whether the first celebrity residents of Beverly Hills,  Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, inspired a youngster to stand out on  Wilshire Boulevard with a sign that proclaimed:  </P> <P> "Map to the Stars' Home."  </P> <P> But, as more entertainment personalities took root there, the guide-hawking  youngsters became more numerous, as did vendors of flowers and fruit.  </P> <P> Terming the proliferation a hazard in the face of mounting automobile traffic,  the Beverly Hills City Council adopted an ordinance this week that bars vending  on public streets and sidewalks.  </P> <P> "It's just too dangerous," Mayor Max Salter said. "I'm not unsympathetic  because as a little kid during the Depression I used to hustle chocolate bars  in New York, running in and out of traffic. But I still look back and wonder  how I avoided getting crushed."  </P> <P> A verbal spat between Little League managers turned into a fistfight at Sherman  Oaks Park on Thursday night and, soon, parents were spilling out of the stands  to join the fracas on the field.  </P> <P> How do you control hyperactive adults? Simple.  </P> <P> The groundskeeper turned on the sprinklers.  </P> <P> End of brawl.  </P> <P> Great L.A. Moments: On this day in 1850, President Millard Fillmore signed a  bill admitting California as the 31st state. There was no celebration that day  in the sleepy little pueblo of L.A., however.  </P> <P> In fact, because there was no telegraph or railroad connecting the town to the  rest of the country, word of statehood didn't reach L.A. for several days.  Perhaps that's when people first started saying that L.A. was in a world of its  own.  </P></p>

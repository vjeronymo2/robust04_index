			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Tokyo takes tougher line with Beijing WHEN Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, starts talking about China, some bureaucrats in Tokyo hold their breath, wondering if the self-consciously candid leader will offend the Chinese government. On hearing that China had resumed nuclear testing on Tuesday, Mr Hosokawa was particularly blunt, unlike past prime ministers from the Liberal Democratic party, saying: 'It can only be described in the words 'very regrettable'.' One senior Japanese official emphasised the prime minister was 'not reading a statement' when he criticised the Chinese action, implying that the prime minister had picked the words himself and had chosen to inject drama into the delivery. Japan has not altered direction on China policy, but the changes in style introduced by Mr Hosokawa and his seven-party coalition mean the government is apparently taking a tougher public line on Chinese nuclear tests, weapons exports and human rights abuses. Last week Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, told his Chinese counterpart, Mr Qian Qichen, during a meeting in New York that Tokyo is watching China's arms export policy very closely and warned him that Japan opposed a resumption of nuclear testing. China is accustomed to hearing these warnings from the US government, and while they are not necessarily new Japanese policies, Beijing officials have noted that the Hosokawa government is far more willing to make clear its concerns about Chinese policies. A separate incident last week gave the Chinese government the impression that the climate had changed in Tokyo. After several days of bickering, the Chinese delegation to the Tokyo International Film Festival stormed back to Beijing because their Japanese hosts planned to screen two 'unauthorised' Chinese films. The films - one called Blue Kite, a painstaking but unflattering profile of Chinese life in the 1950s and 1960s, and the other a rough-and-ready portrait of Beijing youth, Beijing Bastards - were unauthorised because they are at the centre of an ideological argument in China. In the past, fear of offending the Chinese government would have tempted organisers to shelve the screenings, but they went ahead, and Blue Kite won the grand prize at the festival, causing more embarrassment in Beijing. The coming of the Hosokawa coalition has not slowed the economic exchanges. The prime minister yesterday met a delegation from Dalian, the northern Chinese port city, which launched a trade fair in Tokyo to sell its suitability as an investment site. Japanese electronics companies apparently need little convincing. Sanyo announced yesterday it will establish a joint venture in Dalian to make commercial refrigeration equipment and Matsushita is planning to produce video cassette recorders in the city. Japan's image as a high-wage society received a dent yesterday with publication of an official 1.9 per cent rise in average private sector wages for last year, the lowest growth rate in 34 years. Some companies might even have to cut wages next year to ensure full employment if the downturn continues into the tax period starting April 1994, warned Mr Takeshi Nagano, the chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' federation. One leading car group has been reported to be considering a cut in bonuses, while holidays on low pay are said to be under study in the electronics and steel industries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The two warring parties in Yemen have met in New  York for the first time since the outbreak of the conflict. The  northern party was represented by 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani  [minister of planning and development] and the southern party  was represented by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas [prime minister of  the government declared in south Yemen]. The meeting was  attended by the UN envoy to Yemen, Lakhdar Brahimi, who called  on them to set a date for cease-fire. Al-Iryani, however, did  not have full authorization from Sanaa to make such a decision,  as Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said in his statements to reporters  following the meeting.    The meeting was not in vain, because it brought closer the  two sides' viewpoints on the formation of the committee which  will supervise the cease-fire. REUTER cited Abu-Bakr al-'Attas  as saying: We have almost reached an agreement on the Arab,  African, and Asian countries which would participate in this  committee. Al-Iryani suggested that both France and the United  States participate in this committee. Both sides agreed --  through al-Iryani and al- 'Attas -- that the observers operate  under the supervision of Lakhdar Brahimi with the assistance of  a military attache. The obstacle, however, was represented in  the southern party's insistence that the observers operate under  the UN flag. [passage omitted]</p>

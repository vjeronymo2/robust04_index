			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar-beet to displace grain in Portugal Portugal is to make an important shift away from cereals to beet sugar cultivation following government approval for an Es15bn (Dollars 87.7m) Italian-managed beet sugar refinery that will supply more than 20 per cent of the country's sugar consumption. The project involves replacing wheat and maize cultivation in central and southern Portugal with 10,000 hectares of sugar-beet to supply the refinery with 600,000 tonnes a year, enough to produce about 60,000 tonnes of sugar. Portugal at present has only 500ha of experimental beet sugar crops. 'Beet sugar has already proved more profitable than cereals for Portugal and the difference will be even greater when our European Union subsidiaries for cereals are withdrawn in 2001,' said Mr Diamantino Diogo, director of Fenacam, an investor in the refinery. Portugal consumes 310,000 tonnes of sugar a year, produced by two refineries from imported sugar-cane. The country will now fulfil a 60,000-tonne beet sugar production quota awarded when it joined the EU in 1986. Talks are under way in Brussels on whether this beet sugar quota will be added to or subtracted from Portugal's cane sugar production quota. Societa Fondiaria Industriale Romagnola (SFIR), an Italian sugar company, owns 60 per cent of Dai-Sociedade de Investimento Agro-Industrial, the company investing in the new refinery. RAR of Portugal and Tate and Lyle of the UK, the two existing refinery companies in Portugal, each owns 5 per cent. Fenacam and the Portuguese state holding company IPE own 15 per cent each. The EU and the Portuguese government will together provide Es9.8bn in grants for the project in Coruche, central Portugal. SFIR will invest Es3.6bn and manage the plant. The refinery, due to begin production in June, 1995, will employ 224 people directly and create another 1,500 jobs for farm workers and truck drivers.</p>

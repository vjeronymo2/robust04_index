			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Production rise spread evenly FEBRUARY'S RISE in manufacturing output was fairly evenly spread across all sectors, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. The sharp 1.2 per cent increase in February, compared with January, lifted output above the very narrow range it languished in for most of last year, and followed a revised 1.3 per cent month-on-month increase in January. Compared with a year ago, output was 1.5 per cent higher. This was the third successive monthly increase in manufacturing output and led a number of analysts to conclude that, at least in the manufacturing sector, the recession was over. 'It looks as though the turning point was in the fourth quarter of last year, and that we are now in the early stages of an upturn,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London. Output over the three months to February was particularly buoyant in the chemicals and engineering industries. Higher production of pharmaceuticals boosted chemicals output by 2.7 per cent compared with the previous three-month period. In the engineering industries, a 1.6 per cent three-month on three-month rise in output was driven almost entirely by the computer industry where sales have been particularly strong and exports healthy. Engineering was given a further boost by increased output of computer components and electronic consumer goods. There was an unusually steep rise in the output of investment goods. Investment goods production was 2.6 per cent higher in the latest three months, and 4.1 per cent higher than in the same three months a year ago. The CSO said the healthy computer and electrical goods figures were behind the steep increase. Output of the food in-dustries over the past three months was fairly flat, although a bumper sugar harvest boosted production sharply in February. Food industry output rose by 0.2 per cent in the latest three months compared with the three months to November, but rose 3.2 per cent, month-on-month, in February. Production was weakest in minerals output, which rose only 0.1 per cent in the latest three months. In February, however, increased demand for building materials boosted output sharply. Energy output was 2.1 per cent lower in the three months to February compared with the previous three months. Oil output fell 2.4 per cent as winter storms in the North Sea disrupted oil production. Other energy production was 1.9 per cent lower over the same period after mild weather reduced the demand for gas and electricity. Within consumer goods, a rise in the production of durable goods and pharmaceuticals more than offset a drop in car production over the three months to February. During this period, overall output rose by 0.9 per cent, compared with the previous three months. The CSO estimates that manufacturing output is now increasing at a trend growth rate of 3 per cent year-on-year once monthly fluctuations are taken out.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: French Ecu bond offering marks market revival STRONG demand for the French government's first issue of Ecu BTANs (French Treasury notes) yesterday marked a further revival of interest in the market. Only a handful of Ecu bond offerings has emerged since the market collapsed after Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty last June. But the pace of issuance has picked up since the start of the year. The UK, France and Finland, as well as the European Investment Bank and the European Community, have all issued paper this year. However, the French government's commitment to the market is the most crucial to its survival. The only Ecu bond futures contract is based on Ecu OATs, which are generally viewed as the benchmark issues for the whole market. The French government last year reaffirmed its policy of raising 15 per cent of its funding needs through Ecu bond offerings, despite the difficulties besetting the market, but is well ahead of that target so far this year. Dealers said the issue appeared attractively priced, relative to other Ecu issues, and reported strong demand from central banks and UK-based fund managers and some interest from Japanese investors. In addition, the five-year BTAN issue provides investors with the opportunity to play the Ecu bond yield curve, consisting solely of French government debt, from five years to 30 years. The Ecu2bn five-year issue also made good economic sense for the French government. The five-year area is the lowest point of the Ecu bond yield curve. The 7 per cent notes were priced to yield 7.51 per cent, very close to the 7.50 per cent yield of five-year French franc government paper. Until recently, it was more expensive for the government to raise funds in the Ecu rather than the French franc market, which had raised doubts about the government's continued commitment to the market. However, the government plans to add to the five-year BTAN, syndicated by a group of banks led by Paribas and Credit Commercial de France, by auctioning further tranches.</p>

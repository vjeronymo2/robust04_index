			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Arts: Dame Elisabeth Frink, RA - Obituary Elisabeth Frink, who died at the week-end at the age of 62, after a long illness, was unique in her generation as a British woman sculptor of international standing. She was of that immediate post-war generation that was at once formed by and rejected the example of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, committing itself rather to a more openly expressionist sculptural figuration, dynamic in its modelling and urgent in its effect, 'the Geometry of Fear' as the conventional description of the time would have it. But Miss Frink was always her own distinctive self in her work, and her particular interest in animal subjects, which did so much to revive the old and honourable animalier tradition within the context of modern sculpture, always set her apart. Her work for the rebuilt Coventry Cathedral, notably the eagle lecturn, established her national reputation, and she remained thereafter prolific in the production of public sculpture, often within a religious context. Horses and riders, warriors and the monumental male image became her favoured subjects, and as with Moore and his reclining women, it will be by the massive, totem heads, bullet-headed and blankly staring, that her work as an artist will most readily be called to mind.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spanish food side leaves Ashley Grp Pounds 13.8m in loss ASHLEY GROUP incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.8m for the 16 months to December 31 after an exceptional Pounds 5.9m relating to the disposal of its lossmaking Spanish food retailing business, Digsa. The loss compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 13.7m in the 12 months to August 31 1991. Mr James White, chairman, said the group's exposure to the Spanish food retailing business had not proved a happy one. Digsa reported operating losses of Pounds 5m on sales of Pounds 516m. Mr White said the group acquired the Spanish business when Mr Tony Butler, who had experience of UK retailing, had been chief executive. The decision to expand into Barcelona had proved 'an unmitigated disaster'. He added that the downturn in Spain, which was reported in November, had accelerated. Digsa is being acquired by Parafax, a Hong Kong-based company established to acquire retail businesses. Parafax is paying a deferred consideration of Pounds 20m, together with the transfer of Digsa's net debt which has averaged Pounds 33m in the last three months. After six months from completion it will start to pay four instalments of Pounds 5m. In anticipation of the sale, which has to be approved by shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on May 7, an extraordinary provision of Pounds 3.8m has been made for the expected loss on disposal. This is a transfer of Pounds 43.4m of goodwill previously written off against reserves. Interest charges were Pounds 7.27m, largely resulting from the levels of borrowing in Spain at high interest rates. In the previous year interest charged was Pounds 1.4m. If the Digsa sale goes ahead the group will be left with gearing of 52 per cent, representing net debt of Pounds 12m. Distribution of window blinds reported profits of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 6.7m) on turnover of Pounds 47m (Pounds 30m) while the group's plywood and timber activities contributed Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 286,000) on sales of Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.87m). There is no final dividend. Two interim dividends of 0.375p each were paid during the year. Losses per share were 11.6p (7.5p earnings).</p>

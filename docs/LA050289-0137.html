			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> TENTATIVE ACCORD REPORTED ON KARCHER INSIDE TRADING;  </P> <P> ATTORNEYS TELL OF ONE 'HURDLE'  </P> <P> Attorneys for Carl N. Karcher, founder of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, and  six of his family members reached a tentative agreement today to settle  allegations of illegal insider stock trading.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers and attorneys for the Securities and Exchange Commission said  an unspecified "hurdle" still must be resolved before the agreement is final.  But both sides said they are optimistic that the civil case would be settled by  early next week.  </P> <P> The agreement came on the same day that their trial was to begin in U.S.  District Court in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Carl N. Karcher, 14 family members and a company employee were accused by the  SEC in April, 1988, of avoiding losses of at least $310,000 in 1984 by selling  Karcher securities before public disclosure of a 50% drop in earnings.  </P> <P> Carl Karcher and his younger brother, company President Donald F. Karcher, and  their wives were not accused of trading stock, but they were accused of tipping  other family members, through a series of phone calls and discussions, about  the expected drop in profits.  </P> <P> Since the SEC suit was filed, allegations against many of the defendants have  been resolved.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Edward J. Rafeedie issued a summary judgment in September  against Carl Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, finding him guilty of insider  trading. In February, Donald Karcher, his wife and four family members agreed  to pay $187,560 in fines and penalties to end the case against them. And last  month, the judge dismissed the government's civil case against Carl Karcher's  wife, Margaret.  </P> <P> Terms of the latest settlement were not released, but it was said to require  that the defendants repay money that the SEC alleges was gained through insider  trading.  </P> <P> Carl N. Karcher, 72, was not in court today. His lawyer, Wesley G. Howell Jr.,  said he was on a Mediterranean cruise until Saturday but could be reached to  discuss the settlement.  </P> <P> "It looks like the case will be settled," Howell said, adding that his client  sought a settlement because he "has come to appreciate the costs of trial."  </P> <P> SEC attorney John C. Koutsos said the agreement must be approved by SEC  commissioners in Washington, D.C. The Karcher family attorneys said they need  to consult further with their clients.  </P> <P> "There are conditions to be fulfilled," Howell said. "We don't have the  approval from clients on both sides."  </P> <P> The agreement, reached after two hours of discussions in Rafeedie's chambers,  provided for compromises on both sides. It did not give the SEC all the relief  it sought. If the SEC had won at trial, it could have won an injunction against  the defendants as well as orders requiring Carl Karcher to pay up to $996,000.  </P> <P> Additionally, the six relatives could have been required to repay $332,000 in  losses they avoided by trading on inside information, plus a penalty of three  times that amount.  </P> <P> Alvin A. DeShano, director of general accounting at Karcher Enterprises, was  the only one of the civil case defendants to face criminal charges of  securities fraud through insider trading. DeShano, 53, of Orange, will not  stand trial for the civil charges until the related criminal case is resolved.  His criminal trial is scheduled to start May 23.  </P></p>

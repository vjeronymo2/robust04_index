			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / US attacked over death penalty Amnesty International accuses the US of executing innocent and mentally ill people, in a report to be released today, Reuter reports in London. The death penalty in the US was arbitrary, racist and more expensive than imprisonment, the human rights group said. It has written to President Clinton calling for an urgent presidential commission into the death penalty. The London-based group said one man on death row in the US was cleared last year but other innocent people had gone to the electric chair. It criticised the US for executing people in the last five years for crimes committed when they were minors.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Letter: Bad advice on County Hall Sir, How depressing to witness Dr John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics, enthusiastically supported by the FT, urging the government to cancel the sale of County Hall to Shirayama Shokusan company in favour of the LSE. For two such illustrious parties to offer such advice, which is manifestly wrong in financial terms, is extraordinary. The FT and respected economists spend much time urging the government to keep public spending under rigorous control. Then, your leading article of June 16 blandly refers to the proposed unnecessary expenditure of Pounds 120m as 'modest'. We are assured the LSE is the foremost social science university in Britain, perhaps in Europe. If this is so, and if it is to continue to be so, its standing will be a function of the quality of the teaching staff and the students, and not the grandeur of its building. Christopher H Burt, 92 Rue de l'aqueduc, 1050 Brussels</p>

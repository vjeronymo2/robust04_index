			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Nike clothes may be run out of Games NIKE, the US sports shoe and fashion giant, is facing a painful Olympics in Barcelona later this month after a ruling by Spain's highest court that it cannot advertise its clothes in Spain and that its sponsored athletes at the Games may not wear its racy logo. Choosing their moment with deadly precision, two Catalonians have gone to the courts claiming that they have had the Nike name, and an emblem very similar to the US Nike company, registered in Spain since 1932. The court bought their story. The two are said to be asking Dollars 30m (Pounds 15.7m) for 'their' marque. Nike was not available for comment late yesterday but its Spanish representatives have appealed against the ruling by the Constitutional Court (Barcelona branch) on June 30. Their problem is that the wheels of Spanish justice grind hideously slowly and the games are just three weeks away. Expansion, the Spanish newspaper which unearthed the ruling, is this morning quoting local Nike (US) representatives as saying the damage to the company would be 'irreversible and irreparable' if its athletes are not able to sport the company logo during the games. While the ruling does not mean that Michael Jordan and Katrin Krabbe will have to compete without their shoes on, it could mean that TV closeups of their victorious heaving chests will be free of advertising. It also means Nike would have to take down its hoardings in Barcelona and the rest of Spain. Nike was planning to use the Games to help launch a multimillion dollar range of sports clothes in the autumn.</p>

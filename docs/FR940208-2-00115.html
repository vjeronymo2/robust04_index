			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that distribution and service payments relating to any particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class and except that any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by the applicable classes of shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 39(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to make), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on the policies and procedures placed in operation and test of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The prospectus for each Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of each class may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards. Such compliance standards will require that all investors eligible to purchase Institutional Shares will be sold only Institutional Shares, and all investors eligible to purchase Non-Institutional Shares or Financial Shares will be sold only Non-Institutional Shares or Financial Shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees of the Funds with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the Trustees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares other than Institutional Shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Institutional Shares will be offered solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus for Institutional Shares will disclose the existence of the Fund's other classes, and the prospectus for the Fund's other classes will disclose the existence of Institutional Shares and will identify the persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares, except Institutional Shares. Advertising materials reflecting the expenses or performance data for Institutional Shares will be available only to those persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares, except Institutional Shares, separately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

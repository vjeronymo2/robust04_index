Cola Chairman Chao Shou-po said that the new regulation will  go into effect March 16.    Previously, the COLA allowed public construction works to  rely entirely on foreign laborers, but an easing of Taiwan's  labor shortage has brought more domestic workers into the labor  market. The average labor shortage rate in Taiwan was only 2.91  percent in 1992, down from 5.16 percent in 1987. The labor  shortage rate measures the percentage of unfilled positions in  local firms.    Meanwhile, despite protests from workers' groups Wednesday  [2  March], COLA vice director of the labor-management relations  department, Lai Ching-fong, reaffirmed COLA's decision to deport  two Thai workers who the COLA said led a recent strike in  central Taiwan.    The workers groups had requested that COLA overturn its  decision to deport the two Thai workers. They also asked the  COLA to provide interpreters for Filipino, Thai, Indonesian and  Malaysian workers to give the workers a way of voicing their  complaints.    Some 500 Thai workers at Taichung's Cheng Tai Yi  Construction  Co., went on strike last week, marking the first foreign  workers' strike since the introduction of foreign labor to  Taiwan.</p>

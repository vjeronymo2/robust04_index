			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Zelenetskiy, commercial counselor at </F> the Russian Embassy in Bratislava, by Lubo Rabay; place and date  not given: "Deficits Are Not All the Same; Is Our Balance of  Trade With Russia Really That Awful?"]    [Excerpt] According to Slovak statistics, Slovak imports  from Russia reached approximately $1.25 billion (41.2 billion  korunas) last year. In the same period, Slovakia exported to  Russia industrial products worth only $260 million--that is,  less than 8.6 billion korunas [Sk]. A comparison of these two  figures produces a frightening Slovak trade deficit of over Sk32  billion. Is the deficit really so awful? Yuriy V. Zelenetskiy,  economic counselor at the Embassy of the Russian Federation to  the Slovak Republic, has a somewhat different view of the data.    [Rabay] You are supposed to have claimed that Slovakia's  actual trade deficit is several times lower than the official  statistics suggest. How is that possible?    [Zelenetskiy] The problem lies in the statistical method.  We are of the opinion that, for the sake of objectivity,  Slovak-Russian and Russian-Slovak trade relations should be  assessed within the framework of the balance of payments rather  than that of the trade balance. Only in this way will we arrive  at an objective picture.    [Rabay] Does the balance of trade perhaps not include  payment relations?    [Zelenetskiy] Miraculously, it does not. The balance of  trade is based only on so-called customs statistics, which only  register the physical movement of merchandise across borders.  It does not include a whole range of commercial services that  Slovakia provides to Russia on Slovak territory, and other facts.    [Rabay] But can something that never leaves our country be  called an export?    [Zelenetskiy] Customs statistics do not permit that. It is  possible using the balance of payments, however. According to  the customs statistics, Slovakia really exported only about $260  million worth of merchandise to Russia last year. However,  during the same period, the Slovak gas industry provided Russia  with approximately $340 million worth of services in the transit  of natural gas to West Europe. Russia paid for these services  in kind--in gas deliveries (according to the bilateral  agreement, Russia supplied us in this way with 3.7 billion cubic  meters of natural gas, which is two-thirds of Slovakia's annual  consumption--editor's note). In the customs statistics, this  volume figures as an import because the gas was physically  imported. From the viewpoint of the balance of payments,  however, this can hardly be qualified other than as $340 million  worth of exports by the Slovak gas industry to Russia. If you  included just this sum in the mutual balance of trade, the ratio  in Slovakia's disfavor would change from five to one to two to  one.    [Rabay] Looking at it from this angle, however, even the  rest of the gas that Slovakia imports from Russia, as  compensation for deliveries of capital goods in the 1980's,  looks more like exports than imports.    [Zelenetskiy] Exactly. This concerns deliveries as a  compensation for past credits, according to the Yamburg  Agreement. Slovakia does not have to pay for this gas, the  annual value of which is between $120 and $150 million. This  sum must again be added to Slovak exports. These exports had  actually been effected in the past, and the gas supplied to  Slovakia today is only a repayment of credit in kind. From the  viewpoint of the balance of trade, last year's $110 million  worth of deliveries of Russian special equipment belong to the  same category because a part of former Czechoslovakia's claims  [in Russia] that fell due to Slovakia was repaid by them. As  you see, Slovakia's actual trade deficit has shrunk again--to  approximately $400 million.    [Rabay] We have not yet discussed oil purchases....    [Zelenetskiy] The volume of oil supplied by Russia exceeds  Slovakia's need for oil products. According to unofficial data,  Slovnaft [Slovakia's sole oil refinery] exports about 40 percent  of its output, for which it receives foreign exchange, with  which it pays for the oil. And there is yet another aspect.  Crude oil that we export to the Czech Republic is being handed  over to the Czech partner at the Ukrainian-Slovak border. The  Czech partner pays Slovakia for the transit of this oil across  the territory of Slovakia, and, once again, this agreement is  advantageous for Slovakia. Therefore, if we wanted  realistically to assess Slovakia's trade deficit last year with  Russia, we would arrive at a sum of only $200 to $250 million.  [passage omitted]</p>

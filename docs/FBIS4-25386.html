			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said here today in reply  to a reporter's question that we must not lose the direction of  trying to solve the DPRK nuclear issue as it will be very  difficult to step back once we have lost it.    Shen Guofang said: The direction is that of safeguarding  peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and promoting its  denuclearization. China hopes that all the parties concerned  work toward these two basic goals, will continue to seek a  peaceful way to properly solve the DPRK nuclear issue, and will  refrain from practices that may intensify the contradiction.    Shen said: There is still room and the possibility of a  proper solution despite the present difficulties with the DPRK  nuclear issue. Therefore, China does not favor the involvement  of the UN Security Council in the DPRK nuclear issue and does  not agree to sanctions against the DPRK because that will push  all sides concerned toward the brink of confrontation, which may  cause consequences no side wishes to see.    Shen said: China is not clear about the details of the DPRK  nuclear development program, and it is hard for China to predict  what moves the DPRK will make once sanctions are imposed. But  sanctions are not a good method. Experience in solving  international issues tells us that sanctions often intensify  contradictions and lead to conflict.    He stressed: There are many complicated factors in the DPRK  nuclear issue. Two things are very important in solving this  problem: Patience and a certain amount of time. China hopes  all the parties concerned remain calm and maintain restraint and  do not close the door on negotiations so easily. Efforts over  the last year show that there will be progress if talks between  the four corners and the three sides are resumed, and a crisis  if talks stop.    Shen Guofang also revealed details about this morning's  working meeting between the Chinese and ROK foreign ministers,  saying that the two sides exchanged their views on the situation  in great depth. There is some common ground: They both hope  that the trend toward peace and stability on the Korean  peninsula can be maintained, neither wants to see any serious  consequences, and they agreed that further efforts are required  to solve the DPRK nuclear issue.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs' pay freeze under attack Pounds 30,854 - should be opposed, Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow chief secretary, told the Commons last night. She called for the agreement linking rises in MPs' pay to that of middle-ranking civil servants to continue. Under that agreement, MPs would receive an increase of 3.9 per cent from January. The allowance MPs receive for their office costs was increased by more than Pounds 10,000 last July. Conservative MPs will be subject to a two-line whip on the proposal, due to be debated on Wednesday, while Labour backbenchers will be allowed a free vote. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, said yesterday that the party leadership's intention was to abstain, but that might be reviewed in the light of the terms of the government motion. Ms Harman's move came during the resumed debate on the chancellor's Autumn Statement in response to Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. Ms Harman recalled that the link with civil servants' pay was made to stop the remuneration of MPs being a 'political football'. She challenged Tory MPs 'baying for a pay freeze' to observe the 1.5 per cent ceiling set by the government for public-sector workers and to refuse increases in the fees they received from directorships. She was joined by other Labour MPs in arguing that the growing number of redundancies underlined the failure of the Autumn Statement to provide the stimulus needed for for recovery. Mr Portillo maintained that the Autumn Statement would create the conditions for a return of confidence and would remove the barrier to growth. Mr John Townend, MP for Bridlington and chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, warned that unless there was another 'assault' on public spending next year, the alternative of an increase in taxation would have to be faced. He urged ministers to remember what had happened to departing US President George Bush after his pledge not to raise taxes, and warned them that the Conservatives had won the election because voters believed they would not put up taxes. Mr Nick Brown, in the final speech from the Labour front bench, emphasised that the increase in unemployment was the largest single factor affecting consumer confidence. An attempt by Labour to condemn the Autumn Statement was defeated by 55 votes (322-267). A second attempt by Labour to attack the government's policy came to a premature end when the party's whips failed to appoint tellers for the vote. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, ruled that the division could not take place, which resulted in a motion approving the Autumn Statement being carried without challenge.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: New issues get wider airing PRIVATE investors often are keen to invest in new issues, writes Philip Coggan. Apart from getting in on the ground floor of a developing company, there is the chance to make a quick profit if the shares move to a premium. Often, though, it is difficult to find out about new issues in time. Many companies come to the stock market via a placing, with only institutions or the selected clients of a few brokers getting the chance to buy shares. By the time small investors hear about it, the shares have moved to a premium in the after-market. Earlier this year, we reported on one scheme, the New Issue Register, which was designed to get round this problem. Now Sharelink, the Birmingham-based stockbroker, is launching Sharefinder, a service which will include a New Issues Bulletin published six times a year with details of present and future new issues. A telephone hotline and special application service will also be available for those who want to buy shares in the issues covered. The package costs Pounds 25 a year. For details, ring 021-236 2126. Meanwhile, the New Issue Register has produced its own journal, the New Issue Reporter, with details of companies coming to market. Those who join the register will be asked to pay a Pounds 75 fee once they have been offered the chance to invest in an issue.

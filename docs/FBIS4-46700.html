			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Smaha: "The Steal of the Century? PRYVATNA </F> SPRAVA Invites a Public Debate in the Pages of VECHIRNIY KYYIV  by Officials of the State Property Fund and the Anti-Monopoly  Committee Concerning Privatization in Ukraine"]    [Text] Wonderful are Thy works, O Lord! Mass  privatization in Ukraine is still in the talking stage. And at  this crucial moment, its main character--the State Property  Fund--sends the draft "Ukraine Law on Changes to the Ukraine Law  `On the Privatization of State Enterprises'" to the Supreme  Council and the President for signature. The bill reads: "The  Supreme Council decrees that the following changes be made to  Paragraph 1, Article 8 of the Law: remove the words `citizens of  Ukraine.'"    That passage of the Law reads: The right to  privatization shall be enjoyed by citizens of Ukraine, foreign  citizens, and stateless persons.... So it looks as if the State  Property Fund does not want fellow-citizens. They are just in  the way. But why?    Let us recall that the State Property Fund soon plans to  privatize 150 items of state property that it has designated and  to run an advertising campaign inviting people to invest their  certificates in them.    Is this bad or good? "What associations does the number 150  call up for you?", television viewers are asked. Let us reflect  on this. There are 76,000 [as printed; probably should be 6,000]  state enterprises in Ukraine. Formally they are matched by  citizens' 52 million privatization certificates. How many of  those 52 million vouchers do you think the State Property Fund  will attract to those 150 enterprises? And how many vouchers  will be left over for privatizing the 5,850 (approximately)  enterprises that are left over?    Do you see? Try to imagine how much your voucher will  depreciate when millions of people try to invest theirs in the  "first" wave of privatization. Everybody is aware that after  that there will be a "second" and "third" wave. At that point,  the State Property Fund is going to need intermediate agents.  The list of them has already been designated by state decision.  It is the agent's aim, of course, to make a profit. Therefore a  trust (which is what the intermediate agency is called) will  obtain from citizens both their certificates and the right to  exercise ownership. Let us emphasize that it is their lawful  right. Hence, the "first" wave of privatization as planned by  the State Property Fund will cut the price of the vouchers,  while the "second" and "third" waves will turn things over  entirely to the financial sharks.    We are assured that a certificate is worth a million  karbovantsy [Ukrainian rubles]. V. Pylypchuk, a member of the  former Supreme Council Presidium, reminds us that there have  already been two indexations of fixed assets--by a factor of  11.5 and a factor of 40. The product of those figures should  form an index by which it is useful to multiply the property  value of the certificate. Having performed these simple  operations, we divide the resulting figure by the dollar's  exchange rate (40,000) and get 4,040 dollars. Even that,  however, is not the market value of the certificate. An ordinary  bathhouse in Odessa was sold at auction for 3 billion  karbovantsy after a starting price of 1 million--a 3,000-fold  increase. Hence, our correction for the market value (2.5 times)  is maximally understated. In fact, the value of our Ukrainian  voucher is vastly more than 10,000 dollars! (which,  incidentally, has already been reported in VECHIRNIY KYYIV). If  a person knows the value of his voucher, he will come to respect  it more. And he will invest it wisely, and not just give it away  to the first person he meets.    Of course, citizens who try to do these calculations, and  organizations which help them do it, trusts which have their own  views on privatization, are undesirable to those who aspire to  destatization for their own sakes. These latter were especially  displeased by the newspaper PRYVATNA SPRAVA, which tried to  explain people's rights to them and their chance to acquire  their fair share of state property. In addition to a series of  "accusatory" articles in the controlled press and the  above-mentioned draft amendment to the law, Anti-Monopoly  Committee Chairman Oleksandr Zavada himself sent a letter to the  Deputy Chairman of the Board of SPPU [the Union of Private  Entrepreneurs of Ukraine] (the newspaper is its organ)  concerning the start of investigations into dishonest  competition with respect to anti-monopoly legislation.    A spicy detail: this was done at the initiative of persons  having a particular interest--the Association of Securities  Dealers. I have before me a copy of KOMERSANT UKRAYINY (No 13,  March). It has a report of a meeting of the Association (I  remind you that [a] this is not a state body, and [b] it is an  association of businessmen). I quote: "The latest meeting of the  Association of Securities Dealers held a preliminary discussion  of spheres of control. The advertising [of PRYVATNA SPRAVA and  the SPPU--editor] will have to be overseen by the Anti-Monopoly  Committee." Think about that: a civilian commercial organization  is directing a state body--the Anti-Monopoly Committee--to  "oversee" someone's advertising. Where does the Association get  off acting like a Masonic lodge in terms of influence on a state  apparatus! Let us continue the quote. "The State Property  Fund (FDM) was directed [emphasis mine--V. S.] to submit a  proposal to the Provisional Commission of the Supreme Council on  an amendment to repeal the paragraph on creating purchasers's  unions based on residence." Which was done.    True to its obligations, the FDM did on 1 April submit the  appropriate legislative initiative to the Supreme Council (see  above). In effect, this amendment would signal "privatization  for foreigners," because the FDM (the letter to the Supreme  Council was signed by Kaptsov, the FDM's acting chairman) was  undertaking to remove citizens of Ukraine as subjects of the  privatization process. After that legislative transaction, you  and I were left with just one option--the trust. And that is  exactly what they are waiting for. The FDM's bureaucrats have  faithfully kept their promise to the dealers.    A slightly awkward question arises. Exactly how are they  beholden to the latter? And what about the rules of behavior of  a state employee? In a civilized country, at any rate, merely  publishing a bureaucrat's promises to a businessman would at  least call for resignation and prosecution.    It would be hard to assess it otherwise. The SPPU warned  owners of privatization certificates against overly trusting  civilian intermediary agencies and trust companies, which, as we  know, are formed primarily to make a profit. The purpose of  PRYVATNA SPRAVA is different. It is concerned with creating the  material base for local business in Ukraine.    The privatization option proposed by PRYVATNA SPRAVA calls  for creating purchasers' partnerships all over, based on  residence. It is this paragraph of the Law on Privatization that  the intermediaries are against, along with the bureaucrats they  have "recruited." The SPPU's Privatization Center is turning  over to them a data bank of enterprises that are being  privatized in a given locality.    PRYVATNA SPRAVA has never taken a single privatization  certificate from citizens, nor does it intend to.    All of this completely legal activity is spelled out in the  "Procedures for Creating and Registering Purchasers' Companies  in the Privatization Process." The FDM and the Anti-Monopoly  Committee should not oppose it, they should be glad that the  privatization process is becoming available to everyone. Its  operation is simple: citizens join together to find the most  profitable ways to invest their privatization certificates. The  firms help them according to the PRYVATNA SPRAVA model. They do  not buy up vouchers directly. They have just one aim: to help  people invest their certificates most usefully. Naturally, the  service has to be paid for, but anyone dealing with PRYVATNA  SPRAVA is not going to lose the main thing--the right to own the  property he receives.    I don't want to name specific enterprises, although there  are  many of them in Kiev, but directors are now creating closed-type  joint stock companies for themselves and then transferring  workers to the night shift while providing no work for them.  They are happy to sign discharge papers, because a voucher,  according to the company charter, stays with the enterprise. And  new workers will not be proprietors but ordinary hired labor,  that you can do with as you will. The most far-sighted  politicians and economists can see this.    When the scandalous facts of the exclusion of citizens from  privatization became known to the press, the FDM started to  "backpedal." The letter to the Supreme Council, they said, was  not authorized by any Fund official. Those guilty of technical  policy [!] have been punished. At a press conference, FDM  Administration Chief A. Otchenash had this to say: "The girls  typed the wrong thing." It isn't the citizens of Ukraine that  the FDM is trying to prevent from taking part in privatization,  as they say, but rather the purchasers' companies provided for  by existing legislation.    Why is it that the purchasers' companies stick like a bone  in  the throat of the Fund during the privatization of state  property? Let us recall that there are several ways to destatize  property.    First, when the state itself directly undertakes the entire  process. What that leads to, we know. Second, the process is  undertaken by an intermediary--the trust company. Naturally,  "XYZ promises to turn your voucher into gold." But Naftoinvest  in Russia in bankrupt, and 500,000 citizens who entrusted their  vouchers to it don't know what to do. The third option is to  create a purchasers' company as provided for by law.    It is astonishing how newspaper journalists who pretend to  leadership in the economic press can pour abuse on this new and  progressive endeavor, without even taking a look at the law. If  that is so hard to do, we repeat that the Ukrainian investment  company PRYVATNA SPRAVA has never involved itself in any  activity with privatization papers. And the activities of the  SPPU's Privatization Center PRYVATNA SPRAVA have nothing to do  with intermediary agency and are not subject to licensing.  According to Article 6 of the Ukrainian Law on Privatization of  the Property of State Enterprises, the following are subjects of  privatization: state privatization agencies, purchasers,  sellers, and intermediaries. Article 8 of that same Law states  that the FDM "shall issue licenses to intermediaries." Article 8  defines purchasers' companies as purchasers, and they do not  need licenses.    It is hard not to agree with the comments of V. Lesin, the  Chairman of the Kiev Chapter of the Liberal-Democratic Party of  Ukraine, concerning this story:    "For three years now, the State Property Fund has been going  through the motions of privatization while actually making it  available only to a narrow circle of people. Of the results of  its activities we can say confidently that it is obstructing the  Law on Privatization....    "Under these conditions, the Liberal-Democratic Party of  Ukraine (LDPU) and the SPPU initiated mass privatization in the  interests of all the citizens of Ukraine. The initiative was  supported by the PRYVATNA SPRAVA company. All over Ukraine,  including Kiev, lawful purchasers' companies began to be set up  on the basis of residence. Their activities began to encroach  upon the interests of certain financial groups and nomenklatura  bureaucrats. A flood of disinformation, lies, and slander was  launched. It took on the character of a campaign directed,  ultimately, against the citizens of Ukraine, who want to dispose  of their privatization certificates as they see fit, without  intermediaries.    "You see, if the citizens of Ukraine become owners--that is,  if they obtain the share of state property they have coming to  them, then we will be living in a different kind of state where  the main thing will be to work for oneself today rather than for  some mythical wellbeing in the future. The Kiev Chapter of the  LDPU vigorously protests the legislative initiative of the FDM."    Also very eloquent are the words of the famous economist  Volodymyr Pylypchuk, a people's deputy to the new convocation of  the Supreme Council.    A reporter asked him these questions:    "How do you assess the latest `legislative' initiatives of  the FDM?"    "It is utter nonsense to exclude the citizens of Ukraine  from  privatization. The Supreme Council would not allow it.    "And now the bureaucrats are saying that the proposal was a  mistake made by technical workers and are preparing a new one  that would make purchasers' companies based on residence  unlawful.    "The FDM's games are its death throes. Right now the FDM and  the Anti-Monopoly Committee are our most passive structures.  Compare their activities to similar ones in Russia.  Voucher-based privatization there is nearing completion. The  final hundred days. With us, it's the first 150 enterprises. The  work has hardly even started. In other words, they're a pack of  do-nothings."    We have to forgive this eminent politician his harsh words.  But even the most prudent words cannot explain something that is  incomprehensible. The head of the PRYVATNA SPRAVA chapter in  Mykolayevo, Valentin Kryvosheyev, has been commanded by the  local department of the FDM to have all 700 members of the  purchasers' company report for registration; this is in conflict  with the law. The FDM is not an organization that grants  permission but one that registers. And, according to the law,  its departments are supposed to register purchasers' companies  within a 10-day period. Why isn't this being done?    So far, neither the FDM nor the Anti-Monopoly Committee have  distinguished themselves by anything except abusive and illegal  letters to the press and attempts to thwart the new endeavor by  any means possible. And it is too important to allow it to  drift. It is a matter, fundamentally, of the fate of Ukraine. Is  privatization here to serve the nomenklatura or the people? Are  we to create a class of moneybags and a mass of disenfranchised  beggars, or are we to lay that which is the the backbone of any  civilized society--a large stratum of small proprietors?    These are the most acute questions on the agenda. This is  why  the editors of VECHIRNIY KYYIV, true to its democratic  traditions, intend to organize a debate of officials of the FDM,  the Anti-Monopoly Committee, and PRYVATNA SPRAVA. Let the  parties concerned use these pages to express their views on how  to solve the problem which, we can say without exaggeration,  will determine the fate of Ukraine.    We also invite readers to express their thoughts. Please  write to us. We will not allow our great and long-suffering  people to be cheated anymore....    PRYVATNA SPRAVA Is Legal. The Actions of the State  Property Fund Are in Conflict With the Constitution.    The Ukrainian Supreme Council Control Commission for Matters  of Privatization has examined the FDM's representation regarding  the activities of PRYVATNA SPRAVA with regard to the creation of  purchasers' companies on the basis of citizens' residence.    The Commission has stated that the measures being taken by  PRYVATNA SPRAVA to create purchasers' companies are not in  conflict with Ukrainian laws on privatization.    A news item on this issue was submitted to the Press Service  of the Supreme Council on 19 April 1994 by Yu. L. Kamyanin  [surname unclear], the head of the Commission's secretariat. But  for reasons that are unclear, the document was not made public.  Instead, certain newspapers published FDM materials which  groundlessly vilified PRYVATNA SPRAVA and the Union of Private  Entrepreneurs of Ukraine.    The Commission also examined the FDM's proposal to exclude  citizens of Ukraine from the list of subjects of privatization  of state property as designated in Article 8 of the Ukraine Law  "On the Privatization of the Property of State Enterprises."  That proposal has been declared to be in conflict with the  Constitution and laws of Ukraine and cannot be endorsed as a  legislative initiative.

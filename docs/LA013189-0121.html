			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABRAMS ALWAYS SEEKING NEW FRONTIERS  </P> <P> "I have always been inspired to look for better ways to do basic things within  myself and (by) a desire to deal with music itself so style is not something  that is a determinant," declared Muhal Richard Abrams, the acclaimed  pianist-composer who opens a six-night engagement at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill  in Hollywood tonight.  </P> <P> "Music itself is the determinant (factor) so I may be found in a blues suit or  I may be found in a new music suit. I like a lot of things so it's very  difficult for me to settle in one place and not investigate different things."  </P> <P> Abrams, 58, is widely credited as the catalyst for the 1965 formation of the  Assn. for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, the influential Chicago-based  collective with a roster of alumni -- saxophonist Anthony Braxton and the Art  Ensemble of Chicago, among others -- constituting a virtual "Who's Who" of the  last two decades' experimental jazz musicians.  </P> <P> The Catalina performance is his Los Angeles-area appearance since the 1982 Kool  Jazz Festival. He will be performing with a stellar quartet featuring John  Purcell (reeds), Fred Hopkins (bass) and Andrew Cyrille (drums).  </P> <P> Abrams' varied music has ranged from solo piano performances to compositions  for large ensembles, and pieces with a near-chamber music orientation to  straight-ahead homages to Swing Era bandleaders and Chicago bluesmen. He  relishes the challenge of working in multiple musical contexts.  </P> <P> "You fit the situation to the situation, so to speak," said Abrams from his New  York home. "If you're dealing with a trio -- three colors -- you mix those  three colors. You don't think in terms of other colors being missing; you deal  with that which is there.  </P> <P> Abrams, a Chicago native, began his professional music career in 1948. During  the '50s, he played behind numerous jazz artists in Chicago and recorded one  album with his own MJT+3 group.  </P> <P> With his compositions growing more adventurous and no outlets for performing  them in Chicago, Abrams formed his Experimental Band in 1961. That unit  gradually evolved into the Assn. for Creative Musicians, which was officially  formed in May, 1965.  </P> <P> "The collective idea was what we set out to accomplish, in the sense that it  would showcase the individuals and allow them a venue for projecting their  invention," Abrams said. "It started as a collection of people who felt a need  to build a forum to present things to humanity that would otherwise have  probably gone unnoticed."  </P> <P> Abrams' first recording as a leader, "Levels and Degrees of Light," was  released on Delmark in 1967. His next album, the 17th of his career, features  an 18-piece group and will be released later this year on the Black Saint  label. And Abrams continues the personal musical studies that reach back to the  earliest jazz piano pioneers.  </P> <P> "How can you ever finish studying Art Tatum and James P. Johnson?" he asked. "I  look in every nook and cranny because I can never hope to bring it all out of  there so I take what I can take and use it in the best way I can. It's a  continuum that is going on -- I'm sure they did the same thing."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By "Post Correspondent" David Wallen in London] </F>   [Text] The European Parliament has issued a ringing  condemnation of China's human rights abuses, urging guarantees  for the liberties of Hong Kong and calling on the European Union  (EU) not to improve links with Beijing until there is an  improvement. It will be forwarded to Beijing and the  governments of European member states over the next few days and  could be used to block future trade agreements between the EU  and China.    The 33-item resolution, passed without opposition, condemns  labour camps, and calls for the release of political prisoners,  the ending of the sale in Europe of goods produced by forced  labour and the establishment of a multi-party state. It also  regrets visits by senior Western politicians such as Chancellor  Dr. Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister John Major.    Although the motion is mainly advisory and has no  legislative  weight, it could turn into a considerable embarrassment to EU  governments, including Britain, anxious to step up political and  trade links.    "It is a reminder to ministers of the concern of Europe's  elected politicians about human rights issues and they should  not forget that," said a parliament spokesman in Strasbourg  yesterday. "It is a warning to them that they should not  negotiate trade agreements without thinking of these issues."    He warned that the Parliament had blocked trade agreements  with countries including Morocco and Syria in the past because  of concern over human rights and had the power to do so with  China.    Although the Parliament has a say on trade deals the real  power within the EU is still the European Council -- its  executive wing comprised of government ministers. But  politicians and groups around the world opposed to Chinese human  rights abuses will be able to turn to the motion as the first  pan-European democratic view on how links with China should be  viewed.    Foreign policy within the EU remains the province of the  Council and of national governments although under the  Maastricht Treaty the Parliament's influence is growing.    The resolution says economic reforms should be accompanied  by  "the gradual introduction of internationally recognised social  standards" and reminds China that it is a signatory to the  Universal Declaration on Human Rights. It "reaffirms its  condemnation of the use of the death penalty and torture" and  "calls on the Chinese Government to release all persons whose  only crime is practising their religion".    It goes on to express "the hope that the Chinese legal  system  can become genuinely independent of the political authorities  and able to guarantee citizens the right to legal counsel and to  a fair trial". It condemns the "physical and moral pressure  exerted on women to have abortions and the widespread practice  of infanticide, especially of baby girls".    The resolution expresses concern about conditions in Chinese  prisons where it claims prisoners suffer through isolation and  inadequate medical care.    Most of the resolution is extremely condemnatory.    It goes on to express regret about the way the lack of human  rights and democracy in China makes it necessary to maintain  restrictions on the number of official visits. It says that any  "further expansion of co-operation" between China and the EU  should be accompanied by the ending of the system of "lao gai"  or labour camps and the freeing of political prisoners along  with respect for "the human rights and fundamental freedoms of  the people of Tibet. This should be accompanied by the opening  of negotiations with the Dalai Lama."    But it is not all negative. While condemning some official  visits, it supports professional and academic exchanges and  approves technical and financial schemes. It also welcomes the  normalization of relations between China and Vietnam, Russia,  India and other countries in the region.    It calls on China to put pressure on North Korea over its  nuclear programme, yet condemns arms sales and nuclear testing.    The motion is the result of the first report to be drawn up  on EU-Chinese relations since the Tiananmen Square massacre and  is accompanied by a lengthy appraisal of events within the  country, its economy and the party hierarchy. It has not  concentrated on Hong Kong to any extent although it stresses  that links with China must include "securing agreement that the  human rights of the people of Hong Kong and Macao are respected  after these territories return to Chinese sovereignty".    The Parliament says it "hopes that the planned reunification  with Hong Kong and Macao in line with the principle `one  country, two systems' will be accompanied by every possible  democratic guarantee".    The resolution was drawn up by the Parliament's Committee on  Foreign Affairs and Security under the guidance of an Italian  Green MEP Maria Aglietta.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE CREDIBILITY ON TRIAL AFTER SUSPECT O.C. CASES  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Investigator Robert Davis testified that on the day Aissa Wayne and  her boyfriend were attacked, Wayne's ex-husband, Dr. Thomas Gionis, was in his  limousine when calls from a private detective who set up the assault came in on  the car phone. He was sure about that key piece of evidence, he said, because  Gionis' chauffeur had told him so.  </P> <P> Then, Davis fell into the maw. Defense attorney John D. Barnett confronted him  with a tape recording of his conversation with the chauffeur. No statement  placing Gionis in the limo was on the tape.  </P> <P> Davis squirmed in his seat. Gionis winked at the defense staff.  </P> <P> Thursday, the jury deadlocked 9 to 3 to convict and the holdout jurors said  they thought Davis was not truthful on the stand.  </P> <P> The devastating cross-examination in the Gionis case is not an isolated example  of a law enforcement officer being impaled on his or her own words by a skilled  defense attorney. Police have been there before.  </P> <P> Blame it on overwork, honest mistakes, lapse of memory or just plain lying, the  credibility of Orange County law enforcement officers and the quality of their  investigations have been called into question in a number of local cases,  including some high-profile ones.  </P> <P> Although the vast majority of police are honest and professional, serious  errors and inaccurate statements going to the heart of guilt or innocence have  occurred in cases ranging from the simple writing of traffic tickets to major  felony matters and civil lawsuits.  </P> <P> "We see it a fair amount of times," said Jack Earley, a longtime Orange County  lawyer and spokesman for California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a statewide  association of defense counsel. "In the perfect system, police should gather  evidence without necessarily assuming guilt or innocence, but our justice  system has not evolved that way."  </P> <P> "It's the one thing we really have to protect against," said Laguna Beach  Police Chief Neil J. Purcell, president of the Orange County Chiefs' and  Sheriff's Assn. "We must assure the public and the judicial system that our  integrity and honesty is unquestionable. No defendant is worth an officer lying  or stretching the truth. . . . Like Jack Webb says, 'Just the facts, ma'am.' "  </P> <P> Five days a week, in scores of courtrooms across the county, the accuracy of  police officers is routinely challenged by defense lawyers, scrutinized by  judges and weighed by jurors.  </P> <P> Their work holds up in most cases, but in some it does not, and the mistakes  are costly considering the power that police officers have over the average  person. Those charged with crimes based on inaccurate statements or shoddy  investigation must fight the stigma of arrest and endure financial hardship  until they are either acquitted or the matter is dismissed.  </P> <P> In civil cases, plaintiffs alleging police misconduct have been removed from  lawsuits because of erroneous statements by law enforcement officials. That  happened to George Wright, a Rancho Santiago College instructor, who alleged in  a federal civil rights suit in the mid-1980s that Orange County Sheriff Brad  Gates improperly investigated him because he was a political opponent.  </P> <P> Gates and two deputies said in sworn court affidavits that they never ordered  or participated in the surveillance of Wright and other department critics.  Partly based on those statements, Wright was thrown out as a plaintiff.  </P> <P> When evidence to the contrary later surfaced, Gates and the deputies recanted  their statements in sworn depositions and in court in 1988. Federal authorities  investigated for the possibility of perjury. No charges resulted.  </P> <P> "It was a bonehead mistake," said Sheriff's Lt. Randall Blair, who was linked  to the surveillance of Wright and a newspaper reporter. Gates said he honestly  believed there had been no investigation and blamed the error on inaccurate  information from subordinates.  </P> <P> Said Wright: "I had a considerable amount of money invested in that lawsuit  when I was kicked out of it."  </P> <P> Wright did not rejoin the lawsuit, but complained to the FBI. The other  plaintiffs, including a former Orange County Municipal Court judge, settled the  case for $375,000, a portion of which they gave to Wright even though he had  been dismissed from the suit.  </P> <P> Similar inaccuracies have affected other cases:  </P> <P> * In a traffic matter handled by defense lawyer Ronald Brower, police said  there was a stop sign where there wasn't and the officer's report said the  streets formed an intersection when they actually ran parallel.  </P> <P> * In two recent felony cases, police ignored fingerprints that would have  exonerated the accused well before the cases were filed, according to the  county public defender's office. One case was dismissed; the other ended in  acquittal.  </P> <P> * In another major felony prosecution, an Anaheim officer whose gunfire wounded  a baby earlier this year said in sworn testimony that the suspect had pointed a  gun at him twice. Three witnesses, including the child's mother and an observer  in a police helicopter, said they did not see a gun pointed at the officer  before he fired. A charge of assault on a police officer was dismissed as a  result, and a judge made a finding that the officer was not believable in this  case.  </P> <P> * The Sheriff's Department faces allegations that a deputy and other county  personnel deliberately destroyed a key section of County Jail videotape that  purportedly would have shown deputies beating an inmate without provocation.  The tape, which was cut and crudely spliced back together, was evidence in a  federal civil rights suit. The county has claimed that a malfunctioning  videocassette player accidentally damaged the recording.  </P> <P> No statistics are available on how many times law enforcement officers have  embellished testimony, misstated the facts or lied to help make a case. But  prosecutors, judges and defense lawyers say credibility problems involving  police are not all that uncommon.  </P> <P> "It was one of the constant battles I had with police and investigators," said  Nick Novick, a retired prosecutor who headed the district attorney's branch  office in south Orange County. "Like in any other business, most are pros, and  most cops are ethical and straightforward, but you have those who try it."  </P> <P> According to court records, hundreds of misdemeanor prosecutions and scores of  felony cases are dismissed every month in Orange County courts for a variety of  reasons. A number of those, defense lawyers say, are kicked out because of poor  investigation or credibility problems.  </P> <P> Proven cases of fabrication of key evidence remain rare and in the last decade,  there have been a handful of investigations into whether an Orange County law  enforcement officer committed perjury.  </P> <P> Local prosecutors only recall one case in which an officer was convicted of  perjury and fabricating evidence -- a Buena Park police sergeant who falsely  linked people to crimes by saying their fingerprints were found at the scene.  </P> <P> More common are embellishment, exaggeration, stretching the facts and shoddy  investigation. Judges, police and attorneys blame some of this on human error,  overwork, inevitable memory lapses and pressures to make a case that can affect  an officer's objectivity.  </P> <P> "A police officer on the street reacts instantly. They may fully believe in  their mind that a gun was pointed at them when it wasn't," said North Municipal  Court Judge Margaret Anderson, who handles felony preliminary hearings. "You  can sincerely and honestly believe something happens to you, but your  perception is wrong."  </P> <P> Police say some investigators and officers are incredibly busy, handling many  cases at a time. Often, they come to court to testify months after a case has  begun and are asked by the defense to accurately produce details about the  crime.  </P> <P> But criminal defense attorneys blame some of the inaccuracies on incompetence  and something else -- a presumption that a person is guilty from the start,  which can improperly influence the investigation.  </P> <P> "Police manuals say they must accumulate all evidence and not try to point the  finger at someone too soon," said Ron Talmo, a civil rights attorney and  assistant dean at Western State University College of Law based in Fullerton.  </P> <P> "But if you drive down the street and you're weaving, is the cop going to ask  you if you had a sneezing attack? If he sees certain symptoms -- watery eyes,  slurred speech -- is he or she going to ask if you have palsy or anything else?  No, because none of that helps the cops."  </P> <P> One of the most serious controversies involving the truthfulness of police  occurred in 1985 after Newport Beach officers boarded and commandeered the Sea  Dolphin, a 45-foot ketch loaded with six tons of marijuana. It was the largest  pot seizure in the city's history.  </P> <P> Police said they had enough cause to search the sailboat because there was a  marked 20-minute mooring restriction that was violated and the boat was riding  low in the water. One officer said a deckhand blurted out, "Search and you'll  find 20,000 pounds of pot" when police stepped onto the boat.  </P> <P> Court testimony indicated, however, that the mooring sign was faded and partly  obliterated, making it difficult for anyone -- police or boaters -- to find out  whether there was a mooring limit. Case records show that doubt was cast on  whether the deckhand made such an obviously incriminating remark because it had  not been mentioned in police reports or officials' reasons for seeking a search  warrant.  </P> <P> To make matters worse, a few hours after Harbor Municipal Court Judge Russell  A. Bostrom ordered the faded sign to be photographed for the case, it was  repainted by Newport Beach city employees before the order could be carried  out.  </P> <P> Bostrom subsequently ruled that the police made an illegal search and threw out  the case. He also held one detective in contempt for making contradictory  statements on key parts of the case and criticized other officers in the  investigation.  </P> <P> "Clearly prima facie cases of perjury could be alleged against two and possibly  all three of the officers as well as possible charges of conspiracy to obstruct  justice and the willful destruction of evidence," Bostrom said in court.  </P> <P> The bitterly contested dismissal was upheld on appeal and the last of the case  was kicked out two years ago. Appellate justices concluded that the police  search made "a mockery" of the Constitution, while police said the case was  kicked out over a "technicality."  </P> <P> Court records show that Municipal Court Judge Christopher Strople overturned  the detective's contempt citation and referred misconduct allegations to the  Orange County Grand Jury. No perjury charges resulted.  </P> <P> "If you don't have a tape or a photograph, it is hard to overcome this kind of  thing in the system," said Brower, a former deputy district attorney.  </P> <P> Although obviously inaccurate statements have been made in cases, prosecutors  also say that perjury or lying under oath is hard to show and certain legal  requirements must be met before charges can be filed.  </P> <P> "It requires two witnesses or one witness plus sufficient corroboration. You  get into a lot of technicalities and it is one of the more difficult crimes to  prosecute," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade, head of the district  attorney's special operations unit, which looks into allegations of misconduct  by public officials.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office declined to discuss Investigator Davis'  performance on the witness stand in the Gionis case.  </P> <P> But Davis' testimony "is a shock" to Newport Beach Chief Purcell. "It raises  some real concerns with chiefs and those who might have read about it," Purcell  said. "I would expect officers to have good recall and memory of key phone  calls."  </P> <P> Central to the prosecution's case were telephone records showing a pattern of  calls between Gionis, a private detective and two gunmen who attacked Wayne  during a bitter child-custody dispute.  </P> <P> Davis' testimony placed Gionis in the limo when calls came in from one of the  alleged henchmen hours before the attack. After the tape contradicted Davis,  Davis said Gionis must have made another phone call to talk to the chauffeur.  </P> <P> The defense put on unrefuted evidence of Gionis' whereabouts, showing that he  was not in the limo the morning before the assault. There was no record of a  second phone call by Davis to the chauffeur.  </P> <P> "Mr. Davis sat right here. You heard him. Fourteen years of law enforcement.  Member of the organized crime unit," Barnett told jurors in his closing  argument. "Why did (the prosecutor) ask him those questions? Because he wanted  to impress you. Those are impressive credentials. . . . But you know that Mr.  Davis is lying. Because we proved it. But folks, if you hadn't heard that tape,  you would never have known."  </P> <P> When serious questions about an officer's honesty arise, they can be  investigated internally by the law enforcement agency or weeded out of cases  before they become a problem. Sometimes it means dismissing cases or dropping  charges to set the record straight.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have a legal obligation to rid their cases of potential  inaccuracies damaging to a case and must disclose to the defense evidence that  might relate to the believability of witnesses and the police.  </P> <P> "We have people trying to resolve these things on our side of the fence before  charges are filed," said Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maury Evans. "If we find  something out after that, we try to resolve them before trial."  </P> <P> Earley, the spokesman for the defense counsel association, said, for example,  that in one death penalty case a map he thought could help corroborate the  alibi of the murder defendant was placed in a Garden Grove detective's desk and  apparently forgotten.  </P> <P> The accused, Son Van Ngo, a bodyguard, claimed that he shot several associates  who threatened his life for refusing to participate in a home-invasion robbery.  He said a map to the home was made by one of the victims.  </P> <P> During jury selection, Earley said, another police officer found the map, which  was then turned over to the defense by the prosecution. Ngo was convicted of  voluntary manslaughter and spared the death penalty.  </P></p>

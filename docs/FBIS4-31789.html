			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 10 (CTK) -- Premier Vaclav Klaus said  he was surprised by the resignation of National Property Fund  (FNM) Chairman Tomas Jezek and the appointment of Deputy  Privatisation Minister Roman Ceska as his successor, Klaus's  advisor Vadim Petrov told CTK today. The premier wonders  whether the change was not overly hasty and whether the new  chairman will be able to carry out much-needed improvements in  the activities of the fund. He told Nova Television today that  he had not been informed beforehand of Jezek's intention, but  got the news from CTK.</p>

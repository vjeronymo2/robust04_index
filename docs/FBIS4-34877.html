			<p>BFN     [Text] The former head of the Trinidad and Tobago  Manufacturers' Association [TTMA], (Gordon Rosseau), says NAFTA  has nothing to offer Trinidad and Tobago at this point in time.  In fact, (Rosseau) is of the belief that the government's plan  to accede to NAFTA can only be seen as destructive to the  island's manufacturing sector. Denise Moore has the details:    [Begin recording] [Moore] Mr. (Rosseau) says the perception  that NAFTA is synonymous with free trade is a mistaken one. He  refers to one asymetrical clause, designed to protect American  industries which are larger than the entire economies of some  Caribbean countries.    [(Rosseau)] If we are to join NAFTA now, we are not going to  be joining NAFTA under the rules and regulations that those  three countries joined NAFTA. And I'm saying that if...[pauses]  I'll have to put myself out on a limb here: Assuming that our  government is sensitive to the manufacturing industry and  assuming that the 40,000 jobs and the $400-odd-million in  revenue in exports is important and assuming that we have a  place in the future diversity of this economy, then I don't  understand why it is we are forcing and we are rushing into  NAFTA in a destructive mode.    [Moore] The former TTMA president says NAFTA embodies the  concepts of protectionism and selective intervention. These are  practices, he says, which it seems this government is reluctant  to put into place. The manufacturer echoes the concerns of  former head of the Institute of International Relations at St.  Augustin, Professor (Anthony Brian), when he questions local  ability to effectively bargain in the nation's interest.    [(Rosseau)] You look at the Venezuela agreement: five years,  nonreciprocal trade. But I see some items on that list there,  airplane wings, propellors for boats, things that we don't ever  dream to get into. Those are the items that have preference for  duty-free trade. I look at the list for the Colombian agreement  that has just been signed. Again, none of the strength that we  have in our exporting products are on that list for duty-free  trade. Some are on a phased period, and some are to be  negotiated in time.    [Moore] Mr. (Rosseau)'s fears appear to be vindicated by  Prof. (John Butrick), of York University. Reflecting on the  experience of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, Prof.  (Butrick) says NAFTA has already gutted the entire manufacturing  sector in Ontario.    [(Butrick)] It was clear from the beginning why this would  happen. Ontario was selling across all of Canada. If you live  in BC [British Columbia], and they suddenly say: We're going  free trade. Will you continue to buy from Ontario? Or would  you go somewhere where it's cheaper?    [Moore] Prof. (Butrick) says that the movement toward a  competitive world economy will eventually erode national  sovereignty. In his brave, new world, sovereignty will be  replaced by market forces and nations will become powerless to  control their own economies. And senior lecturer in the faculty  of social sciences, Patrick Watson, feels this country and  Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] should not limit their vision  geographically. He feels Europe may offer more possibilities  because of its historic ties to the region. All the speakers  agree, though, that there is no hurry to join NAFTA,  particularly since Latin America offers so many opportunities.  [end recording]</p>

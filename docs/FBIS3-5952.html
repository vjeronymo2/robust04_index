The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a recent statement  said Japan has stockpiled a large amount of plutonium and  completed technological preparations to make nuclear weapons any  time.    The statement warned that if Japan continued on the road of  nuclear armament, it would invite curses and condemnations from  the world people.    The Yugoslav paper BORBA said although Japan laid down the  "Three non-nuclear principles" banning the production,  possession and introduction of nuclear weapons, it has been  covertly ignoring the principles recently.    Alejandro Solorzano, chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the National Assembly of Nicaragua, in a statement  on March 3 said it is a big obstacle to the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula that Japan is hastening its nuclear  armament despite strong protests and denunciation by the world's  progressive people.    He stressed that the total elimination of nuclear weapons  and  a halt to their development should be realized worldwide and  that Japan should discard its dream of becoming a nuclear power.</p>

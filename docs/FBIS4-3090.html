			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling:"A Better Credit-Rating System is Deemed </F> Essential"]    [Text] Credit evaluation, a young industry that emerged in  China only several years ago, is set to play an ever important  role in the country's accelerating drive toward a market economy.    According to a recent seminar in Hainan Province on the  development of China's credit rating industry, demand for  authoritative credit assessments and a reliable rating system is  becoming increasingly urgent.    However, officials and experts attending the seminar said  many factors hinder the development of the budding industry.    Among the obstacles to development are that:    -- Many of the rating companies were launched by the  People's  Bank of China or other specialized banks, which makes it  difficult for these companies to be independent when issuing  ratings;    -- Although the major business of rating companies is  grading  the credit of corporate bonds, the issuance of such bonds still  remains a small trade and development of the bond market lags  behind that of the stock market;    -- Interest rates on corporate bonds have little relation to  companies' credit worthiness because interest rates in China are  set by the government, not the market. This reduces the value  of a credit rating;    -- The business of credit evaluation is essentially limited  to bonds, stunting its development;    -- A reliable management system and standard rating indices  have not been established. China has no special organization to  monitor the qualifications of rating companies;    -- Asset evaluation is stealing the limelight while credit  rating is neglected by both investors and the government;    -- Some of the rating companies sprouting up across the  country are unqualified. What China needs is not many new  rating companies but national, even international, companies  that are experienced and authoritative.    Experts are calling for tightened management to ensure that  the industry develops properly.    The People's Bank of China should supervise the industry  while an association of rating companies should be established,  according to Shen Lizhong, a member of the Nanjin Credit Rating  Committee.    Shen also urged authorities to strictly examine the  qualifications of companies.    Meanwhile, experts say the rating companies must be  independent of government, financial organizations, and  enterprises and institutions that plan to issue bonds.    And experts say interest rates of corporate bonds should be  set according to credit grades.    In addition, standard credit rating indices suitable for  China should be established, according to You Liansheng, an  expert from Shenyang.    You also said the rating business should be expanded from  appraising bond credit to evaluating the credit of enterprises.  financial institutions, stocks and various capital projects.</p>

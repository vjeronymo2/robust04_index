			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN GETS 27 YEARS TO LIFE IN THE SLAYING OF HIS WIFE  </P> <P> A Glendale man convicted last month of murdering his wife and trying to cover  up the crime by staging a burglary of their home was sentenced Monday to 27  years to life in prison.  </P> <P> Daniel J. Montecalvo's face reddened, but he sat motionless as Pasadena  Superior Court Judge Jack Tso outlined the sentence and told him that the  evidence that led to his first-degree murder conviction was overwhelming.  </P> <P> Montecalvo, 49, was found guilty Nov. 5 of fatally wounding his wife, Carol, in  1988 despite his claim that a burglar had shot her after being discovered  ransacking their Burbank home.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Montecalvo, who moved to Glendale after the murder, shot  himself in the back with a small-caliber pistol to make it seem as though the  burglar had also attacked him.  </P> <P> Montecalvo, a convicted bank robber, killed his 43-year-old wife to collect on  her $600,000 insurance policy in order to settle gambling debts, said Deputy  Dist. Atty. Robert Cohen, who prosecuted the case.  </P> <P> At his sentencing Monday, Montecalvo, who has acted as his own attorney  throughout the trial, denied the allegations and accused Cohen of misleading  the jurors and the judge.  </P> <P> He also said the Police Department focused on him as the murder suspect after  he sued the department for negligence, charging that his wife, a Pacific Bell  supervisor, died of her wounds because the officers did not respond fast enough  to an emergency call.  </P> <P> "This is a frame-up," said Montecalvo. "Everything (Cohen) has said has been  unfair. He has lied to the court."  </P> <P> In a nearly hourlong statement before he was sentenced, Montecalvo asked Tso  for a retrial on the grounds that new evidence had surfaced that would clear  his name.  </P> <P> "The only way I can grant a retrial is if it can be demonstrated that you have  not had a fair trial," said Tso. "There is substantial evidence to show you are  guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. The evidence has been overwhelming."  </P> <P> Prosecutors admitted that most of the evidence against Montecalvo was  circumstantial. There were no eyewitnesses to the slaying, and a murder weapon  was never recovered.  </P> <P> The case was so difficult to assemble, prosecutors said, they waited nearly two  years before charging Montecalvo of murder last March 14.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Penny Schneider, the original prosecutor, sought later to  have the murder charge dropped, but was overruled by her superiors. She was  replaced by Cohen.  </P> <P> Eighty-five witnesses, 163 exhibits and 8,600 pages of investigative reports  painted Montecalvo as a bar-hopping womanizer and a habitual gambler desperate  to pay off his gambling debts.  </P></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Gemina lifted by one-off gains GEMINA, the Italian financial holding company controlled by Fiat, posted a leap in profits at both parent company and group levels in the first six months of the current 1992-93 financial year. Group pre-tax profits jumped to L235.8bn (Dollars 147.8m) from L130.9bn, while parent company pre-tax profits increased to L164.4bn from L30.8bn. The rises derived from a number of one-off gains, notably the L226.1bn from the sale of Gemina's 9.7 per cent stake in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto). However, Gemina set aside L64.6bn in extraordinary losses following the write-down in value to recent stock market prices of its holdings in Pirelli &amp; C, Burgo and Europa Metalli. These three stakes have been transferred to the company's Gemina Investments investment banking subsidiary. Gemina predicted full-year profits would be higher for both the group and the parent company, thanks to the sharp increases at the interim stage and other developments. In 1991-92, Gemina reported group net earnings of L157bn while parent company net profits fell sharply to L42.7bn, largely because of write-offs on the company's share port-folio. The sale of the Ambroveneto stake led to a L351.7bn fall in the value of Gemina's holdings to L1,170.9bn at the end of last year. Gemina been tipped as a possible investor in a consortium to buy Credito Italiano, the state-owned bank now up for sale, but gave no indication of investment plans linked to Italy's privatisation programme. However, its cash pile stood at L378bn at the end of last year, leaving it well placed for any future investment opportunities.</p>

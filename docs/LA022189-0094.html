			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> DEPRESSION AS SOURCE OF CREATIVITY  </P> <P> Churchill's Black Dog, Kafka's Mice and Other Phenomena of the Human Mind by  Anthony Storr (Grove Press: $19.95; 288 pages)  </P> <P> The connection between creativity and madness has long been observed and  brooded about. It's probably a matter of degree. People who are a little bit  different from the mainstream are considered creative. People who are a lot  different are considered crazy.  </P> <P> But that explanation doesn't reach the heart of the matter. It simply describes  the phenomenon without getting inside it. Many questions can still profitably  be asked: Where do these differences come from? What accounts for their  intensity? Why do some people use them as assets while for others they are  great liabilities?  </P> <P> Anthony Storr, a British psychiatrist, addresses these questions and many  related to them in three remarkably lucid and revealing profiles -- of Winston  Churchill, Franz Kafka and Isaac Newton, all of whom suffered severe and  debilitating depressions throughout their lives but had great achievements  nonetheless. The profiles are the first three chapters of his collection of  essays, "Churchill's Black Dog, Kafka's Mice and Other Phenomena of the Human  Mind," and they are worth the price of the book.  </P> <P> Storr argues that the sources of the depression of Churchill, Kafka and Newton  were the same as the sources of their achievements: an extremely unhappy  childhood that haunted each all of his life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bottomless Hole Inside a Man  </P> <P> The profile of Churchill is especially compelling. He was an unloved child who  developed inside of himself a bottomless hole that he spent his life trying to  fill with accomplishments and the roar of the crowd.  </P> <P> As long as he was achieving, he could hold his demons at bay, though the  formula always demanded more and more accomplishments to overcome the terrible  self-image within.  </P> <P> When the achievements were interrupted or stopped altogether, Churchill had no  internal resources to draw on and fell into despair. "I have achieved a great  deal to achieve nothing in the end," he said and spent the last years of his  long life in his sitting room, staring into the fire.  </P> <P> "One salient characteristic of adults who suffer from depression is their  dependence on external sources to maintain self-esteem," Storr writes.  Churchill "remained hungry -- hungry for fame, for adulation, for success and  for power; and although he gained all these in full measure, the end of his  life showed that he never assimilated them into himself, but remained  unsatisfied."  </P> <P> Ironically, Storr writes, if Churchill had been a happier man, less driven to  achieve, less driven to overcome despair with fantasy, he probably would not  have been there in 1940 to rouse England to defend itself against the German  onslaught.  </P> <P> "In that dark time," he says, "what England needed was not a shrewd, equable,  balanced leader. She needed a prophet, a visionary, a man who could dream  dreams of victory when all seemed lost."  </P> <P> It was a happy coincidence of the product of Churchill's inner turmoil and the  needs of the world.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ruled by Tyrannical Father  </P> <P> Similarly, in the case of Franz Kafka, the world benefited (this time in  literature) from his personal unhappiness. "Kafka's writing is so bound up with  the more pathological parts of his personality that, if he had become happier,  his drive to write might have been greatly diminished."  </P> <P> The pathological parts of Kafka's personality were caused by an irrational and  tyrannical father, which gave young Franz a view of the world as a hostile,  uncontrollable place, a vision familiar to everyone who has read his work.  </P> <P> Kafka, Storr says, "described in his novels and short stories what it is like  to feel oneself helplessly at the mercy of people who are not only powerful but  also remote, inaccessible and entirely arbitrary in their actions."  </P> <P> Haven't we all had bosses like that?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exploring Mind of a Genius  </P> <P> Like Churchill and Kafka, Isaac Newton also had a difficult childhood: He was  abandoned by his mother (his father having died before he was born) and grew up  emotionally isolated.  </P> <P> In another book, "Solitude" (Free Press) -- a wonderful book in its own right  -- Storr argues that isolation is frequently associated with supreme abstract  mental achievement, and here he offers Newton as a case in point.  </P> <P> "Newton shared his absence of close personal ties with Descartes, Locke,  Hobbes, Hume, Pascal, Spinoza, Kant, Leibniz, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche,  Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein -- in short, with many of the world's greatest  thinkers," Storr says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Odd People  </P> <P> Geniuses tend to be odd people, and Newton was both a great genius and very,  very odd. Though Storr's explanation of Newton is less successful than his  explanations of Churchill and Kafka, his exploration of Newton's mind is  revealing as far as it goes.  </P> <P> The remaining essays in the book are less broad-based than the first three, but  no matter. There's enough thought-provoking material at the beginning to make  up for the paucity at the end.  </P> <P> The sources of creativity and their relationship to genius and madness remain  enigmatic, but Storr has lifted one of the veils.  </P></p>

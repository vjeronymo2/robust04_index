			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Justice Is on Our Side"] </F>   [Text] During yesterday's meeting with the delegation of  the U.S. Council of Foreign Affairs, President Gligorov pointed  out the United States have so far kept a balanced position in  the Macedonian-Greek relations, which results from its interest  to preserve peace and stability in the region, just like it is  in the interest of both Greece and Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. "America is interested  to see an agreement acceptable for both sides and will remain on  such a position during talks with Papandreou. We look forward  to today's meeting between Foreign Minister Crvenkovski and U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher and hope to see a fruitful  discussion." Asked on possible reactions by the Macedonian  Govt. in case Serbs undertake an ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,  Gligorov said it would be a tragic event with consequences  bigger than those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressing peace and  stability must be preserved and the Kosovo question must be  resolved through peaceful means. Otherwise, he said, a new  Balkan war would start, involving two NATO member countries,  Turkey and Greece. In regard to Greek remarks on the Macedonian  Constitution, Gligorov underlined it clearly states Macedonia  has no territorial aspirations and intentions of interfering in  any country's domestic affairs. He went on to say Macedonia has  suggested signing a treaty with Greece on inviolability of  present borders. "They are now bothered by our name and the  fact that Macedonia will take care of cultural and other needs  of Macedonians living out of the country. Let me remind that  one third of the total Macedonian population lives in Australia,  the United States, Canada, Germany and other countries and that  none of these countries are concerned by this responsibility  Macedonia took on. And, the Article 108 of the Greek  Constitution likewise states Greece will take care of cultural  and other needs of Greeks throughout the world." He was also  asked on his opinion of the loose federation of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina and possibilities of Macedonia entering any  federation. He said Bosnia should be re-established, as  dividing on ethnic basis violates international laws and in fact  approves of changing borders by force and ethnic cleansing. "We  consider it is the best interest for the Balkans that Macedonia  remains independent and stays out of any form of federation, as  it would cause new conflicts. This means we are oriented  towards integrating into European associations and wish to see  the European option enforced in all Balkan countries. Any  joining of countries on religious or ethnic basis would just  bring about new complications. We have a great deal of mutual  interests with Greece and, once emotions are calmed down in this  country, there is a realistic hope we will reach a long-term  agreement. That is how we view our relations with all other  neighbours -- Bulgaria, Albania, and, when the war is over,  Serbia, as well." Asked what terms would the possible agreement  with Greece include, President Gligorov said the inviolability  of borders would be of greatest priority, and all other issues  Macedonia is ready to negotiate on should be discussed in a  package and not separately. He also said Macedonia is "aware  that both sides must be ready to compromise." As for the ability  of the Macedonians to stand up to the strong Greek lobby in the  world, Gligorov answered although Macedonians have no such  economic and political influence and means to react at every  moment, the "justice is on our side."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippines and China have agreed to explore  the possibility of undertaking joint efforts in developing the  resources in the South China Sea, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary  Rodolfo Severino said after the annual bilateral consultations  between the two countries ended yesterday. However, the  question on mineral resources in the contentious area won't be  included in the joint efforts at the moment since it might only  create friction between the two countries, he said.    The Philippines and China both lay claim to the islands in  the South China Sea along with Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, and  Malaysia. The islands are believed sitting atop rich resources  of oil and minerals. They are also considered an important sea  lane.    The joint efforts between Manila and Beijing are expected to  start next year as soon as internal consultations among  government agencies concerned begin. Mr. Severino was likewise  informed by the Chinese delegation, headed by Assistant Foreign  Minister Wang Yingfang, that Beijing prefers to deal with the  South China Sea issue on a bilateral level, although they are  also open to discussing the issue with more than two claimants.    On the issue of Hong Kong reverting back to China, Mr. Wang  assured government the status of Filipino workers and local  companies in the British colony will not be affected by the time  the island reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. "This is in  line with the fact that the social system will not change, even  after the transfer of sovereignty. They don't even have  objections to the extradition treaty we had initialed with Hong  Kong. They said it will remain valid as long as China is  consulted even after 1997," Mr. Severino said.    The two sides also discussed the need for more political  consultations between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  and China, particularly on regional security issues. Although  the One China Policy was tackled, Mr. Severino declined to give  further details on what the two panels discussed. He said he  assured Beijing that Manila will continue to adhere to the One  China Policy.</p>

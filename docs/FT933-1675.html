			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Yeltsin gives reformers cause to hope RUSSIA'S radical economic reformers, boosted by President Boris Yeltsin's dissolution of parliament and the return to government this week of radical economist Yegor Gaidar, are preparing a counter-offensive after the reverses of recent months. Although the government stressed it was business as usual, despite what President Yeltsin's opponents describe as a coup, his decree to replace the Soviet-era parliament with new elections in December comes at a critical juncture. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which had grown increasingly frustrated by divisions within the cabinet over pursuing radical policies proclaimed in public, are expected to be encouraged by Mr Yeltsin's decisiveness. The timing of the decision is also useful. Russia had promised to sign a standby agreement with the IMF by October 1 as part of a debt rescheduling agreed with western creditors. But the latest political crisis, and the boosting of the reformist camp, will give it much more leeway in dealing with western institutions. The IMF and western governments have taken an increasingly cautious stance towards aiding Moscow since the chaos of the government's abortive currency reform in early July. Senior officials of the Group of Seven industrialised countries have for some time considered the current parliament to be an important obstacle to economic reform which Mr Yeltsin would have to remove. In a clear sign of support for Mr Yeltsin, Germany said yesterday it would today sign a debt-rescheduling deal with Russia to delay payment of capital and interest on DM8bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of outstanding credits, due since the end of 1991. In return Russia has agreed to pay some DM500m in outstanding debt service payments by the end of September, to ensure that German credits are given the same treatment as those of all other creditors, including US loans for grain purchases. Germany has insisted that as the largest official creditor to Russia it should receive equal treatment. The rescheduling deal is the bilateral element of the Paris Club agreement reached with the Russian government earlier this year, allowing repayments to be extended over a further 10 years. Observers closely involved in Russia's reform effort were optimistic that Mr Yeltsin's willingness to take on his opponents would not undermine the reform cause and could even accelerate it. 'Mr Yeltsin has finally put economic reform on the line,' said Mr Stanley Fischer, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chief economist of the World Bank. 'The IMF's tough stance in recent weeks has had a positive effect because it has helped persuade Yeltsin that it was time to act, both in getting back Gaidar and confronting his opposition in parliament. As soon as there is any sign that the programme is being implemented, the Fund will be back with support. 'If Yeltsin wins, then the reform programme can succeed. If he loses, then that's it for reform,' Mr Fischer said.</p>

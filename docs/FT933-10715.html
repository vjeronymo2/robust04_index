			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Reform of E Europe banks 'a priority' RADICAL reform of the banking sector must be a priority for east European governments and western donors seeking to implement economic change in former Communist countries, Mr Mario Sarcinelli, vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said yesterday. Commenting on the EBRD's latest quarterly review, which showed how recession in the west and last year's drought had contributed to a deteriorating foreign trade balance in most of the region, Mr Sarcinelli said that the existing banking structures were ill-equiped to finance the reform process. Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics had gone furthest in implementing banking reforms, but most east European banks still lacked western-style auditing practices, had little understanding of risk control, and were burdened by huge levels of bad debt, he said. The EBRD declined to issue figures showing the scale of the problem, claiming the statistics were too unreliable and politically sensitive. But bank officials estimate that bad debts represent more than 60 per cent of the balance sheet in some of the largest east European banks. Mr John Fleming, chief economist of the EBRD, added that most east European countries still lacked effective bankruptcy laws so enterprises were continuing to trade and receive bank funding, although they were technically insolvent. 'There is clear evidence of a big build-up in many countries of inter-enterprise arrears,' he added. The banks now need recapitalisation and the introduction of competition, ideally through a process of privatisation. The EBRD plans to increase its stake in east European banks, such as Poland's recently privatised Wielkopolski Bank Kreditowy in which the EBRD has become a majority shareholder. It also plans to increase its provision of credits through local financial intermediaries, in an effort to spread credit risks and boost local financial sectors.</p>

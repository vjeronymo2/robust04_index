			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Compliance Monitoring Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Introduction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed compliance monitoring requirements for sulfate would apply to all systems (community, non-transient non-community, and transient non-community water systems).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The occurrence of sulfate in drinking water may be predictable based on several factors including geological conditions, use patterns (e.g., pesticides), presence of industrial activity in the area, and type of source or historic record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PWSs would need to monitor for sulfate in accordance with EPA's Standard Monitoring Framework (SMF), published Jan. 30, 1991 (56 FR 3564). Monitoring is done for three, three-year compliance periods in a nine-year cycle. The Phase II regulations established a nine-year cycle for those contaminants in that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. By agreement between States and EPA at a Denver work group meeting in 1992, subsequent rules will begin their individual nine-year cycles in the first January after the effective date (18 months after promulgation).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The monitoring requirements described in the next section are proposed to apply to systems which exceed the MCL and are authorized by the State to select the preferred option (Option 1) to achieve compliance with the sulfate MCL. For systems which select central treatment, or which do not exceed the MCL, the SMF is proposed to apply. If either Option 2 or Option 3 becomes the final regulation for sulfate and the State allows that method of compliance, the monitoring requirements described for Option 1 regarding Alternative Water and the reporting/record keeping requirements for public notification would apply for systems exceeding the sulfate MCL. Initial monitoring to determine MCL exceedence would be required of all systems, that is, community, transient and non-transient, non-community systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed monitoring requirements for sulfate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The monitoring requirements for those systems selecting Option 1, with State authorization, would be as follows, and are consistent with the provisions of &sect;142.62 (g) and (h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Bottled water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are regulations in effect (&sect;142.62) which state that a PWS can be required or permitted by the State to supply its customers with bottled water as a condition for receiving a variance or exemption. These regulations indicate that the State shall require and approve a monitoring program for bottled water and that the PWS shall develop and put in place a monitoring program that provides reasonable assurances that the bottled water meets all MCLs. These same monitoring requirements are proposed to apply here. The PWS monitors a representative sample of the bottled water for all contaminants regulated under &sect;&sect;141.61 (a) and (c) and 141.62 during the first three-month period that it supplies the bottled water to the public, and annually thereafter. Results of the monitoring are provided to the State annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State, in lieu of the above requirements, could accept certification from the bottled water company that the bottled water supplied has come from an approved source as defined in 21 CFR 129.3(a); and that the bottled water company has conducted monitoring in accordance with 21 CFR 129.80(g) (1) through (3); and that the bottled water does not exceed any EPA MCLs. The PWS would have to provide certification to the State the first quarter after it supplies bottled water and annually thereafter. At the State's option a PWS may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by citing an approved monitoring program which is already in place in another State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

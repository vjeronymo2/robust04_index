			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: Apple plans worldwide on-line service Apple Computer, the personal computer maker, plans to develop a global on-line service called eWorld that will be a key element in its strategy to increase profits after a troubled year of layoffs and top management changes. The on-line service will be available in the US during the second quarter of 1994 and will be expanded to European and Asian markets later. Within five years Apple expects eWorld to produce annual revenues of several hundred million dollars and to attract several million subscribers. Apple's eWorld will compete directly with market leaders Prodigy, Compuserve, America Online and Genie. The on-line service will offer different types of services and a special graphical user interface in which users can more easily gain access to services and find information. Almost all Apple Macintosh computers sold in 1994 will contain eWorld communications software and a version for Windows systems will be available at the end of 1994. Owners of Apple's hand-held Newton MessagePad system will use eWorld to send electronic messages and to subscribe to news services. Apple declined to say how much it is investing in eWorld which will be financed mostly from profits from the AppleLink on-line service which generates annual revenues of about Dollars 32m and has 60,000 subscribers, mostly software developers and Apple dealers. Mr Joshua Harris, on-line services analyst at New York based consultancy Jupiter Communications, said that Apple was late entering the market. Sprint and British Telecom will provide Apple with communications links to its data centre in Napa, California, which will host the on-line service. Rival on-line services company American Online has licensed key software to Apple as part of a cross-technology licensing agreement.</p>

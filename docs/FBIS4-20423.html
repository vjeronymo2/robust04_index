			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xia Youfu (1115 0645 1381) and Huang Xueqi (7806 </F> 1331 3825): "Comparing Development Models for Tumen Jiang"]    [Text] Development and cooperation in the Tumen Jiang  region has been a much-examined and much-discussed topic both  among countries in northeast Asia and at the United Nations  Development and Planning [UNDP] in recent years. One can think  of eight models for achieving development and cooperation in the  Tumen Jiang region. To achieve the goal of development and  economically vitalize the region and the entire northeast Asia,  we must do a careful study, compare the various cooperation  models, and select the best. The Tumen Jiang development region  can be defined on three levels. On the first level is the Tumen  Jiang small-triangle development zone, also known as TREZ, made  up of a 1,000-square kilometer area of land including Jingxin in  China, the southern Hasang area in Russia, and the Luojin and  Xianfeng areas in North Korea. On the second level is the Tumen  Jiang greater-triangle development zone, also refereed to as the  Tumen Jiang economic development area [TEDA]. It is about 10,000  square kilometers in area and includes Yanji in China, the  greater Vladivostok economic region in Russia, and Qingjin in  North Korea. On the third level is the Northeast Asia  Development Area [NEARDA], encompassing northeast China (Jilin,  Heilongjiang, and three banners and one city in Inner Mongolia),  the Russian Far East, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, and  Japan. This article focuses on cooperation models for the Tumen  Jiang small-triangle development zone in hopes of identifying  the best model to transform the region into an enormously  powerful development magnet, which, in turn, would be the engine  to drive the development of TEDA and NEARDA in the course of  time through the ripple effect.    1. The Necessity and Criteria of Choosing the Best Model    1) Necessity a) Broadly speaking there are eight cooperation  models for the development of the Tumen Jiang development zone:  unilateral development zone, bilateral coordinated development  zone, trilateral coordinated development zone, functional  cooperation, multinational economic cooperation zone, management  by a multinational consortium or multinational corporation,  three-nation joint management, and UN administration. These are  the objectives of developing the Tumen Jiang region. First, spur  the development of the economy of the development zone; second,  tap the zone's development potential, and fully exploit the  complementariness of the resources of the various nations so  that they are allocated optimally; and third, build the  development zone into a powerful development magnet to fuel the  development of northeast Asia as a whole. The several nations  involved do not completely see eye to eye when it comes to  development objectives. China hopes that a developed Tumen Jiang  would power the economic take-off of its northeast. Russia looks  to it to fuel the development of its Far East and lead the  charge of its Asian Pacific economic and trade strategy. North  Korea expects it to jump-start economic development in its  several northwestern provinces. South Korea wants it to do the  same for its eastern coastal area and hopes to make full use of  the complementariness of its resources and captures the market  in the region. Japan hopes that it will further the development  of its western coast. It too expects to fully utilize the  complementariness of its resources and corner the market in  northeast Asia. As for Mongolia, it sees Tumen Jiang as another  trade shortcut. Depending on the model we pick, these various  objectives will be achieved to different extents. Hence we need  to do a careful comparative study and select the one which would  lead to the achievement of all these objectives.    b) The models also produce different results. Some yield  short-term benefits. Others satisfy a limited number of national  objectives. Yet others meet all objectives in the long haul. It  is imperative, therefore, that the best model be selected.    c) The complexity of development and cooperation in the zone  requires that we carefully choose the best model. The region is  one of the most complex, most diverse in the world, as  demonstrated by its 1) political complexity, 2) economic  diversity, 3) legal complexity, and 4) managerial difficulty.    2) The Criteria of Model Comparison and Selection a) Conduct  a qualitative evaluation of the models from the macro strategic  high plane. The qualitative evaluation system should consist of  six criteria--politics, economics, dissemination effect, its  ability to attract foreign capital and technology, management,  and law.    b) Carry out empirical research on the models through case  studies, using international experiences.    c) Identify the model acceptable to all parties by  conducting  feasibility studies.    2. Defining Various Models    Depending on the closeness of cooperation among the various  countries, the models can be divided into three broad  categories: loose cooperation, semi-close cooperation, and close  cooperation.    1) Loose-cooperation models Under a loose-cooperation model,  China, North Korea, and Russia each set up a development zone in  neighboring areas in the Tumen Jiang region. There is very  limited cooperation in some fields, with each country creating  its own comprehensive economic development zone characterized by  loose cooperation. Specifically, the three nations each  establish a comprehensive economic development zone in adjoining  areas in the region. By fully exercising their respective  sovereignty, the three nations each formulate their own policies  to meet the requirements of their comprehensive zones. In  particular, they decide on their own what preferential policies  to offer to foreign investors. There is some form of low-level  cooperation and coordination in some policy areas, but each  nation has its own development zone management committee to run  the zone.    Specific examples of a loose-cooperation model: Model A:  unilateral economic zone. Under this model, China, North Korea,  and Russia each set up an economic zone in neighboring areas in  the Tumen Jiang region based on their own national interests and  aspirations. They run the zones separately on their own and  there is no well-defined cooperative relationship or  coordination among them. Specifically China has created an  economic development zone in Hunchun. To develop Siberia and its  Far East, Russia has set up a free economic development zone in  the Hasang area in Nahuodeka. To attract foreign capital, North  Korea has also created a special economic zone on Hashan Island  in Xianfeng Prefecture. They have their own development zone  management committees. Each zone has its own regional  development plan, a policy to attract foreign capital, and other  policies. There is only routine trade among the three  development zones, along with border trade and border trade on a  very modest scale. Nor have the three nations taken joint  measures to develop the local economy by drawing up an  agreement, for instance.    Model B: Bilateral coordinated economic development zone.  Under this model, the three nations each set up an economic open  zone in neighboring areas in the Tumen Jiang region. China  concludes a bilateral agreement with North Korea and Russia  separately. There is a limited degree of coordination in policy  matters as well as some cooperation in certain fields through  the establishment of a bilateral coordinating committee, forming  an economic development zone characterized by loose bilateral  cooperation and coordination. Specifically, China, North Korea,  and Russia each set up a development zone in neighboring areas  in the Tumen Jiang region. China enters into a bilateral  cooperative agreement with Russia and North Korea separately. It  sets up a development zone ministerial-level committee with the  two countries, again separately. The committee meets once a year  to discuss major matters of coordination and cooperation. In  addition, a bilateral coordinating committee is created to  coordinate cooperative activities. Nevertheless, the major  decisions are still made by each nation. The characteristic of  this model is that ownership and the right to use are merged.  Each nation retains absolute sovereignty. The basis of  coordination is the bilateral agreement, yet no such agreement  exists between Russia and North Korea.    Model C: Trilateral coordinated economic open zone. Under  this model, China, North Korea, and Russia each set up an  economic open zone in adjoining areas in the Tumen Jiang region.  The three nations sign an agreement setting up a trilateral  coordinating committee to coordinate policies and other matters  to a certain extent, forming an economic open zone characterized  by loose coordination and cooperation. Specifically the three  nations each set up their own economic development zone and all  three are parties to a coordination and cooperation agreement. A  trilateral ministerial-level committee is set up, along with a  trilateral coordinating committee to carry out coordination.  What you have under this model is still loose coordination and  cooperation. Ownership and the right to use have not been  separated. The basis for coordination is a trilateral agreement.    2) Semi-close cooperation models    Under a semi-close cooperation model, the three nations each  set up an economic open zone in neighboring areas in the Tumen  Jiang region by exercising their sovereignty and cooperate more  closely in certain fields or in the planning and development of  the region as a whole. Specifically the nations each set up an  economic development zone in the Tumen Jiang region, sign a  trilateral agreement, and set up a three-nation  ministerial-level coordinating committee and a three-nation  coordinating committee. The three countries cooperate more  closely in certain fields, in the formulation of some policies,  and in the development of the entire regional economy.    Specific examples of a semi-close cooperation model:    Model D: functional cooperation. China, North Korea, and  Russia each set up an economic open zone in neighboring areas in  the Tumen Jiang region and sign an agreement under which they  are to cooperate relatively more closely in some fields that  will shape the long-term development of the whole region, such  as communication and transportation, energy, environmental  protection, tourism, agriculture, and tariffs. Specifically the  three nations each set up their own development zone and enter  into an agreement specifying the fields of cooperation. A  ministerial-level committee and a coordinating committee are set  up. In some fields, eg., transportation, energy, and  environmental protection, a corporation is set up. In others,  such as tourism, a promoting committee is set up. A number of  preferential policies are adopted to attract foreign capital to  finance development in the selected fields. Resources are  allowed to circulate freely in the field concerned.    Model E: multinational economic cooperation zone. By  exercising their political sovereignty, the three nations,  namely China, Russia, and North Korea, sign a cooperation  agreement setting up a unified multinational economic open zone  and carry out relatively close cooperation on the economic  front. Specifically, the three nations sign an agreement  creating a multinational economic cooperation zone in adjoining  areas in the Tumen Jiang region. A "Tumen Jiang multinational  economic cooperation law," which must not violate the  constitutions of the three nations, is adopted as the basic law  of the zone. There is a single unified fiscal policy, tax  policy, and monetary policy in the zone. Tariffs are unified. A  free trade zone, perhaps even tariff alliance, is set up. A  favorable investment climate is created to attract foreign  capital and technology. Resources are allowed to circulate  freely within the zone to take advantage of their  complementariness. The market system reigns supreme within the  zone. A three-nation ministerial-level committee exists to  handle major matters. Underneath it is a multinational economic  zone management committee, an executive body in charge of the  unified planning, leadership, and management of the zone.    Model F: management by a multinational consortium or  corporation. This carries the multinational cooperation zone  model one step further. A multinational corporation leases the  land use right to a piece of territory where the three nations  abut one another, forming an economic development zone  characterized by multinational cooperation through unified  planning, investment, and management. Specifically a  multinational economic cooperation zone is set up in accordance  with an agreement. The multinational consortium or corporation  leases the land use right to a piece of land in the Tumen Jiang  region where the three nations abut, with ownership remaining in  the hands of the three nations. When the land use right lease  expires, it may be extended if necessary. A management committee  exists to carry out unified planning and management. As far as  tariffs are concerned, a free port policy is followed A number  of other preferential policies are also offered. The leading  industry in the multinational economic zone is banking and  trade, with the zone ultimately becoming a banking and trade  center in northeast Asia. This model is characterized by the  separation of ownership and use-right, but the three nations  still retain sovereignty.    3) Close-cooperation models    To fully achieve the development objective of the region,  China, Russia, and North Korea sign a trilateral or  international agrement setting up an integrated Tumen Jiang  cooperation zone. They engage in close cooperation on issues  relating to the zone's overall development. The cooperation zone  is quasi-national in nature and practices political, social, and  economic integration for an extended period of time (anywhere  from 50 to 100 years, for stance). A case in point is Hong Kong.  Specifically the three nations sign a trilateral or  international agreement setting up an integrated cooperation  zone. By adopting a "special law on the integration of the Tumen  Jiang region," the legislatures of the three nations approve the  establishment of an integrated Tumen Jiang cooperation zone for  a set period of time (say, from 50 to 100 years) in order to  develop the region. The zone is quasi-national in nature. It has  a committee composed of the heads of government which meets  regularly and handles major issues. There is also a development  zone special management committee, an authoritative body in  charge of the unified planning, leadership, and management of  the zone. Special policies apply in the zone. While the  territory of the zone belongs to the three nations, no nation  can unilaterally exercise sovereign control over its portion of  the zone during its predetermined duration. Resources can  circulate freely within the zone. It is a free trade zone and an  export processing zone. It is a tariff union as well as economic  union. It is authorized to issue a freely convertible special  zone currency and offers preferential incentives to attract  foreign capital and technology. The zone also has a special  assembly whose primary responsibilities are legislation and  supervising the zone's administrative officers in the discharge  of the latter's duties and functions. The zone's diplomatic and  defense matters are handled through consultation.    Specific examples of a close-cooperation model:    Model G, three-nation joint management. The three nations  sign a cooperation agreement setting up an integrated Tumen  Jiang cooperation zone to effect political, economic, and social  integration for a prolonged period of time. The zone is run by a  mixed three-nation joint management committee. Specifically, in  addition to the above description, the following points need to  be noted. The three nations sign a trilateral agreement. A  committee consisting of the heads of government of the three  nations is set up. Also established is a special mixed  management committee comprising representatives from the three  nations to run the zone jointly.    Model H: UN administration. Under the auspices of the United  Nations, the six [as published] nations of China, Russia, North  Korea, Japan, and Mongolia sign an international agreement  setting up an integrated special cooperation zone where these  six nations abut one another in the Tumen Jiang region. A  "special law on the Tumen Jiang integrated special cooperation  zone" is passed by the pertinent legislative bodies and the  United Nations is entrusted to be solely responsible for its  administration. Specifically, under the auspices of the UN, the  six nations sign an international agreement setting up an  integrated Tumen Jiang special cooperation zone. The pertinent  legislative bodies adopt a "special law on the Tumen Jiang  integrated special cooperation zone" and authorize the UN to be  solely responsible for administering it. The United Nations sets  up a regional development special committee directly answerable  to the secretary general. The committee selects experts to form  a "Tumen Jiang experts management committee" to take charge of  the zone's unified planning, leadership, and management. There  is also a committee composed of the UN secretary-general, the  executive director of the regional development special committee  directly under the secretary-general, as well as the heads of  government of the nations involved. The zone adopts special  preferential policies to attract foreign capital and technology  and issues a freely convertible Tumen Jiang currency. Its  exchange rate follows the exchange rate of the special drawing  rights [SDR's]. The distribution of interests and disputes  arising therefrom are resolved by the United Nations and the six  nations through consultation, with the United Nations holding  the ultimate arbitration power. Diplomatic affairs are worked  out through consultation. Territorial sovereignty remains in the  hands of the three nations. Defense and public security  responsibilities are carried out by UN peacekeeping forces.    3. Comparing the Eight Models    1) Model A Pros: Relatively amenable to realizing the wishes  and aspirations of an individual nation. Extremely low initial  exchange costs, which means that an economic open zone can be  set up in no time. Legal and policy coordination can come about  readily.    Cons: Cannot achieve the basic objectives of developing the  region, fully exploiting the zone's absolute or comparative  advantage, or bringing about the complementariness of resources.  Economies of scale unobtainable. Large-scale infusion of foreign  capital hampered by the political system, legal system, level of  economic development and policies of the nation in question and  other constraints. Hard to build up a lead industry. The fact  that each nation solves its environmental and other problems on  its own presents enormous difficulties.    In the real world, each nation has set up its own economic  development zone, but only of a very elementary variety. Foreign  capital is cautious about entering Russia what with its current  political instability. It still has a long way to go before  completing its transition to a market economy and its economic  mechanism operates in a most haphazard manner, which gives  foreign capital pause. The infrastructure in the Russian far  east is backward and there is a shortage of managerial  personnel. Foreign-funded enterprises already there cannot  operate properly. The legal system is unsound and incomplete,  with administrative orders often filling the void. The result is  a high degree of unpredictability. Furthermore, the  Russian-Japanese territorial dispute is an impediment to the  large-scale entry of Japanese capital into the Russian Far East.  Thus, domestic investment and the vitalization of existing  relations alone will not be able to lift the economy of Russian  far east and those of Asian Pacific nations to a higher level of  mutually beneficial interaction. Among the various nations in  northeast Asia, the North Korean economy is most backward and  the least open. It has a tenuous economic relationship with  Japan and began trade and economic ties with South Korea only  two or three years ago. The channels of economic exchange and  trade between North Korea and other nations are narrow and, to a  certain extent, stagnant. Despite the establishment of an  economic zone on Hashan Island, the possibility of attracting  foreign capital on a large scale is extremely remote. China,  too, has its own problems: a backward infrastructure, an  incomplete legal system, inefficiency, and a shortage of senior  managerial personnel.    2) Model B Pros: conducive to bringing out the  complementariness of the resources of the two sides involved.  Initial exchange costs low; good chance of reaching an  agreement; may strengthen bilateral relations; may serve common  economic interests through bilateral cooperation.    Cons: This model still falls short of achieving the basic  objective of developing the region. Bilateral forces not enough  of an engine to fuel the development of the region; the free  circulation of resources is impeded, their complementariness not  fully exploited; there is only limited complementariness between  the resources of China and those of North Korea; cannot reap the  benefits of economies of scale long term; the different  interpretations of the institutions and policies of the various  nations and different expectations about the future preclude a  large infusion of foreign capital; immense difficulties in  reconciling one system of law with another and one policy with  another, and in coordinating the distribution of interests; the  extent of economic cooperation within the zone is modest,  complicating further development.    This model is fairly acceptable to the three parties. Thus  far all three have made some move on this front. China and  Russia, for instance, have set up a common market in a number of  localities.    3) Model C Pros: marks the first step toward achieving the  basic objective of cooperation and development in the zone;  economies of scale much more substantial than under the previous  two models; helps bring out the complementariness of resources  to a large extent; helps improve relations among the three  parties. Initial exchange costs also quite low, albeit they tend  to go up subsequently.    Cons: hard to coordinate the laws and policies of different  nations because of conflicting interests and because they are  significantly different from one another; the zone is nothing  more than a loose organization; lacking a legal basis for its  actions as well as a powerful coordinating committee, it is not  in a position to play an effective role or to attract foreign  capital and technology in a big way; it has trouble developing  into a development magnet and still falls short of achieving the  objective of development.    In the real world, the three nations do find this model  acceptable and now appreciate the importance of cooperation.  They have taken some moves on the cooperation front as  illustrated by their enthusiastic participation in the  international conference organized by UNDP.    4) Model D Pros: helps spur development in some fields,  taking the interests of the entire region as the point of  departure; makes good use of the resources within those fields  and puts their complementariness to work; can lead to economies  of scale more extensively and is good at disseminating  technology to the surrounding areas. It also succeeds in  attracting a substantial amount of foreign capital; can promote  trilateral relations further.    Cons: because of the presence of the complexity and  disparities mentioned above, the field of cooperation cannot be  readily broadened; initial exchange costs quite high;  difficulties in coordinating policies and management; cannot  guarantee the all-round development of zone.    It is within the realm of possibility to adopt this model to  set the stage for further cooperation. The three parties are in  the process of exploring the possibility of cooperating with one  another in transportation (building a harbor) and environmental  protection. Right now the foremost problem is conflicting  interests. A case in point is harbor construction. In 1990 China  proposed building a harbor on its soil. Under its plan, the  first phase will consist of dredging the silt that has  accumulated at the mouth of Tumen Jiang, estimated to be between  1 and 3 million cubic meters. Along with rail construction, the  project will cost about $2 billion. The second phase of the plan  calls for the construction of a large harbor upstream at  Hunchun, about 72 km from Fangchuan, that will handle 10,000-ton  ships, at an estimated cost of $8 billion by the year 2015.  North Korea, on the other hand, suggests that an international  trade port be built within its territory, arguing that, first,  Qingjin, Luojin, and Xianji are ice-free ports; second, unlike  downstream Tumen Jiang, it does not have the problem of silt  accumulation; and third, it is free from flooding and it costs  less to use existing facilities. For its part, meanwhile, Russia  has proposed that places like Boxiete and Vladivostok be  developed first to spearhead the drive of opening up to the  outside world.    5) Model E Pros: it tentatively accomplishes the goal of  development and reaps the benefits of economies of scale; it is  better able to attract foreign capital than the several  preceding models and bring out the complementariness of  resources.    Cons: initial exchange costs quite substantial; management  and coordination still present enormous difficulties; South  Korea, Mongolia, and Japan still unable to play their proper  role.    Both China and Russia find this model acceptable. As a  matter  of fact, Chinese experts have proposed adopting this model. The  main roadblock comes from North Korea. In 1984 North Korea  introduced a limited open policy, which militates against  expanding economic ties with other nations in the region, which,  in turn, will necessarily hamper the formation of a cooperation  zone in Tumen Jiang.    6) Model F Pros: can attract foreign capital; utilizes the  strengths of multinational consortia and corporations when it  comes to funding, technology, and management; short-term  pay-offs substantial. Leads to considerable economies of scale.    Cons: High initial exchange costs. There is no guarantee  that the objective of development in the zone will be achieved.  Out of self-interests, the multinational consortium or  corporation typically pursues short-term benefits while ignoring  the region's long-term interests. It may cause the Matai effect.  Transfer prices may get out of control. Macro-management  presents great difficulties. The three nations are not up to the  task. Special preferential policies are needed to create the  investment climate to attract foreign capital, something beyond  the capacity of the three nations. It is well worth our while to  examine ways of ensuring the investors' interests. A banking and  trade center is unlikely to materialize in the short run.  Besides there is no guarantee this model will lead to the  development of the region and other areas.    The adoption of this model must be made conditional on the  implementation of Model E. Otherwise it simply will not work.    7) Model G Pros: achieves the goal of development; better  able to utilize the complementariness of resources; achieves  economies of scale in a big way; effective in attracting foreign  capital; more harmonious relations among the three nations;  internal institutional stability; easy to coordinate policies.    Cons: extremely high initial exchange costs; hard to  reconcile the interests of the three nations and resolve their  conflicts; the complexity and diversity of the region  complicates the operations of the model in practice; management  would have trouble keeping up. Model still fails to engage  Japan, Mongolia, or South Korea actively in it.    It is extremely difficult to put this model into practice.  The conditions are just not there in the real world. First, the  issue of sovereignty. Arduous negotiations are necessary here.  Second, the three nations' attitudes. North Korea finds the  model unacceptable. China and Russia are more flexible but are  still deterred by doubts about whether it can be properly run,  about its ability to attract foreign capital on a large scale,  and about its future and success from rushing to embrace it. Be  that as it may, this model is one of cooperation at an advanced  level that is well worth looking into.    8) Model H Pros: It can fully accomplish the objective of  development and ensure the interests of all parties. It is  effective in attracting foreign capital and technology in large  quantities and reconciling the conflicts among the various  parties. It is amenable to scientific management and can  generate substantial social, ecological, and economic benefits.  It is better suited to enable Japan, South Korea, and Mongolia  to play their proper role. Under this model, resources can be  truly complementary and we can effectively tap their potential.  The region can serve as a strong disseminator of technology and  gradually helps drive the development of northeast Asia as a  whole, achieving optimal economies of scale. It also sets an  example for other forms of multilateral cooperation.    Cons: It incurs hefty initial exchange costs and entails  extremely tough negotiations. However, once the model is in  place, all nations in northeast Asia will benefit from it  tremendously. This is cooperation of a high order. Nevertheless,  further reform of the existing UN management system is needed  before it can undertake this monumental task.    The fact of the matter is that as an international  authoritative body that is neutral, nonprofit, technical, and  disinterested, the United Nations has consistently held high the  banner of peace and development. It is a strong advocate of  development. All nations recognize its organizational, research  and development, managerial, and fund-raising abilities; its  capacity for attracting, organizing, and putting qualified  personnel to work; and its achievements over the past few  decades. For this reason, it is the best candidate to play the  administrative role. With the United Nations actively supporting  and working hard on behalf of the development of the region, it  is possible it may accept the role. Let us analyze the attitudes  of the various nations. Russia has now adopted a policy of  opening itself up across the board and is looking for a powerful  engine to boost the development of all Siberia and its Far East,  so it is expected to take a positive view. Since Deng Xiaoping  toured south China and delivered a number of speeches there,  China has opened itself further, emphasizing economic  construction as the central task. As we see it, provided the  territory belongs to China, provided UN administration can lead  to the development of the Tumen Jiang region and fuel the  development of the northeast as a whole, making China more  powerful overall, China may support this model. And so will  Japan, South Korea, and Mongolia. North Korea may well reserve  judgment. But if other nations in northeast Asia support it  unanimously and put in painstaking work, in the end North Korea  will also go along with it.</p>

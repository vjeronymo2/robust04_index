The Tariff Policy Commission of the State Council has  decided  that provisional tariffs are to be levied on imports of major  raw materials for agricultural and industrial production,  including farm chemicals and pesticides.    Imports of products which China either does not produce or  in  which the country faces shortages, such as spare parts for major  machinery and electric products, is also on the list of  provisional tariff rates.    China will also collect tariffs at provisional rates on nine  categories of exports, including lead, zinc, tin, phosphorus and  benzine.    The customs official said that the move is part of the bid  to  reduce the effects on the prices of imports which may be brought  about by the currency reform to going into force on January 1,  1994.    The provisional tariffs are lower than the present  preferential tariffs spelled out in the country's tariff rules  for imports and exports, and some tariff rates on export  commodities will be reduced to zero under the provisional rates.    China cut tariffs on 2,898 categories of imports last month.</p>

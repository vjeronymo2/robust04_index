			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 30 (CNS) -- The real estate market  has to be standardized this year, according to the Minister of  Construction Mr. Hou Jie. Work has to be done in several  sectors to achieve this end.    -- The primary market where the transfer of land is possible  has to be put under proper administration. The amount of land  supply, location and purpose have to strictly observe the  planning. The purpose and nature concerning the use of land  have to be clearly defined. The practice of administrative  allocation of land has to be reduced to the minimum while the  transfer of land with payment has to be employed.    -- The transfer and management of land has to be  strengthened. Before enforcement of the "Real estate law" the  ministry will make known as soon as possible regulations on land  transfer, sales of commodity housing and the transacting of real  estate. They cover rules and procedures for real estate trading  as well as punishment for violation of the regulations.    -- The taxation system for real estate has to be improved  with the interests of and rights enjoyed by the parties  concerned taken into consideration.    -- The market function has to be strengthened and  intermediary service has to be exploited to cover information,  consultation, assessment and the role of agent. Professional  workers in these sectors have to be trained. Requirements will  have to be set for entry into this profession. The state will  soon promulgate regulations on the evaluation and registration  of real estate.    -- A price system for real estate has to be set up and  principles for prices for commodity housing, welfare housing and  standard housing have to be confirmed. Land price and  corresponding taxation policy have also to be formulated.    -- Administration of foreign investment in real estate has  to  be strengthened. Foreign capital is allowed to be involved in  general residential housing, a great potential market featuring  a relatively short period for the input of investment.  International practice has to be employed in the administration  of foreign investment in real estate.    -- The government must not apply excessive intervention in  the real estate sector. Land prices have been decided not by  the market but by the government in the past and the blind  establishment of development zones is attributed to such  practice. Administrative functions and standardization by the  government has to be properly handled.    -- The "Real estate law" has to be made public and brought  into force as soon as possible. Loss of control of real estate  last year was mainly due to the weak legal system. The law  drafted by the ministry has been submitted to the State Council  for appraisal and approval and it is expected that the law will  come into force shortly.</p>

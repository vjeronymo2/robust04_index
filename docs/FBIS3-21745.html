			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 28 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian authorities have  dealt a very severe blow to the drug traffickers in the region  when the police seized 3.5 tonnes of cocaine basic paste in the  Manu jungle, which is the drug traffickers' new center of  operations.    Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, the president of the Armed Forces  Joint Command and commanding general of the Peruvian Army,  stated the drug seized is comparable to 50 percent of all the  cocaine seized in the Peruvian Amazons jungle over the past  three years.    The basic paste, from which cocaine is refined, was stored  at  an abandoned airport at Boca Manu, in the jungle Department of  Madre de Dios, adjacent to Bolivia and Brazil. According to  authorities, drug traffickers have started to use this area in  the past three months. Apparently, the basic paste was coming  from Bolivia and was to be shipped to Colombia. The operation  was prepared by the Army, the National Drug Police, and U.S.  Drug Enforcement Administration personnel.    Gen. Hermoza stated that the drug cache belonged to drug  trafficker Cachique Rivera, another Peruvian drug kingpin who  was unknown to the public up to now. During the past three  months, Madre de Dios residents have been reporting airplanes in  the area; possibly Colombian airplanes picking up basic paste in  Peru.    Last week, the police seized a shipment of 30 tons of  sulfuric acid which was being transported by three persons--who  were also arrested--to the Palmapampa area in the southern  Andean Ayacucho Department. The drug traffickers have also  established bases in this area. Sulfuric acid is indispensable  to producing cocaine basic paste.    The weekly SI publication reported today that drug  trafficking prospers "under the very noses of the Army" in the  Huallaga Valley area in the jungle Department of San Martin.  The weekly notes "a large part of the Huallaga population lives  off drug trafficking money, in one way or another. There is no  authority or institution that has not been infiltrated by drug  terrorism."    According to the SI publication, Colombian Waldo Vargas  Arias, alias "Ministro," pays $100 a month to teachers in  several towns to improve their wages. "Ministro" is a partner  of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez, alias "Vaticano," who was  arrested in Cali (Colombia) on 14 January and sent to Peru on  that same day.    The weekly reports that drug airplanes leave the Bellavista  community regularly although nobody sees or knows anything.  "Don't forget everybody here eats when there is a flight," a  local authority, who asked his name not be revealed, told SI.    However, since former Army Major Evaristo Castillo charged  complicity between military personnel and the drug  traffickers--charges he reiterated yesterday,  Sunday--authorities have initiated operations to find "Ministro"  and assert he will soon fall into the hands of the police.    Authorities announced on Friday the Drug Police have  arrested nine drug traffickers, five of them Colombians, members  of the organization headed by "Ministro" in Bellavista. The  Bellavista community is close to another community called  Campanilla, where "Vaticano" used to have a mansion. However,  community residents told reporters they do not know Chavez or if  he lived in this town.</p>

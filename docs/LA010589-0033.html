			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DULZURA  </P> <P> The four people killed in a traffic accident on California 94 were identified  Wednesday by the coroner's office as Marisa Marisca, 23; Rosa Garcia, 20;  Cipriano Fernandez-Rueda, 19, and Edialberto Tinajero-Saucedo, 25, all of  Tecate, Mexico.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol said the accident occurred late Tuesday afternoon  east of Dulzura when a westbound tractor-trailer rig filled with bottled water  toppled over while going around a curve and landed on the victims' car.  </P> <P> The crushed eastbound car caught fire, killing the four occupants and starting  a small brush fire. The fire was extinguished by members of the Jamul Volunteer  Fire Department.  </P> <P> The victims, who were trapped in their car beneath the truck, died of burns and  carbon monoxide poisoning, Deputy Coroner George Dickason said.  </P> <P> Authorities said that after tipping over, the truck slid in the eastbound lane,  striking another vehicle and injuring Manuel Campa, 26, also of Tecate. He  suffered minor injuries.  </P> <P> Authorities declined to say how fast the truck driver, Bobby Fanning, 31, of  Chula Vista, was traveling when the accident occurred, but indicated that speed  might have been a contributing factor in the accident.  </P> <P> The CHP is conducting a full investigation, after which it will determine  whether charges will be brought against Fanning, who suffered minor injuries.  </P></p>

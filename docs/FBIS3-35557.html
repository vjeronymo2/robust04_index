			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the savage attack of the Zionists against  the ranks of fasting Muslim Palestinians in the shrine of his  holiness Abraham in the town of Hebron, his eminence Ayatollah  Khamene'i, the guardian of Muslims, has issued a statement. The  text of the eminent leader's statement is as follows:    In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. The  villainous attack by the Zionists against worshippers in the  occupied town of Hebron, which left dozens dead and hundreds  injured, is one of those model crimes which can only be brought  about by the cruel and bigoted hands of the Zionists and is in  keeping with the villainy and wretchedness of the usurpers of  Palestine.    This tragic blow is a reminder of the Zionists' other mass  killings throughout the years of occupation, with this  difference, that, today, this enormous crime took place before  the eyes of the entire world. Will the consciences which have  remained indifferent to what has been happening to Palestinians  in their own homes be awakened by this tragedy? Will the false  seekers of peace with the usurper enemy realise their mistake  now? Will organizations and governments that claim to defend  human rights, which have disregarded the gravest violation of a  nation's rights over a period of years, finally end their  shameless silence now and confess to their past sins? Will the  American Government accept that it is an accomplice to those who  have shed the blood of innocent Palestinians, because it has  consistently given its unconditional support to the Zionist  government? Or will everyone ignore this tragic incident once  again, without accepting its implications and learning any  lessons just as they have failed to pay any attention to the  other great tragedy of the times in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    Nevertheless, the Palestinian nation will undoubtedly learn  the appropriate lesson from this incident. Today, once again,  the bitter truth has been driven home to that oppressed nation  that it must fight in its own home in order to be able to live  there. It has been driven home to them that the Zionists --  despite the elegant statements of some of their leaders --  continue to be the same racist and bigoted savages they have  been for the past 50 years. And they only need the slightest  opportunity or excuse to inflict the most villainous blows on  the Palestinians who are the true owners of the land.    Even the most slow-to-believe Palestinians must now be  convinced that the arrogant regimes that make so many claims  about the need for the security of the Zionists do not care in  the slightest about the security of Muslim Palestinians;  otherwise, the Israeli Army would not dare to massacre sacred  worshippers in this way.    It is through arming and attacking the interests of the  usurping regime that the Palestinians can obtain the right of  life and livelihood in their own home. Such is the lesson of the  Friday morning incident at Hebron. Muslim governments and  nations also have a great responsibility. The least that Muslim  nations can demand is the handing over of the murderers and  their collaborators in the Zionist army to Muslim Palestinians  for the execution of religious retribution and the dismissal of  that army's commanders. Of course, the final and only solution  is to dispossess the usurping Zionists and to transfer Palestine  to Palestinians of all religions and nationalities.    While expressing condolences to the innocent people of  Palestine, in particular the relatives of the martyrs of the  incident, I beseech God Almighty for forgiveness for the  deceased, the recovery of the wounded who were fasting, the  reform of the Muslim conditions, and a just solution to the  Palestinian issue, and call on all to pursue this matter with  all their might.    [Signed] Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i    [Dated] 25 February 1994</p>

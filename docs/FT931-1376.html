			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo rebuts criticism by Clinton JAPAN hit back yesterday against strong criticism of its trading practices by President Bill Clinton. The US leader's statement on Tuesday that the prospect of gaining fair access to the Japanese market was 'somewhat remote' was based on a misunderstanding of that market, said Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 'His understanding of the Japanese market is wrong,' Mr Hatakeyama told the FT. Japan was the largest market for US agricultural products and the second largest for US manufactured goods. If Japanese markets were really difficult to access, this could not be the case. President Clinton's statement that the trade imbalance with Japan was the only one that did not seem to change very much was also untrue, said Mr Hatakeyama. Japan's imports from the US had increased in value from Dollars 48.2bn in 1989 to Dollars 52.1bn last year. It was not appropriate to compare Japan's trade surplus with the situation in other countries since there was a difference in competitiveness, Mr Hatakeyama said. Japan was more competitive than other US trading partners. The minister repeated the Japanese government's rejection of the US suggestion that it should set market share targets as a measurement of access. 'We are working in a free market which cannot be changed by artificial means,' he said. The US-Japan trade balance should be improved through efforts to reduce the US budget deficit and raise US competitiveness, in the government's view. Mr Hatakeyama welcomed President Clinton's decision not to act unilaterally by raising US tariffs on minivans from 2.5 per cent to 25 per cent but to address the issue 'in the context of of a larger set of trade issues'. Raising the tariff would have been a breach of Gatt rules. Further Japanese steps to open its markets and expand domestic demand were promised yesterday by Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet secretary. The issue would be addressed by Mr Yoshiro Mori, trade minister, during his visit to Washington later this week, he said. Mr Kono pointed out, however, that the surplus has grown even though the volume of imports into Japan had not fallen. This was in part due to the rise in the value of the yen.</p>

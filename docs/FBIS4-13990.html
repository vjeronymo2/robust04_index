			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "China's Goodwill Gesture"] </F>   [Text] The Chinese ambassador, Mr Cheng Ruisheng's  statement, that Beijing is soon likely to officially recognise  Sikkim's merger with India, is further good tidings for New  Delhi and indicates that India can now look forward to the  dividends of last year's agreement which marked a departure from  past hostility between the two countries. Ever since Indira  Gandhi's decision to make the "Protectorate" of Sikkim a State  of the Republic in 1975, Beijing has steadfastly questioned the  legality of the annexation. More than the technicality of the  Himalayan kingdom's merger with India and whether or not a  sovereign nation had been subjugated, Beijing was bothered by  the disappearance of a buffer between India and China. After  all, Sikkim had been the gateway to Tibet and its merger with  India meant pushing the Indian frontier that much forward.  Indeed, Chinese unhappiness with the turn of the events was  reflected in Beijing's refusal to acknowledge Sikkim as a part  of the Indian Union, a view which has been repeatedly expressed  over the years.    It was Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China that led to a softening  in Beijing's stand on Sikkim insofar as any official mention of  the protectorate's merger with India was concerned. It is  possible that the Chinese political leadership remained unhappy  with the merger, but it refrained from striking public postures  on the issue. Two factors have since contributed to the removal  of doubts in Beijing about India's motives behind granting  Sikkim statehood: First, the Prime Minister's visit to China  last year which led to the Sino- Indian agreement on maintaining  peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control; and,  second, China's interest in forging a regional front to prevent  the U.S. from meddling in Asian affairs. Both the factors have  contributed towards an upswing in Sino-Indian relations to the  detriment of America's hegemonistic designs in the region, an  added spinoff being the weakening of the Pakistan-China axis.    True, Beijing's official recognition of Sikkim's merger will  not necessarily mean the removal of all irritants in Sino-Indian  relations; neither should it be seen as indicative of a smooth  road to solving the vexatious border dispute. At the same time,  the benefits of narrowing down differences in other areas by  stepping around what is apparently an intractable problem cannot  be over- emphasised. Some problems will continue to plague  Sino-Indian relations and both New Delhi and Beijing will have  to learn to cope with them if a lasting relation is to be forged  between the two Asian giants. For instance, Beijing will have  to stop doubting New Delhi's official position on Tibet -- that  it is an autonomous zone of China -- and accept the  inevitability of pluralism in a democratic society. By  cavilling at views on Tibet's future expressed by individuals at  seminars and rallies, like it did recently, Beijing will be  running the risk of setting the clock back. A better option  would be to hasten the reopening of the silk route which once  connected two civilisations.</p>

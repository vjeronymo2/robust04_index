			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BECKER, AGASSI ADVANCE IN PRO INDOOR  </P> <P> Second-seeded Boris Becker rallied from a first-set loss to overpower Christo  van Rensburg, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, Friday night in the $602,500 U.S. Pro Indoor  Tennis Championships at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Earlier, top-seeded Andre Agassi defeated Dan Goldie, 6-1, 6-4, advancing to a  semifinal match today against third-seeded Tim Mayotte, who defeated Brad  Gilbert, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.  </P> <P> Becker will meet No. 4-seeded Mikael Pernfors of Sweden, who defeated Robert  Seguso, 6-4, 6-3.  </P> <P> Becker had eight double-faults, including three in the fourth game of the first  set and two in the second game of the third set, both times losing his service.  "Sometimes my concentration goes a little," he said.  </P> <P> Goldie, seeded eighth, made a stand in the second set against Agassi after  trailing 1-3. Both players used a two-handed backhand as they dueled from the  baseline, and Goldie closed the gap to 4-5.  </P> <P> In the 14-point final game, Agassi lost five match points, then Goldie  backhanded a volley wide to set up the sixth. Then Goldie hit a return into the  net to end it.  </P> <P> For the second time in 10 days, John McEnroe had little trouble beating Carl  Uwe Steeb of West Germany, this time advancing to the semifinals of the  $291,000 Grand Prix tournament at Lyon, France, with a 6-2, 6-2 win.  </P> <P> Last week McEnroe beat the West German, ranked 92nd in the world, handily in  the first round of the Milan tournament.  </P> <P> "After I took the game at 1-1, I feel the tide just turned. I was feeling very  comfortable," McEnroe said. "Everything just felt right. That's what I hope to  have in the next two days."  </P> <P> McEnroe, seeded second, will next play Jonas Svensson, who defeated fellow  Swede Magnus Gustafsson, 6-2, 6-0.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Martina Navratilova defeated Jenny Byrne of Australia, 6-1, 6-3, to  reach the semifinals of the $250,000 Virginia Slims of California at Oakland.  </P> <P> Navratilova will face Larisa Savchenko of the Soviet Union, who defeated Patty  Fendick, 6-1, 6-1. Another Soviet player, second-seeded Natalia Zvereva,  advanced and will meet Zina Garrison.  </P></p>

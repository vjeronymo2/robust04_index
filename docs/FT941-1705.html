			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Institutions boost investment levels Investment by UK pension funds, insurance companies, investment and unit trusts shot up last year, reflecting the rebuilding of personal savings and a switch by savers away from cash to securities. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that total net investment by institutions in 1993 was a record Pounds 52.2bn, compared with Pounds 35.8bn in 1992. It was also at a record Pounds 14.9bn in the fourth quarter of last year, up from Pounds 13.6bn in the third. 'The figures show that the personal savings are there, and are finding their way to the investment institutions,' said Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley. 'Consumers no longer want to hold their assets in the form of money but want to put them into securitised savings.' Particularly striking was a sharp jump in land and property investment in the fourth quarter, a move that highlighted a decisive change in investors' sentiments towards the UK property and land market. Net investment in 'other' assets increased to Pounds 2.3bn in the three months to December, reflecting investment of Pounds 1bn in UK land, property and ground rent. This followed disinvestment in the previous two quarters. Investment in UK company shares also rose from a net Pounds 4.1bn in the third quarter to Pounds 4.9bn in the fourth. Institutions' net investment in overseas securities rose from Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.6bn. Overall, the annual level of net investment in both UK and overseas company securities increased substantially last year. For UK company shares the amount rose from Pounds 8.1bn in 1992 to Pounds 20.9bn. After a disinvestment of Pounds 0.5bn in overseas companies in 1992, flows last year increased to Pounds 11.2bn. Investment in UK government bonds, or gilts, remained strong, although last year's net investment of Pounds 13.2bn fell short of 1992's record Pounds 15.4bn net total. Looked at by institutional group, the CSO figures show that all groups, apart from pension funds, increased their net investment last year. The increase was particularly marked for unit trusts which enjoyed their best ever year for inflows from private investors. Net investment by unit trusts rose from Pounds 1.4bn in 1992, to a record Pounds 10.8bn last year. In the fourth quarter, activity by investment trusts staged the most striking pick-up. This partly reflected the launch of several new trusts at the end of last year that took advantage of new legislation allowing corporate investment in Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, for the first time. As a result, total net investment was a record Pounds 1.9bn in the fourth quarter, compared with Pounds 66m in the third. Net investment by pension funds increased slightly to Pounds 2.15bn in the fourth quarter. This brought the total for the year to Pounds 8bn, a similar level to the previous two years. Net investment by unit trusts and property unit trusts at Pounds 2.6bn in the fourth quarter was still at an exceptionally high level.</p>

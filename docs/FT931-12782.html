			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Supercomputer venture folds as funds dry up SUPERCOMPUTER Systems, an ambitious US supercomputer venture launched five years ago with plans to build the world's fastest computer, has closed its doors after failing to raise funds to continue development work. The company was founded by Mr Steven Chen, a supercomputer expert, when he left Cray Research in 1987. International Business Machines has funded Supercomputer Systems for the past five years, pouring Dollars 100m into the enterprise. However, IBM told SSI last month it would not continue funding the venture beyond the five-year period to which it had originally agreed. Mr Chen acknowledged his supercomputer development was behind schedule, but said the company had recently completed a prototype and had plans to deliver its first computer in October. However, SSI's operations were closed on Monday and most of the company's employees laid off. Mr Chen said: 'We were left with no alternative but to terminate our project at this point.' He added that he had been unable to find an investment banker willing to raise money through a stock offering, and that a worldwide search for new investors, to provide Dollars 60m needed to continue operations until the end of 1993, had also failed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Cong Yaping (0654 0068 1627) and Li Jianmin </F> (2621 1696 3046)]    [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA)--"Wan Li on Urban  Development" was published in Beijing today. At a ceremony  marking the book's publication, Li Ruihuan, member of the  Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, said: In urban  development, we must pay heed to long-term benefits. We must  not pursue only speed and economic benefits, disregarding  environmental benefits.    Li Ruihuan said: The publication of "Wan Li on Urban  Development" marks a major event in China's urban and rural  development. Following the republic's founding, the focus of our  work shifted from rural to urban areas. Although we were not  totally ignorant of urban planning, development, and  administration, we were indeed not very well informed. After 40  years of real experience, we have scored tremendous progress and  accumulated a wealth of experience in this regard. At the same  time, we have also learned quiet a few lessons.    Comrade Wan Li had many years of leadership experience in  urban development. "Wan Li on Urban Development" -- a  collection of 48 speeches and written instructions on urban  development written by Wan Li between 1956 and 1993 -- offers an  incisive summing-up of the republic's good and bad experience in  urban development. Li Ruihuan said: Every comrade in charge of  urban development work, leading comrades in particular, should  carefully study this book and use it as guidance in summing up  our historical experience and solving the immediate problems.    Li Ruihuan stressed in his speech: Historical experience  shows that we are more prone to mistakes when we carry out  massive economic construction and accelerate urban development  across the board. There are indeed cadres who are rather  ignorant of urban planning. Unwilling to put in some efforts to  study it or listen to people's criticism with an open mind, they  often pay attention only to local, immediate interests to the  neglect of long-term interests. They stress only economic  benefits and not environmental benefits, only the utility  functions and not the aesthetic effects, and they blindly  imitate foreign styles and belittle national traditions. In  some cities, too many high-rise buildings were built and their  layout was irrational. Shoddy outward embellishment will cause  endless trouble in later years. The colors used were  incongruous and no attention was paid to balance. The green  areas are small and untidy. All these phenomena are worrisome.  Urban development has a great impact on overall national  development and on the immediate interests of hundreds of  millions of people. A blunder in urban planning often cannot be  corrected in a short time, some cannot be corrected at all.  Leaders and administrators of all types of cities at various  levels must, out of their sense of responsibility to the state  and future generations, earnestly sum up experience, constantly  raise their levels of performance, and tackle the problems in  urban planning with a positive yet modest approach.    A graduation ceremony for the 18th training class for mayors  was held simultaneously with the book launching ceremony. Chen  Xitong and Hou Jie spoke at the graduation ceremony.</p>

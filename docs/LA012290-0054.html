			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 RESCUED AFTER THEIR SMALL PLANE CRASHES INTO SEA  </P> <P> Four people were rescued from the waters off Rancho Palos Verdes on Sunday  after their light airplane crashed into the sea, the Redondo Beach Harbor  Patrol said.  </P> <P> The crew of a charter whale-watching boat pulled the four victims from the  water minutes after the single-engine Bellanca aircraft crashed about 3:50  p.m., said Harbor Patrol spokesman Officer Kevin McCamy.  </P> <P> The victims -- two men, a woman and a 12-year-old girl -- were treated for  minor cuts and bruises at South Bay Hospital and released, McCamy said. Their  names were not released.  </P> <P> McCamy said the four-seat plane, which was returning to Santa Monica from Santa  Catalina Island, went down after its fuel pump and a back-up pump both  malfunctioned.  </P> <P> "Fortunately, the plane landed on its belly," McCamy said. "They got a  relatively good landing. They were able to gather their things and get into the  water."  </P> <P> After the victims discovered that the plane was temporarily buoyant, McCamy  said, they scrambled out of the water and onto the wings of the aircraft.  </P> <P> Moments later, the crew of the whale-watching vessel Voyager arrived and helped  the stranded foursome aboard.  </P></p>

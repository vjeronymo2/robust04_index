			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Christchurch Lib Dems play on Tory popularity dive: A disused car showroom seems an unlikely setting for a by-election victory MR WILLIE Rennie, a 25-year-old Scotsman, was yesterday sitting in a disused car showroom in east Dorset plotting the next big crisis for Mr John Major's government. 'I never underestimate the Tories,' said Mr Rennie, who will run the Liberal Democrat's campaign from the showroom at the forthcoming by-election in Christchurch. 'But even in this constituency, with its massive Tory majority, we are in with a chance.' In ordinary times such words would be dismissed as by-election bravado. Christchurch, a quiet seaside town on the south coast of England would be seen as a safe sanctuary of the Conservative party. The late Robert Adley, whose death forced the by-election, had one of the largest majorities, some 23,000, of any Tory MP in the present parliament. And Christchurch has one of the largest proportions of pensioners in any town in the country - most of whom have never thought of voting anything but Tory in their lives. The Liberal Democrats will provide the main challenge in the by-election, and they aren't sitting by waiting for the date to be set, which most expect will be in July. Mr Rennie, a veteran of previous contests, could yesterday be seen talking into a portable telephone, outlining to colleagues the facilities in the headquarters around him: a 50-place car park for canvassers; sleeping accommodation for four and the newly arrived shipment of portable by-election furniture. But if the local Conservatives feel vulnerable, they aren't showing it. At the Conservative Association, the president was nowhere to be seen. And in the Conservative Club next door, Ms Wendy Salter, a bar attendant, was amused by the suggestion that the Tories could lose. 'It's very, very Conservative here,' she said. The apparent reason behind the Conservatives' confidence is that they held on to all their seats within the Christchurch constituency in the recent county council elections. However, the Conservatives have a problem in Christchurch that could be the key to any by-election upset. Pensioners feel deeply threatened by the government's most unpopular policies. At the Highcliffe Community Centre, a question to a group of pensioners deep in a game of bowls about the imposition of value added tax on fuel and the effect of higher prescription charges brought howls of derision. 'The government put its foot in it by announcing what they would do before they went ahead and implemented the measures,' said Mrs June Mason, 62, until now a consistent supporter of the Conservatives. 'I have had a bill from my dentist to the tune of Pounds 100. I cannot possibly afford that.' The government's progressive reductions in interest rates, while reducing negative equity for many houseowners, have also reduced the returns on pensioners' savings. 'That loss of income has not angered people, but it has created concerns that were not present before,' said Mr John Cooper, an independent member of the borough council. A 50 per cent rise in bankruptcies in the town last year has not helped the Conservatives' cause, but not everyone blames them for that. 'I am not disappointed with the Conservatives,'said Mr Terry Woodford, 62, whose French Country Kitchen shop is one of the few retailers still operating in one of the main shopping centres in the middle of town. 'The current economic problems would have been difficult for any administration to avoid,' he added. A Gallup poll this week revealing Mr Major as the least popular prime minister since opinion polling began suggests Mr Woodford may be in a minority. People are wondering whether even this constituency is safe. The recent cabinet reshuffle, and Mr Norman Lamont's departure as chancellor, showed little sign of having helped to raise the government's fortunes. 'Major completely nullified the effect of Lamont's removal the day after it happened,' said Mr Ray New, a local businessman standing on top of his 22-foot yacht in the local harbour. 'The next day he said that economic policy would remain unchanged, but change is exactly what we need - in particular a concrete strategy for industry.' All these concerns are changing voters' allegiances. Strolling outside the Conservative Club yesterday, two pensioners said that for the first time in their lives they would not vote Conservative and that there is a possibility that the Tory party could lose this contest. But is the tide strong enough to overturn a gargantuan majority? Mr Rennie of the Liberal Democrats is confident: 'People do not think Lamont's removal was enough. They want to use this chance to make the government change its course or its leader.'</p>

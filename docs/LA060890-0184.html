			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FRENCH OPEN;  </P> <P> AGASSI ROLLS PAST SVENSSON, WILL MEET GOMEZ IN FINAL  </P> <P> Andre Agassi and Andres Gomez overcame rain and strong winds today in the  French Open tennis championships to reach the final of a Grand Slam tournament  for the first time.  </P> <P> The third-seeded Agassi had an easier time than the score suggested despite  dropping a set in his 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 victory over unseeded Jonas Svensson  of Sweden.  </P> <P> "He did a good job of beating himself. I had an easy start," said Agassi, the  highest surviving seed.  </P> <P> Gomez, seeded fourth, easily beat seventh-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria, 7-6,  6-1, 7-5, to qualify for Sunday's final. Agassi and Gomez have met four times,  each winning twice.  </P> <P> Agassi, 20, appeared confident about his chances against Gomez.  </P> <P> "I'm not concerned about who I play. I played Gomez a month ago in Key  Biscayne, Fla., and things worked fine for me, but it's going to be a long  afternoon.  </P> <P> "I want it pretty bad. I didn't stay in Paris for two weeks to finish in second  place, I'm going out there to win it," Agassi said after winning in two hours,  27 minutes.  </P> <P> Agassi, whose refusal to wear traditional white on court has incurred the wrath  of tennis authorities in Paris, began in style, winning the first three games  before Svensson held his serve.  </P> <P> The game was interrupted by rain briefly at the start of the match, but storm  clouds held off for the rest of the match.  </P> <P> Agassi then swept the next seven games as he surged into a two-set lead.  </P> <P> Svensson, 23, failed with most of his attempted drop shots but fought back at  the end of the second set.  </P> <P> The wind swirled around the center court in the third set, holding the ball up,  and the unseeded Swede briefly found his form as Agassi struggled with the  conditions.  </P> <P> But the American, ranked fifth in the world, came out confidently in the  fourth.  </P> <P> Agassi's service was far superior to the Swede's. He did not double-fault at  all and 80% of his first serves found the mark, compared with 57% for Svensson.  </P> <P> Svensson admitted the pressure of playing in such a big match had affected his  game.  </P> <P> "I was really nervous at the start. His game does not suit me at all. He tracks  everything down and hits it back solidly," he said.  </P> <P> Gomez, who has failed to reach even the semifinals in 26 Grand Slam  tournaments, succeeded at last on his favorite surface, clay, winning in less  than two hours.  </P> <P> "I gave everything today. I knew the way he was going to play. Maybe people saw  Muster as the favorite but I prefer it that way," he said.  </P> <P> Moving Muster around with smooth strokes and drop shots, Gomez took the first  three games in less than 10 minutes.  </P> <P> A rainy spell allowed Muster to regain his composure -- and his serve -- to  close the gap to 3-2, but he lost his serve twice again in the first set.  </P> <P> After that it all proved too much for the Austrian, who lost the next seven  games in a row to find himself two sets down in little more than 75 minutes.  </P> <P> The tennis lesson continued in the last set when Muster, broken in the third  game, only managed to break back five games later before crashing out on a last  passing shot which left him with his head bowed in despair.  </P></p>

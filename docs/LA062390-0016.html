			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOPEZ LANDFILL WORKERS SAFE, DOCTOR SAYS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: WITNESS SAYS MEN WHO WERE SICKENED BY FUMES LAST YEAR CAME IN  CONTACT WITH TOXIC GASES DURING UNCOMMON EXCAVATION WORK.  </P> <P> Lopez Canyon Landfill is safe for Los Angeles sanitation workers even though  one worker was hospitalized for 11 days after being overcome by fumes at the  dump last year, the city's industrial hygienist testified Friday.  </P> <P> Dr. Alex Guss told a hearing board of the South Coast Air Quality Management  District that he had investigated the March 9, 1989, incident involving the  worker, Keith O'Kray of Newhall, and determined that he probably had been  exposed to hydrogen sulfide, a highly poisonous gas.  </P> <P> He said O'Kray, and other workers who also became ill that day, came into  contact with a pocket of several gases during excavation work for installation  of a gas collecting system. Guss said that unless they dig into underground gas  pockets, workers normally do not come into contact with high concentrations of  toxic gas at the landfill.  </P> <P> Guss' testimony came during the sixth in a series of hearings the AQMD board is  conducting in an examination of noxious gas emissions at the only operating  landfill owned by the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Neighbors of the dump in the northeast San Fernando Valley, along with their  city and state elected representatives, have asked the hearing board to close  the landfill until the city controls methane gas emissions there.  </P> <P> AQMD inspectors, as recently as April, found that many areas of the dump  emitted methane gas at levels above 10,000 parts per million, 20 times more  than the 500 p.p.m. allowed under state law. Methane gas is not toxic itself  but is an indication of the presence of other more toxic gases, such as  hydrogen sulfide and benzene, Guss said.  </P> <P> Guss, who testified for about six hours, said that several days after the  March, 1989, incident he tested for the presence of toxic gases in the air at  the landfill. He said he found that all gases were within safe levels for  workers who spend eight hours a day, five days a week at the dump.  </P> <P> Under questioning from board members, Guss said he had not tested gas levels in  the surrounding community of Kagel Canyon where at least three children became  ill after breathing noxious fumes last Oct. 12.  </P> <P> "We have people out there close to this landfill saying it stinks and they want  us to do something about it," said board member William F. Banks.  </P> <P> Hearing board member Sharon Scott asked whether testing could be carried out in  the community before the next hearing July 5. Deputy City Atty. Christopher  Westhoff, representing the Bureau of Sanitation, said the city is now  conducting such testing. But Scott asked that AQMD engineers conduct their own  tests.  </P> <P> After the hearing, Rob Zapple of Kagel Canyon, who has led the campaign against  the landfill, said the incident involving the worker has been whitewashed for  the board.  </P> <P> "Actually, seven workers got sick that day," he said. "Two were hospitalized."  </P> <P> According to a city report, O'Kray, 33, and another worker, Carlann Paul, 29,  were hospitalized after they were exposed to unearthed materials at the north  end of the landfill. Paul was treated and released while O'Kray remained at St.  Joseph Medical Center in Burbank for 11 days.  </P> <P> City officials have said O'Kray spent six months recovering from the gas  exposure and has since returned to work.  </P> <P> Guss testified Friday that some people, including children and adults with  chronic illnesses, are more sensitive to toxic gases than others.  </P></p>

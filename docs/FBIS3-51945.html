			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Finance Minister Emilio Pereira and </F> Construction and Transportation Minister Pablo Vigil with  unidentifed reporters; place not given; from the "News and a  Little Bit More" newscast -- live]    [Excerpts][Pereira] Good evening, Radio Nicaragua, and good  evening to all Nicaraguans who are listening to us at this time.  We would like to share with you our assessment of today's events  in response to the measures the government took last night  concerning fuel prices and the decision to instruct the  Government Ministry on the preservation of public order.    The response has definitely been positive and the situation  is returning to normal. We see the people are starting to return  to work and their other activities little by little. [passage  omitted]    I am going to allow Construction and Transportation Minister  Pablo Vigil to speak because he has been monitoring the  transportation situation throughout the day. He will now speak  to you.    [Vigil] Good evening, Radio Nicaragua listeners. As Dr.  Pereira noted, we assessed the development of the transportation  situation nationwide. At this time we can confirm, from touring  Managua and based on reports we have received from the regions  of the country, that the police have guaranteed unobstructed  transit on all our roads and highways in a very normal way,  except for a few points in Managua, near the facilities of the  Parrales-Vallejo Cooperative.    We have observed that citizens have been able to freely move  about and drive the streets of Managua and the highways today.  The police have maintained constant patrols. We noticed great  calm. Certain routes of urban and interurban bus lines have  started to operate. There was greater activity in the afternoon.  We noticed a normalization in activities. We think this is a  positive response by citizens to the measures the government  announced on 25 January.    We urge carriers who have not yet returned to work to do so  tomorrow because we think that to increase production and  progress we must show support and solidarity with those who have  made great efforts to reach their workplaces.    Fortunately, people have found solutions to their  transportation problems. This has prevented an interruption of  most economic activities in the country. Therefore, I urge the  people in general, those who have not yet returned to work,  especially the drivers, to do so on 27 January.    Of course, as the government, we are always willing to talk  with all sectors. As representatives of the transportation  sector, we are always willing to negotiate and talk with the  various members of a sector as important as this one.    We must clarify that the fuel problem is not the only one  facing the transportation sector. It is essential we maintain a  dialogue, and an attitude that will allow us to find  alternatives to ensure the citizens have adequate transportation.    Radio Nicaragua, thank you very much. To the Nicaraguan  people, we say the government is very determined to find  solutions to all problems to ensure we will have a better  Nicaragua in the future. Thank you very much.</p>

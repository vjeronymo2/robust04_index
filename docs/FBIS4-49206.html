			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Notes on a northern journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping </F> (5012 0393): "Three Major Worries Disturb Deng Xiaoping"]    [Text] "The World Regards My Life and Death as a  Critical Point"    There is a saying: When a man is dying, his words are nice;  when a bird is dying, its voice is pitiful. Aware that his  remaining years are few, Deng Xiaoping recently talked about  what would happen after his death. Sometimes he referred to  China's situation after his death, and sometimes he talked about  arrangements after his death. Recently, he talked soberly about  arrangements after his death and the current situation. He said:    I note that the world is still paying attention to me and  regards my personal role, health, and life or death as a  critical point. This is not normal. The day I meet the premier  [Zhou Enlai] and my comrades in arms is approaching. This is  the law of nature. But I am not going as fast as people  overseas think. I have said time and again that neither I nor  my remarks should be given too much publicity or lauded too  much; instead propagation should be given to the party's line,  principles, and policies, as well as the leadership of the party  Central Committee and the State Council. I would like to say  once again that after I am no longer around, do not hold  large-scale ceremonies, do not praise me too highly, and do not  give too much publicity to my remarks, writings, or work; still  less should a memorial hall or statue be built for me. People  in various circles should be discouraged from doing this.  <H5>  Document No. 94019 Quotes Deng Xiaoping's Recent Remarks </H5>   Deng Xiaoping's remarks were relayed to the Political Bureau  by Jiang Zemin recently. On 11 April the CPC Central Committee  Secretariat issued "classified" document No. 94019, entitled  "General Secretary Jiang Zemin Relays Deng Xiaoping's Important  Remarks to the Political Bureau." This document summed up the  main points of Deng Xiaoping's remarks at the National People's  Congress in March and during a meeting of the Political Bureau  Standing Committee members in early April. Apart from talking  about arrangements after his death, Deng Xiaoping also appraised  the Central Committee's work and current problems.  <H5>  Deng Xiaoping Confirms the Central Leadership </H5>   Deng Xiaoping delivered a high appraisal of the central  leadership. Jiang Zemin relayed this by saying:    In the four years since the Fourth Plenary Session of the  13th CPC Central Committee to the new leadership elected at the  14th CPC Central Committee, practice has proven that this is a  staunch, competent, united, and farsighted leadership, which  enjoys the people's trust and support, as well as international  support. The Political Bureau and its Standing Committee have  withstood the stiffest tests; this is very important. Comrades  of the Central Military Commission have a clear-cut stand and  closely follow the party Central Committee. Now, our situation  is stable, well-founded, and ensured. There is a stable  political situation of unity between the party, the government,  and the military. This suggests that the party's line,  principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee have been correct and should be  further implemented and developed. Chen Yun, Wan Li, Shangkun,  Yibo, Desheng, and I are of the opinion that leaders of your  generation are more competent than we are, more farsighted, less  bookish, less dogmatic, less affected by old conventions, and  are quick in changing your brains.  <H5>  When Talking About the Current Situation, Deng Xiaoping </H5> Revealed His Uneasiness    Despite his satisfaction with the Central Committee  leadership group, Deng Xiaoping revealed his uneasiness when  talking about the party's main tasks. He pointed out that  localism, intra-party corruption, and "leftist" interference are  three major problems. The chief architect does not seem to have  a method to resolve these problems.  <H5>  Localism Is Ruining the Party's Cause </H5>   Deng Xiaoping expressed his indignation over intra-party  factionalism, sectarianism, and localism. He said:    We must frequently and repeatedly say in the party that it  is  impermissible to engage in factionalism or sectarianism, or to  put oneself above the party committee; we must guard against  this. Intra-party factionalism is not allowed because it will  ruin the party's cause and the country's future. At present, it  is necessary to rectify and overcome sectarianism and localism.  We must admit and acknowledge that localism, sectarianism, and  intra-party anarchy have played a destructive role in the  implementation of the party's policies and principles and to our  cause. Leaders who cannot consciously correct or do not  acknowledge their mistakes in work must be replaced,  transferred, rectified, and reorganized. We must be resolute.    Corruption Has Caused Party To Lose Its Leadership  Initiative    Deng Xiaoping pointed out that intra-party corruption at  present has gone beyond what people imagine and that the  consequences are very serious. He said:    I have noted that anticorruption work needs more courage and  effort. Anticorruption work has yielded results in previous  periods. Corruption is more serious and complicated than we  imagine. In localities and departments where corruption is  serious, they cannot be politically clean and their leadership  groups are weak and lax. I have told some veteran comrades that  in combating corruption, we should proceed from ourselves and  our families and relatives; veteran and middle-aged cadres  should not commit mistakes in this respect. Recently, some  people have said that there is also corruption in Europe, Japan,  Asia, and Taiwan and that their corruption is very serious.  This comparison is very dangerous. If corruption cannot be  resolved, our party and government will lose their leadership  initiative and it will be hard for us to have a reputation for  giving instructions and guidance. In this scenario, our cause  will fail.  <H5>  "Interference From Many Aspects" Must Be Removed </H5>   This chief architect admitted that reform is meeting  interference from many aspects, particularly from the "left"  aspect (he first mentioned such interference). He stressed the  problem of "interference from within the contingent itself" and  that the problem of not complying with the Central Committee  ideologically or in actions should be resolved. This was  targeted at conservatives. In relaying Deng Xiaoping's remarks,  Jiang Zemin said:    In carrying out socialist construction and reform, including  political reform, we should be sober-minded instead of being  intoxicated with self-satisfaction or complacency. There is  interference from many aspects, and this interference has  basically never stopped for the past 10-odd years. There is  "left" and right interference. Of course, there is also  interference from U.S. hegemonism and power politics; this has  never stopped. But we must resolve interference and  disturbances from within our own contingent. Namely, we must  comply with the Central Committee ideologically and in actions.  In this way, we will be able to overcome "left" and right  interference in a timely manner, instead of becoming passive.    Deng Xiaoping's "latest instructions" in classified document  No. 94019, apart from the arrangements for after his death,  soberly talked about information which is hard to obtain, and  the rest was on "major principles" and does not contain anything  new. But Jiang Zemin regards Deng Xiaoping's remarks as  imperial edicts. In fact, Jiang Zemin understands very well  that the CPC's corruption, sectarianism, and localism are  deep-rooted habits which are difficult to remove. The chief  architect's empty talk cannot help resolve practical problems.  Deng Xiaoping said that "in political reform... one should not  remain complacent." He does not mean what he says. Everyone  knows that there is no political reform in the chief architect's  blueprint. The problem is not one of marking time in political  reform; there have been no first steps at all.</p>

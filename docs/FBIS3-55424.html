			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Vladimir Grinev in </F> Kiev by correspondent Boris Sverdlov; date not given: "We Must  Learn from Russia"]    [Text] Kiev -- What was essentially a sensation took place  at the first presidential elections in Ukraine. Vladimir  Grinev, a quite youthful doctor of science from Kharkov, took  third place among the six candidates. Recalling the contest,  Vladimir Borisovich says: "At the time I was only trying my  strength. Today I am feeling more resolute."    To judge by the mounting authority of the "New Ukraine"  movement he heads, in the opinion of sociologists he has quite  good chances of becoming head of state. Especially as he has  coordinated his actions with the no less popular candidate  Leonid Kuchma. They will go to the new presidential elections  together.    Nonetheless Grinev believes that at the present stage for  Ukraine the election of a new president is not the main issue.  Beginning radical reforms without delay is far more urgent.  Because for the young independent state which has come under the  pressure of economic and political collapse delay is like death.    [Grinev] I believe that Ukraine has fallen into a quagmire  because of an abominable domestic and foreign policy, he says.  Having won independence through suffering, its president and  Supreme Soviet decided to set off on their journey with the old  administrative-edict baggage. And without making any moves in  the direction of reform. And a state with an enormous domestic  potential in industry and agriculture ran aground. The attempt  to retain all-embracing state control over the economy naturally  ended in catastrophe.    Successes are no better in foreign policy. Ukraine is so  integrated with the East that in the next few decades it will be  unable to exist without it. But politicians see a threat to its  sovereignty from Russia. But the threat in fact does not come  from Russia, as the national-radicals are trying to persuade us,  but from spurning rapprochement with our Eastern neighbor.  Without Russia and the CIS countries, without economic alliance  with them, it is impossible to improve the prosperity of a  people driven into deep poverty.    From my viewpoint, we must immediate eliminate border  barriers which impede the movement of citizens, goods, and  capital. Ukraine is most interested in this. And of course we  are perturbed by RUKH leaders' statements that the thwarting of  the ratification of the treaty on economic alliance is a victory  for the democratic forces. The president, instead of adopting a  firm stance on such a decisive issue, has resorted to his  favorite method -- maneuvering and playing word games with  himself.    Meanwhile we have contrived to lag very considerably behind  Russia. I view economic alliance with it primarily as a  prerequisite for joint movement along the path of reforms.    [Sverdlov] So the present authorities cannot amend anything?    [Grinev] Naturally. The question today is this: Can the  present authorities bring Ukraine to the repeat elections  without cataclysms and in general will we live to see the repeat  elections? I can reply in the affirmative.    [Sverdlov] If you are elected president what first three  edicts will you issue?    [Grinev] The first will be on the land market, the second  on the capital market, the third on the real estate market. It  is naive to believe that without putting these levers into  operation we can, for instance, stabilize the financial system.    [Sverdlov] As deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet you  suggested to parliament your own economic program for Ukraine's  resurrection. But it was not supported....    [Grinev] There is nothing surprising in that. The  parliament tried to do in the old way what cannot be resolved  under the new conditions. But, you see, I mounted the rostrum  with the demand that the economy be reformed through the market.  It is a good thing I was not hissed off the platform. I  realized then that I could not deal with that Supreme Soviet and  I resigned.    Today there are at least five or six fine programs for  stabilizing the economy. And they have all been shelved merely  because there is no one to implement them. Neither the  president nor the parliament relies on a single political force.    [Sverdlov] You are running with Leonid Kuchma in the  election campaign. Are you not afraid? After all, it was under  Leonid Kuchma that Ukraine's economy started to crack at the  seams.    [Grinev] To be precise the seams had cracked under the  former premier. Incidentally, Kuchma's popularity rating is  increasing. He is a man who only tells the truth and who,  counter to politicians of a nationalist bent, who have only an  anti-Russian syndrome to their name, he is resolutely advocating  rapprochement with Russia. And to all appearances the majority  of voters are in solidarity with him.</p>

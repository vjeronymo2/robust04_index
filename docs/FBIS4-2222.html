			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Foreign  Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said this afternoon that reporters  acquiring essential information to promote the development of  economic relations and trade is different from stealing state  commercial, financial, and economic secrets, and we should not  confuse the two.    A few days ago, Xi Yang, a reporter with Hong Kong's MING  PAO, was pronounced guilty by China's judicial organ on the  charge of "stealing state secrets" and will serve a 12-year  prison sentence.    At a regular news briefing held here on Thursday afternoon,  Wu Jianmin answered Hong Kong reporters' questions on Xi Yang's  sentence. He said that as China is opening up more deeply to  the outside world, it is entirely justified for the overseas  community to acquire more information about us. The Chinese  side also publishes, in a timely fashion, statistical  information through various means, such as granting interviews  to reporters, and makes public all sorts of information related  to China through other channels, and our purpose is to promote  the development of economic relations and trade between China  and the outside world.    Wu Jianmin said that every country had its own commercial  and  economic secrets. In cases where someone has stolen such  secrets, he should definitely be punished.    Finally, Wu Jianmin said: If necessary, the Foreign Ministry  Information Department will, as in the past, organize news  briefings and invite relevant government officials responsible  for economic affairs to brief overseas reporters on certain  aspects of economic construction and development they want to  know about.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Countryside Pounds 11.7m in the red COUNTRYSIDE Properties, the residential, commercial and property company, unveiled losses before tax of Pounds 11.7m for the 12 months to September 30. That compared with previous profits of Pounds 3.05m and was struck after taking account of exceptional provisions of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 1.2m). A provision of Pounds 10.1m was made against development sites and there was also a deficit of Pounds 8.3m arising on a revaluation of the investment properties. The latter was partly offset against the revaluation reserve of Pounds 3.6m with the remainder of the deficit amounting to Pounds 4.7m charged to the profit and loss account. Turnover for the year fell to Pounds 79.7m (Pounds 87.1m). The contribution from the residential side rose to Pounds 70.4m (Pounds 63.6m) while that from the commercial activity fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 21m). Property investment income was Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 2.5m). Pre-exceptional profits from residential fell to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 6.7m) while the loss from commercial was cut to Pounds 775,000 (Pounds 2.4m). Losses per share emerged at 17.3p (earnings 7.2p). A same-again final dividend of 2.7p is paid from reserves and holds the total at 4.11p.</p>

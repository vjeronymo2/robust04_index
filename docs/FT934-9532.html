			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Anglian Water flat at Pounds 100.5m - Sales increase sharply, boosted by 8% price increase in April ANGLIAN WATER, one of the largest privatised water companies, was yesterday quietly optimistic about its full-year outlook in spite of reporting virtually flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 100.5m for the six months to September 30. Mr Chris Mellor, finance director, said the group was confident it 'might show some improvement on the full year'. Analysts pencilled in forecasts of Pounds 190m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 185.4m last year. The shares closed 3p down at 491p. Mr Mellor also indicated that Anglian intended to launch a concerted lobbying effort following last week's consultation document on pricing regulations in the water industry. Mr Ian Byatt, the industry regulator, has indicated he wants to cut the rate of return enjoyed by water companies from 7 per cent to about 5 per cent. 'It is something we don't see adding up,' Mr Mellor said. Anglian, was committed to spending some Pounds 2bn between 1995 and 2000, including installing compulsory metering in more than 1.3m homes. Such investment levels would require 'a rate of return which enables us to finance the business on a sustainable basis,' Mr Mellor said. Anglian's profits were achieved on a sharp rise in sales from Pounds 286.3m to Pounds 341.4m. The increase was partly due to an 8 per cent price rise in April, which accounted for Pounds 22m of sales, and also to the inclusion for a full six months of Nordic Water. Nordic Water, which was purchased in February for Pounds 38m and broke even in the first half, offers design contracting and equipment supply services to water companies in Europe and North America. Mr Mellor said Anglian expected Nordic to return a profit in the second half, and cover its interest costs for the full year. In the core water business, Anglian showed a Pounds 2.7m increase in operating profit to Pounds 118.7m. The advance was held back by a 7.5 per cent decline in measured income, or sales to industrial customers. 'Companies under cost pressure are generally looking to cut back on water consumption,' Mr Mellor said. The start-up costs of Anglian Water International resulted in a Pounds 2.2m loss, leaving an operating profit for the group of Pounds 116.5m (Pounds 114m). A 49 per cent increase in debt to Pounds 423.8m reflected the rise in capital expenditure from Pounds 147.2m to Pounds 178.9m. Investment was budgeted at Pounds 380m for the full year. Gearing was 23 per cent. The dividend was raised by 7.4 per cent to 7.3p, while earnings rose from 31.7p to 32.2p.</p>

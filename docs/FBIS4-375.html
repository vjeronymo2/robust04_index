			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] The civil war in Rwanda started all over again  following the rejection last night of the new acting president,  Theodore Sindikugbabo, by the Rwandese Patriotic Front, RPF,  rebels. Seen as a close ally of the late President Habyarimana,  who was killed in a plane crash on Wednesday [6 April], the  rebels said they would continue their march to capture the  capital, Kigali, where some of their fighters are trapped.  [passage omitted]    Just as we were about to go on the air, we received a call  from the information spokesperson of the RPF rebels. Wilson  Wutasira is in Mulindi. Alice Martin asked him what news he had  of their forces march to the capital:    [Begin recording] [Wutasira] The latest information I have  just got is that some of our troops are just between 10 to 15 km  from the capital, Kigali.    [Martin] How many troops?    [Wutasira] Well, there are two units, two units, all  fighting  units, which have gone along the Wumba-Kigali axis.    [Martin] And what is happening at the moment? Are they  fighting all the way or are they just walking in?    [Wutasira] Yes, they are fighting all the way as they come  across the government forces.    [Martin] Has there been much fighting?    [Wutasira] Well, there is a lot of fighting along the way  but  some have managed to go through.    [Martin] So you say that two battalions have crossed through  the so-called demilitarized zone and they are within 10 to 15 km  of the capital.    [Wutasira] That's right, that's right.    [Martin] Now, why should I be sure that you are telling me  the truth?    [Wutasira] Well, it is good that we give information as to  the progress of the forces as they advance.    [Martin] And who is leading the forces? Is Paul Kagame at  the head of the battalion?    [Wutasira] Well, he is with the troops.    [Martin] What do you intend to do?    [Wutasira] Well, we intend to....[pauses] Those two forces  are supposed to go and reinforce our battalion which has been  locked in fighting for the past two days.    [Martin] So, you are going to relieve a battalion of 600 who  are in the center of Kigali.    [Wutasira] That's right.    [Martin] And what else will you do when you are in Kigali?    [Wutasira] Well, we could also assist the UNAMIR [UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda] and those other forces there who  want peace and security restored in Kigali.    [Martin] Aren't you going to try and take over?    [Wutasira] Well, if that is necessary to regain security for  Kigali, then it can also be considered. [end recording]</p>

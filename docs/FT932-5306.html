			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Arts: Capriccio and Meistersinger - Opera in Berlin Heil Hitler] Few operas served the Third Reich better than Capriccio and Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg. Both were used to prove the health and strength of German art, at the very hour when the seeds of Germany's wartime destruction were being sown. Both have just been staged in Berlin in productions which resonate with images of the Nazi era. Strauss was given the idea for Capriccio by Stefan Zweig, the Jewish librettist of Die schweigsame Frau. Prevented by the Nazis from collaborating further, Zweig fled to Brazil, where he committed suicide shortly before Capriccio was premiered in war-torn Munich. The opera was completed with the help of Clemens Krauss, a known Nazi sympathiser  - but it was an anachronism, the product of a composer who blinkered himself from the world around him. Meistersinger was the ultimate paean to 'holy German art', set in the very city which symbolised the rise and fall of the Nazi master-race. Plenty of scope for re-interpretation here, you might think. Turning great works of theatre into a parable of the Nazi experience may be a cliche, but it provokes a thoughtful response from German audiences. Occasionally it illuminates. The programme books offered stimulating perspectives. But what the performances bore out was that no two operas could be more remote from the atmosphere of the 1940s. Meistersinger at the Deutsche Oper suffers least, if only because Gotz Friedrich leaves most of his production ideology where it belongs, on the drawing board. He confines his moralising to the overture, flashing up an image of Nuremberg in ruins - a grim 20th century symbol of the ills (Hans Sachs's 'Wahn') that befall a society which succumbs to chauvinism and democratic chaos. For the rest of the evening, Nuremberg assumes a Biedermeyer setting of around 1835 - when Wagner himself witnessed a riot there, and the Act two finale of Meistersinger began to germinate. The central motif of Peter Sykora's decor is a giant lens, with models of Nuremberg's town-houses bunched along the bottom curve. A circular pane of patterned glass provides the backdrop for Act one. Act two is a dingy townscape of prefabricated boxes - lacquered, like all Sykora's designs, in unremitting Prussian blue. The Festwiese could have been an aircraft hangar or a sports hall, with the chorus ranked on stands tucked away in the wings. Not a glimmer of Romanticism - nor much humour, which never was Friedrich's strong suit. On the credit side, the character-quirks of the mastersingers are beautifully etched, and the Act one singing trial is a delight. Beckmesser, sung by Eike Wilm Schulte without a hint of caricature or vulgarity, is a tragi-comic figure more interested in Pogner's money than his daughter. Pogner is majestically brought to life by Jan-Hendrik Rootering. Wolfgang Brendel, in an extremely promising role-debut, portrays Sachs as a well-coiffed, clean-shaven young philosopher-cobbler, and the voice carries handsomely. Eva Johansson was the delectably plump Eva, Paul Frey a frayed-at-the-edges Walther. The Act three quintet was one of the best I've heard. That reflected well on the Deutsche Oper's new music director, Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos. He secured clean, sensitive playing from the orchestra. The performance was brisk and unfussy. All it lacked was a sense of pathos. Much the same could be said for Hartmut Haenchen's conducting of Capriccio at the Staatsoper unter den Linden. The rich textures of Strauss's orchestra were eloquently unravelled, the singers never covered. Yvonne Kenny's debut as Countess Madeleine was an unqualified success. She looked gracious, elegant, pretty, never sounding less than confident and comfortable. Also outstanding was Siegfried Vogel, a magisterial La Roche. Other characters were barely sketched, and - apart from Rosemarie Lang's Clairon - undersung. Jonathan Miller's production, designed by Peter Davison and Sue Blane, was set in a bombed-out Munich rehearsal hall. Before a note was heard, the cast and attendants gathered on stage to the sound of a German wartime news broadcast (complete with the war-theme from Liszt's Les Preludes). After the sound faded, Strauss's serene string sextet started up and the 'rehearsal' began in period costume. The performance was clumsily staged and littered with unnecessary ideas. At the final curtain, the sight and sound of an allied air raid loomed through the crumbling back wall, and the cast reassembled to watch in silence. The only authentic touch missing from this crass, charmless setting was the cry of Heil Hitler]</p>

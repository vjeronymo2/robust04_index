This  has been verified by a NATO military inspection from the Kingdom  of Belgium, in which experts from the other states of the North  Atlantic alliance were also represented, as is customary.  Foreign monitors inspected and counted up all the equipment due  for destruction between 13 January and 24 February. More than  90 tanks and about 50 infantry fighting vehicles will be cut up  for scrap and partially re-equipped as vehicles for use in the  national economy.</p>

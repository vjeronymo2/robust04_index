			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Cabin crew strike hits Cathay Pacific CATHAY PACIFIC, Hong Kong's international airline, was last night facing its worst industrial action since 1985 after cabin crews went on strike, claiming the airline had inadequate staffing levels, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. Half of Cathay's 28 outbound flights and 13 of its 31 inbound flights were cancelled. The company was unable to determine how many of the 4,000 cabin attendants were on strike. Industrial action is virtually unknown in Hong Kong. Cathay's last serious dispute was in 1985, when ground staff went on strike. The dispute centres on Cathay's requirement that its cabin attendants accept working 'out of position'. This has meant that senior cabin attendants have had to operate in junior positions in the event of a staff shortage due to sickness. A Flight Attendants Union official said yesterday Cathay employed 300 fewer cabin attendants than it should, but the company denied this. 'There is no shortage of cabin attendants, our staff grows in line with the growth in our fleet,' it said. Hong Kong's Labour Department offered to mediate in the dispute, which has been brewing over the past three months.</p>

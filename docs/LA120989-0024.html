			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR HIGH DROPOUT PROBLEM BURDENS LOS ANGELES SCHOOLS  </P> <P> In regard to the junior high dropout problem, I would like to voice my support  of the new program that helps students feel more comfortable in a stressful,  unfamiliar environment. A more personal relationship between students and  teachers makes the students want to learn, and the more a student wants to  learn, the less chance he has of dropping out. Retreats and camping trips can  make a "loner" feel more secure; therefore, making him want to become involved  further. Acceptance by eighth graders, through the suggested "adoption," can  also make fearful newcomers less worried. When other concerns are lightened or  altogether alleviated, a student can concentrate more on staying in and doing  well in school.  </P> <P> A larger portion of tax money should be directed towards the schools with a  high dropout rate. This money should be used to increase the pay of teachers  who actively participate in school unity projects, to help pay for elective  classes which are interesting to the student, and to help support a program  which teaches parents how to encourage their children to stay in school.  </P> <P> The students of today are the future of tomorrow. How do you think our future  will look when some junior highs have a dropout rate as high as 28%?  </P> <P> With thoughtful planning, our schools will be able to keep more students from  dropping out, and even truly enjoying school.  </P> <P> KARI SCHRAG  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

Current Onusal Chief Augusto  Ramirez Ocampo, who has headed the delegation since March 1993,  stressed that he is leaving El Salvador convinced that democracy  will continue moving irreversibly forward. According to the  peace agreements, the only pending issue concerns the full  deployment of the National Civilian Police [PNC], scheduled for  22 September, and the dissolution of the current National Police  on 31 October at the latest. In addition, Ramirez said that  although there were delays in the land transfer process, it has  been expedited in the past few weeks, as well as the  indemnification for former fighters of the Armed Forces.    [Begin Ocampo recording] To bid farewell, I have only words  of gratitude for the Salvadoran people who accepted me with  generosity, kindness, and cooperation. I must thank President  Alfredo Cristiani and his government, which I believe has  reached continental status, for promoting as successful a peace  process as the Salvadoran peace process. I also want to praise  the cooperation of and the work done by the Political Committee,  headed by Coordinator Jorge Shafik Handal, of the FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]. It has proven that  it is deeply committed to peace. This is why I am leaving with a  clear conscience and with the sense of having accomplished the  duties and mission assigned. I could predict that peace has  indeed irreversibly rooted in this country. The parameters that  shook our America for so many decades have been successfully  overcome in El Salvador. The dedication, effort, commitment, and  spirit of dialogue, which prevailed not only during the 28  months of negotiations that were so complex and difficult, in  search of such agreements, have followed a similar trend after  the Chapultepec agreement. [end recording]    Meanwhile, new Onusal Chief Ter Horst pointed out that he  already held significant talks with the presidential candidates,  who will participate in a virtual run-off election, and with  President Cristiani. They have all promised to comply with the  agreements that are still pending in El Salvador. His stay in  the country will be significant not only because of his personal  experience, but because of the political and diplomatic  experience he will gain as Onusal chief.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Ivanov report: "Somalia and Bosnia Not on Offer. </F> United Nations Forms Additional Contingent of `Blue Helmets'"]    [Text] An interesting progression. Whereas in 1987  peacekeeping operations were carried out by UN forces in five  areas of the planet and the number of "Blue Helmets" was then  10,000 soldiers and officers, today 70,000 UN troops are  insufficient to pacify the warring sides in 17 hotbeds of  tension.    Fifteen countries prepared to put at least another 50,000  soldiers under arms have responded to the world community's call  to increase the ranks of the peacekeeping forces.    In January of this year UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali  authorized the French Colonel Gerard Gobyez [surname as  transliterated] to poll the 184 UN members on the subject of  their readiness to facilitate the imposition of order in the  world. The Gobyez team flew to 50 world countries and entered  into correspondence with the remainder. Fifteen countries  declared their readiness -- the participants in the new project.  The list of these countries is being kept secret until the UN  mobilization plan is established. It is clear only that they do  not include the United States.    There is no noticeable shortage of countries ready to act as  donors of military force. However, there are only two states in  the world capable today of realistically carrying this project  through. Russia and the United States are the two countries  which possess the necessary means to deliver "Blue Helmets" to  trouble spots quickly. The UN troops need heavy transport  planes, special naval vessels, and the appropriate medical aid,  equipment, means of communication, and satellite links.    Russia's participation in this program is also under  question, but, experts claim, this idea must be seized with both  hands. The Russian soldier, having overstayed his welcome in  the former fraternal republics, will be happy to see the world.  Especially since, in addition to additional training, extra pay  is also promised. And the operations plans will include only  classical functions: the separation of warring parties on the  basis of agreement, as is done in countries like Cambodia and  Macedonia [FYROM]. Somalia and Bosnia will not be on offer.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The sternest test is healthcare: America Social reform in the US occurs in fits and starts. In the 1930s Franklin Roosevelt introduced unemployment insurance and federal pensions. In the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson attacked racial discrimination and poverty. In the 1990s, Mr Bill Clinton faces a task of comparable dimensions: reform of healthcare to ensure universal coverage and better control of costs. He took his first step last week in nominating Ms Donna Shalala, an energetic university chancellor, as health secretary. Ms Shalala inherits a fluid situation. Following Mr Clinton's election victory, two of the parties most resistant to change - the private insurance industry and the American Medical Association - have made conciliatory noises. They have done so in part because a seductively attractive reform strategy, known as 'managed competition', is rapidly gaining popularity. The socially liberal New York Times has been running hectoring editorials in favour of the reform for months. Yet conservative groups are also supportive. The need for reform can hardly be overstated. After decades of uncontrolled expansion, healthcare now accounts for 14 per cent of gross domestic product; it is the biggest 'industry' in the US, more significant for the economy than all exports combined. Relentless healthcare inflation is the main cause of structural budget deficits. Yet despite all this spending 35m or so people remain uninsured. Millions more are reluctant to change jobs for fear of losing health coverage, or getting less generous benefits; a serious illness can still jeopardise future insurance prospects while anxiety about the exploding cost of nursing home care afflicts even the affluent. Could managed competition provide a solution? It depends on what you make this slippery phrase to mean, whether you lay more stress on managing, or more on competition. The heart of the idea is sound enough. Unregulated insurance markets fail for a variety of reasons: private insurers discriminate against the sick (who are costly to insure) and they often lack the market power (or incentive) to restrain the expenditure of providers - the doctors and hospitals. Managed competition says the answer is to create 'sponsors' - regional purchasing groups through which individuals would have to buy health plans. The sponsors, the argument runs, would have the clout to demand high quality and low prices from competing providers in the private sector. Every plan would have to offer a minimum set of basic benefits; discrimination against the sick would be made illegal. As an added pressure on costs, the deductibility of employer-paid premiums would be limited to the cost of the cheapest health plan available in a given area. At first glance all this sounds marvellous. The goals of universal coverage and cost control are achieved without imposing bureaucratic controls or sacrificing the flexibility and dynamism of market competition. But then the questions start pouring in. Even with limits on tax deductibility, is it likely that the sponsors would effectively restrain healthcare costs, which are driven by factors such as new technology? In California, which already has many big purchasing groups, costs are still rising fast. And how do you ensure everybody gets insurance through one of these sponsors? If employers are not required to enroll employees, many workers will continue to plead poverty and fail to enroll themselves. The unemployed in any case would have to be covered by some kind of catch-all public scheme. Scratch the surface of managed competition and things get very messy. There is a variant of managed competition that might work, put forward by Mr John Garamendi, California's insurance commissioner. Under his scheme, private insurance premiums would be replaced by new payroll taxes on employers and employees. This revenue would be handed over to competing purchasing units, on the basis of the number of individuals they attract. As in other schemes, the sponsors would then purchase care from competing private sector providers. But there would be a real budget constraint because the sponsors could only spend the tax revenue they received. By imposing rigorous constraints on the US private sector, Mr Garamendi's version of managed competition would create a health system not dissimilar to Britain's National Health Service, where the aim of reforms was to introduce competition into a public sector system. In both cases the theory is that tax-financed purchasing groups buy care on behalf of patients from independent, competing groups of providers. In both cases there is a safety valve in that, having paid health taxes, people are free to buy extra private care if they so choose. In the US, the biggest obstacles are the institutional upheaval involved and the fact that replacing private insurance premiums by payroll taxes would sharply increase the tax burden - without, of course, raising the financial burden imposed on the economy by healthcare. International experience, however, suggests weaker forms of managed competition would not achieve the twin goals of cost control and universal coverage. A Garamendi-style reform would be a huge step for Americans. But this may just be one of those rare moments in US history when huge steps are possible.</p>

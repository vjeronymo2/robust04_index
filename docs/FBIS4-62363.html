			<p>BFN     [Text] Well-informed sources in Yerevan told INTERFAX that  the Armenian and Azeri Defense Ministers and the commander of  the Karabakh defense forces would be meeting in Moscow under the  mediation of the Russian Defense Minister on 16 May.    Serge Sarakissyan, Mamedrafi Mamedov, Samvel Babayan and  Pavel Grachev will be expected to confirm agreements negotiated  on 18 February in Moscow and on 4 and 5 May, under the mediation  of the Commonwealth's Interparliamentary Assembly, in Bishkek.    Armenian Deputy Defense Minister Asvatsatur Petrossyan told  newsmen in Yerevan on 14 May that within three days a peace  agreement would be signed to put an end, as early as this year,  to the war in Karabakh.    According to Petrossyan, the Moscow meeting of the defense  ministers and the commander of the Karabakh defense forces would  concentrate on the scheduled introduction and deployment of a  peacekeeping contingent in the area of the Armenian-Azeri  conflict.    Petrossyan said Armenia would welcome the introduction of  Russian peacekeepers into the disputed area.    He said that in the past five months 50 Azeri POW's and  hostages had been exchanged for 25 Armenians. He said as many  as 180 Armenians were listed as missing. Some 10 to 15 percent  of these, he said, were civilians taken by Azeris off passenger  trains.    Petrossyan denied rumors on the existence of POW  concentration camps in Armenia.</p>

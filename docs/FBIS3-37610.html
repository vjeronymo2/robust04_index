I have told this to Yeltsin and  Chernomyrdin, and it was met with understanding." According to  him, Tatarstan should play a leading role in pursuing this  policy.    In the near future a Tatarstan permanent mission will be  opened in Washington, in the Russian Federation trade  representation, to promote contacts between the republic's firms  and enterprises and U.S. partners and to exchange information.  It will enjoy diplomatic immunity.</p>

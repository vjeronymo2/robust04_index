			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Better to launch and lose Encouragement for entrepreneurs to 'have a go and hang the risk of failure' has not been a part of the British way of life for many years. In spite of the Thatcher era, to have launched and lost is not widely seen as better than never to have launched at all. The cause of those wanting to lift this dead hand has been further undermined this month with publication of a report* from CCN Business Information, the credit information provider. According to CCN, nearly a quarter of all company directors in the UK have been involved with companies that have failed during the past six years. More than 10 per cent of these directors have had more than one failure and 1,000 display the qualities of rubber - bouncing back from more than 10 failed companies. CCN uses this data, gleaned from analysis of 931,000 directors, to call for a clampdown on 'serial failures'. It says the delay in pursuing disqualification of directors and inefficiency on the part of the courts means serial failures are 'free to defraud and lose other people's money'. In spite of the increase in company failures in the past five years, CCN says, the number of disqualifications has stayed at 300 to 400 a year. CCN recognises that company failure does not necessarily imply dishonesty or incompetence and that companies are put into liquidation for perfectly legitimate reasons. It calls for more investigation of directors' track records before they receive credit, a move that would lead to more prudent credit management. But CCN's emphasis on the small percentage of directors involved with multiple failures denies an important fact. Businesses fail all the time. For many directors, this experience is more valuable than any business school training and makes them better credit risks. Report available from CCN Business Information. Tel: 0602 863864.

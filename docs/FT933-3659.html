			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Ernst &amp; Young raps accounts reform plans ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the UK's third largest accountancy firm, today launches an outspoken attack on the Accounting Standards Board's plans to reform rules governing financial reporting. An Ernst &amp; Young report accuses the board, which sets accounting standards, of heading in the wrong direction with its reforms, being overly academic, ignoring its critics and diverging from international standards. Ernst &amp; Young warns that the board threatens to sideline the traditional concept of prudence in accounts. The strongly worded criticism is one of the first public expressions of discontent with the overall development of the new accounting standards regime. It is particularly significant because it was co-authored by Mr Ron Paterson, a technical partner in the firm, who is a member of the board's urgent issues task force. Ernst &amp; Young's main concern is that the board is concentrating on the so-called 'balance sheet approach' which focuses on attempting to value a company's assets and liabilities regularly. The firm argues that this is inaccurate and incompatible with a 'profit and loss account approach' based on transactions - such as the sale of goods - that have taken place and so can be measured with greater certainty. It wants a return to 'historical cost' accounting, based on the value of an asset at the time it was bought. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, said yesterday: 'Most of what we are doing is just catching up with standards elsewhere in the world.' The proposals would 'improve the balance sheet without destroying the profit and loss account'. Ernst &amp; Young was 'in a minority', with most users of accounts favouring regular revaluations on the balance sheet and 70 per cent of British industry already doing so, he said. Until now there has been a delicate consensus, with few companies and no accounting firms speaking out directly against the board's reform programme.</p>

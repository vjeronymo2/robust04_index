			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's The unsolicited opinion of a credit rating agency that Lloyd's no longer deserves a triple-A rating is unlikely to shake confidence in the insurance market. Its reserves against future claims are on most measures a match for the strongest insurers. If the declared wealth of Names is believed, neither is there a shortage of equity capital should reserves prove inadequate. Lloyd's is arguably more exposed to long-tail risks than its big US and European rivals. But erosion of underwriting capacity remains a bigger threat to Lloyd's share of world insurance than fears for financial security. The most pressing task facing Lloyd's management is thus to attract new capital. The promise of future profits - backed by higher premiums and an overdue attack on costs - is a tempting carrot. But potential investors will have to be convinced that old risks are securely ring-fenced within the proposed new insurance company. The ability of the new vehicle to pay claims is where the issue of financial security is most likely to be fought. The planned audit of reserves across the market should provide firm figures on which such decisions can be made. But the basis on which reserves for the new company are set should be as transparent as possible. A settlement with litigious Names would add a further degree of comfort. One wonders whether Lloyd's campaign to prove the strength of its ring-fence might even usefully include a credit rating.</p>

Settlement Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of CAA section 112(d)(9), and in order to foster a consensus approach to regulation in this area, EPA then commenced discussions with NRC, the American Mining Congress (AMC), and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). As a result of discussions after execution of the MOU, a final settlement agreement was executed between EPA, AMC, EDF, NRDC and individual site owners, to which NRC agreed in principle by letter. The settlement agreement continues the regulatory approach set forth in the MOU adding extensive detail to that agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

EPA Regulatory Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 31, 1991, EPA took several steps towards fulfilling its responsibilities under the MOU and in implementing CAA section 112(d)(9) by publishing three  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (FR) notices. In the first notice (56 FR 67537), EPA published a final rule to stay the effectiveness of 40 CFR part 61, subpart T, as it applies to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed by the NRC or an Agreement State. The stay will remain in effect until the Agency rescinds the uranium mill tailings NESHAP at 40 CFR part 61, subpart T. However, if EPA fails to complete that rulemaking by June 30, 1994, the stay will expire and the requirements of subpart T will become effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a second notice published on December 31, 1991, the Agency proposed to rescind the NESHAP for radionuclides that appears at 40 CFR part 61, subpart T, as it applies to non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed by the NRC or an Agreement State (56 FR 67561).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the third notice, EPA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to amend 40 CFR part 192, subpart D (56 FR 67569) to provide for site closure to occur as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee), and appropriate monitoring requirements for non-operational uranium mill tailings piles. These amendments would ensure timely compliance and add monitoring requirements currently lacking in the UMTRCA regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA published a notice on June 8, 1993, proposing to amend 40 CFR part 192 subpart D. (58 FR 32174). On November 15, 1993, EPA published the final rule amending 40 CFR part 192, subpart D. (58 FR 60340). This final rule requires: (1) Emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with, including attainment of, the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard by all NRC or Agreement State licensed sites that, absent rescission, would be subject to subpart T; (2) interim milestones to assure appropriate progress in emplacing the permanent radon barrier; and (3) that site closure occur as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee) after the impoundments cease operation. EPA announced a goal that this occur by December 31, 1997, for those non-operational uranium mill tailings piles listed in the MOU between EPA, NRC and affected Agreement States (at 56 FR 67568), or seven years after the date on which the impoundments cease operation for all other piles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As intended by EPA, the phrase ``as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility,'' means as quickly as possible considering: (1) The physical characteristics of the tailings and sites; (2) the limits of available technology; (3) the need for consistency with mandatory requirements of other regulatory programs; and (4) factors beyond the control of the licensee. While this phrase does not preclude economic considerations to the extent provided by the phrase ``available technology,'' it also does not contemplate utilization of a cost-benefit analysis in setting compliance schedules. The radon control compliance schedules are to be developed consistent with the targets set forth in the MOU as reasonably applied to the specific circumstances of each site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES 727-ACRE PROJECT  </P> <P> Despite protests from more than 200 residents, the City Council on Tuesday  approved plans for a controversial 727-acre development that will be built on  the city's last undeveloped ridgeline.  </P> <P> In a 4-0 vote, the council approved a plan for Serrano Heights, a development  project that has been in the planning stages for six years and will feature as  many as 1,800 town houses, apartments and single-family residences. Mayor Don  E. Smith abstained from voting, citing a possible conflict of interest.  </P> <P> In a series of votes, the council approved a zoning change for the project,  certified a report detailing the project's expected environmental impact and  approved development plans.  </P> <P> Serrano Heights will be built by Irvine-based Woodcrest Development Inc. in the  east section of the city. The development includes extending Serrano Avenue,  which will link Anaheim Hills to Orange.  </P> <P> Many of the residents wore orange ribbons to the council meeting as a symbol of  their opposition, and they voiced concerns about traffic, noise and possible  environmental fallout.  </P> <P> "Building on ridgelines should go the way of dinosaurs, it should be extinct,"  said Joe Pelka, a representative of the Maybury Ranch Homeowner Assn.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Pelka said he and other residents were disappointed with the  council's action.  </P> <P> "A majority of the people are opposed to the project," Pelka said. "We intend  to continue to pursue the matter throughout the approval process. I don't feel  the council took into consideration the views of the community."  </P> <P> Resident Larry Larson also spoke out against the plan, calling it "outdated."  </P> <P> "It does not respect the existing environment," Larson said. "We are talking  about the last major undeveloped ridgeline in Orange County. Once a mountain or  hillside is blasted, it will never return to us."  </P> <P> But Woodcrest consultant Frank Elfend defended the project and said much of the  community opposition is based on "misinformation." He said only one-third of  the ridgeline will be affected. GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

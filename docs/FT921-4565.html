			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Airlines face switch in source of finance AIRLINES, faced with the drying-up of their traditional sources of financing, will be forced to find new sources of funding in order to cover the enormous cost of expanding and upgrading aircraft fleets Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, last week predicted that airlines would have to turn to the international capital markets in order to raise the necessary funds, given that they will require Dollars 857bn of new aircraft over the next 20 years. This view is echoed by international bankers who believe there may be a shift away from bank loans and leases as airlines turn to the bond markets and more innovative forms of financing. The problem for the airlines is that Japan, which during the 1980s was an important source of aircraft financing - both through loans and leases - is no longer such a willing supplier of funds. The Japanese banks, which were once so keen to lend to airlines, are now reluctant to participate because of concern about the international capital adequacy requirements agreed by the Basle committee. As one financing expert points out: 'Japanese banks are only interested in lending to the good flight carriers, and are not at all interested in lending to the weaker names.' At the same time, as the Japanese banks are picking their borrowers more carefully, the supply of leveraged lease deals from Japan is drying up. With a finance lease, a group of investors buys the aircraft and then leases it out to the airline. Such deals were particularly popular in Japan among rich individuals and small businesses because of tax advantages, and these were passed on to the airline in the form of reduced rentals. Lease arrangements still continue, but not on the same scale as before, since the Japanese authorities have clamped down on the tax advantages, while the fall in the Japanese stock market means that companies and investors have fewer gains to shelter. 'There have been problems for some time getting equity from the Japanese and putting these Japanese leveraged leases together,' says one Japanese banker. With banks less willing to lend money, margins on loans have increased sharply. Two years ago, a leading European flag carrier would have paid a margin of between 25 and 35 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) on a 10 to 12-year loan. Now, the margin is more likely to be in the region of 60 to 80 basis points, bankers say. In view of the industry's future requirements, bankers point out that the loan market will be unable to meet the demand. 'The way the market has been, the banks simply cannot provide all that liquidity,' says one aircraft finance expert. 'The airlines will need very large sums of money so there will have to be alternative sources of finance such as public sector bond issues, with institutional investors buying 10 or 12-year secured notes backed by the aircraft.'</p>

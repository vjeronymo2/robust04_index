			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Ten-year issues in Canadian dollars The Canadian dollar market saw two 10-year eurobond offerings yesterday as borrowers took advantage of the recent revival in the underlying Canadian government bond market. BNG launched a CDollars 250m issue, priced to yield 22 basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent Canadian government bond due 1994. Lead managers ABN Amro reported demand from retail investors in Belgium and Luxembourg but about 60 per cent of the bonds are expected to be taken up by European institutional investors. The Canadian dollar market currently offers good swap opportunities, particularly at the long end, and investors in particular like the spread against the US market, syndicate managers said. Ile-de-France launched a CDollars 85m 10-year bond, priced to yield 16 basis points above the 6 1/2 per cent Canadian government bond due 2004. The eurobond market also saw a flock of other issues yesterday, mainly small, short-dated deals aimed at retail investors, including five US dollar offerings. 'This signifies that the dollar market will be the market of choice in the fourth quarter rather than more peripheral markets as borrowers go for safety,' said one syndicate manager. Ford Credit Europe tapped the US dollar market with a Dollars 200m three-year offering priced to yield 37 1/2 basis points above the 6 1/2 per cent 1997 Treasury. Syndicate managers said the deal was a success and lead manager Goldman Sachs said the bonds were mainly sold to Swiss retail investors. Volvo Group Finance Europe also tapped the dollar market, with a Dollars 150m five-year issue priced to yield 56 basis points over the 6 7/8 per cent Treasury 1999. Syndicate managers said the pricing was ambitious for an unrated borrower and that the bonds were pitched at a less popular area of the curve. The spread widened slightly in later trade. However, lead manager Merrill Lynch said it saw significant interest from Swiss and Benelux retail investors and institutional investors.</p>

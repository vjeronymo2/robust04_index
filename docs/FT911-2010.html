			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Philips posts 'encouraging' return to profits in quarter PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group which ran up heavy losses in 1990, yesterday reported an 'encouraging' return to profits in the first quarter of 1991 and repeated its earlier predictions that it will end the year in the black. Mr Henk Appelo, the group's finance director, said first-quarter results were slightly better than expected, but cautioned against excessive optimism, saying the same strong improvement might not be repeated in the second quarter. The real fruits of the company's extensive restructuring programme were not expected until the second half of this year. Net profit from normal business operations, currently the best measure of Philips' performance, soared to Fl 135m (Dollars 71m) in the first quarter from just Fl 6m in the 1990 quarter. Overall net profit also totalled Fl 135m against Fl 336m in 1990, when the net figure had been inflated by book profits of Fl 330m from the sale of defence electronics subsidiaries. The results were above analysts' forecasts, helping to push up Philips' shares by Fl 1.70 to Fl 29 at the close in Amsterdam. Philips said operating profit rose nearly 50 per cent from Fl 450m to Fl 655m, while turnover fell 2 per cent to Fl 12.5bn. Mr Appelo said operating profit remained too low as a percentage of turnover. 'But all our product sectors were back in the black,' he said, noting that Philips' professional products and components sectors had stemmed their losses and returned to profitability. At the same time, however, the group's two most profitable sectors, lighting and consumer electronics, saw a decline in operating earnings. Lighting's earnings fell to Fl 135m from Fl 192m, due mainly to a downturn in the US and Brazil. Consumer products declined to Fl 298m from Fl 364m, partly as a result of sluggish consumer spending in a number of countries. Other computer activities broke even, enabling professional products to post an operating profit of Fl 70m against a loss of Fl 96m a year earlier. Components also turned a loss of Fl 23m to show a profit of Fl 65m in the quarter. Mr Appelo said overall losses in North America fell by a third against the same period of 1990. The group remained in the red in Latin America but posted gains in Europe. In 1990 as a whole, Philips posted a record net loss of Fl 4.24bn, reflecting Fl 4.65bn in restructuring charges taken to slim down its ailing computer and semi-conductor divisions and to trim its worldwide workforce by nearly 20 per cent.</p>

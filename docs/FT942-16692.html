			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: AirTouch aims for the overseas market - Pactel's wireless arm is well placed to operate as a separate unit US telecoms operators are hastily reassessing their prospects as the old certainties of the industry fade amid regulatory and technological upheaval. The seven regional Bell companies face the most urgent challenge, with their local monopolies set to be abolished and their cellular mobile networks about to meet a fresh wave of competition from new licensees. Arguably the most innovative reaction is that of Pacific Telesis, the San Francisco-based Bell company. Two years ago Pactel said it was going to spin-off its wireless business into an entirely separate company. That spin-off takes effect this week with the launch of AirTouch Communications as an independent company, comprising Pactel's cellular, paging and international operations. Pactel's 'wireline' activities - 15m line connections and associated businesses in California and Nevada - remain with Pacific Bell. They account for the bulk of the former group's turnover: in 1992 PacBell generated Dollars 8.7bn of Pactel's Dollars 9.9bn revenues, with domestic cellular, paging and international activities contributing Dollars 873m between them. But the wireless business is set to grow fast, and the spin-off marks a significant departure from the course adopted by the other Bell operators. Mr Sam Ginn, AirTouch chairman - who moves sideways from the same post in Pactel - says regulation and valuation were the key considerations in the spin-off. Pactel believed it was undervalued because its cellular assets were 'buried' by PacBell, and it was concerned about access to capital for the cellular business, given valuation and dividend requirements. So far, Pactel/AirTouch has defied the sceptics. In an initial public offering last December AirTouch raised Dollars 1.5bn with ease, and Pactel's share price has risen by more than 35 per cent since the announcement of the spin-off. That compares starkly with the fate of Bell Atlantic, whose share price fell nearly 20 per cent in the four months between the announcement and the collapse of its much-vaunted Dollars 21.4bn merger with Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television service company. Why, then, are no other Bell companies following suit? 'There is a great deal of inertia out there,' claims Mr Ginn. 'The others are reluctant to go through the trauma of the state regulatory process to reform themselves; and they are hooked by the term 'convergence' into thinking it would be a mistake to separate their wireless activities from the rest.' The move last year by AT&amp;T, the US telecoms giant, to buy McCaw, the leading domestic wireless operator, convinced many Baby Bells the future lay in integrating, not separating their activities. 'We'd be insane to fragment ourselves just as AT&amp;T is trying to resurrect old Ma Bell,' said one regional Bell chief executive earlier this year. A few months on, the definition of sanity is more problematic. Hard on the heels of the Bell Atlantic escapade, Southwestern Bell - the Texas-based Bell operator - this week called off its planned Dollars 1.6bn investment in Cox Enterprises, a leading cable group. A meltdown of the Bell system appears ever less likely. As for convergence between cellular and 'wireline', the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the telecoms industry from Washington, is unlikely to allow full integration between wireline and wireless activities for fear of cross-subsidies. Divesting its cellular business leaves PacBell free to bid in its own right for California franchises for personal communications services, the new cellular networks soon to be auctioned by the FCC. AirTouch will bid elsewhere, aiming to put together a consortium providing nationwide coverage. The overseas market is the focus of AirTouch's strategy. Although it is only one of the large Bell cellular operators within the US, overseas it is the largest. It inherits several lucrative international franchises - notably a 26 per cent stake in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, which operates the second cellular network in Germany with 570,000 subscribers, and a 10 per cent stake in the consortium which recently won the licence for Italy's second cellular network. Across Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, the cellular mobile market is liberalising faster than the wireline market, where the vested interests of long-established national telecoms monopolies are far more powerful. US cellular operators are strongly placed, particularly those such as AirTouch and BellSouth with successful records in partnerships with local companies. Allowing for its share of consortia, AirTouch begins life with 1.1m US subscribers and 155,000 abroad. 'My hope is that by the year 2000 our assets would be larger outside the US than inside,' says Mr Ginn. That means an aggressive overseas strategy. 'In our early ventures we were motivated largely by political risk - we concentrated on politically stable countries, mostly western industrial countries. My current thinking is that we are now in a position to take more risk - moving into lesser developed countries.' So in addition to western Europe, Mr Ginn will be looking for franchises in the Asia-Pacific region's rapidly expanding economies. The strategy is similar to that of Vodafone, the UK's largest operator and also a dedicated wireless operator, whose overseas forays in 'safe' countries have led it to less stable areas, notably South Africa. Will the AirTouch spin-off generate a dynamism of its own? 'In personal terms, it's been a wrench, like the 1984 divestiture (of AT&amp;T, which led to the creation of the Baby Bells),' muses Mr Ginn. 'Twelve months after that revolution, it seemed like ancient history.'</p>

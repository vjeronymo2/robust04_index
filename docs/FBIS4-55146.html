			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 10 (CTK) -- At their meeting today, the  deputy chairmen of the government coalition parties failed to  agree on a law which would put an end to the restitution  process, Deputy Chairman of the Christian and Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) Jan Kasal told  journalists. A KDU-CSL proposal concerning the restitution of  church property was discussed and tasks were set which should be  solved before a relevant resolution is discussed by the  government.    The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) still insists that no more  claims concerning the redressing of property injustices should  be proposed, ODS Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach said. He added that  in the ODS's view the debate on the completion of restitutions  had come rather late, though the coalition partners consider it  to be premature. The issue of church property restitutions  could be solved in an executive way in the framework of the  existing laws, Vlach said.    It was agreed at the meeting that the issue of church  property should be solved before a full stop is made to end  restitutions, Deputy Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party  (KDS) Miroslav Tyl said. He said the KDS was not concerned  about the form in which church property was to be returned. It  only insists that the return of church property be set down by  law as firmly as was the restitution of property which has  already been returned to its initial owners, he said.    ODS Deputy Chairman Jan Strasky told CTK that the next  coalition meeting on the same topic was to be held in a  fortnight.</p>

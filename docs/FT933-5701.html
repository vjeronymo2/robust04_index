			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Perez to appeal over suspension MR Carlos Andres Perez, Venezuela's suspended president, said yesterday he would appeal to the Supreme Court against Congress's decision to block him from returning to office even if he is acquitted on corruption charges, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. Congress voted on Tuesday night to make permanent last May's suspension of Mr Perez from the presidency following allegations of embezzlement and misuse of public funds. Congress also voted to ratify Mr Ramon Jose Velasquez as interim president, and authorised him to serve out the remaining five months of Mr Perez's term.</p>

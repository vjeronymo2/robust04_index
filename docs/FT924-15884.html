			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Bulgarian reforms win OECD praise BULGARIA has made considerable progress towards market-oriented reforms but is still far from reaching sustainable macro-economic stability, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says in its first report on the highly indebted former communist state. Since embarking on market reforms in February 1991, goods have become more widely available at higher prices, freedom of choice and the scope for entrepreneurial activity have increased dramatically, inflation has been contained and export growth to the OECD has been high. But these achievements remain fragile, the report warns. 'Sustainable macro-economic stability remains hostage both to progress with structural reforms and to a solution of the external debt problem'. Bulgaria declared a unilateral moratorium on its Dollars 9.2bn foreign debt in June 1990. The borrowings were partly used to import components from the west for incorporation into exports to soft-currency Comecon or third world markets. The country's high exposure to such trade made it particularly vulnerable to the collapse of Comecon, the Soviet bloc trading group. Over the medium term, the reports says, Bulgaria will attract official capital inflows, foreign investment and trade credit only if a satisfactory solution is found to the external debt problem. This would be one based on 'a voluntary arrangement involving compromises on both creditor and debtor sides'.</p>

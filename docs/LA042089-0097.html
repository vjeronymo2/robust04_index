			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WALKER DEFENDS HIS MOBIL INITIATIVE  </P> <P> I wish to respond to those publicly opposing my petition drive to qualify an  initiative to prohibit the storage of large quantities of hydrofluoric acid at  the Mobil Oil refinery in Torrance.  </P> <P> Everyone, with the exception of the Mobil Oil Corp., who has studied the issue  agrees that hydrofluoric acid is an extremely lethal chemical that could, in  the case of an accidental spill, threaten the lives of tens of thousands of  Torrance residents.  </P> <P> Everyone, with the exception of the Mobil Oil Corp., who has studied the issue  agrees that the Mobil refinery has one of the worst safety records in Southern  California.  </P> <P> To prevent a catastrophic accident from happening here in Torrance, we must  eliminate the threat.  </P> <P> That is why I have been working the past eight months on a ballot initiative  which prohibits the storage of large quantities of hydrofluoric acid. And that  is why I and my City Council colleagues filed a lawsuit last week against Mobil  Oil Corp. which asks for a permanent injunction against the use of hydrofluoric  acid and other, less dangerous chemicals within the city of Torrance.  </P> <P> But to defeat the mighty Mobil Goliath, this cannot be a battle between one  councilman and Mobil, or seven council members and Mobil. Torrance residents  must be brought into the battle.  </P> <P> Only by allowing Torrance voters to speak out at the ballot box will Mobil --  and their high-priced lawyers -- truly understand that Torrance residents  demand action now.  </P> <P> The issue is not politics, or the perceived political ambitions of myself. The  issue is nothing less than the health and safety of you and your family.  </P> <P> If you have not yet done so, please sign your initiative petition and mail it  to me today.  </P> <P> DAN WALKER  </P> <P> Member, Torrance City Council  </P></p>

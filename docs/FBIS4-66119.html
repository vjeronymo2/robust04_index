			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union/Italy: Socialists </F> Want Word on Neo-Fascist Ministers"]    [Text] (ANSA) Genoa, May 19 -- The head of the European  Parliament's Socialist caucus, Jean Pierre Cot, on Thursday [19  May] urged the government of Silvio Berlusconi to issue a  "formal declaration" that would clear up once and for all the  issue of what he called "neo-Fascist ministers" in the cabinet.    Cot, on a brief visit to Genoa, told reporters the European  Parliament did not intend to interfere with Italy's internal  affairs when it approved a motion on May 4 asking the Italian  president to make sure the new government would "remain faithful  to the fundamental values" of the European Union [EU], referring  indirectly to the possibility that the new executive (which had  not been formed yet) would include ministers of the National  Alliance, the new name given to the Italian Social Movement,  heir to Mussolini's Fascist Party.    "We do not plan to put intentions on trial over the issue,"  Cot said, adding however that "contradictory statements have  been made," referring to National Alliance leader Gianfranco  Fini, who insists he is a "post-fascist" but has not formally  renounced the party's historical roots and recently defined  Mussolini as the century's greatest statesman.    Fini's party has five cabinet posts in the new government  and  on Monday [16 May] National Alliance presented, as it has done  at the beginning of every legislature for decades, a legislative  bill to revoke a constitutional law passed in 1948 banning the  revival of the Fascist Party. The party later withdrew the  bill, saying it had been mistakenly filed with the speaker's  office by an over-zealous secretary.    Cot said: "The Italian government must be told: Since you  claim you have nothing to do with the Fascist past, you must  also say that the Fascist past has nothing to do with you." He  warned that, "unless a political clarification is made,  relations may become complicated."    Cot also made reference to statements by the new foreign  minister, Antonio Martino, who claimed he would never have  anything to do with a Fascist minister, noting that "while  Martino says reassuring things, others are saying the opposite."    Italy, in other words, "must say it follows the anti-Fascist  line" that is at the foundation of the EU, Cot asserted. "A  formal declaration made by the Italian government reneging a  past that is hateful to all may clear the air."    He compared the Italian situation to that of Japan, where  the  justice minister was forced to resign two weeks ago for having  downplayed the Nanjing massacres of 1937.    According to Cot, the European Parliament is concerned about  the issue just as it is concerned about the rise of extreme  right-wing movements across Europe. "We are living in a time in  which watchfulness over the values of democracy must be  doubled," he said.</p>

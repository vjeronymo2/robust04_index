PLO Executive Committee Member Dr. Samir Ghawshah told a  MENA  correspondent in Tunis that at a meeting last night, the  committee emphasized its rejection of the Israeli response to  the demands sent by the PLO after the massacre. The demands  were to disarm settlers, remove settlements, and provide  protection for the Palestinians.    Ghawshah remarked that the decisions the PLO received after  the Israeli Cabinet meeting yesterday were bad, not in  proportion with the nature of the massacre, contained nothing  new, and failed to provide solutions.    He added that the decisions indicate that Rabin's government  is maintaining the policy of hegemony, intransigence, stalling  for time, and failing to provide any solutions or even give a  chance to efforts to deal with what happened. He said the  Israelis proposed disarming a limited, specific number of  individual settlers. But they refused to provide international  protection for the Palestinian citizens under occupation. He  explained that this means maintaining the settlements as an  armed force in violation of the law and agreements. He stressed  that the Palestinians cannot accept the existence of an  irregular armed force when they take charge of security in Gaza  and Jericho.    Ghawshah added that the Executive Committee also discussed  the American proposal to hold urgent negotiations between the  Palestinian and Israeli sides in Washington. He pointed out  that there is a general feeling within the committee that  changing the venue of the talks will be useless if the same  lists of negotiators are maintained, if the United States does  not play a basic role as a partner and sponsor of the peace  process, if pressure is not put on Israel to honor its  commitments, and if the essence of these negotiations remains  the same.    He explained that the U.S. proposal, which the PLO approved  in principle, raises many questions on its ultimate goal: Does  it really aim to boost the peace process or just to contain the  situation resulting from the massacre? He pointed out that the  American response to these questions and the U.S. proposals  involve no real change in the peace process in terms of its  essence and form or in terms of the U.S. bias toward Israel.    Ghawshah noted that no final decision has been made on  participation in the Washington talks or on the date for this  participation. He added that this issue is still being  discussed.    The Palestinian official added that the committee will  resume  its meetings tonight with the participation of the heads of the  negotiating teams to follow up on the decisions the UN Security  Council will adopt. He remarked that these decisions will  reflect the real stance of the Council members on the peace  process, particularly the stance of the United States.    Ghawshah praised the resolutions adopted last night by the  Arab League Council, saying they constitute a real starting  point and an excellent step toward restoring Arab solidarity and  supporting the lawful rights of the Palestinian people.    He affirmed that the decision in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan  to suspend talks with the Israeli side in Washington in protest  of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre shows that coordination and  solidarity have returned and that the pan-Arab common interest  and national security take priority over everything else.</p>

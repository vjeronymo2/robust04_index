			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Parties have disputed a poll by the Human Sciences  Research Council [HSRC] on the outcome of the election. A poll  by the HSRC and the Multiparty Democracy Organization found that  the ANC [African National Congress] would obtain a two thirds  majority.    The ANC does not think it will get a two thirds majority,  but  thinks it will win an outright majority. It has criticized the  poll, saying the category of people who did not know which party  they would vote for had not been taken into consideration, nor  were the residents of the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda,  Ciskei] states.    The National Party also criticized the poll finding, saying  it believes its support is increasing compared with parties such  as the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], the CP [Conservative Party],  and other parties in the Freedom Alliance in general.    Meanwhile, the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] says the  fact that it and the Conservative Party can show that they have  2 million supporters should provide food for thought. It says  groups wanting to ignore the Afrikaner's demand for  self-determination should not ignore that support.</p>

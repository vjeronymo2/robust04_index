			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Gusinskiy, under rubric "Statistics": </F> "The Year Was Not as Terrible as It Was Painted"]    [Text] Somehow we have easily become accustomed to the  assertion that, with every passing day, life is becoming  increasingly more difficult. And we even fail to pay very much  attention to the statistical data which, even if they do not  speak about the opposite situation, in any case force us to  subject to doubt the thesis that is being propagandized -- the  thesis concerning the unbearability of the conditions for  existence.    As is attested to by the data provided by the oblast  statistics administration, consumer prices of the basic  commodities and services by December 1992 rose during the year  that had passed by a factor of 8.1, but the population's  monetary income during 1993, according to preliminary  computations, rose, as compared with 1992, by a factor of 9.7.  During 1993 the average per-capital nominal monetary income with  respect to the living wage constituted 197 percent (in 1992, 157  percent). Nevertheless, during last year almost one-fifth of the  population had a per-capital income lower than the living wage.    The situation in the labor market also is not as  catastrophic  as is usually depicted. As compared with 1992, last year the  number of workers in the oblast economy (excluding cooperatives  and small and private enterprises) dropped by only 2.7 percent.  As of the beginning of January 1993, employment-service agencies  had 2800 unemployed citizens on their rolls. During the year  their number decreased by 24 percent. Eleven hundred people have  been recognized as being unemployed.    As compared with January-November 1992, profit in 1993  increased by a factor of 8, including 7.5 in industry. But the  profitability of production in industry was at the level of  41-44 percent. (For purposes of comparison: according to data in  BSE [Large Soviet Encyclopedia], the profitability of industry  in the USSR in 1970 was only 21.5 percent.) True, it was  achieved as a result of the fact that the enterprises are  unjustifiably raising the price of their output, which is also  attested to by statistics: the entire increase in profit last  year was obtained at the expense of the increase in prices. More  than 16 percent of all the enterprises and organizations in the  oblast operated unprofitably in January-November 1993. The  number of enterprises operating at a loss, as compared with the  same period in 1992, dropped by 7 percent, although in industry  their number asincreased by 17 percent. For the oblast as a  whole, however, in the state sector of the economy the share of  the enterprises operating at a loss is larger than in the  nonstate sector, by 3.8 percentage points.    Industrial production in 1993 was distinguished by  instability. The slump in production continued, but by the end  of the year one could note a tendency toward a slowing down in  it. Whereas the correlation of the volumes of production during  the first quarter of 1993 and the same period of 1992  constituted a total of 79.4 percent, for the year as a whole the  volume of industrial production as compared with the 1992 level  came to 88.3 percent. And in such branches as energy  machine-building, the garment industry, and the butter and  cheese, dairy, and printing industries, the volumes of  production even surpassed the 1992 indicators.    The production slump in agriculture last year was lower than  in industry, and came to only 8 percent. For a long time people  have tried to convince us of the farmers' inability to feed us  in the next few years, but the 1993 indicators say just the  opposite: more than half (52 percent) of the volume of the gross  output of agriculture was produced on the population's personal  farms and peasant (individual-farmer) farms. As of 1 January  1994 the number of the latter in the oblast was 3183. They had  use of 165,800 hectares of land.    Economic difficulties had a considerably stronger effect in  capital construction. In 1993 the volumes of capital investments  at the expense of all sources of financing dropped by 33 percent  and come to 1188 billion rubles, which is the consequence of the  reduction during the past two years of the investment activity  rate of the enterprises. The rates of the slump in the volumes  of capital investments in agriculture (by 53 percent) are  considerably higher than in the other branches. Capital  investments in the nonproduction sphere decreased by 2 percent  and came to 43.9 billion rubles. However, the share of funds for  housing and social-cultural construction in the overall volume  of capital investments rose from 35 percent in 1992 to 37  percent in 1993.    As of 1 January 1994, 1375 enterprises in the oblast were  privatized, of which 439, or 3 percent, were privatized in 1993.  The share of the privatized large-scale enterprises that are  federal property increased from 5 percent in 1992 to 11 percent  in 1993. The number of enterprises that were oblast and  municipal property dropped somewhat, respectively from 18 to 14  percent and from 76 to 75 percent. On the average, the value of  one privatized enterprise that is municipal property was 2.7  million rubles; oblast property, 39.6 million; and federal  property, 88.4 million rubles. The total proceeds from the sale  of property to new owners (including the funds accruing from  enterprises that had been privatized in 1992) came to 5.7  billion rubles of monetary funds and 526,300 privatization  checks. More than 60 percent of the funds received from the  privatization of enterprise property became part of the income  of the oblast budget and the rayon and city budgets.    As of 1 January 1994, 82,300 apartments (30.6 percent of the  total number), including 37,500 in 1993, were privatized.    The demographic situation in the oblast remains strained. In  1993, 9600 persons were born in Smolensk Oblast. That is 1200  (11 percent) less than in 1992. The number of persons who died  was 19,200, or 2900 (17.6 percent) more.</p>

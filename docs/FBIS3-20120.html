In an opinion poll carried  out by Finnish Gallup for HELSINGIN SANOMAT, support for the SDP  is about 34 percent. Support for the party is 12 percent higher  than the number of votes it received in the last parliamentary  elections. According to the opinion poll, the main government  parties -- the National Coalition Party and the Center Party --  would both receive support of just under 18 percent. Joint  support for the four government parties is now 43 percent. The  opposition thus has a clear majority of support from the voters.  Support for the Leftist Alliance was 11 percent, and support for  the Greens has dropped to 6 percent. Support for the Finnish  Rural Party has dropped to almost nothing. Last week, 2,000  Finns were interviewed for the opinion poll.</p>

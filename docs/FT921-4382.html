			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Spotlight falls on Guinness WIDESPREAD belief that a stake has been built up in Guinness, the international drinks group, by Mr Warren Buffett, chairman of US investment house Salomon Inc, pushed the shares up 20 to 608p on turnover of 3.5m. A block of shares was crossed between institutions at 607 1/2 p. Mr John Wakely, drinks analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, reviewing doubts regarding Mr Buffett's suggested interest, pointed out that Guinness has 'a potential compound growth rate among the highest of any consumer company'. He added that Mr Buffett has 'sanctified' the stock for US investors and that, as foreign buyers raise their holdings in Guinness, UK fund managers are in danger of becoming seriously underweight in Britain's sixth largest company. Mr Wakely believes that some large UK investment institutions do not own any Guinness shares at all. Midland gains Midland Bank moved higher as the prospect of preliminary results today from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, holder of 14.7 per cent of the Midland equity, rekindled speculative activity. Hints from Far East sources suggested that Hongkong Bank may announce a rights issue along with its results. Suggestions that the bank might raise as much as HKDollars 20bn (around Pounds 1.5bn) fuelled speculation that it might increase its stake in Midland, or even mount a full takeover. A merger between Midland and Hongkong Bank was on the cards after the Far Eastern bank acquired its stake some years ago, but the likelihood faded last year when the two boards said merger talks had been ended. There were hints that other suitors had run the slide rule over Midland. BAT Industries, the tobacco to financial services giant, has been mentioned as a potential bidder, as has Prudential, the UK insurance group. Midland closed 6 firmer at 269p ex-dividend. Forte advances Hotel group Forte received a boost as the share price nudged above the 226p level at which holders of the group's maturing Pounds 85m Eurobond can exercise the accompanying warrants convertible into ordinary shares. Today is the final day for holders to take up shares, and Mr Richard Power, Forte's director of corporate affairs, said there had been a steady stream of enquiries in recent days. 'Although it is too early to say, there has been a lot of interest from holders wanting to convert. It is looking quite good at the moment.' There were fears that if the share price stayed below the 226p mark, warrant holders would shun the chance of taking their shares and leave Forte without the Pounds 93m that would be raised if the warrants were exercised. But Mr Power believed many warrants were held by arbitrageurs who had gone short on share positions over the last week, and would buy stock today. The shares closed a penny ahead at 227p after moderate volume of 2.3m. Gas firmer The best performance in a generally reluctant energy sector came from British Gas after a presentation to institutions hosted by Hoare Govett, the company's stockbroker. Gas shares ran up 6 to 257 1/2 p on turnover of 3.1m. Hoare said that directors of British Gas had told the gathered ranks of institutions that the company remained committed to 'real dividend growth'. It also emerged from the meeting that Gas executives were expecting a constructive deal with the Office of Fair Trading regarding Gas's pipelines business and alterations to its dominant position in industrial and commercial gas supply in the UK. Worries about the cost of heavy redundancies and news that County NatWest has removed BT 'new' from its buy list upset both classes of BT stock. Mr Patrick Wellington at County reiterated his cautious stance and said the trading environment at BT remains very difficult: 'Political risk is substantial and the prospect of a Labour electoral victory is not fully reflected in the share price.' The 'old' shares eased to 333p and the 'new' 2 to 118 1/4 p. Big switching out of NatWest and into TSB drove the latter's shares 2 1/2 better to 133p on keen turnover of 4.3m. Strong support ahead of tomorrow's preliminary results - expected to show profits up from Pounds 150m to around Pounds 200m and a maintained dividend - saw Standard Chartered move ahead 18 to 459p. The composite insurance area was alive with speculation that one of its constituents may yet emerge as the target of one of the big European insurance groupings. Takeover talk was again centred on Guardian Royal Exchange, which advanced 7 to 123p. Royal Insurance, depressed recently by the dreadful figures and dividend omission, shot up 12 to 188p. BP and Shell edged higher as the session wore on, with both stocks closing at the day's best levels, partly reflecting keen overseas support. The former, under pressure towards the back end of last week as its head of exploration and production failed to wholly please US institutions at an important presentation in New York, firmed 2 1/2 to 264 1/2 p on 6.5m shares traded. Shell settled 5 ahead at 447p on 2m traded. A few buyers moved back into the property sector after last week's poor showing, picking up selected stocks. MEPC put on 7 to 342p in good turnover of 1.2m, Land Securities improved 9 to 432p and British Land rose 11 to 225p. A second profits warning in a week saw chemicals group MTM tumble 70 to 119p Hopes of an imminent cut in UK interest rates inspired a burst of support for the building stocks. Persimmon, additionally boosted by the impressive dividend, advanced 7 to 294p. George Wimpey, a recent strong performer as the market has anticipated the group maintaining its final dividend when its preliminary figures are announced on March 17, put on 6 more to 143p. Marley, the roof tile specialist, responded to a Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation and closed 5 higher at 122p. A buy recommendation from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew lifted P &amp; O 40 to 399p. Mr Richard Hannah predicted annual profits of Pounds 210m (Pounds 261m previously). Transport Development Group gained 3 to 269p on reporting a maintained dividend. Among engineering stocks, Fairey Group raced forward 22 to 385p following an increased dividend. A 43 per cent setback at BBA left the shares only 2 down at 132p. The maintained dividend helped to prevent a greater fall in the shares. T &amp; N picked up 6 to 117p on talk that the company is likely to maintain the dividend when it reports its figures tomorrow. US recovery hopes boosted Siebe, which rose 16 to 596p. Brewers and spirits groups tended to be pulled up by the performance of Guinness. Allied-Lyons put on 5 to 650p and Grand Metropolitan climbed 12 to 908p. Figures from Hillsdown tomorrow are expected to show a decline in 1991 profits to around Pounds 184m from Pounds 191.2m. The shares rose 4 to 172p. In the leisure sector, sentiment was helped by a positive document from County NatWest as the stockbroker decided that 'the worst is over' and that, within certain criteria, '1992 will be the year when the sector resumes its pattern of outperformance' to the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. Reflection on its purchase of Virgin's music division helped Thorn EMI add 9 at 815p. There was good volume in Granada Group of 2.6m, the shares rising 5 to 260p, helped by a bullish presentation given by BSkyB, in which Granada is a shareholder. Euro Disney continued to benefit from its prospective inclusion in the CAC 40 index in Paris as French investors bought the stock ahead of the March 19 joining date. From that time, the stock can count on buying from index-related funds. The shares climbed 20 to 1655p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (71).

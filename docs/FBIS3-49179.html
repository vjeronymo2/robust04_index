			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Today Mircea Geoana, the spokesman of the  Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, held his weekly news  conference. [passage omitted]    Answering a journalist's question, Mr. Geoana referred to  certain aspects of Romanian-Hungarian relations:    [Begin Geoana recording] The statement made last week by  Gyula Horn is well known. He said -- and I am trying to  summarize his words -- that if the party he is leading wins the  general elections that are to be held during this year's spring  in Hungary and a government is set up in which Mr. Horn's party  held the majority, that would mean a historic turn in relations  between Romania and Hungary and, generally, between Hungary and  its neighboring countries. We believe that the issue of the  relations between Romania and Hungary is an issue of national  interest and we believe that the relaunching of those ties is an  absolutely vital need for the establishment of a stable  situation in this region. We also believe that it is an  absolutely necessary precondition for the two countries'  integration within Euro-Atlantic structures and that goal is  more important than any circumstantial political issue and  therefore it should be in the center of attention of any  [Hungarian] government, regardless of its political orientation.    I also have to say that the Mr. Horn's statement was  received  by us with great satisfaction, as it is quite obvious that in  the Hungarian political life they have realized the importance  of normalizing ties with Romania. We believe that a similar  thing is currently happening in Romania as well. [end Geoana  recording]</p>

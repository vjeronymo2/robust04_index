			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The 1995 fees for wrapped coin, nonstandard packaging, and nonstandard access are shown in Attachment VIII. Fees for other cash transportation services and registered mail fees can be obtained by contacting the individual Federal Reserve offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Competitive Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> All operational and legal changes considered by the Board that have a substantial effect on payment system participants are subject to the competitive impact analysis described in the March 1990 policy statement ``The Federal Reserve in the Payments System.'' In this analysis, the Board assesses whether the proposed change would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve in providing similar service due to differing legal powers or constraints or due to a dominant market position of the Federal Reserve deriving from such legal differences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board believes that the recommended price and service level changes would not have a substantial effect on payments system participants and would not have a direct and material effect on the ability of other service providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve in providing similar services. The 1995 fees approved by the Board result in a projected return on equity that meets the target return on equity based on the 50 bank holding company model. The Board believes that the recommended fees for the noncash collection services are consistent with the approach that would be used by a private-sector firm, which would absorb the results of structural changes through its retained earnings account. Therefore, the Board does not believe that approval of the proposed fees would have an adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete with the Reserve Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

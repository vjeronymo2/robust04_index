			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / BCCI: Creditors may be paid up to Dollars 2.2bn - BCCI's liquidators offer compensation designed to 'make peace' with the UAE A DEAL for compensation has finally been agreed between the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce International and its Abu Dhabi majority shareholders which could lead to the payment of as much as Dollars 2.2bn to creditors. The deal is dependent on agreement from creditors owed 70 per cent of the bank's Dollars 10bn liabilities, and will need court approval in England, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. Mr Brian Smouha, one of the bank's liquidators, said yesterday that getting enough people to agree to such an offer was likely to prove difficult. Also, many creditors are unlikely to come forward given the large amount of 'black' money in the bank linked to tax avoidance, drug smuggling and terrorism. Majority shareholders from Abu Dhabi will pay a flat Dollars 1.7bn in compensation. The figure could rise to as much as Dollars 2.2bn if claims exceed Dollars 10bn, or fall to as little as Dollars 1.2bn if they are less than Dollars 10bn. In return, the majority shareholders and the liquidators have agreed to drop claims and counter-claims. Creditors will have to sign over all legal rights before they can benefit. Mr Smouha said it was 'likely' that the liquidators and majority shareholders would sue advisers to the bank, though he refused to name them. 'We will sue wherever we're most likely to recover money,' he said. The two sides have agreed to co-operate on legal actions, and divide any money they recover equally. The BCCI depositors' association warned creditors yesterday not to accept the offer until it had been studied in more detail. 'We are not very happy,' said Mr Mourad Fleming of Richards Butler, a lawyer acting for the association. 'Creditors are being asked to give up very considerable rights. But we can't possibly say yet (whether the terms are attractive).' Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East who has campaigned on behalf of depositors, welcomed the 'generosity of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi'. However, he added that a meeting of creditors should be called to allow them to question the liquidators directly about the proposed deal.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATHS OF 2 HORSES CITED IN HALTING OF POLO GAMES  </P> <P> Prompted by the deaths of two horses after injuries in a polo match last month  and the rumored deaths of other horses, the Department of Animal Regulation on  Tuesday shut down the glitzy indoor arena polo games at the debt-ridden Los  Angeles Equestrian Center.  </P> <P> Officials of the city department said the management of the center in Griffith  Park has illegally held the polo contests in the 3,500-seat Equidome without  having a permit for the matches or other shows, such as rodeos. They said an  investigation is under way to determine whether center officials had also  violated state humane laws in the treatment of horses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Department's Blessing  </P> <P> Polo matches have been played with the knowledge and blessing of the city  Recreation and Parks Department, which has allowed such contests at the center  since 1983. Officials of that department said they were not aware that the  center's management did not have the proper permits.  </P> <P> "We've got a lot of questions about what's going on out there, and until we  answer them, they can no longer have arena polo at the center," said Michael  Burns, district supervisor for the Animal Regulation Department.  </P> <P> He said it could be up to a year before the center can obtain a permit to hold  any horse-related shows.  </P> <P> The move could mean the end of the 11-game polo season at the center and the  glamour that surrounds the events.  </P> <P> Celebrities such as actors William Shatner, William Devane and Mickey Dolenz  and singer Juice Newton frequent the matches as well as play polo. One official  said the matches are attended by the "Cadillac and champagne" set that dine on  cracked crab and calamari cocktail during the action.  </P> <P> Two thoroughbred polo ponies had to be destroyed when they broke legs during  the first minutes of a March 11 match, officials said. Burns said he had also  heard accounts of two other horses being killed at the center in the past but  said he had not confirmed the incidents.  </P> <P> Horse boarders at the center, which is on property owned by the city of Los  Angeles, have also complained to officials about horses with large open sores  being ridden during the games.  </P> <P> Officials at Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills, which operates the center,  called the department's action toward polo "outrageous."  </P> <P> Dean Harrison, general counsel for Gibraltar, said city officials had not  notified Gibraltar of the shutdown and had failed to return phone calls.  </P> <P> "This is an outrageous procedural thing by the city," he said. "This is  uncalled for. We welcome an inspection. We also note that this kind of accident  occurs frequently in race tracks around the country. The city has accused us of  intentionally harming animals, and we deny that."  </P> <P> Harrison said the revenues from the polo matches were important to the center,  which is more than $2 million in debt and is losing $80,000 to $100,000 a  month.  </P> <P> "This will hurt us, but hopefully not fatally," he said. "The season accounts  for between 8% to 10% of our yearly revenue.  </P> <P> "But without the matches, the public begins to lose interest, and they wonder  about the financial viability of the place. It has a domino effect."  </P> <P> Burns said he did not feel that the center deliberately failed to get the  proper permits. He said recreation and parks officials and center management  were probably unaware that the documents are required.  </P> <P> Polo -- a team game in which riders attempt to shoot a ball through goals with  a mallet -- involves a significant amount of pushing and bumping of horses,  which is all legal, unless a rider "bumps" off an opponent at an angle greater  than 45 degrees.  </P> <P> "We do know that horses have died doing this. But we don't know if it's an  unsafe event unless we can see how they are cared for," Burns said. "We have to  make sure they're in good shape. You can't send a horse into these events  without them being in good shape."  </P> <P> Burns said he would have a veterinarian inspect the horses for old and new  injuries. He said he wanted center officials to provide him with records of  horses that have been injured or killed during the polo matches.  </P></p>

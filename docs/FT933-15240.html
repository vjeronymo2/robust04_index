			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Burtonwood Brewery lower with Pounds 3.5m PRE-TAX profits dropped from Pounds 4.62m to Pounds 3.5m at Burtonwood Brewery in the year to March 31. The Cheshire-based company pointed out, however, that the figures last time included property profits, and stripping those out, the trading results were 27 per cent ahead. Turnover rose from Pounds 44.7m to Pounds 50.3m and beer volumes also improved 13 per cent. A 'significant impact' was made by the first full-year contribution from the 132 houses acquired on 25-year leases, the company said. A further 49 pubs had been acquired during the year. Earnings per share were 12p (18.6p) and a proposed final dividend of 3.98p (3.75p) lifts the total to 4.68p (4.45p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit expects  King Norodom Sihanouk will be able to bring about reconciliation  and peace in Cambodia, Army spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan said  yesterday.    He quoted the army chief as saying that the war in Cambodia  had been going on for more than 10 years and, if it continued,  it would affect Thailand and the good relationship between  Thailand and Cambodia.    Col Phalangkun said the peace conference between the  Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge to be held next month  at the behest of King Sihanouk was Cambodia's internal affairs.    The Thai armed forces, he said, wanted peace restored in  Cambodia.    "The best way to bring about peace is to stop fighting and  for all sides to reconcile," he said.    First Army Region commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo voiced  support for King Sihanouk's peace initiative "because the policy  of the Government and the Thai armed forces is to see peace and  reconciliation being restored in Cambodia."    He said he had told the Burapha Task Force on the eastern  border to compile evidence of cross-border shelling and the flow  of Cambodian refugees into Thailand.    "We want the Cambodian refugees to speak out openly when  they  want to go home because previously we were always accused of  forcing the Cambodians back," Lt-Gen Chettha said.    About 100 more Cambodian refugees fled to the border of Ta  Phraya district in Sa Kaeo Province on Friday night for fear of  a Khmer Rouge attack on their village.    The refugees from O Bai Chuan village, mostly women and  children, were settled in a temple in Ban Non Mak Mun.    One of the refugees, Mrs Chao, 68, told Thai police that  they  escaped because they heard that Khmer Rouge guerrillas would  attack their village and would kill all men wearing army uniform.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By PAP correspondent Wlodzimierz Korzycki] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 30 May, PAP -- "We will be intensifying  cooperation with the Federal Republic. Both sides are striving  toward this," General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the Polish Army  General Staff has told a PAP correspondent after talks at the  Bonn Defense Ministry. On day one of a three-day visit, Gen.  Wilecki had talks with his host, Gen. Klaus Naumann, inspector  general of the Bundeswehr, about joint undertakings by the two  Armies and about Partnership for Peace.    They agreed on closer contacts between the staffs of the  Polish Army and the Bundeswehr; between military districts, our  Pomeranian and Silesian, and their counterparts across the Odra;  and between the Navies.    Cross-border cooperation will be continued. According to the  generals, some units could establish twin partnerships and,  bewteen them, exchange training experiences. An agreement will  be signed in the near future to provide formal permission to  commanding personnel and servicemen's communities. This would  apply to several land and Naval units, especially those  stationed close to one another in the border zone. Twin  partnerships mean not only mutual observation of exercises, but  also contacts between families.    Asked about the role of Germany in our defense policy, Gen.  Wilecki replied that it was in Poland's interests to maintain  good contacts with all of our neighbors, including the Federal  Republic. "Until now we have had better relations with our other  neighbors; now we are levelling these."    The general conceded that in our public's consciousness  there  undoubtedly were obstacles against rapprochement with Germany.  But this process has to be started. If we are seriously  thinking about Partnership for Peace and integration with NATO,  Germany is our first natural neighbor along the road to  Brussels. "It plays one of the main parts in these structures  and I cannot imagine us not maintaining good contacts with them.  The leadership of the Bundeswehr views this cooperation  favorably," noted the chief of the Polish Army General Staff.    Gen. Wilecki will spend the next two days in Bavaria where  he  will be familiarized with the air defense system and the  training of highland infantry and engineering and ordnance  troops.</p>

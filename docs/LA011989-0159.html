			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JURY STRUGGLING IN BOMBING DEATH  </P> <P> The Los Angeles federal court jury deliberating in the trial of two people  accused in the 1980 bombing death of a Manhattan Beach woman said Wednesday  that it was unable to reach a verdict, but the judge told the panel to continue  its deliberations.  </P> <P> The panel sent a note to U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian Jr. after 2 1/2  days of deliberations, saying it was deadlocked on the charges against wealthy  Hawthorne real estate broker William Ross, 52, and Rochelle Ida Manning, 48, a  Los Angeles-born woman with dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship.  </P> <P> The two are accused of arranging the mailing of a bomb that exploded on July  17, 1980, killing Patricia Wilkerson, a Manhattan Beach secretary who died when  a parcel she opened exploded. Prosecutors said the bomb's intended target was  the dead woman's boss, Brenda Crouthamel, who had sued Ross in a real estate  dispute.  </P> <P> Tevrizian called the jury into court and ordered it to continue deliberations,  cautioning jurors that a retrial would be expensive and time-consuming.  </P> <P> The panel did not indicate how it was deadlocked on the two charges against the  defendants -- aiding and abetting and mailing an explosive device with intent  to kill.  </P></p>

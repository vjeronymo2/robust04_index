			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: Afloat in the deep jungle - On Safari I was alone, paddling a small dug-out canoe through flooded rainforest. The boat was borrowed, the paddle my own, traded with the Jagua Indians for valued T-shirts, and the forest was immense, writes Michael J.  Woods. The low afternoon sun penetrated the riverine trees, illuminating trunks whitened by lichens and the greens of thin palm fronds and huge leaved epiphytes. These, in turn, were reflected in the Amazon's motionless waters which, in spite of a patina of dust, leaves and twigs, formed a perfect reverse image. A ringed kingfisher flew across the water, a large bird with chestnut belly, white collar and determined manner, while a crimson crested woodpecker, in black with a red cap, pecked delicately at a dead stump. The Amazon near Iquitos in Peru, still 1,200 miles from the sea and normally five miles across, was flooded to almost twice its width. Banana fields were submerged, the houses, all on stilts, stood just above the flood, and water lapped deep into the forest. From Iquitos, a small town of crumbling facades, rusty corrugated iron and an atmosphere redolent of Greene and Conrad, we motored downstream to the Explorama Camp in a long narrow boat thatched against sun and rain. This was the first of three camps I visited, all designed in fundamentally the same simple and unobtrusive way with bedroom blocks linked by covered walkways to showers, toilets and communal areas festooned with hammocks. There is no electricity, little plumbing and the limited privacy in the bedrooms, which are designed to encourage a flow of air. The locations are perfect, the food good and the beds comfortable and well-netted to prevent mosquitoes 'singing a private song in your ear', as Julio Parano, our Peruvian Indian guide so aptly put it. Visiting at a time of high water had its advantages, for though the jungle walks were curtailed, we made up for that with river cruises in open boat. The rivers, twisting, caramel-coloured and soupy with silt, are the highways of the rainforest. There is constant traffic ranging from overloaded banana boats labouring upstream to the quick canoes of children which, on school days, line the shore by the schools. Parano, now a conservationist and guide, was raised as a hunter in the jungle and has senses appropriately honed. From the water his keen eyes spotted greenish coloured three-toed sloths clinging motionless to bankside foliage; he pointed out a bushy-tailed squirrel which scampered high into the tree tops; and once, identifying a pygmy marmoset by its squall, scoured the vegetation with his binoculars until he located its tiny form. Swallow-tailed kites wheeled above the trees, egrets hunted the shallows and parrots screeched past on whirring wings. One afternoon Julio took us in search of the hoatzin (pronounced watson), a noisy chicken-sized bird of some scarcity living on a lake in the centre of a forested island. High water had joined the pool to the river but, our long boat was too big to penetrate the trees. Unperturbed, Julio intercepted a local lad who was paddling past and hired him to carry us in pairs in his canoe, weaving deftly through the trunks, to spot several hoatzins as they squawked to one another in the twilight. Life with Julio was never dull. Unannounced, we would pull into villages to see what was going on. We were invited into houses to watch the cooking of manioc and the salting of fish; we weaved thatch, paddled canoes and joined local men in netting fish. Holding the heavy folds of the net in hands and teeth with a loop over one elbow, we whirled it outwards to open like a parachute, theoretically hitting the water in a circle and sliding through the surface to trap fish in its mesh bell. Although in practice the circle was often far from perfect, the fish were so numerous that every cast was a success. Everything in the rainforest seems to have grown to excessive size. Lily pads were like tea trays, insects as big as mice, butterflies the size of bats and bats as large as crows. But for a habitat as rich and varied as this, there is surprisingly little to see at ground level, for most of life goes on in the tree-tops. Fortunately, the Amazon Centre for Environmental Education and Research offers an opportunity, unique in South America, to wander around the canopy more than 100ft above the ground on a series of swooping suspension bridges. As I looked down, the jungle hummed and whined like a very bad international telephone line, interrupted periodically by pings and buzzes, yelps and yaps, while at my feet stretched a billowing carpet of leaves in every imaginable shade of green, from the palest celery to the blackest spring cabbage. Brightly-coloured birds stood out from its surface - azure-spangled cotingas, golden woodpeckers, green honeycreepers and red-throated caracaras. I watched a centipede make its sinuous way over the crevasses of bark and wondered idly if this was a species previously known to man. After the still, dark, humid oppression of the forest floor, the canopy walkway supplied a breath of fresh air. But the best moments were on the river as day broke. The soft light of dawn cast everything in a greeny-grey shade, a veil of mist shrouded the tree-tops and their perfect reflections wrinkled in our wake. Fishermen cast their nets with gentle splashes and blue-grey woodsmoke rose from rekindled fires. Apart from the quiet calls of children in their red cedar canoes, the only other sound was the dripping of water from up-raised paddles as we glided slowly through the Amazon jungle.

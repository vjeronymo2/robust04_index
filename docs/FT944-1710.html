			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: The right person to lead WTO Sir, Your leader concerning choice of a leader for the World Trade Organisation (December 14) is right on the mark. As important as the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round are to the future of world trade, so is the choice of the first leader of the WTO and the launch of this new entity. For those of us who worked on the round for years, it would be frustrating to see all of the efforts made to reach a broad and strong agreement frustrated by a poor leadership choice and/or an unproductive confrontation over the nature of the WTO at its outset. You make a very critical point in how governments should make their choices as to the WTO head - namely, that each candidate should be judged (among other important criteria) on his ability to draw support beyond his natural constituency. Thus, your point that Mr Renato Ruggiero - Italian former trade minister and the EU's official candidate - should be judged, among other criteria, on his support from such areas as Latin America and Asia. His support now is largely from the EU and countries closely tied to it. Similarly, it would follow that Mr Carlos Salinas, former Mexican president, must draw significant support from countries outside the western hemisphere; and that Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea trade minister, should be more than an Asian candidate. Your approach is meritorious and should help select a candidate based on ability. My own favourite, Mr Salinas, I would concede, must draw significant support from such areas as Africa, the Asian sub-continent and Australasia, rather than being solely a western hemisphere candidate. I believe he can do so as, at least in my judgment, the best candidate for this position at this time. Harry L Freeman, president, The Freeman Company, 4708 Dorset Avenue, Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815, US</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Bonn awaits court's ruling on Nato role GERMANY'S constitutional court yesterday failed to defuse tensions in the coalition government after it adjourned proceedings without a ruling on the legality of German military participation in the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Constitutional judges in Karlsruhe will meet again today to debate the appeal made by liberal Free Democrats (FDP), the junior party in the coalition, against an earlier cabinet decision for Germans to fly Nato missions in Awacs surveillance aircraft once the United Nations no-fly zone is enforced. The judges are expected to rule today only on the validity of an interim injunction requested by the FDP. If they issue the injunction, it would prevent German participation until the court rules on whether involvement in such missions violates a vague constitutional ban on German military participation in combat operations outside of the Nato area.</p>

			<p>920519 FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rise in number of DTI probes COMMERCIAL investigation requests made to the Department of Trade and Industry rose sharply in the fiscal year ended March 31 to 811, up from 723 the year before. The rise was attributed to the increased number of corporate failures as well as greater public awareness of the DTI's investigations unit. The number of convictions stemming from those investigations rose to eight in the first quarter of this year, compared with three in the previous quarter. Some of the convictions stem from investigations which were opened as long as four years ago.</p>

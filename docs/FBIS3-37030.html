			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- In his interview with a UNIAN correspondent  on 10 February, Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy  commented on certain aspects of Ukraine's accession to the  "Partnership for Peace" treaty. "I have not been calculating the  cost of Ukraine's participation in the partnership," he said.  "However, regional security is in the forefront of the treaty,  while issues which require payments go next. I consider the  signing of the treaty to be undoubtedly necessary and urgent.  As for the prospects for Ukraine's accession to NATO, our  military doctrine stipulates non- alignment, however our army,  undoubtedly, has all prerequisites for reforming its  infrastructure following the NATO states' pattern."</p>

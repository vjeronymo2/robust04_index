			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 CHARGED IN SLAYING OF SWAP MEET GUARD  </P> <P> Roland (Lucky) Teal used to preach on Sundays to the wards at Sylmar Juvenile  Hall. Now a youth arrested in his slaying is being held there.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old Pacoima boy was among three suspects charged Thursday with  murdering Teal, a popular security guard at the San Fernando Swap Meet.  </P> <P> Authorities allege that the juvenile, along with Ricardo Roldan, 19, of  Pacoima, and Richard Zorns, 19, of Arleta, took part in a June 3 robbery at the  swap meet during which Teal, 61, who was unarmed, was shot in the back when he  tried to stop them.  </P> <P> Each suspect was charged with murder, attempted murder and robbery. Roldan and  Zorns are being held without bail.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said he will attempt to  have the 17-year-old tried as an adult and will ask for the death penalty for  Roldan, who allegedly fired the Uzi-style assault weapon that killed Teal.  </P> <P> Teal, of Pacoima, had 15 children and stepchildren. Nine of them, ranging in  age from 3 to 16, were still living at home at the time of his death. He worked  several jobs to support his family.  </P> <P> Police allege that Roldan and the juvenile suspect robbed the swap meet's  manager, Barnie Pipkin, 68, as he stepped out of his office with bags  containing $12,000 in receipts he planned to deposit at a bank.  </P> <P> The robbers fired a shot at Pipkin but missed, and then fled to a nearby car  believed driven by Zorns, police said.  </P> <P> Teal jumped in his van and chased the car, cutting it off on nearby Borden  Street. When the juvenile allegedly attempted to run away with the money bags,  Teal grabbed him. Roldan then allegedly came up behind Teal and shot him in the  back, police said.  </P></p>

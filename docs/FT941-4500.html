			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Brazil minister seeks poll pact Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, has been in exploratory talks with the right-of-centre Liberal Front party (PFL), the second-largest in Congress, with a view to building an alliance ahead of October's presidential elections. Both sides are reluctant to talk about the discussions, which are still at an early stage. Mr Cardoso, who is trying to push an ambitious economic restructuring programme through Congress, is also measuring reaction to the proposed alliance within his own party, the Social Democratic Movement (PSDB). Linking with the PFL would provide Mr Cardoso with a viable political base and support in the country's north-east, where he has looked weak in all opinion polls. It would also provide a strong challenge to the present presidential front-runner, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers party. In the latest polls, Mr da Silva won 30 per cent backing compared with Mr Cardoso's 11 per cent. Mr Lus Eduardo Magalhaes, leader of the PFL in the lower house, said the situation should become clearer by the end of this month, the deadline for Mr Cardoso to resign under Brazilian law if he wants to run for president.</p>

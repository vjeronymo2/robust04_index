			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Apathy rules on Hurd's home ground It is 9pm and Mr Douglas Hurd is on home ground. About 40 people, not his best crowd, have come to hear the foreign secretary at a public meeting in the Oxfordshire town of Witney. Europe is not a subject calculated to persuade the people of the surrounding Cotswolds to abandon their sitting rooms for the draughty auditorium of the town's ancient Corn Exchange. Much better to watch on television the ceremonies commemorating the D-day landings 50 years ago. Anyway, Mr Hurd has represented the area in parliament for 20 years. Familiarity breeds apathy. Mr Hurd, ending a day on the campaign trail, decides to strike a positive note. With his eye on a group of inquisitive teenagers shuffling in the back row he reminds us what the EU is all about. We take for granted there will never be another D-day. 'Britons and Germans and Frenchmen and Italians will never fight each other again.' He adds: 'We don't want to go back to the days when it wasn't so - and to start filling the cemeteries again.' It is a change of tack. For much of the day he has been echoing the more familiar themes of the Conservatives' campaign for Thursday's European elections. The government will prevent Britain's national identity being submerged in a centralised European Union. It will preserve the veto. It will promote a multi-speed, multi-track Europe in which governments can opt in or out of further integration. This is the message that Mr John Major's government has decided will play best on the doorstep. Its strategy has a single purpose: to galvanise enough core support to prevent an inevitable defeat turning into a humiliating rout. That may prove impossible. But waving the Union Jack offers the best chance. Mr Hurd the Eurosceptic does not sound as convincing as Mr Hurd the statesman who knows that Britain's security and prosperity are inextricably bound to Europe. But his political authority and his credentials as a good European allow him to be at once critical of and positive about Europe. He understands the difference between patriotism and nationalism. So it is a nice irony that Witney forms part of the sprawling European constituency where the result will spell the difference between defeat and disaster for the government. The Cotswolds seat has been represented by Lord (Henry) Plumb since 1979. Five of the six parliamentary constituencies encompassed by a boundary stretching from the west of Gloucestershire to the edge of Oxford are held by Tory MPs. In other times it would be unthinkable for such a slice of affluent England to elect anyone but a Tory. But boundary changes have replaced two Tory strongholds with the Labour enclave of the Forest of Dean. The Liberal Democrats have marched into the area's town halls. The risk - as Lord Plumb warns potential supporters at every opportunity - is that Tory voters will punish the government for domestic policy mistakes by abstaining. Travelling with the foreign secretary through the towns and villages, that risk is all too apparent. As Mr Hurd sips a half-pint of beer in the Beehive pub in Carterton, Mr Michael Bulley, a local party activist, admits that there is no real enthusiasm for the Tory effort: 'A lot of Conservatives are sitting on their hands . . . I haven't seen a poster yet.' Things have improved in the past few days as Mr Major's message about preserving British sovereignty has started to get across. But the voters are keener to talk about local or national issues. It is the same in Woodstock, the affluent home of Blenheim Palace. Here elderly local activists are preoccupied with council tax bills, rising crime rates and their dependency on a single grocery shop. Mr Hurd exhorts them to focus on issues European, to tell their neighbours that the choice is 'between voting for sensible people like Henry (Lord Plumb) who believe in a Europe of nation states and the Libs and Labs who want to push more power to the centre in Brussels'. He draws a response of which Lord Tebbit would be proud. Mrs Peggy Morris, a retired party stalwart, knows where she stands: 'The thing I dislike intensely is being ruled by the Germans and those others.' And therein lies the risk to Mr Hurd's careful strategy. He developed the theme, now taken up by Mr Major, of a multi-speed, multi-track Europe to reconcile the reality of the nation state with the imperative of closer European co-operation. In Mr Hurd's mind this so-called 'variable geometry' is a practical expression of the future shape of a union which may soon embrace 20 nations. His confidence that others will recognise the case for flexibility rather than centralisation is real rather than obstructionist. Mr Hurd is agnostic about a European single currency. He does not see the case for any significant extension of the union's competences. But he does believe that in foreign and defence policy Europe must intensify, not weaken, co-operation. The problem is that he has handed a powerful weapon to the Euro-sceptics. His idea has conferred respectability on the notion that Britain can draw a line in the sand. Whatever the rest of the EU decides in the way of further integration, Britain can opt out. Mr Hurd caught a glimpse of the danger on the campaign trail. During canvassing in a Cotswold shopping complex a passing voter offered unsolicited approval for the Tory campaign. He was all for defending British interests. The foreign secretary turned and beamed. Until the middle-aged man offered a parting shot: 'Bring back Maggie, that's what I say.'</p>

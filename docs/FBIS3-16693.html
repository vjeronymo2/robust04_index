			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- There can no longer be quick  and popular solutions in the economy, Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin said.    In his speech to the Federation Council, the upper house of  Russia's new parliament, on Thursday Chernomyrdin said that  after steep price rises in January "inflationary processes have  slightly slowed down." In February inflation was about ten per  cent. In 1993 the number of people living beyond the  subsistence level shrank twofold. Presently, there are 25  million such people in Russia.    However, the situation in the country "remains extremely  complex on the whole," the premier continued. He blamed this on  the continuing production decline which causes stoppages in the  work of industrial enterprises. As a result of such stoppages  22 million man-days were lost at 4,000 enterprises in February.    Chernomyrdin believes stoppages are caused by "difficulties  in selling finished products." They account for the loss of 58  per cent of working time. One third of losses is caused by the  shortage of material resources, six per cent "are connected with  the conversion of the defence complex."    He said it would be "premature and inappropriate" to feel  elated about the decrease in inflation. The main problems in  the economy "are directly connected with non-payments which are  the most vivid indicator of the depth and intensity of crisis  processes." As of March 1, 1994, "overdue credit debts exceeded  25 trillion roubles. Overdue debit debts totalled about 32  trillion rouble," he said.    There are several factors behind the problem of  non-payments,  the prime minister explained. Among them he named "debts of CIS  republics to the fuel and energy complex," "uncontrolled money  movement" and "inability of many heads of industrial enterprises  to increase labour productivity." Chernomyrdin stressed the need  to "get rid of incapable leaders."    To solve the problem of non-payments, the government has  mapped out several measurers, including to pay off the debt for  1993 estimated at 4.6 trillion roubles by the end of March. A  new procedure for issuing centralised credits has been  introduced. Under the new regulations, they will be issued to  end users for targeted payments. There are also plans to  introduce soon a mechanism for settling overdue credit debts  through finance bills. Additionally, commercial bills will be  introduced. Work is underway to prepare documents obliging tax  payers to provide information about all of their bank accounts.    "The government is taking measures to begin the process of  halting ineffective industries and will actively use bankruptcy  proceedings," Chernomyrdin said.</p>

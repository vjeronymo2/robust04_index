			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> THE CLASS OF '89 MOVES ON  </P> <P> Here's how The Times' Freshman Class of '89 fared during the past 12 months:  </P> <P> Neneh Cherry: Dubbed "the Joni Mitchell of hip-hop," the young Londoner capped  1989 with a Grammy nomination for best new artist. But Cherry was quiet during  1990 except for a radical version of "I Got You Under My Skin" on "Red, Hot and  Blue," the new Cole Porter anthology album. She is now working on a new album,  due next spring.  </P> <P> De La Soul: The flower-power rap trio's "3 Feet High and Rising" album finished  first in both the Village Voice and New Musical Express critics' polls in 1989  and earned the group a Grammy nomination for best rap album. A new album, "De  La Soul Is Dead," is scheduled for release in early 1991.  </P> <P> Lenny Kravitz: The New Yorker became an MTV favorite with "Let Love Rule" and  was the opening act on tours with Tom Petty and David Bowie. He wrote and  produced Madonna's new single, "Justify My Love," contributed to the "Return of  Superfly" score and is finishing a second album, featuring collaborations with  Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash.  </P> <P> Mary's Danish: Picked by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the five new acts to  watch, the energetic Los Angeles-based alternative-rock band fronted by singers  Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager has just released a live EP and video, and  will release its second album early next year.  </P> <P> N.W.A: The rap group that put Compton on the musical map drew national  attention as the target of a letter from an FBI official accusing its stark,  urban "documentaries" and fantasies of encouraging violence against law  enforcement officers. Chief lyricist Ice Cube went solo, but the recent N.W.A  EP "100 Miles and Runnin' " shows the remaining four quite capable of raising  issues and eyebrows. An new album is due in early 1991.  </P> <P> Soul II Soul: Jazzie B's musical "family" became the most honored new soul  group during 1990. It won two Grammys, virtually swept the Soul Train Awards  and garnered more American Music Awards nominations than any other act for the  debut album "Keep On Movin'." A second album, "Vol. II -- 1990 -- A New  Decade," got mixed reviews, but has sold nearly a million copies in the U.S.  </P> <P> Stone Roses: The leading act of the heady, "neo-psychedelic" scene in  Manchester, England (as featured in major stories in Calendar and Rolling  Stone) continues to be the sensation of the British pop world and a hit on  college/alternative radio in the U.S. But its long-awaited U.S. tour was  cancelled in favor of working on the crucial second album, which is promised  for spring.  </P> <P> Soundgarden: The most prominent act of the dark-hued new-metal/alternative-rock  Seattle sound received a heavy-metal Grammy nomination, while singer Chris  Cornell earned kudos from no less a wailer than Axl Rose. The band's at home in  the studio now preparing its second major-label album.  </P> <P> Texas: From the Scottish Highlands but influenced by the wide open spaces of  its namesake state, the young group proved even more stirring in concert than  on its atmospheric, enticing debut album. A second album is due in the spring.  </P> <P> Tone Loc: The long-awaited follow-up to the 2-million-selling debut album  "Loc-ed After Dark" is still a ways off, but Tone (who was nominated for a best  new artist Grammy last year) been busy contributing songs to film scores  (including "Marked for Death" and "The Return of Superfly") and making cameo  acting appearances (the "Ferris Bueller" TV series and the film "The Adventures  of Ford Fairlane").  </P></p>

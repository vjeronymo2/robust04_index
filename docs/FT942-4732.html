			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bloomsbury Publishing to raise Pounds 5m via placing Bloomsbury Publishing, the Soho-based company started in 1986 is seeking to raise Pounds 5m in a placing when it comes to the market this month, writes Antonia Sharpe. The flotation will value the company at about Pounds 8.5m. A prospectus will be issued next week and dealings should start the week after. Of the total raised, Pounds 2m will go to Bloomsbury's original backers which include Baring Venture Partners, Caledonia Investments and ECI Ventures. After the flotation, their combined stake will fall from a little less than 50 per cent to a little more than 10 per cent. About Pounds 250,000 will be shared among the authors who are beneficiaries of the Bloomsbury Authors' Trust. The remainder will be used to expand into home reference books, paperbacks and children's books.</p>

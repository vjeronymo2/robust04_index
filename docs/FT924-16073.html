			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Inflation renews its threat: The reactions in engineering to devaluation THE devaluation of sterling has brought a welcome impetus to the competitiveness of British engineering companies in export markets. But the threat of more expensive imports has revived worries about stoking inflation. The six engineering companies that feature in an occasional FT series tracking the sector's performance believe the boost to exports should benefit the whole UK economy. Some, though, feel that last week's cut in base rates of 1 percentage point was either not enough, or needs to be accompanied by other measures to stimulate manufacturing industry or infrastructural spending without depressing the pound further. Above all, they do not want to see sterling quite as low as it is now. 'Maybe DM2.95 was too high, but I'm damned sure it is too low at around DM2.50,' says Mr John Bell, chief executive of Senior Engineering Group. 'At the end of the day we'll get a high inflation rate back.' Many UK engineering companies echo the views of Mr Peter Burton, chief executive of Walsall-based Bloxwich Engineering, that sterling entered the European exchange rate mechanism at too high a rate. Even so, there are strong pleas for an eventual return to a stabilised currency system such as the ERM. Mr Peter Barker, chairman of Fenner, says: 'I don't believe a floating pound is right for Britain in the long term.' Mr Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman of JCB, says: 'There is a need for currency stability, and the easiest way is through the ERM.' But the rules need to be clarified. 'There has to be something very wrong in the ERM's structure when all this has happened through the sheer movement of funds,' he says. With few, if any, signs yet of recovery in their domestic markets, the companies with strong export markets are determined to make the most of the unexpected stimulus from devaluation. Larger companies such as Fenner, which has three manufacturing plants in the US, will benefit from profit translation and a substantial revaluation of US assets. A lower pound 'must be helpful' for exporting into Europe, Mr Barker says, although he emphasises that not everybody in British engineering was uncompetitive at DM2.95. For companies such as JCB, with strong market shares in Europe, the effective devaluation may not represent a 'massive opportunity' in volume terms but will make a difference to margins, according to Mr Johnston. Several companies also pointed out the benefits from the fall in the pound against the dollar. 'The dollar rate was far too high, it was nearly impossible to sell into the US,' says Mr Burton. 'And because other currencies were tied in with the dollar, we had great difficulty selling into the Pacific Rim, too.' At 600 Group, Dr Colin Gaskell, the managing director, hopes selling into the US will be much easier with a weaker pound. 'Through our own operation,' he says, 'we can improve margins or cut prices  -whichever is better to improve returns. That is useful in a market such as the US where price is critical.' The effect is reversed, of course, for importers. One of the FT Six, Posiva, imports its products from its German parent, and has moved quickly to decide on its tactics, says Mr Reg Bricknell, chief executive. 'We don't expect to make any increases in prices - the market would not bear it,' he says. 'We'll have to absorb as much of the difference as we can, and are looking at whether we can become even more efficient, source more in the UK, or do more ourselves.' Other companies that import products for sale in the UK, or have competitors that import, believe that at least in the short term the effect of the devaluation will be absorbed rather than passed on to customers through price increases. Mr Burton adds that eventually foreign competitors will have to raise prices to protect their margins. Mr Bell expresses concern that engineering companies such as Senior might find some import costs - such as for raw materials - rising, while UK customers refuse to accept price increases. Mr Bricknell points out that a general rise in inflation is more dependent on trends in the high street such as the purchase of foreign consumer electronics than on price rises in manufacturing industry. Dr Gaskell says the 1-point cut in interest rates has at least ended a damaging 'hiatus' during which talk of higher rates had a negative effect on customer confidence. Mr Bell says the fear of rekindling inflation underpins the caution at most of the FT Six about deep cuts in interest rates. That is why other solutions to stimulating the economy are suggested. Mr Bell wants incentives from the government to spur investments by industry. Mr Johnston at JCB opts for a programme of public works and increased spending on the infrastructure.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "MING PAO's Response to XINHUA Article Entitled </F> `Xi Yang Sentenced to 12 Years Imprisonment at First Trial'"]    [Text] First, the XINHUA article once again showed that Xi  Yang was actually engaged in normal news gathering as understood  by the Hong Kong journalistic circles.    In June and July last year, a number of important meetings  concerning Hong Kong were held in Beijing and MING PAO sent two  reporters, one of whom was Xi Yang, to cover the news in  Beijing. During this period, Xi Yang also covered economic news  concerning China's macroeconomic control, which was of keen  interest to people in various circles at that time. All  arrangements made between MING PAO and Xi Yang were within the  scope of news gathering and there was no such thing as doing  something without relation to news gathering in the name of  covering news in Beijing. The XINHUA article once again proved  that Xi Yang delivered all the materials he gathered from news  gathering to MING PAO for open publishing and did not use the  information for any other purpose.    Second, PRC Criminal Procedure Law, Chapter 2, First  Section,  Article 121 stipulates: "All sentences are announced openly  without exception." According to the annotation on this article  in the book "Collection of Annotations on the PRC Laws" compiled  by the National People's Congress Law Committee: "The People's  Courts will openly announce their decisions on all cases no  matter whether the cases are tried openly or secretely." The  "Collection of Annotations" particularly mentions that the  decisions on cases related to state secrets and tried secretely  should also be announced openly. Relevant law experts in Beijing  pointed out that an open announcement of court decisions should  at least include the following two points:    1. Delivery of the court verdicts to the accused and the  public prosecutors concerned.    2. Posting of the written court verdicts on the notice  boards of the courts with the signatures of the courts'  responsible officials and the seals of the courts.    According to the XINHUA article, the Chinese authorities  only  satisfied the first point. It is perplexing as to why the court  has not yet made public the verdict and the details of the case  were only partly revealed by XINHUA. According to the  instructions of the court in Beijing, Xi Yang's lawyers were not  allowed to reveal any details of the case to the public.  Therefore, before the court verdict was officially made public,  it was unfair to the appelant that the Chinese authorities gave  a unilateral account of the case through the news agency.    Third, the XINHUA article said that Xi Yang's case was very  serious and Xi Yang might be sentenced to a prison term of over  10 years. However, the article did not quote the official  concern and did not mention what evidence showed that the case  could be considered as very serious. On the contrary, according  to Dr Lo Cheung-kwok, a member of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, who pointed out in his capacity as a  finance expert that, under the current financial operation  system, the information about China's gold trading and interest  rate adjustment as reported by Xi Yang absolutely could not  cause any serious economic losses to the state.</p>

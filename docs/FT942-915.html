			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: South Africa Two months after its first all-race elections, South Africa is reaping the reward in terms of access to international capital. Liberty Life, the country's largest insurance company, is leading the way with a Dollars 500m convertible bond offering. Smaller debt and equity issues are sure to follow. Last week's budget included a government overseas borrowing target of R1.8bn (Pounds 320m). Yet buying rand-denominated assets remains difficult. Despite being the world's 10th largest equity market, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is notoriously illiquid thanks to a complex web of cross-holdings. Until South African companies and institutions are free to invest overseas, equities will remain gridlocked. The financial rand - a closed pool of currency through which all inward investment must be channelled - is another hurdle. True, foreign investors enjoy exceptionally high bond yields because the financial rand trades at a discount to the domestic currency. But the closed pool restricts liquidity, making it difficult to buy and sell. These factors are likely to limit the flow of foreign investment in South Africa, however promising the economic fundamentals may seem. While the discount on the financial rand remains high, the government may be too worried about capital flight to abolish exchange controls. The danger is that the discount will not close because international investors dislike dealing in the volatile financial rand. Unless the government takes the initiative, South Africa could find itself locked into a damaging stand-off.</p>

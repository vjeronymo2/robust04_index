			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / UN struggles for a role in Somalia: An inauspicious start to today's peace talks THE humiliation of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary general, by 500 anti-UN protesters in Mogadishu yesterday was a demonstration of the difficulties facing the UN chief in critical Somali peace talks which open in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa today. Demonstrators loyal to Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, Somalia's most powerful warlord, chanted 'Boutros Ghali go home' as they pelted the UN headquarters in Mogadishu with rocks and grapefruit skins and tore down and stamped on UN flags and signboards. The UN chief was forced to abandon plans to visit the building and retreated to the airport by helicopter, leaving some of his most senior aides besieged inside the headquarters. It was an inauspicious start to the secretary-general's Somalia peace mission. Fourteen Somali factions are due to meet in Addis Ababa this morning under Mr Boutros Ghali's chairmanship in the first serious round-table political conference aimed at beginning a process to end the bitter clan warfare that has destroyed Somalia and created a famine which has cost at least 300,000 lives. Finding a political solution to Somalia's two-year conflict is fundamental to ending the faction fighting and therefore the starvation created largely by banditry. Without political reconciliation the cycle of violence and death from starvation cannot be broken. But for the UN the stakes are high. Its repeated efforts in the past 24 months to broker peace talks have failed, and many believe today's talks have come about only because of the US military intervention in Somalia. Several of the faction leaders invited to the informal talks are deeply critical of the role the UN has played in Somalia. Some go as far as accusing the UN of fuelling the fighting by exacerbating divisions among the factions. At best, UN officials are hoping to lay the groundwork for an agenda, venue and list of delegates to a national reconciliation conference, probably in Somalia within three months, which will pave the way for an interim assembly and administration. At worst, the conference could collapse in acrimony with the warlords accusing the UN of malicious meddling. Failure in Addis Ababa could sink hopes for political reconciliation and discredit the UN and Mr Boutros Ghali, already under pressure in Bosnia and Cambodia. Critics say the UN may have already sown the seeds of failure by convening a conference without adequately preparing the groundwork. They also say that by inviting only warlords and factions, and not intellectuals and elders, the UN is legitimising those directly responsible for the violence and famine who do not have popular support and cannot deliver genuine reconciliation. 'All the conditions for failure are there,' says Mr Abdul Mohamed, a member of the conference secretariat and a Horn of Africa expert. 'The UN has not done its political homework in Somalia and this is going to haunt them and further marginalise the UN at a time when it is critical for it to regain the confidence of Somalis.' Before any real work can be done resolving the differences between the splintered clan-based factions, the UN must try to win over Gen Aideed, who controls most of Mogadishu, and his ally in the Somalia National Alliance (SNA), Col Omar Jess, who controls the southern port of Kismayu. It was here that a British UN relief worker was shot dead on Saturday, prompting Unicef to withdraw its international staff from the city yesterday. Both men are hostile to the UN. They want to deal solely with the US and are intent on exploiting divisions between the US and the UN over disarmament of factions and the timetable for the handover from US forces in Somalia to UN peacekeepers. In a statement before leaving Mogadishu for Addis Ababa, Gen Aideed said that the 'UN bureaucrats had failed time and time again to demonstrate any understanding of the intricate political situation in Somalia'. He said he agreed to take part in the conference only because it was 'informal and preparatory'. He went on to attack the UN role in Somalia as 'too ad hoc, meddling, secretive, divisive and partial' to produce any positive results for the good of the country. His blunt criticism of the UN intensified doubts about the chances of success at the Addis Ababa conference. In private, senior US officials also voice criticism about the UN role in Somalia and say it was the organisation's failure to resolve the crisis and mount a serious humanitarian relief operation which prompted US military intervention. US officials also say they have had greater success in political reconciliation than the UN, brokering the first face-to-face talks between Gen Aideed and his arch rival, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, last month. Washington, however, is reluctant to get drawn in too far. Mr Bush has continued to insist that US troops are on a limited humanitarian mission and must pull out within weeks and hand over to UN peacekeepers. Mr Boutros Ghali has tried unsuccessfully to put pressure on the US to disarm the factions and is believed to be stalling on talks about the transition from the US-led operation to a UN force until Washington gives in to his request. He does not want to inherit the problems of disarmament. For better or for worse the UN is going to be the key player in Somalia. The challenge in Addis Ababa today will be to impress that reality on the faction leaders and start building the framework for a broad-based national political reconciliation.

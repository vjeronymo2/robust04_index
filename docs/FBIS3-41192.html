			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lagos, 31 Jan. (NAN) -- The flag officer commanding  Western Naval Command (WNC), Rear Admiral Jibril Ayinla, has  directed the immediate withdrawal of all naval personnel  attached to private jetties in the areas of operation of the  command, the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reports. Disclosing  this in an interview with NAN today in Lagos, Rear Admiral  Ayinla, said that the decision was necessitated by the need to  re-appraise naval strategy of policing private jetties in the  Western and Delta coastal areas to enhance effectiveness.    The flag officer commanding [FOC] said that the current  practice of stationing naval personnel to police and verify  cargoes at private jetties would be replaced with naval task  forces, to effectively combat the menace of smugglers, illegal  bunkerers [as received] and ferrying of hard drugs. The task  forces, he said, would be set up at different locations in the  areas of operations of naval units where such jetties were  located. Members of the task forces each of which would be  under the command of an officer, Rear Admiral Ayinla said, would  undertake regular patrol and conduct raids and inspection of  vessels at the private jetties.    The FOC said that the current move, was part of naval  efforts  to sustain and intensify battles against misuse of private  jetties for economic sabotage and anti-social purposes,  particularly as the federal government was striving to revive  the nation's economy. He said that the Navy, had earlier  observed that some of its personnel posted to man some private  jetties were being corrupted, hence, the need to change  strategy. On the state of the operational readiness of the  ships in the arsenal of the Western Command, Rear Admiral Ayinla  said that though most of the ships were behind in their  maintenance programme, the command was going to "improvise,  innovate and use initiative to make the best of a very bad  situation." He said that ideally, naval ships should be taken  out of water every nine months for maintenance, but pointed out  that this had not been possible due to non-availability of funds.    Rear Admiral Ayinla advocated increased funding of the Navy,  to enable the force [to] effectively discharge its duties of  protecting the nation's coastal resources, particularly oil.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Armenian-Azeri dispute 'a war', says CIS chief FIGHTERS from Armenia and Azerbaijan are attacking towns in each others' territory, in what appears to be escalating into war between the two republics, according to Lt-Gen Boris Pyankov, deputy head of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). However, Gen Pyankov's assessment of the conflict over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh appeared to be at odds with a claim from Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel, in Ankara yesterday, that the two sides had achieved a ceasefire. According to a military commander in Agdam, speaking earlier yesterday, an Azerbaijani official had left Agdam for talks with the Armenian authorities within Karabakh. In the first direct move by the United Nations, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali said yesterday he was sending Mr Cyrus Vance to the area on a fact-finding mission. In a message to Mr Jiri Dienstbier, Czechoslovak foreign minister and president of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, Mr Boutros Ghali said the situation called for concerted efforts for a peaceful solution. He also sent messages to the Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders calling for 'maximum restraint'. Mr Vance is to visit Nagorno-Karabakh, Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, and Baku, the Azerbaijani capital. In the other main conflict in the former Soviet Union, a ceasefire established in the republic of Moldova between Moldovans and ethnic Russians broke down yesterday and two people were killed. In the Russian parliament yesterday, Gen Pyankov said that 'fighting has gone beyond the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, and is going on in the region of Agdam, which is being stormed by Armenian militants'. Agdam is several kilometres inside Azerbaijan, near the Karabakh border. Azeri forces were also pushing over the border of Armenia in the Kazakh region. He said CIS army families were 'in effect' being held hostage in the two republics, with 27 of the former 67 CIS posts on the border between the two countries still not evacuated, because of attacks by militants. In the past two months, CIS forces in Transcaucasia had sustained 112 attacks and 11 deaths: 87 in Azerbaijan, 13 in Georgia and 12 in Armenia. The CIS garrisons could not retaliate against attacks, he said, because they did not possess sufficient strength, but local people, who saw the posts as a form of security, were refusing to allow them to leave. The Ministry of Defence said yesterday an order had been given to evacuate the posts. Gen Pyankov called for CIS military in the area, under the command of the Transcaucasian military district in neighbouring Georgia, to be put under Russian jurisdiction, prior to being pulled out. He said 103 men of Armenian descent, who had belonged to the 366 regiment which was pulling out of Karabakh, had opted to stay to fight. Earlier yesterday, Reuters agency reported people streaming away from Agdam as rumours of an Armenian attack mounted and as it came under extensive rocket attack. Mr Gyunduzh Akhundov, the mayor of Agdam, said that ten rockets had fallen overnight, killing three people.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan by </F> Tsvetana Krusteva in Sofia; date not given: "Disintegration of  Soviet Union Is Still Continuing"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Krusteva] It is claimed  that Moscow is the key to solving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.    [Papazyan] I am not sure how far one can claim this. Of  course, Moscow wields very great influence in Azerbaijan,  Nagorno-Karabakh, and Armenia, but I would not say the key lies  in Moscow. Moscow has influence over all the parties to the  conflict, as it has over all the processes in the former USSR, a  fact that one has to bear in mind. However, the point in this  case is that other countries are now being drawn into the  conflict as well. Moscow is not the only one that can influence  the peace process, but also Iran and certain other states. We  should not forget that 2,000 Afghan mojahedin are fighting for  the Azeris against the Karabakh army and the self-defense forces.    We think the best way to seek peace is to organize talks  through international organizations. It seems that now it is  possible to negotiate a cease-fire. If we manage to stop the  war, then we can start talks in other directions as well, such  as on withdrawing troops from the occupied territories and on  suspending the blockade of Armenia.    [Krusteva] Can Armenia exist without Russia, and vice-versa?    [Papazyan] We are existing without them right now.    [Krusteva] What is your view on ideas mooted in Moscow of  creating a new state to replace the former USSR?    [Papazyan] They are unrealistic. Such proposals have no  real foundation. Naturally, Armenia has strong historical links  with Russia, and I do not think this is such a bad thing. In  principle we believe that we should maintain good relations with  Moscow, and as far as I know they think the same. Wherever  possible, we will deepen these relations. We are allied with  Russia, but want to cooperate with other countries as well. We  have quite good relations with Iran, which is our third biggest  trading partner, and I think we can extend our relations with  them in the future. We also have good relations with some EU  countries, such as France, and also with the United States.    [Krusteva] Why was Armenia one of the CIS countries that did  not object to President Yeltsin's proposed decree on creating  Russian military bases on the territory of the former USSR?  Other CIS countries reacted sharply.    [Papazyan] There is no need even for negotiations on this,  because for a long time we have had a treaty with Russia on  maintaining three Russian bases in Armenia, and they exist.  Armenia was one of the founders of the CIS, and actively  participates in the community because we believe one must delay  the disintegration of the USSR. In my view, this disintegration  is still continuing. All the conflicts on the territory of the  former Soviet Union prove this. We must ensure that the "pain"  during the period of disintegration is as mild as possible.  [passage omitted]    [Krusteva] Ankara recently accused Yerevan of allowing the  Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) to maintain bases on its territory.    [Papazyan] The Turkish leadership is unable to grasp that  Turkey has to solve its own problems, and there is no point in  seeking solutions where they do not exist. Armenia does not  help the PKK. Even if it wanted to, Armenia is not in a  position to help them. Armenia needs help itself and is in  receipt of humanitarian aid. In principle we are against  interference in the internal affairs of any country.  Incidentally, Armenia is not the only country against which  Demirel and the other Turkish leaders make such accusations.  They claim that Iran, Syria, and Greece are helping the PKK.  We attribute this to the fact that Ankara cannot find a way to  solve this problem.    [Krusteva] In an interview with a Russian newspaper,  President Demirel said that Armenia should maintain good  relations with Turkey if it wants to develop well in its region.  What do you think?    [Papazyan] I agree with Demirel, but would add that if  Turkey wants to have good relations with Azerbaijan of the  Central Asian republics, it should also have good relations with  Armenia. [passage omitted]    [Krusteva] Mr. Papazyan, what does Armenia want in the  Balkans?    [Papazyan] Politically speaking, we have always have good  traditional relations with the Balkan countries. Our people  have many common historical and cultural links. We should not  have good relations only with Russia and Iran, for example, but  also with any other country that wants this. Accordingly, we  are ready for cooperation. In the Balkans and in Bulgaria, I  hope that we will discover that we understand one another. I  came here after visiting Romania, toward which we have the same  attitude. We are ready to cooperate with any country, even  Turkey, but unfortunately at the moment Ankara is still not  ready for this.    [Krusteva] You signed a trade agreement here, but last year  our imports from Armenia fell in comparison with 1992. How will  out bilateral trade develop in the future?    [Papazyan] I would point out that I am responsible for  foreign affairs. My most important task is to find solutions to  the problems that face me in my own field, such as a peaceful  solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. If this is achieved,  I am absolutely certain that Armenia will very quickly  experience an economic upsurge. Our country was one of the most  developed former Soviet republics, but because of the warfare in  Nagorno-Karabakh and the economic blockade we are in a very  difficult situation. As regards our bilateral relations with  Bulgaria, at the moment we are laying a juridical basis for  them. [passage omitted]</p>

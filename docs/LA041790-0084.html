			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEWS;  </P> <P> RUSCHA: GOOFY, POPULAR, PROFOUND  </P> <P> Rolling into town in the early '60s from his native Oklahoma, Ed Ruscha  established himself as the fair-haired boy of West Coast art, and it doesn't  look as though that's ever going to change. Women love him (he's handsome,  witty and has the bashful good manners of a Midwesterner), critics find his  style of Pop Conceptualism suitable for heavy theorizing, he's extremely  prolific, and his work -- which is amazingly, consistently good -- is wildly  popular. Why do people like this art so much? The answer to that question can  be found in a survey of Ruscha prints on view at the Richard Green Gallery.  </P> <P> For starters, Ruscha's work is visually quite yummy. He has an impeccable sense  of composition and a delightfully whimsical feeling for color. However, the  fundamental appeal of his work lies elsewhere; it's the posture this art  strikes that's so seductive.  </P> <P> This showcase of 90 works dating from 1962 through 1990 finds Ruscha exploring  a diversity of themes (loneliness, language and desire to name a few). However,  regardless of where he shifts his gaze, he greets the world with the same wry  smile, a goofy pun, a blank stare. It's hard to think of an artist with a  lighter touch, yet his work has soul and the weight of deep intelligence as  well -- and therein lies the genius of this art. Ruscha acknowledges the  considerable difficulties of being a human being in the 20th Century -- he's  clearly tuned in to the Zeitgeist -- yet his work is virtually Angst free.  Consequently, it's oddly reassuring and soothing.  </P> <P> In perusing this show, one is struck by the fact that despite Ruscha's high  profile, he remains something of a mystery. Like Jasper Johns (whose work  Ruscha's resembles in several significant ways), Ruscha has always kept his own  private agenda out of his work and it's impossible to gauge his ideology or  personal travails from his cryptic visual wordplay. It's safe to conclude,  however, that he has a rather black sense of humor. In a 1978 print titled  "I've Never Seen Two People Looking Healthier," for instance, we find two  minuscule human figures dwarfed by a vast landscape; they look crushed,  insignificant and not remotely healthy.  </P> <P> In seeing 28 years of Ruscha's work marching down the wall in chronological  order, one also observes this artist to be evolving in a rather unorthodox  fashion. Typically, artists get the heavy Sturm und Drang out of the way during  early and mid career, and then go lyrical. Now in his early 50s, Ruscha seems  to be growing increasingly bleak and stormy with the years. The bright Popsicle  colors of his early work have disappeared, and we now find him working in a  dark, chiaroscuro style, doing haunted portraits of howling coyotes and lonely  suburban houses, and giving his work titles like "Yesterday's Treasures" and  "Time Is Up." His work has always had an edge, but the edge seems to be getting  sharper as of late. At 2036 Broadway, Santa Monica, through Saturday.  </P> <P> From Pop to Pound: Pioneering Appropriationist Richard Pettibone spent the '60s  turning out miniature replicas of Pop masterworks, and he still resorts to  brazen borrowing as his chief mode of art making. But, where he once recycled  the work of his contemporaries with a cynical sneer, he now regards his primary  sources with deep respect.  </P> <P> In fact, Pettibone's new body of work on view at the Michael Kohn Gallery, is  essentially a mash note to Romanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi, the  furniture-making traditions of the Shaker community, and the great irascible  crank of American letters, Ezra Pound. At a glance this might seem an  ill-matched trio, but Pettibone succeeds in synthesizing them into a cohesive  whole by underscoring the fact that they share a common approach to the notion  of transcendence; the qualities of rigor, devotion and simplicity are  characteristic of each of them.  </P> <P> Fashioning lovingly crafted psuedo-Shaker end tables that are either inscribed  with passages by Pound or treated as pedestals for miniature replicas of  Brancusi sculptures, Pettibone might appear to have wandered far afield from  his earlier work with these pieces -- which he describes as metaphors for  religious beliefs. In fact, the work makes perfect sense. Pettibone's work has  always questioned the importance of originality, and similarly, the Shaker  tradition views art as an act of service and selflessness rather than a vehicle  for the assertion of one's own personality. (Having spent the past 21 years  living in the New York countryside alongside various Shaker enclaves, Pettibone  is well acquainted with Shaker philosophy and has amassed a collection of  Shaker pieces, one of which -- a chair -- is included in this show).  </P> <P> Brancusi was revered for his ability to reduce natural forms to a simple  symphony of volumes and planes, and Pound, of course, was a notoriously arcane  and ambitious intellect who spent his life in furious pursuit of the sublime.  Pettibone quotes from Pound's "Cantos," the epic poem that occupied him  throughout his life, as well as from Pound's controversial translation of the  writings of Confucius. Pound showed a slight lapse of judgment during World War  II when he came out in support of the Fascists -- a faux pas that earned him  several years in a mental hospital. Nonetheless, the extremity of some of his  ideas and his willingness to scream them to the heavens have made him an  inspirational, if increasingly obscure figure to romantic souls everywhere.  It's a pleasant surprise to encounter him in an art gallery, and Pettibone does  a masterful job of interweaving the brilliance of Pound with the beauty of  Brancusi and the Shaker tradition. The cumulative effect of this show is  comparable to Rilke's "Letters to a Young Poet"; it's like a profound and  encouraging pep talk. At 920 Colorado, through May 14.  </P> <P> Imitation of Life: New York artist Dennis Levinthal, whose work is on view at  the Pence Gallery, is one of the current crop of artists smitten with the body  of thought popularized by French theoretician Jean Baudrillard. Mass media have  infiltrated our collective psyche to its very core, goes the battle cry of this  ideological revolution. Movies, history, fact, fiction and our private dreams  have merged to form a rancid puddle of second-hand experience. The mythologies  that once gave meaning to human experience have been enlisted as sales tools  and debased, and Joseph Campbell isn't around anymore to direct us to a new set  of fables. Yes, the water is indeed rising at an alarming rate as the media --  voracious beasts that feed on our dreams -- grow increasingly sophisticated.  </P> <P> Levinthal expresses his distress about this state of affairs in  computer-generated photographs of plastic toys (it makes an odd kind of sense,  using patently fake materials to explore issues of authenticity). Previous  series found Levinthal exploring World War II, and the West; this time out he  tackles eros and the American woman in a series titled "American Beauties."  Little plastic dolls with Betty Grable bodies (some in bathing suits, some  nude), Levinthal's beauties pose on patches of sand washed in eerie lighting --  the sky is black over this imaginary beach and these gals appear to be  sunbathing on the moon. The dolls are anonymous and interchangeable and  Levinthal's treatment -- the lighting, the photographic quality he achieves,  etc. -- serve to embalm the myth under examination here. Drained of texture and  dimension, reduced to a cheap bit of plastic, the fantasy of the American  beauty is laid to rest. Admirably skillful though Levinthal is -- he makes his  point quite effectively -- he doesn't leave the viewer feeling particularly  happy.  </P> <P> Also on view are sculptures by James Ford. Gleaming with sci-fi grandeur, the  works pulsate with the cruel power of instruments of torture. They feel creepy  -- as well they should, as they take as their central theme the making and  administration of medication. Hard hit by AIDS, the art world is increasingly  turning to the themes of human mortality and the failure of science, and Ford  asserts these concerns in the forms he favors -- basins, flasks, globes,  blades, beakers and needles. He then doubles back and disguises his theme in  his use of sensual materials -- rusted steel, buffed ebony, polished copper and  aluminum. An attractively subtle artist, Ford is overt in just one piece; "Big  Needle," a menacing spear with its tip poised against a mirror, is an  exquisitely clear metaphor for the rituals of illness. At 908 Colorado Ave.,  through May 19.  </P></p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Japanese Bonds: Yields fall on hopes of a reduction in discount rate HOPES of an imminent cut in the official discount rate buoyed Japanese government bonds last week, pushing yields down to their lowest levels for nearly five years. Worries over sluggish money supply and weak share prices prompted the expectation of a credit easing by the Bank of Japan. The yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark bond fell to 4.335 per cent last Friday, its lowest since April 1988. At the short end, the return on three-month certificates of deposit declined to 3.7 per cent, matching the low of last December. Low bank lending has been one of the leading factors behind the contraction in money supply. Last month, the money supply fell by 0.5 per cent from the previous year, posting its fourth consecutive monthly decline. The Tokyo stock market, suffering from low trading volume, remains vulnerable to even light selling. The leading Nikkei index closed below the psychological resistance line of 16,500 last Friday, helping to harden speculation of a February crash ahead of the March year-end book closing by Japanese companies. The weakness triggered renewed anticipation for monetary easing in support for share prices. Meanwhile, the weakness of the Tokyo stock market has led to a shift in funds by institutional investors into the fixed income market. The bond market received a lift in sentiment through the Ministry of Finance's Y100bn purchase of 10 and 20-year bonds at the beginning of last week. The move was the first outright bond purchase operated directly on the secondary market, as until now, the government has bought bonds through private placements. Bond market participants expect the operation to bolster Japan's faltering money supply, while lowering market rates and subsequently bank lending rates. The decision was seen as an attempt by the ministry to increase the circulation of funds at a time when a sharp rise in postal savings is becoming a controversy among policy makers. Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said: 'The Ministry of Finance is trying to recycle postal funds into the financial system.' The finance ministry plans a Y100bn purchase of government bonds every month. 'The Ministry of Finance has become a large institutional buyer which can be counted on to support the bond market,' said Mr Eric Miller, bond trader at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. While the monthly purchase may support sentiment, oversupply in the bond market is expected to dampen the current rally. An increasing number of Japanese companies, facing redemptions of equity-linked bonds, are expected to tap the corporate straight bond market for funds this year. An income tax cut to lift the economy, which could be implemented this summer will push up the supply of debt. Economists expect the cut to be as large as Y5,000bn-Y6,000bn. To finance tax cuts on this scale, the government will need to issue some Y2,000bn to Y3,000bn in deficit bonds, which will mean extra supply. The Ministry of Finance remains opposed to the issue of deficit bonds, but the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and leading business organisations, including the Keidanren, have built a consensus in favour of deficit spending. Ms Tomoko Fujii, economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, expects the rally to last for three to four months, with the yield falling on the bench market to 4.1 per cent. However, a rise in government borrowing plus the demand for funds by Japanese companies, are likely to push up bond yields thus steepening the yield curve.</p>

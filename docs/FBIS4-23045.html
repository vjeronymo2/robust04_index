Simakov [deceased];  UDC678.724.32:678.046.32:536.6]    [Abstract] During pressure casting of filled polymeric  compositions at high temperatures and mechanical stress,  physical chemical processes may take place which could alter the  properties of the end product. The degree of change to the end  product is directly proportional to the intensity of the above  processes. In order to obtain filled materials having optimum  characteristics, such as anti-friction, for example, it is  necessary to determine the amount of filler needed to provide  the given properties to the material, taking to account the  mutual effects of the system components during handling. In the  present work a study was made of the effects of molybdenum  sulfide content on the characteristics of polyarylate DV  compositions (copolymer of diphenylolpropane and a mixture of  iso- and terephthalic acids in the ratio 1:0.5:0.5). It was  demonstrated that the thermal properties of pressure cast  samples of polyarylate DV filled with MoS[.sub]2[/] vary with  the filler content. Materials containing 15 percent  MoS[.sub]2[/] have optimum properties as manifested in higher  heat resistance of the ester bond in the polymer owing to the  formation of a coordination bond between the carbonyl group and  the MoS[.sub]2[/], and an increase in the thermo-oxidative  stability of the filler. Increasing the MoS[.sub]2[/] content  to 25 percent or more activates the decomposition of the  isopropylydine groups, making it possible to form grafted  branched polymer structures.

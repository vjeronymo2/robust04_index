			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown calls for 'dialogue' on reforms MR PADDY Ashdown last night called for a 'constructive dialogue' on constitutional change between the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties to counter the electorate's growing disenchantment with politics and politicians. But the Liberal Democrat leader warned that 'half-hearted' Labour support for radical reform of Britain's outdated political system could bring a repeat of the damaging uncertainty which helped the Conservatives win last year's general election. In a speech to Charter 88, the independent pressure group, Mr Ashdown floated two other ideas - consultative referenda for important issues and the inclusion in government of talented individuals from outside parliament  -to strengthen public involvement in decision-making. Mr Ashdown warned that disillusionment among voters with the government had widened into a general distrust of politicians of all parties. He said Britain faced not only a crisis of government and of leadership but also a 'crisis of democracy' resulting from the failure of its political institutions to maintain the respect and confidence of its citizens. Mr Ashdown, setting out his platform for constitutional reform, said that at the core of the crisis was a system which centralised power in Whitehall and treated citizens as passive 'subjects' rather than active participants in political life. The Liberal Democrat leader, promoting the case for reform of the voting system, a written constitution and bill of rights, and devolution of power to regional and local government, said other ways were also needed to 'bridge the gap that is opening up between government and governed'. Mr Ashdown welcomed the commitment to constitutional change offered by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. He set his own speech last night in the context of a contribution to a 'continuing constructive dialogue between our two parties and others on constitutional matters'. He said a cross-party consensus offered the only route to the overhaul a 19th century model which had 'hit the limits of its own utility'. But if Labour were going to advocate change they 'must start to behave as if they are committed to change'.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: US stake in BP tops 20% STRUGGLING oil major British Petroleum saw keen interest from US investors. That interest has taken the US stake above 20 per cent for the first time according to the latest available figures. Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, quoting BP sources, said yesterday that the number of shares held in the form of American Depositary Receipts had hit 20.5 per cent, compared with only 7.5 per cent a year ago. Both figures include a 3.74 per cent stake which is part of the Kuwait Investment Office holding in the company. Strauss's Mr John Toalster, generally regarded as the superbear on the stock, said yesterday; 'US investors continue to regard the company as attractive against the US oil majors whereas compared to Shell it is expensive. UK institutions are further underweight.' The two-way view on the stock was in evidence for most of the day and despite the heaviest closing turnover of the day - 16 million shares - BP rose only 1 1/2 to 219p. Shell Transport also firmed 1 1/2 to 524 1/2 p. Generators weak The UK generators were under pressure after the electricity regulator Offer published a document criticising their pricing. There was also a response to worries of a national coal strike. PowerGen, which came in for the stronger criticism, fell 6 to 280p and National Power lost 4 to 269p. Analysts said the market was particularly concerned by what it took to be a threat that the duopoly could be broken up. The threat was contained in the final sentence of the report which said Offer was considering the 'pattern of ownership'. However, Mr Kevin Lapwood of Nomura argued that this had been misinterpreted and merely referred to the geographical imbalance of the industry. Most power stations are in the North of England. The prospects of a coal strike as a result of pit closure announcements would not directly hurt the generators as there are massive coal stock piles. However, it would suck them in to a political storm. Insurance switch Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest insurance group measured by market capitalisation, came under persistent pressure after Robert Fleming Securities told clients to switch out of Prudential and into Legal &amp; General, the third biggest of the UK's life companies. There were also market stories that stockbroker Credit Lyonnais Laing had cut its profits estimates for Prudential. Prudential shares retreated to 261p before stabilising with the market and closing 2 better at 269 on turnover of 2m shares. Legal &amp; General advanced 17 to 364p. Flemings insurance team said the life sector was too high and Prudential, which has approached its actual and relative all-time high, should be switched into Legal for a 'massive yield pick up.' News that Abbey National was cutting its mortgage rate may have helped the market, but it left the bank's shares unchanged at 315p. Speculation of an imminent sale for its merchant bank arm helped Royal Bank of Scotland improve 8 to 161p. Some analysts suggested that a European consortium headed by German bank BHF was poised to launch an offer. However, others argued that the shares were merely responding to recent falls. Early hopes that perennial bid target TSB might attract an offer evaporated on closer scrutiny and the shares closed only 2 better at 137 1/2 p. The big water companies were under pressure in response to growing worries of a head-to-head confrontation with the official regulator Ofwat, highlighted by a Nomura sell recommendation. North West Water lost 3 to 442p, Thames fell 4 to 438p and Anglian dropped 3 to 420p. British Gas, which is prompting diverging views, closed 4 up at 256 1/2 p. Three leading securities houses were said to be recommending the stock and a fourth, Smith New Court, published a sell note yesterday. Smith believes the 'earnings growth picture is extremely uncertain due to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation'. Recent Footsie 100 entrant Burmah recovered recent losses and gained 15 to 648p as a squeeze on the stock was helped by tenuous bid speculation and a buy recommendation from agency broker James Capel following a visit to the company. Grand Metropolitan bounced 6 to 376p, and Guinness was reported a good market, the shares moving 15 ahead to 541p, in trade of 3.4m shares. Argyll Group and J. Sainsbury moved strongly ahead after BZW reiterated its buy recommendation on the stocks on the basis of an increase in food inflation driven by sterling's effective devaluation. The former gained 14 to 364p, while the latter jumped 17 to 487p, after trade of 2.1m shares. Securities house Nomura, however, took a contrary view on Sainsbury and advised investors to switch out of it and into Tesco, which added 10 to 242p. Mr Andy Hughes at Nomura believes there is more upside in Tesco given the big rating differential. Asda Group closed unchanged at 39p, with bid speculation once again doing the rounds. Turnover reached 9.8m, with the equivalent of over another 3m shares dealt in the traded options. Body Shop had a volatile session. The shares fell 7 in early trading after the cosmetics retailer revealed a fall in interim profits from Pounds 9.15m to Pounds 8.26m. Then, a lunchtime meeting with institutions steadied nerves and the shares recovered to end 2 up at 163p. A big report from SG Warburg on the hotels and leisure sector re-emphasising the broker's caution on the sector cast a shadow over it. Forte shed 4 to 153p. Ladbroke was also affected though more serious damage was done by reports that Smith New Court had taken on a line of stock in the group. The shares fell 9 to 154p on turnover of 5.1m. News of an increased number of visitors to Euro - Disney, sent the shares sharply ahead. The company announced that visitors had topped the 7m mark and beat its September forecast. The shares jumped 50 to 860p, in thin trade. Analysts however remained sceptical, pointing out the rise in the figures coincided with the end of the school holidays. Wellcome was sharply lower at the start of trading on concerns that a drug being developed by Glaxo could affect Wellcome's Retrovir. There was also disappointment that the US holding in the company had fallen to 6.8 per cent from a 8.7 per cent stake at the time of its share offer in July. The shares were off 20 at their worst, but some analysts argued that Retrovir would always be the main component in any AIDS treatment and the shares recovered to close 7 lower at 956p. Glaxo jumped 15 to 791p. A meeting in New York to publicise its two new electronic dealing systems helped Reuters Holdings improve 18 to 1282p. Dealers said awareness of Carlton Communications, the group which is to take over the London TV franchise from Thames, continues to grow. Carlton shares lifted 15 to 683p. Mirror Group Newspapers fell 2 to 63p as investors took profits after the publisher unveiled first half-results. Speculation that GKN would soon win an order from Kuwait for its Warrior armoured personnel carriers lifted the shares 13 to 373p.

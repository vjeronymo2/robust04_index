			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Politics is driving force for Milan, Madrid A strong opening on Wall Street provided a cue for a positive direction among many of the continent's markets. MILAN extended its rally, picking up 1.4 per cent, on renewed hopes of a swift end to the country's political crisis. The Comit index rose 8.68 to 637.68, approaching the 640 level which some analysts see as a resistance point, as the market began to discount the formation of a broader coalition, including the centrist Popular Party. Ferruzzi rose L83 or 6.9 per cent to L1,280 with its strength attributed to window dressing by stockholding banks which have had to book losses on loans to the former parent company, Serafino, together with hopes Ferfin may soon sell Fondiaria. Olivetti gained L45 to L2,085 after the computer group said that it had agreed to sell its 53.9 per cent stake in the news and financial information group, Radiocor Telerate, to the Il Sole 24 Ore group. MADRID was dragged down to a low for the year by continuing political fears following high court investigations into the role of former leading security chiefs in illicit anti-ETA activity in the early 1980's. The general index lost 8.26 or 2.8 per cent to 284.62 amid worries that the rumour laden atmosphere would deter foreign investors. The market was led lower by sharp falls for Telefonica, Pta75 or 4.8 per cent lower at Pta1,490, Argentaria, Pta310 or 6.3 per cent down at Pta4,620 and Santander which lost Pta260 or 4.9 per cent to Pta5,060. ZURICH was firmer in thin volume with some of the gains attributed to window-dressing ahead of the end of the year, and banks in particular said to be buying their own shares. The SMI index gained 22.5 to 2,673.5. Zurich Insurance bearers picked up SFr1 to SFr1,261 but the registered shares were SFr1 lower at SFr1,266 as the market found difficulty in assessing the impact of the cooperation deal with Sweden's Trygg-Hansa. The deal opens the way for Zurich to take over part of the insurance business of Trygg's 64 per cent-owned US affilate, Home Holdings. Holderbank bounced SFr27 to SFr1,030 on a reassessment of Friday's 3.7 per cent fall which followed concerns about the company's exposure in Mexico, and a downgrading from UBS. STOCKHOLM featured a 3.8 per cent jump in Trygg-Hansa in otherwise thin holiday trade with lower debt yields and the early rally on Wall Street contributing to a firm tone. The Affarsvarlden index rose 2.90 to 1,474.00. Trygg-Hansa B shares finished SKr3 higher at SKr81 following the announcement that it had cancelled an agreement with US investors to bale out its troubled Home Holdings subsidiary in favour of a new, in-principle agreement with Zurich Insurance. Partly as a result of Trygg, the day's winning sector was banking and insurance whose sub-index rose by 0.6 per cent. Volvo's B share rose SKr1.50 to SKr139, extending a pre-Christmas rally, amid rumours that the automotive group would sell its wholly-owned subsidiary, Branded Consumer Products, before the end of the year. FRANKFURT moved upward, the Dax index adding 12.14 to 2,106.15 in the floor session, then rising to 2,110.77 in the Ibis. Daimler rose DM8.50 to DM772.50 as its Mercedes unit said that it expected to see a return to profit in 1994. Worldwide sales were expected to show an increase of about 9 per cent to some DM70bn. Kaufhof, up DM1.50 at DM772.50, announced that it had asked the Federal Cartel office to approve the merger of its ITS travel unit with Hanover-based Touristik Union International. PARIS did not find comfort from the gains on Wall Street, with investors instead choosing to take profits at the start of the new account. The CAC-40 index lost 10.59 to 1,955.98 in low volume. Among the day's movers Eurotunnel saw interest, losing 60 centimes to FFr23.90, with EuroDisney firmed 20 centimes to FFr11.35. AMSTERDAM edged higher, with the AEX index adding 3.56 to 417.96. Ahold, up Fl 1.00 at Fl 61.20, confirmed that the food retailing group expected investments in 1995 to exceed the Fl 1bn level seen in 1994. ABN Amro topped the most actives list gaining 80 cents to Fl 61.20. BolsWessanen, up 30 cents at Fl 33.40, said that it was combining its frozen snacks companies under a single name.

He also stated the need to set up without delay an  international space company involving foreign capital "for the  sake of saving" the cosmodrome and to open it for the  implementation of very diverse international commercial projects.    "If this option is not adopted, Kazakhstan is prepared to  consider the question of leasing the Baykonur Cosmodrome and the  city of Leninsk to Russia on condition that Russia takes over  all the costs," G. Abilsiitov said. In that case Kazakhstan  will require reimbursing for the expenditure on Baykonur over  the past 2.5 years, the minister said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The official spokesman of the government peace  delegation to Nairobi, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj, has said that the  current peace talks in Nairobi opened amid encouraging signs,  since all the negotiating parties are represented by high-level  delegations. He said the presence of John Garang and Riak  Machar would give impetus to the negotiations.    Speaking during an interview with Kenyan television, Dr.  al-Hajj said the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and  Development [IGADD] initiative was unique, since it included  African countries adjacent to Sudan, whose problems were  identical to Sudan's problems. He said the similarity would  help in resolving the southern problem.    Meanwhile, in a telephone call from Nairobi, the official  spokesman of the government peace delegation, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj,  said some negative developments had occurred during the 24 hours  following the official inauguration of the peace talks. He said  so-called opposition elements had sent representatives to  Nairobi with the aim of aborting the peace talks. Dr. 'Ali  al-Hajj said the government delegation had warned the IGADD  group about the aims of the opposition group. He said the  Kenyan side had been notified that peace was not a priority for  the opposition, whose main aim was to topple the government in  Khartoum, using the southerners as tools to do so. Dr. 'Ali  al-Hajj said the elements who arrived in Nairobi were the same  people who had attended the Washington Symposium and the London  Forum under Baroness Cox.    He said the southern problem should not be mixed with the  toppling of the government, and stated that the southern problem  should come first. Dr. al-Hajj further urged all parties to  give a chance to the IGADD countries to play their role,  especially after the emergence of positive signs, with the rebel  leaders attending the talks for the first time.    [Omdurman Republic of Sudan Radio Network in Arabic at 0430  GMT on 20 March adds: "His excellency appealed to the Kenyan  Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the  current peace efforts did not fail and that the solution should  be purely an African one. His excellency said that the members  of the alliance who had arrived in Nairobi were Mubarak al-Fadil  al-Mahdi, 'Abd al-Rahman Ahmad Sa'id and al-Harith Idris. Dr.  'Ali al-Hajj Hassan said the government delegation did not  object to their presence provided they did so as part of the  delegation of the rebel movement.    ["Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the entry of foreign quarters or of  a  foreign dimension had always been at the root of failure to  arrive at an agreement with the rebel movement. His excellency  appealed to John Garang to throw off foreign hegemony. He said  the purpose of his convening a press conference was to inform  the outside world of the facts of what was happening and to  confirm the eagerness of the government delegation that the  negotiations should succeed."]</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE STAYS HOME IN STOCKING ITS PROGRAM;  </P> <P> COLLEGE RECRUITING: EARLY SIGNING PERIOD BEGINS WITH COMMITMENTS FROM  CHATSWORTH VOLLEYBALL PLAYER AND SIMI VALLEY THIRD BASEMAN.  </P> <P> Placing a bit of the future in the hands of athletes with more potential than  renown, the Northridge athletic program welcomed two more recruits into the  fold on the first day of the NCAA early signing period.  </P> <P> Gene Urcan, a third-team All-City Section volleyball player for Chatsworth High  last season, and Tyler Nelson, an unheralded baseball player at Simi Valley  High, both accepted scholarship offers Wednesday, the first day high school  seniors can sign a letter of intent.  </P> <P> Urcan is a 6-foot-5, 200-pound middle blocker, and Nelson is a 6-2, 185-pound  third baseman. Urcan's specialty is blocking, Nelson's is hitting. But two  common threads led them to Northridge -- a chance to attend a school close to  home and a belief in the coach who recruited them.  </P> <P> "I've talked to a lot of coaches, but I like the way (CSUN Coach) John Price  runs his program. I just like the way he is," Urcan said. "That and it's a lot  better when you have your friends there watching you play. It's an added  confidence boost."  </P> <P> Urcan helped Chatsworth reach the City 4-A final last season but it was his  play for a local club team last summer that caught Price's attention.  </P> <P> "He's a good athlete who moves well. He has all the qualities of a big-time  player," Price said. "He's a great catch for us."  </P> <P> And yet another local one. Of the 16 players on the CSUN practice roster, 12  are from area schools -- including all six probable starters.  </P> <P> "Our goal all along was to get the top local guys and I think Gene should be  one of the best players out there this year," Price said.  </P> <P> Nelson, a right-handed hitter who batted .343 for Simi Valley last season, is  projected as a power hitter by CSUN Coach Bill Kernen.  </P> <P> "He can hit and I think he's going to develop some power for us," Kernen said.  </P> <P> Nelson will play third base for Simi Valley this spring, but he can also catch  and play first base.  </P> <P> Nelson joins pitcher-first baseman Scott Sharts and utility player Andy Hodgins  as Simi Valley High products on the Matador roster.  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jute mills scramble for supplies - India fears a shortage of high grade fibre The Indian jute mills that have in recent years taken up production of high value jute goods and export quality yarn in a big way have rushed to Bangladesh to cover their requirement of superior grades of raw jute for the current season. Even as India, the largest producer of jute and jute goods, harvests a much bigger crop than last year's the government and industry officials fear that there is going to be an acute shortage of the higher grades. According to the industry officials, Indian mills have so far signed contracts for the import of 300,000 bales (180kg each) from Bangladesh. This season's Indian imports from that country could reach 500,000 bales, compared with about 300,000 in 1993-94. 'We have, however, drawn a blank in Vietnam and China, which do not have any surplus of jute this year,' says an official at the Indian Jute Mills Association. 'Last year, we imported some fibre from Vietnam. Thailand is a net importer of jute.' Bangladesh is harvesting 5.5m bales of jute in the current year, up from 5.1m in 1993-94, and the quality of the crop has turned out to be highly satisfactory. As the country opened the season with stocks of 2.3m bales total fibre availability will be 7.8m bales. Indian industry official estimate that Bangladeshi mills will consume less than 3m bales, while the requirement at village level will be about 400,000 bales. So Bangladesh will have a plenty of exportable surplus. According to the Indian Jute Development Council, the Indian jute and mesta crops in 1994-95 will total 8.9m bales and not 9.5m, as the industry and the trade earlier thought. 'Because of the high premium that jute and mesta fetched over the minimum prices throughout the last season, the farmers committed 957,000 hectares to the crop this year, against 892,000 hectares in 1993-94, says an official at the Directorate of Jute Development. 'More land would have been brought under the crop had the weather been favourable during the sowing period.' Moreover, as some of the major jute growing centres like north Bengal and Bihar experienced drought when the crop was growing, the average is expected to decline to 1,860kg a hectare from 1,907kg in 1993-94. 'The late harvesting of jute in many areas and the shortage of water for retting (soaking) are responsible for the deterioration in the quality of the Indian crop,' according to the DJD official. The official estimate is that inferior grades' share in the total will rise from 11.5 to 20 per cent in 1993-94. 'Besides the shortage of superior grades of jute what is causing concern to the industry are the very high prices of fibre around this time of year when the mills build up stocks,' says the IJMA official. 'The mills should now be holding raw jute stocks equal to at least one and a half months' requirement. But their present fibre inventory can at the most sustain production for two weeks.' Though this is traditionally the peak marketing period for jute, the benchmark TD-4 grade is quoted at the unusually high price of Rs750 (Pounds 14.50) a quintal (100lb). Industry officials say the very low carryover into the current season and the 'alarmingly low daily arrival of the crop in the village markets' are responsible for the prevailing high prices. The farmers, according to the Jute Balers' Association, are selling jute in small lots as they expect prices to go up as the season progresses. It is principally due to the high prices in India that the jute market in Bangladesh is ruling firm, in spite of a bumper crop.</p>

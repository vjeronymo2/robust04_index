			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PARTY EXPELS FOE OF GORBACHEV FOR BUYING MERCEDES  </P> <P> A former Politburo member and political enemy of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  was expelled from the Communist Party for using his influence to buy a  Mercedes, Tass reported today.  </P> <P> The harsh action against die-hard conservative Yuri F. Solovyov came three days  before a critical meeting of the party Central Committee.  </P> <P> The expulsion was another humiliation for Solovyov, the former Leningrad party  chief who was defeated during the spring in the vote for Parliament despite  having no opposition. More than 50% of the voters crossed his lone name off the  ballot.  </P> <P> Solovyov was expelled at an emergency meeting of the Leningrad party committee  Thursday, the day after the sensational Leningrad TV program "600 Seconds"  broadcast a report showing his name on an auto registration list. Journalist  Alexander Nevzorov told viewers it had become easy to buy a Mercedes-Benz 280-S  for 9,780 rubles.  </P></p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong Bank to buy Midland: Deal would create world's largest transcontinental bank with Pounds 8bn market value HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank plans to take over Midland Bank in a deal to create the world's largest transcontinental bank and one of the top 15 in terms of assets. The two banks said in a formal statement issued early yesterday that they were planning to merge, but bankers said the deal would be in effect a takeover of Midland. Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, told his staff that 'although we were not seeking a partner, we received an approach from Hongkong Bank'. This approach was made after Midland announced its 1991 results on February 27. Midland was the biggest bank in the world in the early 1950s but now ranks only fourth by market value among English clearing banks, having incurred after-tax losses for the past two years. Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings which owns Hongkong Bank, is expected to be chairman of the combined operations. The takeover, which requires the approval of governments in the UK, Hong Kong and China and of bank regulators, would create a bank with a market value of about Pounds 8bn. Hongkong Bank is expected to offer one HSBC share for every share in Midland. The deal would involve the first takeover of an English clearing bank by an organisation which to all intents and purposes is not British, although its holding company is domiciled in the UK. Mr Purves said he had kept the Chinese government informed 'at a high level' of the plans and was hopeful that it would not object to the takeover. Hongkong Bank cannot ignore the Chinese view because it earns the bulk of its profits in the colony, which will revert to the control of the Chinese in 1997. The Bank of England, which said it had been kept in the picture about the plans, is understood to be unlikely to ciple. But it is setting two conditions. It wants to put a 'ring fence' round the Hong Kong operations, to prevent deposits at Midland from being used for loans in the colony. The Bank wants to make sure that Midland's depositors are not harmed in the event of an economic crisis in Hong Kong after China regains control. The Bank also wants to have the lead role for regulating the new international bank. Early today an HSBC official in Hong Kong said the Bank of England and the colony's banking commissioner, Mr David Carse, were discussing where the merged group would be regulated and where it would be based. Officials said yesterday they did not expect the UK government to attempt to block the deal. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokeswoman, said her prime concern was that the combined operation should be regulated properly. Bankers said a formal offer for Midland would probably be made in the next couple of weeks, after the two banks have had the opportunity to scrutinise each other's balance sheets and form a view of the respective value of the two organisations. Midland and Hongkong issued their statement of intent yesterday because they feared plans would leak. They said the offer would be at a 'significant premium' to the 253p price at which Midland's shares closed on Monday. Yesterday, Midland's share price rose 76p to 329p, valuing the bank at Pounds 2.58bn. In Hong Kong early today HBSC shares were down HKDollars 3.50 to HKDollars 41.75 as the stock market opened sharply lower on news of the merger plan. The Hang Seng index initially fell more than 2 per cent but was later trading around 1 per cent down. Yesterday Mr Pearse said that 'independence (for Midland) remains an option' but that 'the board considers the commercial case for joining forces to be a clear one'. But he stressed that in the UK, Midland would continue to trade under its own name. Mr Purves confirmed that 'Midland will continue to have its own board'. Mr Pearse also made it clear that the combined organisation would have a strong British identity. 'In concept (the takeover) would lead to the creation of a UK-based banking group with unparalleled global capabilities and regional banking strength in the UK/Europe, Asia Pacific and North America.' The implication, which will be controversial in Hong Kong, is that senior directors of HSBC will move to the UK. However, any transfer of Hongkong Bank's management is unlikely until next year, when Mr Purves is expected to resign from the chairmanship of his group's main banking subsidiary to devote his time to being chairman of HSBC. Hongkong Bank has for years wanted to acquire a European bank to reduce its dependence on its earnings from the colony. However, it stresses that it will retain a significant presence there. It acquired a 14.9 per cent stake in Midland in December 1987. At the time it expected that a full merger would take place after three years. However, the financial performance of both banks deteriorated sharply in 1990 and the merger plans were shelved. Our Asia staff writes: It is understood that the contact with China was possibly through Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao affairs in the Beijing government. These contacts emerged as authorities in the colony sought to play down suggestions that Hongkong Bank was insuring itself against the uncertainty surrounding the return of Hong Kong to China. China is sensitive to developments affecting the territory's financial health. There were fears in Hong Kong that the news could provoke a Chinese verbal onslaught if Beijing saw the merger as a desertion of the colony. But initial indications were that China would not seriously question the proposal.

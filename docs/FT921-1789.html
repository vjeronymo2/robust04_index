			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Brussels seeks deal on export of recyclable toxic waste EC environment ministers will today try to agree a framework for the export of recyclable toxic waste, amid intense pressure from MEPs and environmental lobbyists to adopt tough restrictions. Before the environment council begins, Mr Ken Collins, the British Labour MEP and chairman of the European parliament's influential environment committee, will put the MEPs' case directly to Mr Carlos Borrego, the Portuguese minister who will chair the meeting, and other ministers. The parliament is calling for a ban on all exports of hazardous waste from the EC from the year 2000. The Community has already banned the export of waste to 69 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific (ACP). The Commission also agrees to a total ban on the export of waste for final disposal. But it believes EC member states should be allowed to ship recyclable waste to countries which are members of the OECD and have ratified the Basle convention on waste shipments. The Commission said on Friday that political agreement was possible today, but national officials believe the measure may be too complex to agree in a single meeting. A meeting of technical experts is expected at the same time in an attempt to resolve the more detailed problems. Without the Commission's support, the parliament's powers to change the measure are limited, but MEPs could delay or disrupt the procedure when the directive is given a second reading. Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, warned last week of the dangers of 'toxic colonialism' if the EC made any move to allow waste shipments to third countries on the basis merely of bilateral agreements. Such an approach could lead to developing non-ACP countries accepting waste which they did not know how to recycle safely, said the group.</p>

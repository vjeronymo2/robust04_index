			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two parts by A.G. Noorani: "Why the </F> POK"--quotation marks as published]  <H5>  [11 Feb p 8] </H5> <H5>  [Part I] </H5>   [Text] On January 29, the JKLF [Jammu Kashmir Liberation  Front] leader, Mr. Amanullah Khan, tartly reminded the Prime  Minister of Pakistan, Mrs Benazir Bhutto, that Pakistan's  persistent rejection of "the third option" of independence for  Kashmir is "tantamount to denying them the very right of  self-determination," a right which, he asserted, cannot be  "limited, conditioned or circumscribed." But Pakistan's espousal  of the right to self-determination has ever been self-servingly  conditional and circumscribed. It is demanded of the part of  Kashmir which, mercifully, escaped its occupation, albeit, not  its repeated depredations. The right to self-determination is  not recognized for Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, miscalled "Azad"  (free) Kashmir. Pakistan has banned the cry of plebiscite or  independence in the POK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir].    The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974,  obliges all office-bearers from the President down and all  legislators to swear loyalty "to the cause of accession of the  State of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan." Islam is made the State  religion (Article 3). The President and the Prime Minister must  be Muslim.  <H5>  Plebiscite Plea </H5>   The fundamental right to freedom of association is  restricted  to forbid the cry of a free plebiscite. The POK bans political  parties which advocate independence, let alone accession to  India. Article 7(2) reads thus: "No person or political party in  Azad Jammu and Kashmir shall be permitted to propagate against,  or take part in activities prejudicial or detrimental to, the  ideology of the State's accession to Pakistan." In short, none  can ask for a plebiscite as such in the POK. They can ask only  for accession to Pakistan. Plebiscite is for the rest of the  State.    This Constitution was imposed on the POK by the former Prime  Minister, Mr. Z.A. Bhutto, after he had, in a speech at the POK  capital Muzaffarabad on November 7, 1973, asked the people "not  to aspire for an independent status" and offered them three  choices--the status quo, a full-fledged province of Pakistan, or  "provincial status"--as if the territory was Pakistan's to deal  with as it pleased rather than one temporarily in "its  occupation pending a solution to the Kashmir dispute. In  Pakistan's perception, it is the rest of the State which is  "disputed territory," not the part it has grabbed.    The POK's Constitution of 1974 was imposed on it. Its  preamble recites that the Government of Pakistan "approved" the  repeal of the 1970 Constitution "and authorized the  President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir to introduce" the  Constitution Bill "for consideration and passage." The document  rivets the POK to Pakistan's constitutional and political system.    The POK's legal status and Pakistan's conduct in respect of  it over the years are surely of crucial relevance in the quest  for solutions to the Kashmir question. But the POK has ever been  a dark and neglected area. Pakistan has adroitly focused  attention on the rest of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, which  it ardently covets. That fact should not deflect one from the  duty to subject the Government of India's actions to scrutiny  and criticism, especially the violation of human rights and  political freedom. But Pakistan's conduct in the POK should  receive the same treatment. It has not, however.    Pakistan resents such criticism. It resents intensely the  expression Pak-Occupied Kashmir and uses blithely its coinage  "Indian-Held Kashmir." If one were to take "the U.N.  resolutions" by which it swears as common ground, one would find  that while the legality of the accession of the State of Jammu  and Kashmir was consistently and explicitly accepted in those  resolutions, the expression "Pak-Occupied Kashmir" is derived  from those very documents.    They have a lineage in the proceedings of the Security  Council at an early stage. The United States Representative, Mr.  Warren Austin, said on February 4, 1948: "We must face the legal  situation. The external sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir is no  longer under the control of the Maharaja ... with the accession  of Jammu and Kashmir to India, this foreign sovereignty went  over to India and is exercised by India and that is how India  happens to be here as a petitioner."    On January 20, 1948, the Security Council set up a  three-member Commission. On April 21, 1948, the Council not only  expanded its membership to five but laid down the details of a  plebiscitory solution. A Plebiscite Administrator was to be  nominated by the U.N. Secretary-General. Para 10(b) said: "The  Plebiscite Administrator, acting as an officer of the State of  Jammu and Kashmir, should have authority to nominate his  assistants--and to draft regulations governing the plebiscite.  Such nominees should be formally appointed and such draft  regulations should be formally promulgated by the State of Jammu  and Kashmir."  <H5>  Recognition </H5>   This is an explicit recognition by the UN of: (a) the  legality of Kashmir's accession to India; (b) India's external  sovereignty over the State; and (c) the legal authority of the  Government of the State. Hence, the formal induction of the  Plebiscite Administrator by the State Government, although he  was to be nominated by the UN Secretary-General.    The UN Commission for India and Pakistan, acting under this  mandate, arrived in the subcontinent in July, 1948. At the  outset, on August 5, 1948, its members agreed that it should  avoid any action which might be interpreted as signifying de  facto or de jure recognition of the "Azad Kashmir Government."  On August 13, 1948, the UNCIP [UN Commission for India and  Pakistan] adopted a resolution embodying its proposals for a  settlement. India accepted it. Pakistan did not.    On December 11, 1948, the UNCIP offered proposals in  amplification of the first to provide for a plebiscite. Both  sides accepted it. They were formally embodied in its resolution  of January 5, 1949, the parties having declared a ceasefire on  New Year's Day. As Ms. Krishna Menon said in the Security  Council on February 8, 1957, "the only international engagements  that exist are two resolutions of the UNCIP dated August 13,  1948, and January 5, 1949. These are the engagements. If they  were of a formal character, they might be treaties..."  <H5>  Legal Status </H5>   The UNCIP had published in November, 1948, in its first  interim report, the minutes of its talks with both sides. They  were thus fully aware of the UNCIP's clarifications before they  accepted its second resolution. It is the August 13, 1948,  resolution which defined the legal status of the authorities in  the POK. It provided first for a ceasefire; next, a truce  agreement laying down details of troop withdrawals on both  sides; and finally determination of the future status of Kashmir  "in accordance with the will of the people." The word plebiscite  was not used. That was done in the second resolution.    While the tribesmen from Pakistan and Pakistan's troops were  to be withdrawn completely, India was to withdraw only "the bulk  of its forces," retaining some "to assist local authorities in  the observance of law and order." That was not the only  asymmetry. The existence of the Government of the State of Jammu  and Kashmir was explicitly recognized and so, indeed, was the  State's accession to India and assumption of "external  sovereignty." Accordingly, the resolution provided that "the  Government of India will undertake to ensure that the Government  of the State of Jammu and Kashmir" will safeguard law and order  "and that human and political rights will be respected."    For the other part of the State, the resolution said:  "Pending a final solution, the territory evacuated by the  Pakistani troops will be administered by the local authorities  under the surveillance of the Commission." This, the only  provision for that area, is in contrast to the clear recognition  of the State Government, acting under the Government of India in  respect of external relations. No surveillance was provided for  this part of the State.  <H5>  [12 Feb p 8] </H5> <H5>  [Part II] </H5>   [Text] The Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Sir Muhammad  Zafrullah Khan, had an important meeting with the UNCIP on  September 2, 1948. Its minutes have not been published. But  Sardar Mohammed Ibrahim Khan, the founder-President of the "Azad  Kashmir" Government, published in his informative book "The  Kashmir Saga" some revealing extracts. They show that Sir  Zafrullah was clearly told: "By `local authorities' we mean the  Azad Kashmir people though we cannot grant recognition to the  Azad Kashmir Government."    These authorities "will be responsible for the maintenance  of  law and order and security"--only. More explicitly, "we cannot  lose sight of the fact that the State of Jammu and Kashmir still  exists as a legal entity. We have to respect its  sovereignty." Sir Zafrullah himself had told the Commission  earlier that "even his own Government had not granted legal  recognition for the Azad `Government' in view of the  implications which might ensue."  <H5>  Puppet </H5>   Not long after, Pakistan recognized this puppet  "Government."  A new regime was imposed on the POK on June 21, 1952. Rules of  Business were prescribed on October 28, Rule 5 said: "The  President of Azad Kashmir Government shall hold office during  the pleasure of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference duly  recognized as such by the Government of Pakistan in the Ministry  of Kashmir Affairs." The Ministry's Joint Secretary could attend  meetings of the Council of Ministers and "tender advice on any  matter under discussion." What, one must ask, are the legal  "implications" of such a set-up in the POK, which has existed  for over four decades in flagrant breach of the UNCIP's  resolution?    On August 17, 1948, Prime Minister Nehru asked the UNCIP  about the import of the reference to "the local authorities" in  the POK. He was told, the minutes record, that "the phrase  pending a final solution was intended to recognize  the temporary nature of the administration by local authorities.  Sovereignty over the territory was not to be  changed." This clearly meant sovereignty of the State  Government over the POK. For, it was in answer to Nehru's  pointed query whether the UNCIP "envisaged any change in the  status of the territory or whether it recognized the  jurisdiction of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir over that  territory." Equally explicit assurances were given in subsequent  talks.    This brings us to the nomenclature which raises the hackles  of our Pakistani friends--the POK. The UNCIP resolution of  August 13, 1948, spoke of "the territory evacuated by the  Pakistani troops." Since the evacuation has not yet taken place,  is it unfair to call it Pak-Occupied Kashmir? Especially since  the UNCIP clarified to Sir Zafrullah on September 3, 1948, that  "the term evacuated territory refers to those  territories in the State of Jammu and Kashmir which are at  present under the effective control of the Pakistan High  Command."    This is the nub of the matter. The legal sovereignty of the  State of Jammu and Kashmir over "those territories" was  recognized. So, also, the de facto position that they were  "under the effective control" of the Pakistani Army. There is  not much to choose between PCK (Pak-Controlled Kashmir) and POK  (Pak-Occupied Kashmir).    There is, however, a graver aspect, besides. Nehru wrote to  the UNCIP on August 20, 1948, that its resolution of August 13,  "should not be interpreted, or applied in practice, so as: (a)  to bring into question the sovereignty of the Jammu and Kashmir  Government over the portion of their territory evacuated by  Pakistani troops; (b) to afford any recognition of the so-called  `Azad Kashmir Government'; or (c) to enable this territory to be  consolidated in any way during the period of truce to the  disadvantage of the State." On August 25, the UNCIP assured  Nehru that his interpretation "coincides with its own  interpretation."    These assurances were known to Pakistan when it accepted  "the  plebiscite resolution" of January 5, 1949. It provided that the  Plebiscite Administrator "will be formally appointed to office  by the Government of Jammu and Kashmir." He "shall derive from  the State of Jammu and Kashmir" the requisite powers and shall  report the result of the plebiscite not only to the UNCIP but  also "to the Government of Jammu and Kashmir."    In this, the UNCIP acted with perfect legal propriety. The  legality of the State's accession to India was incontestable.  That did not preclude a plebiscite, however. But among the prime  causes which have rendered a plebiscite impossible is, surely,  Pakistan's annexation of the POK and its policies towards the  rest of the State. The war of 1965, for instance. It sought to  grab it at its chosen forum, the battlefield, and failed.  <H5>  Aggression </H5>   It seeks the same result today by a low-cost, covert  operation. The POK has served as a launching pad for this  aggression. It is firmly riveted to Pakistan's control through  the Azad J &amp; K Council, set up by S. 21 of the Act of 1974.  It  is presided over by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and comprises  his five nominees, the President and Prime Minister of the POK  and six representatives of the POK Assembly, elected by  proportional representation.    Political developments faithfully mirror those in  Pakistan--Basic Democracy of Ayub Khan, Zia's Martial Law, and  the rest. In December, 1993, the blasphemy laws of Pakistan were  extended to the POK. The northern areas of the State have been  dismembered from the POK and their status as part of the State  questioned, inviting a stinging rebuff from the POK's High Court  on March 8, 1993. They are ruled directly through a Chief  Executive, Lt-Gen. Mohammad Shafiq, appointed by Islamabad, with  a 26-member Northern Areas Council. The people have never seen  elections or enjoyed political or human rights.    The POK is better only in form. In 1990 the Pakistan  People's  Party came to power. In 1991, after Mrs Bhutto's dismissal,  elections were held again which all outside the ruling party in  Islamabad called "foul." The POK's Premier, Mr. M.H. Rathore,  rejected the results and announced a fresh poll. On July 5,  1991, he was sacked by Islamabad, arrested after a Federal  Minister and a Brigadier in the Army had inveigled him out of  his residence on the pretext that the Army Chief wished to meet  him. He was flown to Islamabad, put in a guest house, and beaten  up.  <H5>  Self-Interest </H5>   Let us go back to the basics. Why did Pakistan's troops  enter  Kashmir at all "early in May, 1948?" Purely in self-interest.  The information was given belatedly to the UNCIP on July 8,  1948--not to the Security Council at all. A memo by Pakistan to  the UNCIP on August 19, 1948, set out the reasons candidly. It  was a perceived "threat to Pakistan's security" posed by Indian  military operations against the tribesmen. "It was this which  compelled the Government of Pakistan to move their troops into  certain defensive positions." There they remain stay put to this  day, occupying areas of the State in breach of the UNCIP's  resolutions and of Pakistan's own assurances to it. In contrast  to the Government in Srinagar, the regime in Muzaffarabad is one  set up by Pakistan in territory it has occupied, not acquired by  law.    None of this minimizes the need to resolve the vexed problem  of Kashmir "in accordance with the will of the people," as the  1948 resolution put it. But the contours of a solution in 1994  will necessarily be different from those that were envisaged in  1948-49 given Pakistan's concept of selective  self-determination. Neither plebiscite nor independence can now  be contemplated. It is not beyond the wit of man to devise a  solution which satisfies the aspirations of the people within  the Indian Union, redresses the grave wrongs they have suffered,  and also provides for the legitimate interests of Pakistan and  of the POK.  *</p>

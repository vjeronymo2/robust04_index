			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analyis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Gorayeb Seminars, Inc. (hereinafter ``GSI''), Gorayeb Learning Systems, Inc. (hereinafter ``GLS'') and their President, Ronald B. Gorayeb, marketers of The Gorayeb Method seminar, a single, two-hour, group hypnosis session program for smoking cessation and weight loss. The Gorayeb Method seminar is offered to the public nationwide by Ronald B. Gorayeb at hotel locales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for the reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's complaint charges that the proposed respondents deceptively advertised: (1) The likelihood of seminar participants' success in achieving and maintaining abstinence from smoking cigarettes and weight loss; and (2) the effectiveness of proposed respondents' weight-loss programs in leading consumers to achieve and maintain weight loss compared to other weight-loss methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Success  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The complaint against GSI, GLS and Ronald B. Gorayeb alleges that the proposed respondents failed to possess a reasonable basis for claims they made regarding the success of their seminar participants in quitting smoking and achieving and maintaining weight loss. Through advertisements placed in various media in advance of their seminars, proposed respondents represented that seminar participants: (1) Are cured of smoking addiction and permanently abstain from smoking cigarettes; (2) are cured of smoking addiction without experiencing withdrawal, anxiety or weight gain; and (3) achieve and maintain weight loss. Proposed respondents further represented that thousands of consumers have permanently quit smoking and thousands have achieved and maintained weight loss as a result of attending The Gorayeb Method seminars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that these success claims for seminar attendees' smoking cessation, weight loss and maintenance of achieved weight loss are deceptive because proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation for those claims at the time they made the claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order seeks to address the alleged success misrepresentations cited in the accompanying complaint in three ways. First, the order (Part I.B.) requires proposed respondents to possess a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any claim about the performance or efficacy of any smoking cessation or weight loss program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the proposed order (Part I.A.) prohibits proposed respondents from representing that seminar participants are cured of smoking addiction without experiencing side effects, such as withdrawal, anxiety or weight gain, unless the claim is substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the proposed order (Part I.C.) generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the performance or efficacy of any smoking cessation or weight loss program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Efficacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's complaint further alleges that proposed respondents failed to possess a reasonable basis for a claim they made regarding the relative ability of their hypnosis program to lead consumers to achieve and maintain weight loss. GSI, GLS and Ronald B. Gorayeb represented through their advertising that their single-session, group hypnosis seminar is more efficacious for weight loss and weight-loss maintenance than other weight-loss methods. The Commission believes that this comparative efficacy claim for proposed respondents' hypnosis program is deceptive because proposed respondents at the time they made the claim did not possess adequate substantiation for the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address this efficacy misrepresentation, the proposed order (Part I.B.) requires proposed respondents to possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any representation about the relative (or absolute) performance or efficacy of any weight loss program (or smoking cessation program), before they make such a claim. The proposed order (Part I.C.) further generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the performance or efficacy of any weight loss program (or smoking cessation program).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order, or to modify in any way their terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Benjamin I.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the Democratic Association `Ukrayina' </F> Regrading the Deployment of Russian Cossack Formations in the  Crimea"; place and date not given]    [Text] Having opted for independence, the Ukrainian people  have right away encountered a whole series of complex problems  on the road to establishing the statehood. Against the general  background of economic crises, the slow advancement of reforms,  and the flourishing corruption and crime -- features that are  more or less typical of all newly created states on the  territory of the former USSR, Ukraine stood out as an island of  stability and peace. This Ukrainian reserve and solid stability  did not suit certain political forces outside Ukraine, in  particular (and mainly) in Russia.    Our northern neighbor does not want to content himself with  the preliminary results of putting pressure upon Ukraine -- the  constant inflating of the Crimean issue and the creation and  exacerbation of the "Crimean problem." With the criminal  experience gained in Karabakh, Abkhazia, and the Dniester  Region, Russia is deliberately exercising it on the territory of  Ukraine. Let us recall: From the very beginning of the war in  the Dniester Region, Russian Cossacks were actively deployed  there. Two years ago, during an exacerbation of the Black Sea  Fleet problem, aliens with whips already marched through the  streets of our Crimean towns. At that time, war could be  avoided. However, since that time, training courses and marches  of Russian Cossacks in the south and east of our country have  been repeatedly held and formations have been created that  adhere to the laws of the Russian Federation and protect its  interests. A few days ago, paramilitary formations of the  foreign state impertinently held their conference -- the  so-called "great circle" -- on our territory; they guard the  Crimean antistate and anti-Ukrainian parliament, and they make  trouble and rape women. We demand that Ukrainian citizens be  protected from corrupt and armed aliens.    We stress that the formation, development, actions, and  financing of the Russian cossackdom are under the immediate  protection of the Russian Government. That is why we consider  the Cossacks' arrival on our territory as Russia's interference  in Ukraine's internal affairs. Particularly, since Ukrainian  laws forbid the existence and stay of paramilitary public  formations on our territory.    We demand the following:    1) From Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs; to  immediately submit a note of protest to the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs in connection with the deployment of Russian  Cossacks in the Crimea and Russia's active interference in  Ukraine's internal affairs;    2) From the Ministry of Internal Affairs; to expel Russian  Cossacks from Ukraine and to put criminals from their formations  on trial in accordance with the Ukrainian legislation;    3) From the State Committee for Borders; an urgent  toughening of control over the situation at the border and the  introduction of visas for entering Ukraine in order to put an  end to the influx of criminals and to prevent the import of  narcotics and weapons.    The passivity of power structures in the given question will  be regarded by the "Ukrayina" Democratic Association as an  encouragement of anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces and as  the involvement of Ukraine's governmental circles in stirring up  separatism in the state.    The statement was adopted at the conference of  plenipotentiary representatives of the Democratic Association  "Ukrayina."</p>

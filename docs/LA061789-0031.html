			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DOWNHILL RACER;  </P> <P> FORMER SAUGUS FAVORITE DAN PRESS DESCENDS FROM HIS REMOTE MOUNTAINTOP HOME FOR  A RETURN ENGAGEMENT AS THE SOUTHWEST TOUR LEADER  </P> <P> Far away in the dry mountains of Los Padres National Forest, in the small rural  town of Lebec, at the end of a long, crudely paved road atop a hill overlooking  a truck stop with a towering red sign succinctly titled "EAT," Dan Press labors  like a blacksmith.  </P> <P> Wearing a T-shirt and a good bit of grime on his tattooed arms, Press  supervises both the maintenance of his race car, a 1989 IROC Camaro, and his  business, Dan Press Development and Machining.  </P> <P> It is a warm afternoon, however, and the boss needs little coaxing to take a  break.  </P> <P> "We don't get many visitors up here," Press says as he extends a hand.  </P> <P> Seventeen miles farther into the forest, "straight back as the crow flies,"  Press says, lies his home of the past three years. He doesn't see many new  faces up there, either.  </P> <P> The immaculate state-of-the-art workshop, which produces various metal items,  including aerospace parts, is a cross between General Motors and Sam Drucker's  General Store. A wooden facade in the Wild West style gives the mini-mall-sized  building the look of Main Street in Dodge City.  </P> <P> Six dogs wander lazily, searching for shade in the small freshly paved parking  lot. Walking through a door usually involves stepping over a sleeping Labrador  retriever.  </P> <P> "We've got a real kennel going here," Press says, ducking into his tiny office.  The boss settles into the comfortable chair behind his desk, flicks his lighter  and prepares to sit for a spell while savoring a cigarette.  </P> <P> "We're kind of out in the country," Press says, "but we like the atmosphere out  here."  </P> <P> Press, 40, has both feet up on the coffee table of life. He talks slowly,  enjoys good conversation and probably chews a mouthful of food 32 times before  swallowing.  </P> <P> Yet despite being tucked away 4,000 feet above sea level, a hermit Press is  not. Once a week or so, he gathers Bonnie, his wife of 21 years, and his small  entourage, trailers his race car and heads outta them thar hills for the race  track.  </P> <P> Tonight at 7, Press will visit Saugus Speedway for Race No. 8 in the NASCAR  All-American Challenge Series Southwest Tour. In his first full season on the  20-race, 12-track circuit, the reclusive racer, somewhat surprisingly, has  emerged as the series' points leader.  </P> <P> "We're definitely in the lower rent district, money-wise," Press says. "But  we've always been able to do more with less. The top six or eight cars that run  the tour have just a money's unlimited deal."  </P> <P> In its fourth season, the Southwest Tour, with a total yearly purse of about  $500,000, has developed into NASCAR's second-most lucrative racing endeavor on  the West Coast behind the Winston West Series. What began with the grease  monkey working out of his garage with his own toolbox is rapidly evolving into  corporate racing.  </P> <P> Several drivers, including defending tour-champion Roman Calczynski of  Sepulveda, who drives for Spears Manufacturing Co., are employed for their  driving services by a racing team. Freymiller Trucking Co. and Taco  Bell/Thompson Buick also field tour competitors.  </P> <P> But with his small-time, small-town operation complete with a seven-member  volunteer pit crew, Press, who stands 5-feet-6, has emerged as the big man on  the tour, confounding the big-bucks city slickers.  </P> <P> "He's not unique as an owner-operator," NASCAR promoter Owen Kearns Jr. said of  Press. "But he's doing well with what he has accumulated over the years, both  in knowledge and pieces."  </P> <P> Ron Burdg, Press' racing partner, considers the pair's effort no more than a  hobby. "It's a relatively restrictive operation with 100% effort," said Burdg,  who also owns a machining business in Chatsworth and serves as Press' chief  sponsor. "What we win goes back into the car. Nobody's in it for the monetary  gain. He has his job, I have mine and that's that."  </P> <P> Said Press: "Ron and I decided we wanted to give it a run for the championship  this year. Ron didn't want to do it all on his own. I didn't want to do it all  on my own. So, we pooled our money and put in whatever it takes to get the job  done."  </P> <P> Press, a part-time competitor in each of the tour's past three years, has a  tour-high three wins, five top-five and six top-10 finishes. He is the leading  money winner with $13,825 entering tonight's 125-lap, 41.6-mile event with a  total purse of $23,550. Press has completed 629 of the tour's 630 laps.  </P> <P> "Those guys don't have any better equipment than what I have," Press said of  the competition. "They just got more of it. A guy said to me one time years  ago, 'The money doesn't really make you go any faster, it just makes you go  faster longer.' "  </P> <P> For many, the success of Press comes as no surprise. And he will be the driver  to beat tonight for more than one reason.  </P> <P> Although he is winless in six tour appearances at Saugus, Press is the  winningest, and, arguably, the most popular, driver in the track's 50-year  history.  </P> <P> During his 16-year career at the one-third-mile oval where he was selected  track rookie of the year in 1973, Press piled up a track-record 61 main-event  victories while winning Modified division championships in 1978 and '82. His 15  main-event wins in 1978 remains a track record.  </P> <P> "He was the toughest to beat," said Tru Cheek, a contemporary of Press who won  Modified titles in 1979 and '81. "He'd win as many as seven or eight races in a  row sometimes. Him and I fought tooth and nail for years -- on the track, not  off it."  </P> <P> Press, who describes his career as "up and down," was voted most popular driver  and "Hard Luck Driver" by the fans three times while developing a reputation  for rallying and for, well, having hard luck.  </P> <P> "We'd be winning and setting track records," Press says, "and then we'd blow up  five laps later."  </P> <P> He finished second three times, including in 1980 when his points lead slipped  away after a qualifying-lap crash left him with a broken leg with three races  left in the season. In 1981, Press broke the same leg and finished outside the  top 10, but he rebounded to win his second title the following year.  </P> <P> "A lot of the guys I race with have not been through anything near the chain of  events that I have gone through in my racing career." Press said. "Most of  those guys haven't been in real bad accidents."  </P> <P> In 1984, Press finished second to Ken Sapper of La Crescenta by just 60 points,  despite a division-high eight main-event wins. In 1985, Press again finished  out of the top 10 but took the checkered flag of the Miller High Life 150 and  won three main events.  </P> <P> "I used to do everything myself -- that is the crew and myself," Press said.  "In '78, when we won the championship, we built our own car, we made our own  body, we did our own motors. We did everything. Nowadays, it's more practical  to buy a chassis from somebody and the body parts. All we do now is maintain  the car, totally, ourselves. We make a few parts for the car, but nothing like  we used to."  </P> <P> Press concedes that in order to keep pace with the competition he must  increasingly rely on more modern methods of preparation and maintenance. It is  a far cry from the old days at Saugus, when he was known as a wizard with a  wrench.  </P> <P> "Dan has always been an innovator," said Lyn Pherigo, Saugus' publicity  director. "He's very innovative and very intelligent. He's got the smarts."  </P> <P> Said Press: "I think that where my success comes from is that throughout my  career, I've liked to experiment. We're not afraid to make drastic changes in  the car. We have a lot of track experience, a lot of chassis experience. I  experiment, probably, more than anyone else on the West Coast as far as  designing stuff and trying stuff.  </P> <P> "That's what I always enjoyed about racing. Now it's more of a money sport."  </P> <P> Press admittedly does not race for big bills, but for big thrills. "In our real  successful years," he said, "we spent, on the average, about $35,000 to $40,000  in a year and we won anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000. We would win that much  money just to cut our losses.  </P> <P> "I'm not trying to make a living racing. I make a living here and racing is  just because I love to race."  </P> <P> Win, lose or slam into a wall tonight, Press will return to his mountain  retreat and prepare for the following week's race in Madera. It makes for a  long drive, living a long trek from the nearest track, but Press wouldn't have  it any other way.  </P> <P> "We like it out here," he said. "I had a little trouble sleeping the first  couple nights because it was so quiet. A guy a block away hits a nail with a  hammer and you know it."  </P></p>

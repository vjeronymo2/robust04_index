			<p>BFN     [Text] At the request of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdalllah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and  supreme commander of the Armed Forces, Muhammad Hasan Dammaz,  minister of local administration, today visited al-Dali'  District, which has been purged of the Yemeni Socialist Party's  renegade and secessionist clique. The minister attended a large  rally in the city of al-Dali' and addressed crowds from the  district.    At the beginning, he conveyed the greetings of brother  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  as well as his wishes and congratulations to them and to our  Yemeni people on the victory over the renegade and secessionist  clique. He said this great victory was achieved thanks to God  and the will of our people and all honorable unionists  everywhere in the Republic of Yemen. He said this victory which  you have achieved made us and every Yemeni citizen proud. He  said that purging the al-Dali' District, as well as the victory  achieved by the heroes of the Armed Forces in it, has restored  the people's confidence in themselves and in their unity.    The city of al-Dali', he said, is the city of heroic deeds  and bravery and the gate of victory that will correct the course  of unity, which will be devoid of factionalism, sectarianism,  cronyism, or regionalism, and which is considered a victory from  almighty God and a victory of right over wrong. He urged all  the sons of the district and all those who left it to return to  their families. He said the state and its leaders will protect  them, provide security for them, and take care of them,  stressing that no harm will come to them. This is, he said, a  promise from Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  and from all officials in the Presidential Council, the  government, and the leadership.    He said that the state and Lt. Gen. brother 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih have issued their instructions to implement an electricity  and water project in the city of al-Dali', stressing that the  project will be implemented immediately.    Brother 'Abd-al-Qadir 'Ali Hilal, deputy governor of the Ibb  Governorate, also delivered a speech to the crowds, hailing the  steadfastness of the heroic sons of al-Dali' District, their  support for Constitutional legitimacy, their defense of unity  and democracy, their efforts to entrench the state of order and  law, and their effective participation in defeating the forces  of renegade and secession. He added that the brother leader  president had asked him to form several committees to register  the names of the martyrs and the wounded and the names of those  whose houses were destroyed by the forces of renegade and  secession. This, he said, will take place quickly in order to  ease the suffering of the sons of the district, who faced  disasters at the hands of secessionists before the restoration  of the Yemeni Unity and during the years that followed it,  stressing that victory is for our people, our revolution, and  our unity, and that defeat is for the secessionists. The rally  was attended by Ibb Commander Colonel Muhammad Ahmad al-  Zayyani, al-Dali' District head Muhammad Isma'il Muqbil, and  several officials from A'tabah and (?Dimzah) districts.    The minister of local administration met with the commanders  of the military units and officials in the al-Dali' District and  discussed with them various issues of interest to the district  and its sons. He also inspected (?Dimz) District, met officials  from it, and listened to a number of supply and educational  issues of interest to the citizens. Several officials from the  district attended.</p>

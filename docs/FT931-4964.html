			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Selling shirts cost banker his job AN ASSISTANT vice-president of Chemical Bank, sacked for allegedly importing 2,000 shirts from Hong Kong and selling some of them around the office, was fairly dismissed, an industrial tribunal has ruled. Mr Andrew Morgan, who was responsible for financial and regulatory reporting in the US bank's Cardiff office until he was sacked in June 1992, had claimed unfair dismissal. He told the tribunal the import and sale of the shirts was a one-off transaction and that many other employees were also conducting businesses with management's tacit approval. The bank's code of ethics, part of every employee's contract, says written permission is needed before an employee can be involved in an outside business. Mr Morgan had failed to get permission, the tribunal heard. The written conclusions of the tribunal say Mr Morgan's activities first came to light during an investigation by the bank's management into travel and expenses claims. A file was discovered in the desk of Mr Lawrence Watts, a colleague of Mr Morgan's, which contained import certificates, shipping instructions and invoices for what appeared to be an importing business called Morgan and Watts. Mr Watts resigned after a disciplinary hearing but Mr Morgan initially denied being involved in any concerted business effort. He said a student from Hong Kong had asked him and Mr Watts to finance some imports and they had agreed. A total of 2,000 garments had been imported but very few had been sold. He had himself sold some shirts around the office, but most had been sold by his girlfriend to non-employees. He said he had never used the bank's telephones or fax machines. Mr Morgan was offered the chance to resign after being found in breach of the company's code of ethics. When he refused he was dismissed for gross misconduct. Mr Morgan argued at the tribunal that the dismissal was unfair because he had not been running a business but had only been involved in a one-off deal. This, he said, had been concluded in March 1991 with the full knowledge and tacit approval of management in his department. The tribunal concluded that it was immaterial whether the import and sale of the shirts had been a one-off transaction. It also found there was inadequate evidence to support Mr Morgan's claim that management did not enforce the code strictly.</p>

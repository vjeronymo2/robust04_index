			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, February 14 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese  representative to the UN Human Rights Commission Monday [14  February] retorted attacks by some non-governmental  organizations of some countries on the Chinese government over  the issue of Tibet.    Representatives from a handful of non-governmental  organizations sold the idea of "independence of Tibet" in their  speeches in the commission's session today. They alleged that  the ethnic Tibetans are becoming a minority in Tibet, and that  the Chinese government restricts religious freedom there.    Zhang Yishan, the Chinese representative, said there is  nothing new in their speeches today, which are only a repetition  of some old lies.    Zhang said it is known to all that since the 13th century,  Tibet has been an inseparable part of the Chinese territory.    China has been exercising its sovereign rights over Tibet  for  more than 700 years, and no country in the world has ever  recognized any kind of independence of Tibet, he said.    He added that the conclusion of some agreements between the  central government of China and the local government of Tibet in  1950 is purely China's internal affairs.    He pointed out that it is a blatant violation of the  principles and purpose of the United Nations charter for some  people to describe this event as "Chinese occupation of Tibet."    On the Tibetan population, Zhang cited a census conducted in  July 1990 by the Chinese government in Tibet, which showed that  the number of ethnic Tibetans there are 2.096 million, about  95.46 percent of the total population in the area.    The ethnic Han population living in Tibet is slightly higher  than 80,000, about 3.7 percent of the total population, the  census shows.    Zhang said this indicates that the claim that Tibetans are  becoming a minority is totally groundless.    Zhang finally pointed out that some non-governmental  organizations are politically motivated and irresponsible when  they create and spread lies about Tibet.    However, lies will be lies even they are repeated a thousand  times, he said, adding that the action of some people on the  issue of Tibet only exposes the fact that these people are not  really interested in human rights, but only in attaining their  own goals by using the issue of human rights.</p>

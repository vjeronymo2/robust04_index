			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US warned against trade pact delays The US is coming under mounting criticism from some of its most important trading partners for its apparent willingness to consider delaying the implementation of the Uruguay Round of trade agreements until next year. Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand and Singapore all attacked the US at the weekend meeting of finance ministers from the 18-nation Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Hawaii, warning that any slippage from the US could encourage other countries to delay carrying out their own promises to cut tariffs and reduce trade barriers. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, told his colleagues that the Clinton administration was committed to completing the agreement this year, or at the latest in the first half of next year. This assurance did not, however, satisfy all his fellow ministers. Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer, warned: 'It would be a tragedy if the immense human effort that led us to this agreement - which brought with it so much expectation of improved world trading relations and economic performance - were now to be postponed and perhaps dissipated through slow implementation.' The Uruguay Round of negotiations to liberalise the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is due to be wrapped up in Marrakesh next month, but the US has recently indicated that it might not be able to ratify the agreement this year. Mr Richard Gephardt, the leader of the majority Democrats in the House of Representatives, has warned that it will be difficult to get agreement on the tax increases or spending cuts which, under US budget rules, will be required to offset revenue lost from the tariff cuts the US has agreed to. 'It can be done this year, but I'm not sure it needs to be done this year,' Mr Gephardt said. Other countries are indignant at the idea that the Gatt deal might be held up because of revenue supposedly lost, since the whole premise of the pact is that it will boost growth, and hence government revenue, around the world. The Uruguay Round tariff cuts are estimated to cost the US government around Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in tax revenue over five years, but Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, told Congress last week that the Gatt agreement would bring in an extra Dollars 3 in federal tax revenue for every Dollars 1 of lost import duties.</p>

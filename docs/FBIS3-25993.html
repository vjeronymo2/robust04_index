Song Hanliang, secretary of the regional party committee,  made a summing up speech. He emphatically pointed out: To  further promote Xinjiang's reform and development, the most  crucial thing is to emancipate our minds and seek truth from  facts. In the minds of some of our comrades, the problem of  being socialist or capitalist has not been fundamentally solved.  The old ideology of planned economy still restrains the minds  of some of our comrades. The traditional oasis economy of  seeking self-sufficiency has been firmly established in the  minds of people. It has generated deep-rooted ideas of closed  economy, self-satisfaction, and conservatism. When discussing  reform, some comrades often stressed special conditions in the  region and warned against taking big strides. They wanted to do  things slowly and hoped to receive more special consideration.  This kind of backward ideology has adversely influenced our  work.    Song Hanling said: Without deepening the reform and changing  our ideology, we will not be able to achieve the goal of  enabling the people to lead a fairly comfortable life. In the  course of emancipating our minds, leading cadres at various  levels must stand at the forefront and set examples for others.  We should conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm the minds of cadres of various  nationalities with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and plunge ourselves  into the great practice of reform and construction.    Song Hanling said: Xinjiang should have a sense of urgency  in promoting development with high speed and high efficiency.  We must now pay particular attention to the following points:    1. We should accelerate adjustment of the industrial  structure and raise the overall efficiency of the national  economy.    2. We should improve the allocation of productive forces and  give favorable consideration to both special areas and special  industries.    3. We should break away from the structure of single  ownership and vigorously develop private economy.    4. We should change the operational mechanism of and  invigorate state-owned enterprises.    5. We should successfully complete construction of the  international passageway in the Northwest and further open up to  the outside world.    Song Hanling said: Adhering to the policy of grasping two  links [no further elaboration; the term "grasping two links" was  explained in detail in Jiang Zemin's report to the 14th CPC  National Congress] simultaneously and attaching equal importance  to both are basic requirements for building socialism and are  integral components of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must  persist in grasping the two links in our actual work.    On the issue of maintaining social and political stability,  Song Hanling pointed out: First, we must correctly handle the  relationship between stability and development. Second, we  should foster the idea of making efforts over a long period and  heighten our consciousness regarding the work of maintaining  stability. Third, leading cadres at various levels should oppose  national splittism with a clear-cut stand. Fourth, we should  exert all our efforts to grasp the work of maintaining  stability. Fifth, we should firmly trust and rely on the masses  of various nationalities.    Song Hanling emphatically pointed out: To realize the  strategic goals set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the tasks put forward by the current  meeting, to accelerate reform and opening up and to promote  Xinjiang's rapid and efficient economic development, the key  lies in strengthening and improving the party's leadership and,  in particular, strengthening party leadership over economic work.    Members of party committees at various levels must spend  more  time in study and less time in social activities, undertake more  investigation and study and reduce their subjectivism, do more  practical things and limit empty speech, concentrate their  efforts on effectively resolving contradictions and problems  arising in the course of reform and development, and ensure the  true implementation of various principles and policies of the  party Central Committee and the autonomous region.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BICC BICC's management must rue the day it ever ventured into property development. The rubble of another Pounds 35m of exceptional property provisions and a Pounds 12m property trading loss has concealed an otherwise pugnacious performance. The Balfour Beatty contracting arm showed remarkable resilience by increasing profits 5 per cent. The cables business suffered more but should now benefit from the revival in the US and Australian economies. The recovery appeal of these businesses has recently pierced the gloom enveloping BICC's property activities and its shares have climbed by two-thirds since October. There may be a little way left to run with the company still yielding some 7 per cent. But last year's dividend again had to be funded from reserves. It will take a while yet to rebuild cover sufficiently to justify raising the pay-out, especially if property throws up any more grisly surprises.</p>

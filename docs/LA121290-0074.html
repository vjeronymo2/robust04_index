			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: Veteran punk-rock singer-guitarist Lydia Lunch, who in the late  1970s and early '80s fronted a series of crude hard-core groups including  Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and Eight-Eyed Spy, is now on the lecture circuit  and will be at the Casbah on Thursday night. Waxing poetic about such topical  issues as abortion, censorship and war, she's part of the burgeoning Los  Angeles spoken-word movement led by impresario Harvey Kubernik, whose  "HollyWord" compilation album was recently released by Rhino Records. . . .  </P> <P> After 17 years and 11 albums, heavy-metal also-rans Y&amp;T are breaking up.  </P> <P> Their current farewell tour includes a stop Thursday night at the Bacchanal in  Kearny Mesa. . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale Friday at 3 p.m. for the Replacements' Jan. 20 concert at UC  San Diego Price Center Ballroom. Opening will be the Posies. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: Mojo Nixon with the Forbidden Pigs,  Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; Bad Company with Damn Yankees,  Friday at Golden Hall downtown; and the James Harman Band, Friday at the Belly  Up Tavern.  </P></p>

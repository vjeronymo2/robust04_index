			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOG HELPS CURB 160-ACRE FIRE NEAR ESCONDIDO  </P> <P> More than 380 firefighters from the California Department of Forestry and local  fire departments battled a brush fire Saturday that torched at least 160 acres  in Harmony Grove, just west of Escondido, authorities said.  </P> <P> The blaze, which did not threaten any homes, began about 1:30 p.m. and was  still burning late Saturday night, according to Audrey Hagan, a CDF  spokeswoman. Authorities were expecting the fire to be contained by midnight.  </P> <P> The blaze, which raged through Elfin Forest, was started by children playing  with matches, fire investigators said.  </P> <P> Forestry Department firefighters were assisted by neighboring departments,  including units from San Diego, Escondido, Vista, Fallbrook, Carlsbad and Camp  Pendleton. No one was reported injured.  </P> <P> Though the fire had not yet been extinguished, high humidity was reportedly  slowing the fire's progress.  </P> <P> "There's a fog bank rolling in and that's helping," Hagan said. "Now if we were  in the middle of the summer and there was a Santa Ana wind blowing, we would be  in big trouble."  </P></p>

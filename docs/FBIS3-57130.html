			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Suldin] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 23 TASS -- The first session of the  new Russian Government which was held on Friday discussed  organizational questions and mapped out the guidelines for its  work in 1994.    Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin who chaired the session  said the Government will hold sessions more often in 1994 and  expressed the confidence that the reduction of the Government  and the ministries by 20 per cent will not affect the quality of  their work.    He paid special attention to relations between the  Government  and the Federal Assembly. Chernomyrdin stressed that "the  Government should learn to build its work with the Federation  Council and the State Duma on a new basis. We need to develop  close and business-like interaction. There should be no  confrontation because we have common interests."    Commenting on the work of the Government, former first  vice-prime minister Yegor Gaydar said that the faction of the  Russia's Choice bloc is in "constructive opposition to the  Government and will support any of its constructive  initiatives." At the same time his faction plans to argue all  decisions which it will consider wrong or dangerous for Russia.  Gaydar voiced the hope that the work of the new Government will  be successful and it will solve the existing problems.    His colleague, deputy Gennadiy Burbulis believes that the  present composition of the Government "has resources and the  country has specialists to continue the course of reforms." As  for the strategy of reform, he said it "is in jeopardy, although  not in a fatal one."    "The present government has more people knowledgeable about  the economic mechanism which should be rebuilt," Nikolay  Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, said. He  said the new cabinet is more capable and suits Russia better  than the previous one. He believes the Government will have to  "feel the manufacturers's interest to work more effectively" and  should reconsider the tax, credit and some other of its policies.    Yabloko leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy proposed his own  programme  of urgent measures to curb inflation and stop production  decline. According to his "optimistic forecast," inflation may  get out of control by the fall and surge to 50 per cent, while  production decline will total 52 per cent of the 1989 level.  The year 1989 was the last year to see production growth.    Yavlinskiy said his faction is ready to form a government  capable of carrying out the proposed programme within eight to  nine months. Among top priority measures aimed at maintaining  inflation at 20 per cent in 1994, the economist named the need  to bring the dollar exchange rate in line with inflation  dynamics. To this end, the "government should take the  responsibility for the dynamics of the dollar exchange rate.  This means the need to conclude today a futures deal to sell  hard currency at a certain rate."    Another important measure is a "radical change of the policy  of privileges for exporters." It will aim at keeping hard  currency reserves within the country, he said.    "The present government will not make quick successes,"  Vladimir Lukin, one of the leaders of the Yabloko bloc, said.    Lukin believes that the cabinet should prioritise measures  aimed at fighting crime in the country. "Without the struggle  against the criminalisation of all spheres of life it will be  impossible to build a normal market system," he added.    Speaking about the composition of the new government, Lukin  noted that Chernomyrdin can act as its leader because he has  supported major reform initiatives of the previous governments.  "There should be only one leader bearing responsibility for the  adopted programme. This is vital for the success of the entire  government," Lukin said.    Georgiy Satarov, a top adviser to President Boris Yeltsin,  believes that the course of reform should not be linked to  individual members of the government. In an interview with  ITAR-TASS, he recalled that "over the eight months of 1993 when  the cabinet of Viktor Chernomyrdin worked without Yegor Gaydar  there had been no considerable backtracking from the  anti-inflationary policy." He warned against making "dramatic  forecasts" and called for assessing the situation by the changes  the Government makes in the reform programme.    Economist Pavel Bunich, a member of the Russia's Choice  bloc,  said the formation of the new Government marks "the decline in  the vector of economic reform." he described the current period  as a period of temporary appeasement connected with the  formation of the president-premier-Federal-Assembly-chairmen  axis. When inflation begins soaring, attempts will resume to  find a scapegoat. The parliament will blame the Government.  The president will do the same. This may lead to a situation  in which the cabinet may become incapable. At present, the  situation in the Government will depend on the prime minister's  behaviour, he concluded.    Former finance minister Boris Fedorov who resigned this week  said he will focus his work in the State Duma on lawmaking in  order to push reform forward. He described as a "provocation" a  publication in the British newspaper GUARDIAN which claimed that  he had allegedly requested the U.S. ambassador to Russia to help  him get a job in some influential international organisation.  Fedorov told ITAR-TASS that he "has not been in the American  Embassy for several months."    Vladimir Shcherbakov has denied reports that he has been  offered the post of finance minister to replace Fedorov. "I  have not received an official offer," Shcherbakov, who heads the  international fund supporting privatisation and foreign  investments, said.</p>

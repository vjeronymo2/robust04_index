			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Fund managers form joint venture HENDERSON Administration and Gartmore Investment Management, the fund management groups, yesterday announced the formation of a joint venture to administer their unit trust businesses. The move is seen as a sign of growing pressure on the profitability of fund management companies which have faced heavy competition and slow growth in the unit trust and pension fund businesses. The venture will allow the two companies to seek a new source of fee income. The venture, named The Administration Partnership, will seek additional work administering the unit trust businesses of other fund managers. Currently, there is only one significant marketer of so-called back office services for the unit trust industry, and most fund managers administer their own funds internally. The venture, expected to take a year to complete, will be 51 per cent owned by Gartmore and 49 per cent by Henderson. It will have 184,000 unitholders and Pounds 3bn under management and will be formed as Gartmore spins off its existing administration facility with 75 staff. Henderson has no unit trust facilities and has used third-party administrative services for some time.</p>

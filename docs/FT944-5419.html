			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): A modest advance for private investors - Gilts THE MEASURE: The Bank of England is planning to introduce an open re-purchase (or 'repo') market for UK government securities or gilts. One potential consequence is that interest on all gilts may start to be paid gross of tax. WHAT IT MEANS: The development of a gilt repo market would bring the UK into line with most other international bond markets. Repos are loans between two parties in which bonds are used as collateral. Party A lends its gilts to Party B in return for cash up-front. At the end of a set period, Party A re-purchases the gilts at a set price which reflects an interest payment covering the period of the loan. The Bank of England believes that creating a repo facility will add liquidity to the gilts market by encouraging more investors to take part. In the long run, this should reduce the government's borrowing costs. But the introduction of such a system, while very useful to institutional investors wishing to finance their gilt holdings, or to traders who want to speculate on a fall in gilt prices by 'going short', will have little direct impact on the private investor. Repos are definitely designed for professionals. It is the side-effects of a repo system which may matter to the average investor. A repo system would be made more complex by the fact that some investors receive their interest gross while others get it only after witholding tax is deducted. One change that would make the system run more smoothly is for interest on all gilts to be paid gross of tax. 'It is possible to have a gilt repo market without gross payment of interest but I don't think it would be satisfactory to the market' says Roger Shaw, head of arbitrage at Mildland Global Markets. Investors would then be responsible for declaring the tax payable to the Inland Revenue. Unsurprisingly, the Revenue fears it could lose money through the change. The present witholding tax system is a highly effective way of collecting money due. The Revenue is soon going to produce a consultation paper on the subject. Like the Bank of England's paper, issued this week, it will invite comments by January 31. The Bank says the earliest likely date for a fully functioning repo market would then be July 31. Gross interest on gilts would make them more convenient for wealthier non-taxpayers, such as non-working spouses. At present, they can receive tax-free income on gilts via the National Savings Stock Register. If, however, you hold gilts already, the amount of any one gilt you can transfer to the NSSR is Pounds 5,000 a year. Then, too, new buyers of gilts can buy only Pounds 25,000 of any one stock in one day. And, because the NSSR is a postal system, it is slower than operating via a broker; it also means investors are unsure of the price they will get. Buying via the NSSR is cheaper than buying through a broker but not as cheap as it used to be; charges were increased this week from an effective 0.4 per cent to 0.6. So, while gross payment of interest would be a modest step forward for the private investor, it would not be a revolution - especially as the possibility of tax-free income from corporate bonds and preference shares is now on offer from the chancellor.

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP ALL-AMERICAN CONWAY WILL ENROLL AT EL CAMINO BUT WON'T PLAY, SAYS COACH  </P> <P> Prep All-American quarterback Curtis Conway of Hawthorne plans to enroll at El  Camino College this fall as a part-time student but will not play football,  according to El Camino Coach John Featherstone.  </P> <P> Conway, one of USC's top recruits, was unable to enroll at USC this fall  because he failed to score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test in five tries.  USC reportedly will honor its commitment to Conway if he passes the test this  fall.  </P> <P> Featherstone said Conway has agreed to take an English placement test in the  first week of August, after which a level of studies will be determined for him  at El Camino. By enrolling as a part-time student and not participating in  sports, Conway will retain his full athletic eligibility.  </P> <P> "It's a one-year plan without playing football," Featherstone said. "We are  going to try to give him as many transferable classes as we can.  </P> <P> "If he fails to pass the SAT, we hope that Curtis would be excited about  playing for us (in 1990)."  </P> <P> The versatile Conway has worked out with El Camino this summer as a wide  receiver.  </P> <P> Conway, twice named South Bay Back of the Year by The Times and the state  100-meter champion, declined to comment. He will play for the South All-Stars  in the Shrine Football Classic on July 29 at the Rose Bowl.  </P></p>

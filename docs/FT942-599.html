			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper price seen holding gains Copper's price will on average be at least Dollars 1 a pound (Dollars 2,204 a tonne) for the next ten years, suggests Mr Burgess Winter, president of Magma Copper, third-largest of the US producers. He dismisses suggestions that a huge upsurge in output from new mines from 1995 onwards and the new low-cost solvent-extraction, electro-winning production process will drive down prices. Not all the scheduled capacity will arrive on time, he says, and inevitably there will be interruptions to existing supply. Magma expects copper demand to rise by an annual average of 2.3 per cent - and that would require a new mine the size of Escondida in Chile (400,000 tonnes last year) and a new smelter every second year, Mr Winter points out. Nevertheless, Magma has taken the precaution of initiating a price protection programme that guarantees a minimum realised price of 84 cents a pound compared with Dollars 1.10 on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. The programme consists mostly of 'put' options which allows the company to benefit from any rise above 84 cents. Mr Winter says Magma wants to guarantee a floor price for 1995 output - no matter what happens to short-term copper prices - at a modest cost of one cent a lb because the company cab be sure of covering the cost of its Dollars 300m Robinson mine in Nevada, due in production early next year, without touching its Dollars 200m line of revolving bank credit. In spite of Mr Winter's bullish price outlook, Magma has been driving down production costs so that by 1996 it expects to achieve cash costs of 50 cents a lb and full pre-tax costs of 70 cents. In the first quarter of 1994 Magma's cash costs were 59 cents. Mr Winter's views on future copper prices are not universally supported. For example, Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, argues that the copper industry is about to be transformed by solvent-extraction, electro-winning technology, which does away with the need for a smelter when an ore body lends itself to this treatment. He suggests that ultimately, the price of copper will fall towards the marginal cost of current production: Dollars 1,350 a tonne (61 cents a pound) as high-cost concentrate/smelter output is displaced.</p>

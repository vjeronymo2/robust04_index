			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / US-Israeli summit boosts hopes over Mideast talks A NEW chapter in US-Israeli relations opened yesterday as President George Bush signalled a formal end to recent tension between the two countries. 'The welcome mat is out,' he told Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, at the start of a two-day summit at Kennebunkport, Mr Bush's east coast holiday home. The summit is expected to pave the way for progress in Middle East peace negotiations and on American guarantees for loans to build homes for Jewish immigrants arriving in Israel from the former Soviet Union. It was the first meeting between the two leaders since Israel's Labour leader defeated his hardline opponent, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, in June's general election - a victory welcomed in Washington. 'Prime minister Rabin has many friends in the US, including the man standing next to him,' said Mr Bush. Mr Rabin responded that his government wished to alter Israel's national priorities and to give peace negotiations, which will resume in Washington on August 24, a chance to succeed. 'We would like to give a chance, a real chance, to the peace negotiations within the framework of the Madrid conference,' said Mr Rabin. 'We would like to change the order of our national priorities. 'We believe that the real problems are in the domestic field, in addition to making a real effort to negotiate peace seriously without endangering Israel's security.' The two days of talks, attended by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, are expected to cover a broad range of Middle East and international issues, including Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's latest challenge to United Nations' resolutions and the crisis in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Israel has largely cleared the way for US approval of loan guarantees for up to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) by imposing a virtual freeze on building new Jewish settlements in the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war. The US refused to accede to Mr Shamir's earlier loan guarantee request, insisting that the commitment of his Likud party to building more settlements in the West Bank and Gaza was a serious obstacle to the peace process. Mr Rabin has also pledged to negotiate speedily with the Palestinians the establishment of an interim self-governing authority for the West Bank and Gaza, pending final agreement on the ultimate status of the territories. The possible shape of such an interim arrangement was formulated by Egypt, Israel and the US during the 1978 Camp David negotiations, but rejected at the time by the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Arab governments. A Jordanian newspaper claimed yesterday that Israeli and Palestinian representatives had already reached an agreement during secret talks in Cairo on limited autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza. However, Ms Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, denied the report, saying it did not reflect the deliberations and work of the negotiating team. Israel has signalled a wish to create a better negotiating atmosphere by indicating it will repeal a law forbidding meetings with official members of the PLO. But hostility within Israel to the new government's initiatives was again evident with hardline settlers' groups pledging to continue building in the occupied territories. Mr Micha Harish, the trade minister, said after a cabinet meeting that the settlers' aim was clearly political and geared towards harming the visit of the prime minister to the US.

The Bad News: Missing Rukh Secretariat Head Has  Not Yet Been Found"]    [Text] The registration of candidates running for Ukraine's  Supreme Soviet, new convocation, has been completed in district  electoral commissions. A considerable part of the current  deputies are running again for the Supreme Soviet. Political  parties' preparations for the elections have barely started. To  take place on 29 January is a congress of the "party of power"  -- the Labor Congress of Ukraine -- and on 5 February there will  be a congress of one of the most influential parties -- the  Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine, to discuss questions  connected with the upcoming 27 March elections.    In the eastern part of Ukraine, parties of democratic  centrist tendency have nominated few delegates, not enough to go  around all the election districts. Even so they could not split  up the zones of influence between themselves. For example, the  rivals in Kharkov will be Volodymyr Grinev, former deputy  chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Soviet and chairman of the "New  Ukraine" association, and Genrikh Altunyan, head of the Kharkov  Kray organization of the People's Rukh of Ukraine. In Odessa,  Eduard Gurvits, rather influential there, will contend against  current Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk.    In Crimea, currently carried away with presidential  elections, not all election districts have nominated candidates.  The deadline for their nomination will apparently be moved  forward because there will be simultaneous elections for  Crimea's Supreme Soviet.    It did not go without scandals. For example, People's Rukh  leader Vyacheslav Chornovil accused Valentin Nedrigaylo, first  deputy internal affairs minister, who was supposed to report to  the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine the results of the search for  Mikhail Boychishin, head of the Rukh secretariat who has been  missing since 15 January, of trying to shift the case from the  political into the purely criminal sphere. This is naturally  disadvantageous to Rukh. As for the lost chief of the Rukh  secretariat, no traces of him have been found to date, nor is  there even a plausible explanation for his disappearance.</p>

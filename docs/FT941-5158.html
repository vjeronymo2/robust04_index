			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Delicate digestive system Mr Silvio Berlusconi's entry into politics coincides with a delicate phase in the Fininvest empire. The group is burdened by debts and has lost its identity as a result of rapid expansion in the 1980s boom, writes Robert Graham. In 1992, the last year for published accounts, Fininvest profits were down to L21bn (Pounds 8.5m). The accounts would have been in the red but for exceptional gains of L334bn, reflecting a mark-up on the transfer to his brother Paolo of his newspaper and Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi building interest. Arthur Andersen, the auditor, qualified the accounts last May, making observations about tax provisions of L172bn, and L437bn of funding extended to buy television rights for use in the Spanish market. The 1993 results are likely to be depressed by stagnant advertising revenues, the effects of recession, the cost of debt service and greater tax provisions. 'Fininvest is a typical product of the 1980s boom,' observes Mr Franco Tato of Fininvest's Mondadori publishing arm. 'It didn't want to become a conglomerate, but became so with a policy of expansion at all costs. The original thread linking all the activities was advertising. But it has been lost and all this expansion now has to be digested.' The group has spread itself into four areas: stores (Standa and Euromercato); publishing (Mondadori and Silvio Berlusconi Editore); television and cinema, known under the heading Big tv; and financial products. Almost without exception Fininvest has a good asset portfolio. However, many assets were bought at very high prices with expensive debt in an expanding economy. Real interest rates remain high and Italy has been in a recession for 18 months. Mr Tato considers all of these to be mature business areas with clear limits on growth imposed by anti-trust laws on expansion in publishing and the threat to TV licences. The group is carrying L3,800bn of debt, high by Italian standards, reflecting the purchase of Standa and Mondadori in the 1988-91 period. Fininvest's debt has leapt 12-fold since 1988 from L293bn. Concern over the size of Fininvest debt among the group's creditor banks was one reason for Mr Tato's appointment last October. Some L600bn should be raised by the flotation of Mondadori-SBE later this year. But even if it proceeds as planned, it may not be enough to tide Fininvest over the recession. Although Standa provides almost half Fininvest's cash-flow, it carries much of the debt and is the most marginal to the media/multimedia interests. Apart from considering asset sales, Mr Tato is restructuring the debt out of the Fininvest holding and into the operating companies. He also believes the ownership structure will have to be reworked. This has been tax efficient, but is increasingly clumsy to manage. Also, in the light of the Ferruzzi group's collapse last year, the demand by the financial community for greater transparency in family holdings has increased.</p>

The U.S. Government  currently places top priority on resolving the North Korean  nuclear question and is therefore refraining from bringing up  trade issues with Seoul, the reports said. Labeling 10 major  developing economies, including South Korea, as "Big Emerging  Markets (BEMs), Washington decided earlier to focus on widening  its access to these markets as this year's top trade policy.  But it has reportedly made South Korea an exception until the  North Korean problem is settled.    The United States will instead concentrate on improving  trade  conditions in Japan and all other BEMs excepting Korea. It has  chosen Indonesia to test the policy first and is limiting trade  pressure against Korea to merely "telling what it wants" through  the bilateral Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) channel,  the reports said. But Washington is expected to turn up the heat  on Seoul sometime before June as tensions from the nuclear  problem slowly ease and the Uruguay Round [UR] act is likely to  pass congress around then, they said.    Its trade demands will aim mainly at Korea's financial  services market and policy on corporate competitiveness, which  were excluded from the UR negotiations, and Washington has  alreadly begun dropping hints through the dec channel to soften  the blow, they said.</p>

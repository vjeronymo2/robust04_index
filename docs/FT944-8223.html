			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Thanksgiving is unlikely to halt uncertainty  -New York Many investors this week will spend their Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday grateful for a day not spent trying to come to terms with a volatile stock market. However, uncertainty is expected to continue over what is generally one of the slowest weeks of the year. Last week saw hour-by-hour and day-by-day see-sawing as the market proved unable to sustain a rally or succumb entirely to the bears, a trend that could continue into next week. Over the past two-and-a-half months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has rarely broken out of the 3800 range. Some economists believe the market may stage its traditional year-end rally, as firms put bonuses and pension-fund contributions into the hands of employees. But even those bullish for the short-term are generally pessimistic about the next several months. 'We're in kind of a seasonally strong time of year, which could lead to a short-term rally phase, but if that happens it will only postpone weakness down the road,' says Mr Richard McCabe at Merrill Lynch. Also contributing to last week's market gyrations was the Fed's decision to increase the fed funds target rate by a larger-than-expected 75 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent. The move left both the stock and bond markets unsettled because the door is open to another rate increase later this year or early in 1995. Even figures showing inflation to be in check for the moment have done nothing to calm fears of inflation down the road. At every turn both the stock and bond markets have seen only the worst in generally positive numbers. For example, presented last week with news of a decline in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's index of business activity, the markets drew pessimism from a sub-index that showed an increase in prices paid by manufacturers. While a strong economy is generally good for the equity market, stocks have taken their cues from bonds recently as company profits suffer when interest rates rise. What does the Fed's move mean for this week's markets? 'We're one week closer to the next tightening,' Mr Thomas McManus at Morgan Stanley, responds dryly. He joins a host of Wall Street economists who are predicting another interest rate increase in the short-term. Mr McManus advises avoiding the stock market until there is a significant decline. He believes some investors have neglected the fact that higher interest rates may draw some investments away from stocks and into the fixed income market. Rising interest rates will hurt equities by deterring corporate borrowing and put pressure on earnings.</p>

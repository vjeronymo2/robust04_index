			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Steady growth for Forth Ports Forth Ports, the privatised Scotland-based ports operator, saw steady growth in turnover and profits in the six months to June 26. Pre-tax profits rose 4.2 per cent to Pounds 5.73m (Pounds 5.49m). Turnover was up 2.5 per cent at Pounds 16.2m, against Pounds 15.8m adjusted to exclude Pounds 1.3m relating to offices being constructed at Victoria Quay, Leith, Edinburgh for the Scottish Office, which have been sold forward. None of the profit made on a property sale at Victoria Quay has been incorporated. Part will be included in the full year results with the balance next year. The overall tonnage handled in the Forth estuary increased by 75 per cent to 20.1m as a result of a 90 per cent increase in piped cargo through BP's Hound Point terminal. Dry cargo handled dropped by 250,000 tonnes to 1.3m tonnes. Revenue per tonne of piped cargo is only about a twentieth of that for dry cargo. Mr William Thomson, chairman, said Forth Ports was encouraged by the recent transformation of the area around the port of Leith which augured well for future developments. Port business had been steady since the half year and the company should report a satisfactory profit for the full year. Earnings per share rose 6.7 per cent to 12.7p (11.9p) and the interim dividend is up 20 per cent at 2.7p (2.25p). The shares rose 20p to 475p yesterday. BZW, the company's broker, raised its profits forecast for the full year from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 13m, including a Pounds 1.65m contribution from Victoria Quay. The forecast implies earnings per share of 29p and a prospective multiple of about 16.</p>

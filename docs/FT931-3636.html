			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / People: Constructive careers Costain, the struggling construction and mining company, has opted to promote its internal candidate, chief financial officer Alan Lovell, to the position of finance director following an outside search to fill the job vacated by Tom Slee at the end of last year. Group chief executive Peter Costain says the headhunters short-listed three outside candidates. 'We wanted to test the market because Alan had only just started at the time. But in his four months with us he has impressed all those working with him, including the banks.' He reports that the other candidates available amounted to 'a very good selection.' The sale of Costain's Australian coal mining interests has been interrupted by complex legal proceedings in the US, in turn raising a questionmark over the group's recent refinancing arrangements which are consequent on the sale. Lovell, 38, joined from Conder Group, where he had been chief executive for five months before the company went into receivership last autumn. He had been at Plessey between 1980 and 1989, in a series of positions, including as finance director of Plessey Avionics. In 1985 he was seconded to the corporate finance department of Kleinwort Benson, working on the defence of Plessey against the first GEC bid.</p>

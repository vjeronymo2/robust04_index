			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil price revisions hit shares A powerful combination of Kleinwort Benson, Nomura and Hoare Govett wrought substantial damage in the oil sector. Kleinwort set the ball rolling, cutting its forecast of average oil prices for 1994 from Dollars 17 a barrel to Dollars 14: analyst Mr Paul Spedding cited 'Opec's inaction to remedy over-production' for the downgrade. Kleinwort accompanied its oil price forecast shift with a reiteration of its bearish stance on Shell Transport, 11 weaker at 726p, while maintaining its stance on British Petroleum as a 'hold'. The latter settled 6 off at 368 1/2 p. The broker also downgraded its asset values for the exploration and production stocks, but declined to give details. Nomura and Hoare were seen by marketmakers as triggering a drop in Enterprise Oil shares of 13 to 463p in keen turnover of 3.4m. Nomura expects the shares to underperform and the dividend to come under threat in 1994/95 without a sustained rise in crude oil prices. It also anticipates that the market may be called on to purchase more Enterprise equity as part of Elf Aquitaine's financial restructuring. Hoare Govett told its clients to 'switch from Enterprise to BP to reduce upstream risk'. Premier Consolidated eased a penny to 23 1/2 p after one institution sold a block of 5m shares into the market at 22 1/2 p, most of which were subsequently placed at 23 1/4 p.</p>

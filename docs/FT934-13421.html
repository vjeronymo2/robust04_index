			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (5): A listener who both lends and borrows big - The European Investment Bank AS a founder member of the European Community, Luxembourg has never been shy of making a pitch for a new EC institution. Its campaign to capture the future European central bank has drawn much attention, but this has tended to obscure the presence in the Grand Duchy of an increasingly powerful international financial institution in its own right: the European Investment Bank (EIB). The EIB's central task is to provide long-term finance to promote economic integration in the EC, most recently through the completion of the Single European market. But the bank is moving rapidly into new areas, ranging from the provision of funds for telecommunications networks in Bulgaria to the management of Euratom money for making nuclear reactors safe in the former Soviet Union. Today, the EIB's lending and borrowing is bigger than the World Bank. It has a leading role in the European Commission's growth initiative to get the European economy under way; and it has a forceful new president, Sir Brian Unwin, a former head of the UK Customs and Excise who spent the last part of a 30-year-long career in Whitehall battling alongside Mrs Thatcher for a bigger EC budget rebate for Britain. It is tempting to suggest that Sir Brian is a poacher-turned-gamekeeper. He prefers to describe himself as an EIB old boy, having earlier served as a British nominee to the EIB board. Insiders predict that this experience will make make him a good less circumspect about stamping his authority on the institution and shaping relations with its political masters in Brussels. 'We need to be a more active,' said Sir Brian in an interview in late summer in his Luxembourg office. 'Political control is in the European Community and the apex is the council of ministers. But it is very important to play an active role to shape the policy. The bank must be heard at all levels of the EC structures.' This suggests that the EIB has been to willing to play 'the listening bank'. Its lack of political punch was underlined three years ago, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl bowed to French pressure and agreed to set up the Bank for European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. Many believe that the job would have been handled better by the EIB. The new bank's new portfolio includes: Operation of the new Ecus 2bn package of subsidised loans and grants set up as part of the EC's deal with the European Free Trade Area states known as in the European Economic Area (which excludes Switzerland); A key role in the new Cohesion fund for Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, as well as the newly enlarged Structural funds agreed in the December 1992 seven-year EC budget deal; Lead role in implementing the 1992 Edinburgh summit's growth package. This includes a temporary lending facility of Ecu 5 bn earmarked for trans-European networks in 1993 and 1994, particularly in telecoms, transport and energy. The Edinburgh agreement also covers a new financial instrument: the European Investment Fund. This is a novel semi-government agency which will draw on public and private capital to funnel finance to small and medium-sized businesses. At the latest count, some 30 banks are positively committed to subscribing to the target of 30 per cent of the subscribed capital of Ecus 2bn, with the rest supplied by the European Commission and the EIB itself. There is, however, another explanation for the EIB's higher profile. The EIB's shareholders - the 12 EC member states - have been less willing to fund new infrastructure projects directly. With growing budget deficits and increasing pressure to meet the Maastricht treaty's convergence criteria, the emphasis is on fiscal constraint. 'We looked around and the EIB was the obvious source of capital,' says one European Commission official. The challenge is to ensure that his newly enlarged portfolio fits into the Bank's core business: the promotion of greater economic cohesion in the EC, mainly through high-quality loans and underwriting capacity. These are still based on a triple A credit rating, which Sir Brian describes as the bank's most precious asset. Ten years ago, the only country outside the EC in which the EIB was involved was Yugoslavia. Today it lends to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP), as well as to Latin America, Asia and, increasingly, eastern Europe. The EIB has also arranged a lending programme for the Baltic states - its first move into the former Soviet Union. Lending outside the EC area still accounts for only about 5 per cent of the total loan portfolio. But it comes amid a significant expansion in the EIB's overall activities. Between 1983 and 1992, lending has risen from Ecu 6bn to Ecu 17bn. This year it could exceed Ecu 20b. As Sir Brian pointed out in his inaugural address to shareholders, this breakneck expansion has led to distortions. About one third of the staff, which is nearly 800 strong, works on less than 10 per cent of the EIB's lending. In other words, while lending has increased by 80 per cent over the past five years, staff numbers grew by only 12 per cent. And the bank, says Sir Brian, already has a formidable amount of business on its plate. It faces a tricky diplomatic task in relations with other EC agencies such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Commission; each has its own ideas on how best to promote the integration of Europe, east and west. But Sir Brian, who calls himself 'a lot of a European', has no intention of 'going native' like some of his fellow countrymen on the continent. There is a strong practical edge to his character, coupled with a hard-headed optimism about the future prospects of the EC. This is a man committed to making the Community's often unwieldy institutions work.</p>

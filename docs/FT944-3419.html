			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Former Macy chief moves to Woolworth Woolworth, the troubled US store group, yesterday pulled off a coup by securing the services of one of the most highly regarded figures in US retailing: Mr Roger Farah, formerly chief operating officer of the RH Macy department store group. Mr Farah, 41, is to become Woolworth's chairman and chief executive. He faces turning around a company that reported six consecutive quarters of losses before making a small profit in the latest quarter. Before joining Macy, Mr Farah spent three years at Federated Department Stores, the US retailing group that owns the Bloomingdale's chain. As head of the group's central buying and product development arm, he earned a reputation as a skilful merchandiser. When Mr Farah announced he was leaving Federated for Macy, Federated tried to block his move with a lawsuit claiming breach of contract. The companies settled out of court, and Mr Farah began working for Macy in July. Two weeks later, Macy, which had been operating under bankruptcy protection since January 1992, agreed to merge with Federated, so Mr Farah, who had alienated Federated by his perceived disloyalty, had to start looking for another job. At Woolworth, Mr Farah will replace Mr John Adams, an outside director who had been acting as chairman and chief executive pending the replacement of Mr William Lavin, who previously held both posts. Mr Lavin was stripped of the chairmanship in May after it was discovered the company had falsified some of its quarterly results to make losses look like profits. He remained as chief executive, but left the company in October. Woolworth has been trying to improve its financial performance by cutting back on its fading five-and-dime store operations and diversifying into specialty retailing. The strategy has failed to yield the expected results. Yesterday, Mr Adams said Mr Farah had a record of accomplishment, particularly in growing businesses. 'We are looking forward to benefiting greatly from his leadership and his merchandising expertise'. Woolworth's shares closed up Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 13 7/8. Kmart, the ailing US discount store group, yesterday announced it was eliminating 900 full-time equivalent jobs at its Troy, Michigan headquarters.</p>

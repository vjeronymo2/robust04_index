			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / City turned down Pounds 1.5m tent for EBRD THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development approached the Corporation of London last autumn with a request that it should spend Pounds 1.5m on a temporary structure for the bank's annual meeting, which is being held next week. The bank drew up plans to build a large tented structure in Spitalfields, across the road from its Bishopsgate building in London. The proposals included a bridge, to be installed by helicopter, that would link the two buildings for the duration of the meeting, to provide extra security for its senior delegates. The corporation, asked to provide the accommodation for the meeting as a welcoming gesture, rejected the proposal as too expensive. The corporation also rejected an earlier proposal to consider building a permanent conference centre, which could then be used for the bank's meeting, on the Spitalfields site at a cost of Pounds 14m. The EBRD's difficulties in finding a conference centre large enough to accommodate the 4,500 people expected to attend its annual meeting began at the end of last summer, when it decided to hold the meeting in London. More details emerged yesterday of the materials and furniture which went into decorating and fitting out the EBRD's new headquarters. According to suppliers expenditure included: Joinery for panelling, door frames and doors worth about Pounds 2.5m, including large amounts of crown-cut sycamore. 600 desks made of steel and glass, to a design by Norman Foster costing more than Pounds 600 each, supplied by Techno of Italy. A custom-made carpet in a wide range of shades of green provided by Tyndale in London, designed to ensure that it appeared to be the same colour regardless of the different lighting. Raised flooring from System Floors at a cost of more than Pounds 1.3m, including 2,000 square metres on the first floor in Italian white veined marble and 30,000 square metres of a more basic design on 11 other floors. A designer bar furnished with 100 chairs representing European furniture throughout the century in the style of famous designers including Le Corbusier. Mr Jean-Louis Berthet, founding partner of the firm of architects responsible for the design of the EBRD's headquarters is a prominent figure in French design. He has worked on a number of commissions for Mr Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq, including the interior design of the presidential palace in Baghdad in 1979, the Saddam Hussein International Airport in 1981 and the Council of Ministers building in 1984. The EBRD refused to comment on the way in which the architects were selected, or on other aspects of the costs of refurbishing their headquarters in Broadgate, London, as further details emerged of the high quality materials used. 'We answer to our shareholders and everything has been completed within budget. We have been extraordinarily transparent this week. Enough is enough,' a spokeswoman said last night. Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, wrote the preface to a book about the work of the Berthet-Pochy firm published in the late 1980s by EPA Editions in Paris. He emphasised his belief in the importance of interior design. 'Certain kings of France', he wrote, 'are better known for their chairs than their achievements.'</p>

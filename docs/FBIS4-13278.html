			<p>BFN     [Text] Let us turn to the Middle East. After having  ordered the closure of the occupied territories for 10 days  following the latest round of massacres, the government in  Jerusalem has decided to allow some 20,000 Palestinians involved  in social and humanitarian work to be allowed back in. Prime  Minister Rabin has also announced a plan for the withdrawal of  Israeli troops from the Golan Heights. Our correspondent  Giovanni Bocco interviewed Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres:    [Begin recording] [Bocco, in English, translating his own  question into Italian] The Cairo peace negotiations have  restarted: When do you think an agreement over Gaza and Jericho  will be reached?    [Peres, in English, with correspondent providing Italian  translation] It appears to me that both ourselves and the PLO  are respecting the agreements. I believe that the most  difficult part of the negotiations has been overcome. The  majority of the workload is behind us. If all goes well, then  in two or three weeks time we will leave the Gaza Strip.    [Bocco] The international observers are arriving in Hebron.  There are 35 Italians among these observers: What do you think  about this?    [Peres] I believe that this is an important contribution to  the peace process. The international presence is truly welcome,  at least on our part, because it is important in bringing normal  living conditions to Hebron and for preventing acts of violence.  This welcome extends to the Italian contingent.    [Bocco] What do you think of the arrival of the Palestinian  police force?    [Peres] I think that the Palestinians can and must provide  security measures. They must police themselves. We cannot be  the policemen of the Palestinians who have every right to have  their own security force. We are happy that the police force is  on its way. You cannot imagine how truthful my words are. [end  recording]</p>

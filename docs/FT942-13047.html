			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / BBC close to launching European news service The BBC is close to launching a 24-hour television news and information service to add to its existing channel in continental Europe. Mr Bob Phillis, the BBC deputy director-general, yesterday told a conference organised by Voice of the Listener and Viewer, the pressure group, that he hoped the new channel could be launched by the end of this year. No agreement has been signed but Mr Phillis said talks were under way with a number of potential partners and had made 'significant progress'. The channel is believed to be primarily designed to serve audiences in continental Europe. It would be similar to those brought to Asia, Africa and the Middle East by BBC World Service Television. WSTV will soon be beamed into Japan, and an Arab-language version aimed at the Middle East will begin broadcasting on the Arabsat satellite from the end of June. In the Middle East deal the BBC will be the programme supplier. Mr Phillis, who is also head of the World Service, emphasised that the BBC's editorial control was protected by contract and that if editorial independence were threatened the BBC had the right to terminate the contract. Mr Phillis told the conference that in a more competitive broadcasting world it was the BBC's duty to supplement licence-fee income - so long as commercial activities did not conflict with the corporation's core purpose. He promised that commercial activities would never determine what programmes were to be made. The Voice of the Listener and Viewer yesterday decided to write to Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the chairman of the BBC, expressing dissatisfaction with BBC Radio.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Tory rebels may back pits plan: Policy saving 12-14 coal mines could win backbench support THE GOVERNMENT may be able to secure backbench support for an energy policy which saved well under half the threatened 31 coal pits, it emerged yesterday. A series of telephone interviews with the most likely Tory backbench rebels indicated that, while a wide range of views is held, a plan which spared between 12 and 14 pits would be likely to keep the government out of the danger area. The findings came as delegates at a special conference of the National Union of Mineworkers agreed unanimously to hold a ballot on March 5, in conjunction with rail workers, with a recommendation to stage a 24-hour strike as part of a 'rolling programme' of industrial action. Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said miners were asking the government to accept the logic of their case and keep open all 31 pits. 'There is no logical reason for closing any one of the 31 collieries,' he said. Separately, Mr Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, expressed strong opposition to proposals to enlarge the market for coal by delaying liberalisation of the electricity market next year. Postponement of the plans would mean that regional electricity companies would not have to compete with each other for the custom of about 45,000 medium to large customers. They would thus be more sure of the electricity they could sell and would be able to buy more coal on long-term contracts. A delay is among the most attractive options open to the government, even though it would upset free market supporters on the back benches. Mr Littlechild's opposition is one more complication for the government as it struggles to complete the work for its white paper on energy. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has previously said he would publish the white paper as soon as possible this month but it is unlikely that this will be next week and the last week in the month looks increasingly likely. It is thought that the Department of Trade and Industry has largely decided on the policies it wants to adopt. However, the fine detail is still being worked on and a series of consultations with potential dissident members of parliament, the industries affected and European Community officials is likely before the DTI puts a final plan to the cabinet.

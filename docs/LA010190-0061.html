			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: QUAKE PUT DAMPER ON WORK  </P> <P> For all their pluck, Bay Area workers did not accomplish much in the weeks  after October's massive earthquake.  </P> <P> Companies surveyed by William M. Mercer Meidinger Hansen, a benefits consulting  firm, reported that employees were afraid to commute to their jobs and use  office elevators, easily flew off the handle, had trouble concentrating on work  and were falling asleep in meetings. "Very little work got done," most  employers agreed.  </P> <P> And that just covered the workers who showed up. "At least one employee took  early retirement on the spot, rather than return to work," according to the  Mercer study of 39 companies employing 120,000 Bay Area residents.  </P> <P> While a majority of employers reported signs of emotional distress among their  workers in the three weeks after the Oct. 17 quake, fewer than half had taken  steps to improve workplace safety, upgrade disaster plans or provide employees  information about earthquake preparedness, the study found. One company brought  in a geologist to talk to workers; three arranged direct help for employees hit  hard by quake damage. Only two firms did nothing at all.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planning to Move? Try Malta  </P> <P> The weather may have been rotten, but the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta  still hopes to capitalize on the worldwide publicity it received during the  recent Bush-Gorbachev summit there. And California is the chief target.  </P> <P> "People before were asking, 'Where is Malta?' " said Joseph Vella Bonnici,  manager of investment promotion for the government's Malta Development Corp.  "At least now they know where it is."  </P> <P> To lure foreign investors, Malta offers a package of incentives similar to  those provided by some other European countries, including such goodies as a  10-year tax holiday and reduced tax rates for foreign managers.  </P> <P> The government is most interested in attracting electronics firms, which could  use Malta as a jumping-off point to market in Europe. So Bonnici said the  development agency plans to open a promotion office in California sometime next  year. By then, the image of President Bush trapped aboard a Navy ship for 10  hours by high seas may be forgotten.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Microwave, Mexican Style  </P> <P> When it comes to microwaveable snack food, Mexican-style food is much more  popular than ready-to-eat frozen hamburgers or packaged croissant sandwiches --  especially in California. A recent study by the Los Angeles office of Selling  Areas Marketing Inc. finds that Americans spend 60 cents per capita on frozen  burritos and only 30 cents per capita on frozen hamburgers. However,  Californians spend two to three times the national average on frozen Mexican  food products.  </P> <P> Those reports did not go unnoticed at Four 'n Twenty, the Tustin-based  subsidiary of an Australian company. It began to distribute a two-ounce,  beef-filled pastry called "Aussie Snacks" in April and plans to add a  taco-flavored pastry to its line. The product will be introduced in Los Angeles  and San Francisco early this year, said Craig Lesly, general manager.  </P></p>

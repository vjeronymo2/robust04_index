The five autonomous regions of Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner  Mongolia, Guangxi and Ningxia have taken various measures to  help raise the work level of minority nationality cadres.    Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region in Northwest China has sent  ethnic cadres to coastal developed areas to learn and at the  same time invited technicians and scientists from elsewhere to  give lectures on management and technical know-how. Such  cooperative relations have been set up between cities and  counties of Xinjiang and those in coastal areas.    Since 1980, Tibet autonomous region has held various courses  to train a total of 27,363 cadres of minority nationalities,  72.75 percent of the total of trainees in the region.    Training of county-level leaders has always been stressed in  Tibet.    Each year, Tibet sends ethnic management and technical  leaders for additional study in related universities and  colleges with support from the central government and other  provinces.    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous  Region and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have also achieved  progress in the work.    Inner Mongolia has given special attention to training and  promotion of ethnic cadres of its three autonomous banners  (counties) and over ten autonomous townships.    Guangxi stressed a relationship of mutual respect and help  between local cadres of the Han and other nationalities.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Letter: Britannia Park juror: a complicated case, but not beyond comprehension Sir, It was with interest that I read the letter from Mrs Edna Wijeratna (Letters, March 2) regarding the role of juries in long or complicated fraud trials. As some of your readers may be aware, the UK's longest fraud trial to date, the Britannia Park case, finished in Nottingham recently. I had the (perhaps dubious) honour of sitting on the jury in that trial and feel that I too must now put pen to paper on the issue of trial by jury in this type of case. It was said in an interview on Central Television that, according to the expert concerned, there was no way that our jury (which included local businessmen, and those with some financial knowledge) could have understood all the pertinent facts in the case. This most certainly was not so. We had the benefit of a judge who normally sits in commercial cases and he, together with the prosecution and indeed the defence counsels, made certain that the import of all the financial evidence was made abundantly clear for all of us. We were at times frustrated by the slow progress made on occasion due to points which, while no doubt vital at the time to prosecution or defence, were argued in great detail only to fall by the wayside later on in the proceedings. Surely the point is that our system of justice is based upon trial by one's peers with the decisions based upon those peers' interpretation of what constitutes proper and decent behaviour and or representation? The legal profession does indeed seem to have a distorted notion as to the ability of people 'lesser' than they to comprehend complicated concepts. Surely it can be seen that parallels can sometimes be used to illustrate particularly difficult points in order to retain comprehension? At the end of the day what matters is, surely, that the correct verdict is reached. I am sure that the qualification of 'beyond reasonable doubt' is always met and, of course, allows a benefit to the accused which is central to our legal system.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "HH/wtm": "Fewer Investments in Russia?"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- In view of the latest threats by Russian  right-wing extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, representatives of  German industry have warned against a decreasing willingness to  invest in Russia. The winner of the Russian elections had  threatened with World War III; he talked about stationing  300,000 troops in Germany and about claims to German  compensation payments for damage done in World War II.    The chairman of the East Committee of the German Economy,  Otto Wolff von Amerongen, said: "The new Zhirinovskiy element  will not increase people's willingness to invest." The  Bonn-based Federation of German Chambers of Industry and  Commerce said that "the climate is deteriorating," and this  affects all sectors of industry.    The Federal Government reacted to Zhirinovskiy's threat  quite  calmly. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told DIE WELT that  German-Russian trade relations have "a sound base founded on  mutual interests." They have "proved solid" also in the  difficult times of the Cold War. Rexrodt cannot see  Zhirinovskiy's positions shaking these foundations: "Yeltsin and  the Russian Government still consider a further expansion of  trade relations with the West, and especially with Germany,  their top priority," Rexrodt pointed out. Moscow is well aware  that the industrialized nations and the international financial  institutions must be of first importance in the reform process,  Rexrodt said.    "The economy is not panicking," Karl-Hermann Fink, manager  of  the East Committee of the German Economy, said. He said that  all the long-term projects are continuing.    Within the German gas industry, which buys some 30 percent  of  its supplies from Russia, there is no trace of alarm. Neither  the market leader Ruhrgas in Essen, nor Wintershall Erdgas  Handelshaus GmbH, the German partner of the Russian Gazprom, are  planning any emergency measures.</p>

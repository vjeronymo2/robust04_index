			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 19 May (MTI) -- "In keeping with its  previously declared principles, the Independent Smallholders'  Party [FKGP] will make no election pact with any party calling  for the withdrawal of its individual candidates in favor of  other parties' candidates in the second round of parliamentary  elections from May 8 to 29.    A Smallholder alliance with the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] is out of the question: Smallholders feel that after the  first round (May 8), MDF deputies with seats in parliament from  party lists are closer to the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats  than to the Smallholders.    However, the FKGP is discussing possible long-term  cooperation with the Christian Democrats, FKGP Deputy Chairman  and campaign chief Mrs. Nagy G. Agnes Maczo told reporters in  Budapest on Thursday.</p>

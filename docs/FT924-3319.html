			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Lloyd Webber buys theatre share SIR Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company has acquired a half share in the Adelphi theatre in the Strand, London. The Really Useful Group already owns two other West End Theatres, the Palace and the New London. The present owner of the Adelphi, Mr Jimmy Nederlander, has given up a half share in return for half the profits likely to be generated at the theatre by a new Lloyd Webber musical, Sunset Boulevard, which opens there next summer. It is expected to have a run of at least three years, and generate Mr Nederlander a return of about Pounds 3m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 20 Jun (AFP) -- Former Uruguayan  President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, who leads all surveys  measuring the popularity of the presidential candidates in  November's elections, demanded a "four-year" delay in installing  the Common Market of the South (Mercosur).    "We must be realistic and postpone the implementation of  Mercosur by four years, in order to be able to complete this  stage of transition and then begin a stage of preparation,"  Sanguinetti said during a campaign speech.    According to the former head of state, Argentina, Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay, the four Mercosur member countries, "are  not ready to close an agreement establishing a Common External  Tariff (AEC)," which is an "essential" prerequisite for a common  customs union in the region.    Macroeconomic differences and the diverging objectives of  the  partner nations' productive mechanisms makes it necessary "to  seek accommodation and a balance in all situations" before  materializing a common market in America's Southern Cone,  Sanguinetti warned.    "We must compete among ourselves, but we must do it on an  equal footing, and not before," Sanguinetti added. The remarks  made by Sanguinetti, one of integration's staunchest supporter  during his administration (1985-1990), provoked a commotion in  Uruguay's political and entrepreneurial circles.    Uruguay's Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu disagreed with  Sanguinetti, confirming that "Mercosur is maintaining its  deadlines." "We are committed to implementing the free trade  treaty by 1 January 1995. We are working on it," Abreu said.    Chamber of Industries spokesmen expressed support for the  former president's initiative, and issued a communique stressing  "the urgent need" to postpone the beginning of Mercosur in order  to complete the retooling of existing plants and be able to  successfully compete in a more demanding market.    The deadlines get closer, but the disagreements among member  countries on establishing a common AEC continue, as is shown by  the poor results obtained in Buenos Aires by the four member  countries' economic vice ministers on 17 June. Spokesmen for the  meeting said that the representatives "made a lot of progress,"  but admitted there are still some hurdles to clear before  agreement can be reached on an AEC that will satisfy the four  Mercosur member countries' governments.    Economic analysts consulted by AFP estimated that a free  trade zone could be installed in the region by 1 January 1995,  but ruled out the possibility of having a customs union  consolidating the greatly heralded common market by that date.    Four years ago Argentine President Carlos Menem, Uruguayan  President Luis Alberto Lacalle, then Brazilian President  Fernando Collor de Mello, and then Paraguayan President Andres  Rodriguez signed a treaty in Asuncion committing their countries  to creating a common market in the region by 1995. "We fervently  support our countries' integration," Sanguinetti said. He  demanded, however, "prudence" in the handling of the deadlines  for installing it.</p>

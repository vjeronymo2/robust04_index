			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alfredo Venturi: "Shaky Axis Between Paris and </F> Bonn"]    [Text] Bonn--Is it, or is it not true that during the  unnerving negotiations for the inclusion of Norway in the EU  [European Union], German Minister Klaus Kinkel verbally abused  his Spanish colleague, Javier Solana? Is it, or is it not true  that Bonn's chief diplomat went so far as to use such  undiplomatic expressions as "We will break your back?" Whether  it's true or not, the fact is that Kinkel's strong intervention  to force Madrid to remove its paralyzing reservations to  Norway's inclusion, thus creating the image of Germany as the  leading power of the European Union, provoked French  resentments, and as a consequence a small crisis in  French-German relations. Yesterday, Francois Scheer, French  ambassador to Germany, was called to the Foreign Ministry: an  absolutely unusual step among allied countries and especially  among friendly countries.    This was a step which was preceded on Wednesday [17 March]  by  a front-page article in the influential FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE.  The article talked about the "diffidence" which is taking hold  in Paris against the "enlarged German neighbor." The article  quoted a French source who the day before had given voice to  this diffidence in Bonn. According to that source, the noted  incident of the lack of an invitation to Chancellor Helmut Kohl  to attend the 50-year anniversary celebration of the Allied  landing in Omaha Beach, is to be connected to a much more  general problem: the problem of the foreign policy of the  unified Germany. The French maintain that the German position  on the EU's enlargement, first towards the North and then  towards the East, its intense relations with Russia, and even  the relocation of the government's headquarters to Berlin, are  choices that require clarification. It is necessary that Bonn  confirm its Western orientation. For this reason, which is of  great importance, bilateral consultations must be intensified.    The French source was none other than Ambassador Scheer, and  the occasion for his outburst was an informal chat with a group  of German journalists. The chat was so informal as to allow the  diplomat to express criticism of Kinkel's "personal style," and  even to underscore the good image Rudolf Scharping, leader of  the opposition and Kohl's adversary in the race to the  Chancellery, enjoys in Paris and especially with President  Mitterrand. In short, there was enough to infuriate Kinkel, who  reacted by calling in Scheer.    Now there is an effort to recast the issue. Nevertheless,  there remains the sensation of a deep malaise in relations  between Paris and Bonn which is tied to a changed reality. It  is evident that reunification, which altered the balance of  power between the two countries in favor of the German giant,  has compromised the equilibrium of the Franco-German axis. In  this situation it would be desirable for the Bonn  representatives to pay more attention to their style, resisting  the temptation to pound their fists on the table. On the other  hand, one must be realistic. As a diplomat who was present at  the negotiating marathon said in Kinkel's defense, it was  necessary to pressure the Spaniards so that they would unblock  the accord with Norway, and who better to do that if not the  Germans?</p>

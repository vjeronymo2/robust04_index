			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> City officials want to boost the cost of parking for baseball fans at Anaheim  Stadium by $1 to pay for lot repairs, but the Angels are balking, saying it may  be pushing the cost of going to games too far by going from $3 to $4.  </P> <P> The parking rate increase, if approved, would take effect March 31, city  officials said, when the Angels play the Dodgers in the Freeway Series. The  Angels, who have already increased most ticket prices by $1, may respond today  to the proposal. The team would have to approve any parking changes made by  Anaheim.  </P></p>

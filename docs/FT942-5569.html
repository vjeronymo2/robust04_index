			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Royal Bank of Canada ahead 12% The Royal Bank of Canada has attributed a a 12 per cent gain in second-quarter profit to strengths in retail and investment banking and the contribution from Royal Trust, acquired last September. The bank, Canada's biggest, said net profit advanced to CDollars 273m (USDollars 196.9m), or 74 cents a share, up from CDollars 243m, or 64 cents, a year earlier. Total assets at April 13 stood at CDollars 168bn, compared with CDollars 143bn. Return on average assets was 0.67 per cent, against 0.72 per cent last time. The 1993 period did not include Royal Trust. Return on equity was 16.1 per cent, up from 13.7 per cent. Mr Allan Taylor, chairman, said loan quality was improving, costs were being reduced, and Royal Trust operations were being integrated quickly. By June 30, the Royal Trust network will have been reduced by 41 units to a total of 101. Net interest income at the bank itself was 2.87 per cent of average assets, against 3.09 per cent a year earlier. Other income was up 33 per cent, with strong brokerage, investment banking and money management results. Royal Trust's contribution was CDollars 84m. Non-interest expense dipped 2 per cent and total payroll was down 5 per cent. Provision for credit losses was CDollars 205m, up slightly, and the total fiscal 1994 provision is forecast at CDollars 820m, down from CDollars 1.75bn. Total non-performing loans were CDollars 5.8bn at April 30, down 24 per cent. The reduction was due partly to the fact that Brazilian debt now has performing status. First-half net profit rose to CDollars 573m, or CDollars 1.56 a share, up from CDollars 497m, or CDollars 1.35, a year earlier. Return on assets was 0.70 per cent, against 0.72 per cent, and on equity 17 per cent compared with 14.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] For Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, a  strong advocate of free trade, the provisions of Asean Free  Trade Area (Afta) are already outdated.    Speaking at an Afta conference at the United Nations  building  in Bangkok yesterday, Suphachai told hundreds of influential  Asean economists that "the Afta agreement should be modified".    He said he was not satisfied with Afta, both in terms of its  long timespan, its limited range of products and its restrictive  regulation for new membership.    The "Afta and Beyond: An Asean Perspective" seminar was  jointly organized by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia  and the Pacific (Escap), the Thailand Development Research  Institute (TDRI) and Queen's University, Canada.    Suphachai viewed Afta as an attempt by the Asean Six to  consolidate their bargaining position -- amidst a feeling of  "grim hope" about the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade talks -- by reaching a regional free trade  agreement. "(But) as the Round has successfully been concluded,  the (original Afta) requirements might not be well suited to  1994," he said.    Suphachai, who represented Thailand at the latest Asean  informal economic ministerial meeting in Malaysia earlier this  month, said he was disappointed with Afta's slow progress. The  Asean economic ministers had met on an informal basis to speed  up the Afta process and Suphachai had hoped to push through a  shorter timeframe.    However the Asean ministers missed the opportunity to  announce a new Afta time-frame, even though it had been widely  speculated that the deadline would be reduced from 2008 to 2003.  A statement from the meeting said the Asean ministers simply  agreed that senior officials would review "the implementation of  Afta".    "But (they did not) agree on a particular year," Suphachai  said.    Asean leaders agreed last year to cut tariffs on Asean  manufactured goods to 0 to 5 per cent over a 15 year period.  Suphachai, though, insisted that "the Afta time-frame should be  shorter (because) the period is too long compared to Gatt and  Nafta".    The members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (Gatt) agreed last month in Marrakech to cut tariffs on  manufactured goods by one-third over a 10-year period.    Moreover, the range of commodities that fall into the Afta  tariff cut basket should be expanded, especially to include farm  goods. Non-processed farm products are excluded from the Afta  tariff cut requirement.    "This may be no longer appropriate," Suphachai said, citing  Gatt and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta)  requirements where the tariffs on farm goods would have to be  cut over specific timeframes.    If Asean continues to ignore the farm sector in its regional  free trade plan, "it might jeopardize Asean attempts to become a  leader in farm trade at the World Trade Organization (which  supersedes Gatt next year)", Suphachai said.    On expanding Afta's membership, Suphachai recalled his  "bitter" experience in unsuccessfully persuading his  counterparts to accept Australia and New Zealand as new partners.    "Asean ministers agreed to discuss the linkage between other  regional groupings with Afta, but they avoided naming names,"  Suphachai said.    Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating stated a clear  intention to join Afta during his recent visit to Bangkok. But  Malaysia's International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah  Aziz has strongly opposed the move.    "Asean is not a free-for-all organization," she was quoted  as  saying.    Without referring to Australia, Suphachai expressed  disappointment at the Malaysian minister's stance. "It's rather  ironic," he said. "The trend is that Asean is trying to  persuade some of its neighbours that they are not ready to join  Afta, but ignores other countries that are."    Some experts view Afta with scepticism. On the meeting's  panel yesterday, Richard G Harris, from Simon Fraser University,  Canada, questioned how much could Asean have done to open up the  regional free trade area, as the grouping has to overcome  factors which have been its engine behind a flourishing growth  rate of Asean exports in the last decade -- or "export-oriented  protectionism" to support export promotion policies.    He said the economies of many highly successful East Asian  countries were and continue to be protectionist, although at  considerably lower levels than before, domestic markets for  finished consumption goods are rather heavily protected.  Intermediate products and basic industrial raw materials, such  as steel and petro-chemicals, are also quite heavily protected,  with capital goods less so.    Although the protection measures have succeeded in promoting  rapid growth of manufactured export products, it has led to a  relatively peculiar structure of export production.    "This pattern has meant, among other things, that the direct  contribution of exports to economic growth has been quite small.  In Thailand, for instance, the aggregate contribution of  exports to economic growth declined in the later 1980's and  early 1990's due to the high cost of exports," he said.    Moreover, local exporters preferred to have a high local  content requirement to avoid direct competition with foreign  companies. "This has led to protectionism and created the  artificial structure of export production." Dr Narongchai  Akrasani, the Afta architect, however, suggested Asean can  achieve the free trade by working hard on its own regional free  trade area.    "(But) we will not have the free trade area under the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation or under the World Trade  Organization in the year 2010," he felt.    Due to strong internal political pressures, more powerful  countries cannot support free trade at a global level, no matter  what they have said, Narongchai claimed.    As such, Asean should achieve a free trade area by itself  with Afta, he said.</p>

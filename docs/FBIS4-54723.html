			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 3 May (MTI) -- "Over the past few weeks,  Hungarian Television has hurled a plethora of slanders at me and  used patently false witnesses for the purpose," Hungarian  Socialist Party (HSP) Chairman Gyula Horn said in a statement  sent to MTI today. "I will confirm again that I did not beat  anyone and committed no illegal acts, either during or after  1956. I stand before the electorate with a clear conscience,"  he said.    HSP Chairman Horn said he has established that the bulk of  the blame for the mud-slinging campaign against himself and the  HSP lies with the government that exercises control over  Hungarian Television, and with the senior politicians and  parties of the governing coalition.    The document states that the Socialists do not wish to apply  unworthy means to succeed; on the contrary, they seek national  reconciliation. It goes on to say that should the electorate  put their confidence in the Socialists, they will make every  effort to ensure that the change in government takes place in  keeping with European standards.    HSP Acting Deputy President Imre Szekeres said that over the  past few weeks Hungarian Television aired incredibly spiteful  statements and that this practice must be brought to a halt.  The party has resolutely protested even before this time, and  now Horn has called for a greater deal of calm and fair-play,  Szekeres said.</p>

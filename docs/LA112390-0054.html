			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Legal Eagles: So what's the deal with "L.A. Law's" Arnie Becker and Roxanne?  Will the sleazy-but-lovable divorce attorney and his long-suffering secretary  on the NBC series ever get together? Susan Ruttan, who plays Roxanne, says she  and co-star Corbin Bernsen wonder, too. "We fantasize that in the very last  episode, in the very last year, he'll look at Roxanne and say, 'Oh my gawd,  it's been you all along!' " Ruttan said this week on her own honeymoon in  Honolulu. "And she'll go, 'Bleah!' " Ruttan is in Hawaii with her husband of  three weeks, sound technician and artist Randy McDonald. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

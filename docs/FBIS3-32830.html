			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, Constituent Democratic  Congress [CCD] vice president, has expressed his opposition to  the U.S. pronouncement on the bill transferring the La Cantuta  case to military jurisdiction. He added the U.S. participation  as part of the support group has not been confirmed yet.    [Begin recording] [Torres y Torres] CCD congressmen are not  stating the Peruvian Government's official position. In this  specific case I have expressed an opinion as an independent  congressman and now as CCD president. [sentence as heard] The  country's position is taken by the president of the Republic and  the Foreign Ministry, however.    [Unidentified reporter] Has the United States in any way  confirmed its participation in the support group?    [Torres y Torres] Nothing has been stated yet regarding  support being suspended or anything of the sort, just the U.S.  concern on this issue. We have agreed on the need to wait a few  more days or weeks so this chapter related to the La Cantuta  issue can be played out by events to come. Concerning La  Cantuta, we at Congress expect an effective pronouncement, a  just and exemplary sentence, and we expect it will complete the  outlook of to what we have been referring. We expect that  resolution will take place very soon. [end recording]</p>

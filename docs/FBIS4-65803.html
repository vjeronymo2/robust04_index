			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social </F> Democratic Party, by unidentified reporter in the studio -- live]    [Text] [Reporter] What does the Social Democratic Party  [SPD] expect of Roman Herzog as the new German president?    [Scharping] We hope Roman Herzog will carry out his duties  as  excellently as Richard von Weizsaecker did. But that will  remain a hope for the time being. The first speech by Roman  Herzog did not suggest this. There were many things he should  have said and did not.    [Reporter] What do you mean by that?    [Scharping] Well, no one will contradict him when Roman  Herzog says he supports a tolerant, peace-loving Germany that is  open to the world. But, you have to choose the appropriate  words to do so, and also relate it to the conditions as they are  in Germany -- high unemployment, the economic and social worries  many people have, the justified concern that we are jeopardizing  the basis of our existence too much. And, also, I think right  now we have to give a clear signal in Germany that extremism,  and violent right-wing extremism in particular, has no chance.  And I hope the European elections on 12 June will give this  signal. Unfortunately, Roman Herzog did not give this signal.  I am not saying that he is not thinking this, but he did not  say it.    [Reporter] In his first speech, Roman Herzog said that he  wants to represent Germany as Germany really is -- easy-going.  What does that mean to you?    [Scharping] I also asked myself that.    [Reporter] In a first reaction, Chancellor Helmut Kohl  described the election of Roman Herzog as a good omen for the  Bundestag elections and said: We will sow the seeds in April  and May, and in October we will bring in the harvest. What's  your view on this? Has a preliminary decision been made?    [Scharping] Even the vegetable growers in the Palatinate  region and in Oggersheim [Kohl's home town] tell me it is right  that the cabbage should be harvested in the autumn.    The chancellor's statement also confirmed that this election  was purely to do with holding onto power. And that influenced  the decision much too strongly. If the Federal Assembly had  been sovereign enough to support the visible wish of the  majority of the population and to support the particularly high  respect for Johannes Rau -- his great popularity right across  Germany, right across all social and political groups -- then we  would have had a different result.    But, a legitimate decision was made. The Free Democratic  Party [FDP] surrendered itself totally to Kohl's interest in  holding onto power. And one thing is crystal clear now: Anyone  who is conservative in Germany votes Christian Democratic Union  [CDU] and anyone who has a social or liberal point of view,  votes for the SPD. After the way it behaved, the FDP is no  longer needed in this set up.    [Reporter] So do you consider the FDP vote for Herzog as a  rejection of what in terms of numbers could have been a possible  social-liberal coalition?    [Scharping] I noted with concern that Mr. Kinkel said that  coalition considerations were the reasons why it was necessary  to hold the test vote in his Federal Assembly group to get a  majority together, and I also noted the comment by Roman Herzog.  Overall, this is not a good advertisement for liberalism but  for the wish, whatever the cost, to retain power. That is not  the FDP which we got to know as a liberal party, and, in this  respect Mr. Kinkel is taking an unusually difficult path for  himself and his party. But that is his responsibility and I do  not have to worry about that.    [Reporter] Will the consequence be that you will seek to  move  closer to the Greens with a view to the elections in October?    [Scharping] No. There is only one conclusion we draw from  the presidential election and that is that a change in political  leadership in Germany, which is urgently necessary, can only be  achieved with the Social Democrats. And we will fight for this.  The Federal Assembly made a decision on the basis of majority  decisions mainly from 1990. The people will be able to make  their first decision on 12 June [European elections]. We are  appealing to all social and liberal and reasonable people in  Germany to show what they think of the three rounds of voting in  Berlin in the fourth round of voting.    [Reporter] Mr. Scharping, in retrospect was it not a  mistake by the SPD to nominate Minister President Rau? Would it  have been better to nominate an eastern German, such as Richard  Schroeder?    [Scharping] If you look at the way that Mr. Kohl dealt with  Mr. Heitmann, who did not even qualify for membership of the  Federal Assembly, then you will soon recognize that Helmut Kohl  has always played a tactical game with the office. First he  proposed Johannes Rau. Then he brought into play the  considerations which he cited and a few more things up to and  including Mr. Heitmann. I think that the office of federal  president has not deserved this handling characterized by power  tactics.    [Reporter] Nevertheless, would it not have been appropriate  to place an eastern German at the head of our state and to give  him an opportunity bearing in mind that all the other posts have  been occupied by western Germans to date?    [Scharping] In my view, the best person we have belongs at  the head of our state and particularly in the office of federal  president, and that person was clearly Johannes Rau.    [Reporter] You have said that if the majority of the  population had an opportunity to elect the federal president  directly, Johannes Rau would probably have been elected and not  Roman Herzog. Do you now seriously want to seek an amendment to  the constitution in favor of direct election of the federal  president?    [Scharping] We are certainly seeking to clearly broaden the  public's opportunity to take part in political decisionmaking  and possibly in the election of the federal president. We have  made these proposals within the constitutional affairs  commission which has been dealing with reforms to the Basic Law.  In my personal view, the whole process of reforming the Basic  Law has progressed in a rather regrettable manner. All the  initiatives from the civil rights movement of the collapsed GDR  have not been adopted, including the possibility of a petition  for a referendum or referendums themselves. We shall continue  to pursue this with the aim of increasing the direct  opportunities for the public to take part in political decisions.    [Reporter] Can I put the question to you again: Do you want  to seek the direct election of the federal president, yes or no?    [Scharping] Against the background of this decision I do not  want to put this up for discussion, because that looks  immediately as if we are looking for a new procedure in a huff.  However, I would like to point out that the present federal  president, who enjoys great respect and recognition in the SPD,  has raised the question of whether the procedure is the correct  one if the members of the Federal Assembly make a decision  ignoring the recognizable will of the majority of the public.  This is a matter which has been raised by Richard von  Weizsaecker.    [Reporter] But was it not the oldest member of the Federal  Assembly, 93-year-old Josef Felder, from the SPD, who warned  against a direct election during the election. He spoke of the  dangers that a populist might be elected as head of state. How  seriously do you take such an argument?    [Scharping] This is a serious consideration and therefore I  would not like to shoot from the hip in the heat of the moment  on this issue. It has to be weighed up very carefully and we  have about four years in which to do this.    [Reporter] Mr. Scharping, you have made forecasts in recent  elections. The SPD has remained the same, the CDU/CSU have  caught up a bit. There is a difference of just one point  between the two major parties. Nonetheless you have managed to  increase your personal lead over Helmut Kohl. Do you have  difficulties passing on the popularity which you enjoy to your  party?    [Scharping] No, the SPD is making headway and you will see  this on 12 June.</p>

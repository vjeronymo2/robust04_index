Milan  Milanovic Thursday warned UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] of  possible undesirable consequences if parts of Russian and  Belgian battalions leave the eastern UNPA [UN protected areas]  sector for Sarajevo.    If that happens, Milanovic warned Commander Jean Cot, the  situation in eastern Slavonia, Baranja and western Srem will be  very difficult as no one will be left to ensure the  disengagement of the R.S.K. (Serb state in Croatia) forces and  the Croatian Army, which was precisely the reason why the two  battalions had come to the eastern sector.    It could also happen that the population will prevent the  departure of U.N. troops, Milanovic said, adding he also  believed it would be better if they remained where they are now.    The UNPROFOR commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina British  General  Sir Michael Rose has asked for additional 3,000 troops to  control the demilitarization of the 20 km exclusion zone around  Sarajevo, capital of the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, neighboring on the eastern UNPA sector.    According to the eastern sector information service, French  General Cot, whose headquarters are based in Croatia's capital  Zagreb, is expected to arrive in Erdut on March 1 for a farewell  visit to the area before handing over his duties to a successor.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 22, 1994, respondent submitted clarifications regarding its response to section C of the Department's questionnaire regarding U.S. sales. Respondent requested that the Department consider backup calculations for reported ocean freight charges, and U.S. short-term interest rates. In this submission, Fuji also provided clarification concerning certain Fuji-Hunt (a U.S. entity related to Fuji) delivery expenses and certain Fuji-Hunt indirect selling expenses. This submission was received too late to be used for purposes of the preliminary determination; however, we will consider this submission in our final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on information submitted by respondent, we reclassified a certain movement expense as revenue, and added it to the U.S. gross unit price. We added, where appropriate, freight revenue to the U.S. gross price, before adjusting for freight costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates, and the following movement charges: foreign brokerage, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling, U.S. broker's commission, U.S. duty, and several U.S. inland freight charges including inland freight insurance. For certain inland freight charges applicable to sales made through Fuji-Hunt, as minor charge-specific best information available (BIA), the Department increased the reported charges to account for missing values. Additionally, we deducted commissions and direct selling expenses which include advertising, credit expenses, and a combination of promotional expenses which constitute other direct selling expenses. We recalculated U.S. imputed credit using the reported dates of shipment and payment because the amounts reported by the respondent did not consistently reflect the method described in the questionnaire response. We then adjusted the U.S. price for additional product preparation performed by certain parties after exportation. The preparation performed by certain parties was treated as a component of total packing costs which were deducted from USP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also deducted indirect selling expenses which include those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-USA (Fuji's principal related U.S. entity) incurred in its general sales activities, those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-Hunt incurred in its sales and marketing activities, foreign and U.S. pre-sale warehousing expenses, inventory carrying costs, premiums for product liability insurance, and indirect selling expenses incurred in Japan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are accepting respondent's treatment of Fuji-USA's commissions paid to an unrelated party and Fuji-Hunt's commissions as direct selling expenses and commissions paid to Fuji-USA's employees as indirect selling expenses pending the receipt of additional information to be used for the final determination. We treated all advertising costs as direct selling expenses because respondent reported that all advertising is directed at their customers' customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We made an adjustment to U.S. price for the consumption tax paid on the comparison sales in Japan. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), the Court of International Trade (CIT) prohibited us from applying a purely tax-neutral margin calculation methodology. Accordingly, we made our tax methodology conform to the instructions of the CIT, and adjusted U.S. price for taxes by multiplying the home market tax rate by the price of the U.S. merchandise at the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous to the point in the home market chain of commerce at which the foreign government applies the home market consumption tax.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this investigation, the tax levied on the subject merchandise in the home market is three percent. We calculated the appropriate tax adjustment to be three percent of the price of the U.S. merchandise net of discounts reflected on the invoice at the time of sale (which, in this case, is the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous to the point in the home market chain of commerce at which the foreign government applies the home market consumption tax). We then added this amount to the U.S. price. We also calculated the amount of the tax adjustment that was due solely to the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from the price to calculate USP (i.e., three percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses and charges that were deducted from the price of the U.S. merchandise). We deducted this amount after all other additions and deductions had been made. By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the creation of a dumping margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department instructed respondent to report by April, 1, 1994, a revised sales listing for sales of further manufactured merchandise. Since respondent will submit this sales information too late to be included in our preliminary analysis, and because respondent's first submission was too deficient to use for purposes of this preliminary determination, we have not included further manufacturing sales in our analysis (see March 24, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV. We found that the home market was viable for sales of CNPP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department excluded from its analysis certain sales of control paper, hobby paper, crystal paper, and softech paper, because these sales were made outside of the ordinary course of trade due to the nature of the products and were made in insignificant quantities. We omitted error entries and inventory adjustment entries because these entries are not sales of CNPP, and because respondent did not directly tie these entries to the relevant sales in the CNPP database. Additionally, we dropped cancellation transactions from the sales database, as respondent has stated that it cannot identify the original transaction to which a specific cancellation entry applies. We also excluded certain low-priced sales of CNPP because, despite a specific request to do so, respondent did not adequately explain the nature of, or circumstances surrounding, these low-priced sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: The case for an international adviser Sir, Your leader ('The new consensus', April 20 ) spots the irony in the announcement on the same day last week of Sir Terence Burns' promotion from chief economic adviser to permanent secretary to the Treasury, with news of a record rise in unemployment and an accelerating fall in industrial production. Later you support the need for some sort of National Economic Assessment - while your Job in the News article below the leader sought a bright, pragmatic economist for Sir Terence's old job. Following the failures in economic management in the 1980s, perhaps you should have gone further. Fiscal policy is now on auto-pilot and monetary policy is dictated by exchange rate considerations. British economic prospects depend largely on what is happening to the rest of the world. The Treasury no longer uses macro-economic forecasts to steer the economy. Nor does it produce reliable forecasts for others. This job, and the National Assessment, should be handed over to independent well-financed economic research institutes. The Treasury's forecasting errors for the British economy are well known. But it is possibly worse at predicting international economic prospects on which our future now rests. The 1990 budget forecasts, for example, predicted that the US current account deficit and the Japanese surplus would increase while the large German surplus, despite unification, would remain broadly unchanged. This suggests that Sir Terence's old post, as chief economic adviser, might also be abolished. Instead, the government should appoint an international economic adviser, so as to be better informed on what is going on in the rest of the world. Moreover, in looking for candidates, it should consider an American, German, French or even a Japanese. Brian Reading, 83 Shakespeare Tower, Barbican, EC2</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Short-dated Treasuries steady despite auction Short-dated US Treasury bonds held steady yesterday even though an afternoon supply auction generated better demand than expected. The long end gave back some of the previous session's gains. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/32 lower at 85 25/32 , with the yield rising to 7.537 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/32 firmer at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.084 per cent. In the early hours, uncertainty surrounding the Treasury's sale of Dollars 17.25bn in new two-year securities kept activity across the board to a minimum. Prospects for a smooth sale were complicated by the threat of an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates. Traders said the issue would not prove attractive unless it was awarded with a 6.25 per cent yield, well above current levels. In the event, the notes were awarded at 6.17 per cent as the auction drew reasonable interest from retail buyers. But the sale's success failed to give the market much of a lift. The day's economic news had no discernible impact, although it provided further support for a scenario which sees the Fed delaying its next move to tighter credit. The Conference Board, an industry group, said its July index of consumer confidence came in at 91.6, a slight decline from June's level of 92.5, but analysts were already counting on a dip in the reading. With the two-year notes out of the way, the market's next hurdle is the sale of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes this afternoon. The Treasury's quarterly refunding operation is scheduled for early August. European government bonds ended yesterday's session slightly weaker, weighed down by the prospect of new supply in several markets and by the softer tone in the US. Once again, most of the activity took place in the futures pits. With many players away on their summer holiday, futures volume has shrunk significantly, which means that even fairly small transactions can sometimes move prices substantially. Italian bonds posted the sharpest losses of the day, plagued by worries that the judicial investigation into Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's holding company Fininvest could trigger another political crisis. Political jitters triggered a sharp slide in the futures market towards the close. In after-hours trading on Liffe, the September BTP future was down about 1.38 points at 102.60. Further weighing on the market's mood is the prospect of L7,000bn of new supply late this week and next Monday. 'The total amount sounds relatively small, but there are no bonds maturing,' so the authorities need to raise new money, said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg Securities. UK gilts shed nearly half a point, weighed down by the latest CBI report (showing manufacturing output growing rapidly), selling ahead of today's gilt auction and weaker continental European markets. The Bank of England today is due to issue Pounds 2bn of 6.25 per cent gilts due 2010 - the first time since January that it is issuing a long-dated conventional stock. While there was not much evidence of strong retail interest, some traders said they expected demand from UK funds with long-dated liabilities and some overseas investors seeking exposure to sterling assets as the currency has stabilised at a lower level. German bunds ended slightly weaker on thin volume as traders awaited today's auction of 6.25 per cent five-year notes for the Treuhandanstalt, Germany's privatisation agency. Traders reported scant retail demand for the deal, which is expected to total around DM4bn - 5bn. The September bund future on Liffe slipped by 0.25 points to 93.69. French bonds again slightly outperformed Germany as foreign buying continued, especially in the futures pits. The September notional government contract on Matif rose by 0.16 points to 117.78.</p>

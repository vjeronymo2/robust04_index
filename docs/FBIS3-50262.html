			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Serbian Court of Prishtina District is expected  to begin the trial of 19 Albanians who are charged with  allegedly creating the organizations "National Movement for the  Republic of Kosova" and "National Movement for the Liberation of  Kosova." They are also charged with hostile activity in  infringing the territorial integrity.    The trial has been postponed four times so far. Such trials,  more of which are expected to be trumped-up in the future, aim  to frighten Albanians and encourage them to leave Kosova.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TROUBLED CHINA NEEDS DEMOCRACY  </P> <P> Near the main gates of the Nanjing University campus, hundreds of people have  crowded each day to read posters pasted over blackboards that normally announce  the day's events. Since the death of Hu Yaobang, regarded by many as a  spokesperson for democracy until his ouster from the Central Committee in 1987  after student demonstrations, students throughout China have erected their own  democracy walls.  </P> <P> The posters, generally written in hasty Chinese calligraphy, express varying  political sentiments. Some of the posters have altered the text of classical  Chinese poetry, giving the words a more relevant meaning. Others rewrite  political slogans: Sun Yat Sen's famous saying -- "If the revolution is not  successful, we must struggle again!" -- has been transformed into "If the  reforms are not successful, we must struggle again!" This refers to the fact  that the Communist Party has begun to backtrack on the political reforms that  it has implemented over the past 10 years.  </P> <P> Posters that criticize Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping have been quickly torn down  by plainclothes public security agents. Some of the posters say that China  needs more "openness," referring to glasnost and the reforms of Mikhail S.  Gorbachev in the Soviet Union. Most of the posters call for more democracy: "Hu  Yaobang is dead; but democracy is not"; "The Chinese do not fear to live, why  should they fear to die?" and "We want democracy now!"  </P> <P> China is in deep trouble. The Communist Party retrenchment is aimed at  fostering centralization, controlling provincial governments, slowing down the  overheated economy and squashing the demand for political reforms. Not enough  progress has been made to release political prisoners, to compromise with the  Dalai Lama over Tibetan autonomy and to end the state of animosity that exists  between the mainland and Taiwan. There have been essentially two responses to  China's crisis. One is called the "new authoritarianism." The other is the  "pro-democracy" movement.  </P> <P> New authoritarianism has been favored by Communist Party General Secretary Zhao  Ziyang in his call for a "new authority" to get the country rolling again by  establishing a pure market economy led by a new class of technocratic  entrepreneurs. The new authoritarians argue that China should emulate countries  such as South Korea, Brazil and, ironically, Taiwan to deal with China's  tremendous problems: the inability to compete on the world market, its lack of  advanced technology, its overpopulation, as well as the problems created by  political and social dissent. The example countries, it is argued, were able to  develop because of iron discipline and the repression of democratic sentiment.  As uneducated peasants cannot comprehend the issues of population control or  democracy, a strong, uncorruptable elite must bring the population bomb under  control and make China capable of competing economically and militarily with  the West and Japan.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the pro-democracy movement argues that the only way to  resolve China's tremendous difficulties is to expand, not retract, steps toward  freedom of speech and assembly, freedom of movement, accountability of  government through open and free elections and the non-discriminatory  implementation of laws through an independent judiciary and a system of checks  and balances. China's severe population problems can be handled by mor  intensive efforts in general and sex education. Its economic problems can be  dealt with by greater economic liberalism, involving a mix of public managers,  private entrepreneurs and worker's cooperatives with shared ownership and  control.  </P> <P> China does not need to militarize. As Fang Lizhi, the pro-democracy spokesman  and astrophysicist, argues, China should call for the mutual renunciation of  force as a means to settle its dispute with Taiwan. Additionally, China's claim  to Taiwan, its naval and nuclear-weapons buildup and its arms sales abroad can  only further militarize the situation in Asia, impelling Japan, India and other  states to augment their naval and military capabilities -- a situation no one  in Asia wants to see.  </P> <P> The new authoritarian claim that China lacks a democratic tradition is  historically inaccurate. The fledgling movement for democracy was initiated  between 1905-14, but unfortunately failed as China went into the period of "war  lords." While both the movement for democracy and the new authoritarians  believe that the formation of a new middle and entrepreneurial class should be  encouraged, such a class must not be able to take the law into its own hands,  as implied by the new authoritarians. Thus, to prevent such a class from ruling  "from above," the movement for democracy must carefully interact with and  educate grass-roots Chinese society to understand the process, principles and  structures of democracy. It should study the strides taken by Chinese democracy  in the past, and attempt to enlarge upon some of those successes and, of  course, seek to avoid similar mistakes.  </P> <P> Without democratic accountability, the "new authoritarianism" differs very  little from its Maoist predecessor. It's time to give Chinese democracy a  chance.  </P></p>

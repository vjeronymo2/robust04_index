			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Finland to meet 90% of STS-Bank losses THE Finnish government has agreed to shoulder 90 per cent of losses arising from the FM3.4bn (Dollars 630m) portfolio of non-performing loans held by STS-Bank, resolving an issue outstanding since Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's leading commercial bank, took over STS last November in the wake of the country's banking crisis. The Government Guarantee Fund, the body handling the state's bank rescue operation, said yesterday the STS bad assets would be concentrated in a so-called 'bad bank' named Siltapankki which KOP will manage. However, KOP will be responsible only for 10 per cent of any losses incurred on the loans. In addition, the guarantee fund will for the time being assume full responsibility for STS loans to Co-operative Eka Corporation and Haka Oy, two closely linked co-operative industrial groups which have had the right to take deposits from the public.</p>

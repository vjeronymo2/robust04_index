			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Aspin orders military support to the Adriatic Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, has ordered 30 ground attack and 10 support aircraft to the Adriatic to spearhead Nato's plan to provide aerial protection for United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia, writes George Graham in Washington. According to the Pentagon they will include A-10 ground attack aircraft, F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and AC-130s, a gunship version of the C-130 transport. France, the Netherlands and Britain are also sending aircraft to take part in the Nato air umbrella. Nato this week approved the mission from July 22, but plans have been referred to the UN for approval and a decision on timing.</p>

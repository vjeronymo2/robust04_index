			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pelican achieves near threefold rise to Pounds 2.5m Pelican Group, the highly acquisitive USM-quoted restaurant operator, yesterday revealed a close to threefold increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 908,000 to Pounds 2.51m for the year to March 31. Organic growth came primarily from the rapid expansion of the Cafe Rouge chain, which now has 20 outlets within Greater London. Four more sites are currently under development and others are under negotiation. Pelican also benefited from the acquisitions of three other chains last year, Yankee Noodle, Jim Thompsons Spice Island Trading, and US restaurant operator Cafe Tu Tu Tango. Overall, Pelican now operates 47 restaurants, compared with just 15 in May 1993. Turnover more than doubled in the year to Pounds 16.47m (Pounds 8.08m), and it will show substantial growth in the current year following the Pounds 11.5m acquisition last April of 16 restaurants from Forte, including the Dome cafes. In addition, it has just signed an agreement enabling Granada to set up diners at its 23 motorway service stations under Pelican's Rock Island Diner brand name. Pelican will receive a share of turnover, and the first restaurant, in Tamworth, Staffordshire, should open at the end of July. Operating margins improved slightly to 16 per cent, but Mr Roger Myers, chairman, said Pelican aimed to maintain margins, and use the improved cost efficiency of the enlarged group to boost the restaurants' competitiveness. During the current year Mr Myers said Pelican would focus on completing the expansion of the Cafe Rouge and Dome chains in Greater London. Next year it plans to take its first steps in expanding beyond the M25, moving into southern England. Pelican is proposing to lift the single final dividend by 14 per cent to 1.25p (1.1p). Earnings per share rose by 22.5 per cent to 4.9p (4p). The shares closed 2p higher at 91p.</p>

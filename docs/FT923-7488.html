			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Mean streets It may be that tomorrow's official retail sales figures for July will counter some of the latest Confederation of British Industry gloom. But there is little in Argos's results to suggest that life in the high street is getting any easier. Like for like sales at the catalogue retailer are still falling, albeit at a reducing rate, and the company is guarded about its view of trading prospects. With a disciplined company such as Argos having to sweat hard to offset cost increases with productivity gains, the message for weaker stores is clear. The severity of conditions is underlined by the new, keenly-priced Argos catalogue. While the company hopes to offset low prices by better-targeted marketing, any repeat of last year's pre-Christmas price war could force up advertising costs and cut profits. Losses for the year at the Chesterman furniture retailing operation are likely to be Pounds 4.5m - higher than previously expected - and reflect the woes of selling anything to do with housing. That said, Argos's operations have proved resilient since the demerger from BAT. The company has also retained the good habit of throwing off cash. True, the bullish case that Argos was immune from recession has tarnished, but then the shares have already lost their premium rating to the sector. The issue now turns on management's strategic grip. Will the plan of expanding from 300 to 500 catalogue stores at the same time as diversifying into furniture retailing generate the profits growth the market wants to see? Market research suggested Chesterman would work, but so far the results have been disappointing. It would help investors believe the overall strategy if management could make a good fist of Chesterman.</p>

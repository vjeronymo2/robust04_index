			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  also apply to major stationary sources of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 that become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 20, 1993 (at 58 FR 66326), EPA announced its intention to take two separate actions with two independent public comment periods on the SIP revisions submitted by the State of Colorado to satisfy the moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area SIP requirements due November 15, 1991 for the Denver PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area. One proposed action was to grant conditional approval of the SIP revisions due to the State's need to fulfill a final commitment to revise permit limitations at two stationary sources (Purina Mills, and Electron Corporation) prior to December 1, 1993. EPA will take action on the conditional approval at a later date. The second proposed action was to limitedly approve the control measures, excluding the permit limits for Purina Mills and Electron Corporation, contained in the SIP revisions for the limited purpose of strengthening the federally enforceable SIP for Colorado. In the proposed rulemaking actions and related Technical Support Document (TSD), EPA described in detail its interpretations of the Act and its rationale for proposing to approve the control measures for their limited purpose in strengthening the federally approved implementation plan for Denver, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal related to the limited approval (please reference 58 FR 66326). EPA received no comments during the public comment period regarding the proposed limited approval. This final action on the limited approval of the control measures in the Denver moderate nonattainment area PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP revisions is unchanged from the December 20, 1993, proposed approval action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred to the December 20, 1993, proposed rule for a more in-depth discussion of the action now being finalized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA did not receive any public comments regarding its December 20, 1993, proposed limited approval of the Denver moderate nonattainment area PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP control measures. (58 FR 66326&hyph;66334).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. This Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). The Governor of Colorado submitted the Denver PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP revision in a letter dated June 7, 1993. That submittal and subsequent submittals made on September 3, 1993, and October 20, 1993, fulfilled commitments made on June 7, 1993, were intended to satisfy those moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP requirements due for Denver on November 15, 1991. As described in EPA's proposed action on this SIP (58 FR 66326&hyph;66334, December 20, 1993), the Denver June 7, 1993, moderate nonattainment area PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  plan and subsequent submittals include control measures. EPA may grant a ``limited'' approval of SIP requirements under section 110(k)(3) of the Act in light of the general authority delegated to EPA under section 301(a) of the Act which allows EPA to take actions necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act. EPA is granting a final limited approval of the referenced PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control measures for Denver because they strengthen the SIP by advancing the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  air quality protection goal of the Act. Federal approval of the control measures makes them federally-enforceable. However, this limited approval is not approving those measures as satisfying the RACM requirement or any other specific requirement of the Act, nor does it constitute full approval of the SIP pursuant to section 110(k)(3). Please refer to EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 66326) and the TSD for that action for a more detailed discussion on control measures contained in the Denver plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NICHOLS INSTITUTE TO JOIN IN TEXAS LABORATORY VENTURE  </P> <P> Striving for further geographic expansion of its medical laboratory network,  Nichols Institute said Wednesday that it has formed a joint venture with three  major hospital systems in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area.  </P> <P> The San Juan Capistrano-based medical laboratory firm will act as the general  partner in an alliance with Baylor Health System and Presbyterian Healthcare  System, both based in Dallas, and Harris Methodist Health System, based in Ft.  Worth.  </P> <P> The partnership will operate a 58,000-square-foot central laboratory in Irving,  Tex., that will be shared by 18 hospitals as well as physicians serving North  Texas and Oklahoma.  </P> <P> While the hospitals will maintain labs for emergency and inpatient tests, they  will refer outpatient work to the new Nichols Institute Laboratories North  Texas Ltd. Annual revenues of the facility, which is expected to open late this  year, are anticipated to exceed $15 million.  </P> <P> Stephen Habgood, a spokesman for Baylor Health Systems, said the hospitals  sought an alliance with Nichols because of the firm's capability for doing  complex diagnostic tests that the hospitals are unable to perform.  </P> <P> Nichols spokeswoman Katherine Murphy said the company has tried to develop  partnerships with networks of hospitals for several years, but this is the  first such arrangement it has established.  </P> <P> The joint venture was described by Nichols' officials as a "prototype for  health-care providers through the 1990s" and as a method to contain laboratory  costs through consolidation.  </P> <P> Securities analysts praised Nichols' joint venture with the Texas hospitals as  an effective and economical method of business expansion.  </P> <P> Joint venturing, the analysts noted, is less expensive than the acquisition of  regional laboratories, which has been Nichols' chief growth strategy until now.  Nichols has regional laboratories in California, the Pacific Northwest and the  Midwest.  </P> <P> It also has a laboratory in San Juan Capistrano, where it performs esoteric  tests referred from less sophisticated laboratories throughout the country.  </P> <P> "I think it is very positive for Nichols, in that it enables them to get rapid  access in the marketplace there (in North Texas) without a significant  investment," said Arda Minocherhomjee, a health care analyst with Chicago Corp.  </P> <P> Ken Bohringer, a securities analyst with Prudential Bache, called the joint  venture "a significant development for the company. If it succeeds, it may  represent a pattern of things to come."  </P></p>

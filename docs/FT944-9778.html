			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Greyhound agrees terms of restructuring Greyhound Lines, the loss-making US bus company, has staved off a threat to force it into bankruptcy by agreeing fresh terms for a financial restructuring with a group of dissident bondholders. Earlier this month, a group of convertible debenture holders filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the company because they considered they were getting a bad deal under the original restructuring terms. On Friday, the company and its bondholders said that they had agreed in principle to a deal under which bondholders would receive 45 per cent of the recapitalised company's common stock in exchange for their Dollars 98.9m worth of convertible debentures. The bondholders will also get two seats on the board. The joint statement said the bankruptcy petition would be withdrawn as soon as the restructuring was complete. Although the imminent threat of bankruptcy has been averted, Greyhound remains troubled. Since emerging from its last bankruptcy in October 1991, it has been been pummelled by competition from low-cost airlines and regional bus companies. Passenger numbers were down nearly 9 per cent in the nine months to September and the company has reported a series of quarterly losses. In July, Greyhound announced it would cease to operate long-distance bus services all over the US and would become a regional operator of relatively short-distance services in selected markets. This was followed in August by the departure of the company's chief executive and in September by proposals for a financial restructuring. However, bondholders disagreed with the plan because they were offered only 40 per cent of the company's common stock in exchange for their bonds. Under the revised plan, bondholders will own 45 per cent of the company and Greyhound will raise Dollars 35m by the issue of new stock equivalent to 29 per cent of the company. As a result, existing shareholders will see their stake diluted to 26 per cent. Greyhound hopes the injection of cash will see it through the lean winter months and provide the basis for a return to profitability.</p>

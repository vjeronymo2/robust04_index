The purpose of these grants is to help eliminate overlap and fragmentation of services to children and their families through creation of new community service systems, working together with health, education and social service professionals. Applications are solicited for projects which: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Demonstrate the ability of health, social service and education professionals to work together in communities to foster successful physical, social and emotional growth for children and their families; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Assist in the development of curricula at institutions of higher learning, based on best practices learned in community settings; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Disseminate a collaborative model of personnel training and service delivery at the regional, State and national levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees are expected to work collaboratively with the Commission on Leadership in Interprofessional Education to field test model curricula. The Commission, an organizational unit of the Association of Teacher Educators which grew out of a March, 1990, symposium cosponsored by MCHB, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, focuses on the study of ways to produce a new generation of interprofessionally oriented leaders in health, teaching, administration, social work, and other human service professions whose members possess the knowledge, skills and values needed to create new community service systems for children and their families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preference for funding will be given to applicants with prior experience linking health, education and social service professionals together with policy makers in State and local health and education agencies and private sector organizations to solve complex problems facing children and their families that require collaboration. This means that approved applicants with such experience will be funded ahead of other categories or groups of applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants will use guidelines adapted from the FY 1993 SPRANS Field-Initiated Project subcategory to prepare their applications. These guidelines will be included with the grant application materials. Information in this announcement, such as application receipt dates, will supersede that contained in the guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Time does not permit a formal comment period on the category and preferences described above. Any comments which members of the public wish to make should be submitted to: Chief, Grants Management Branch, at the address listed in the ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

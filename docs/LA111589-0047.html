			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> '3RD THURSDAY' THRIVES WITHOUT ANY SAFETY NET;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: CHANNEL 39'S PUBLIC FORUM RISKED GOING LIVE, PUTTING PEOPLE OF  OPPOSING VIEWS TOGETHER IN AN UNPREDICTABLE, VOLATILE BREW. THE PAYOFF WAS THE  SPONTANEITY THAT HAS HELPED TO MAKE THE SHOW UNUSUALLY POPULAR FOR ITS GENRE.  </P> <P> As the stunned "Third Thursday" crew looked on, host Marty Levin suddenly  veered for the phone by the side of the stage. A commercial break during a live  television show is no time for spontaneity.  </P> <P> "Fifteen seconds," warned a nervous-looking floor director.  </P> <P> This particular edition of KNSD-TV's (Channel  </P> <P> 39) monthly, live, 90-minute public forum show, was focusing on growth. And it  was starting to heat up. The six politicians and community activists on stage  were clearly growing irritated with each other's comments, while members of the  audience were eagerly raising their hands to make comments and ask questions.  </P> <P> "These people are really ready to go," Levin said into the phone, talking to  show producer Steve Corman, who was in the production truck outside an  auditorium.  </P> <P> Levin did not want to use the taped segment scheduled for that part of the  show. Corman agreed.  </P> <P> "Five seconds," the floor director said.  </P> <P> Levin put the phone down, whirled, hopped over a camera leg and rushed to the  set. He made it to his position -- barely. Disaster averted.  </P> <P> "Third Thursday," which resumes its once-a-month schedule Thursday at 6:30 p.m.  with a show on health-care costs, is special. Not only is the 90-minute,  public-affairs show a rare format in the country, there is an energy created by  putting people with vastly different perspectives in a room together, and then  televising the event live.  </P> <P> The emotions stirred up by the issues invariably make for an unpredictable  brew.  </P> <P> For the show's crew, "Third Thursday" is television on the edge, working  without a net.  </P> <P> "This," Levin said after the growth program, "is as close as we come to  danger."  </P> <P> The October edition was a milestone of sorts for "Third Thursday." Almost  exactly a year earlier, the show went on the air with its first program.  </P> <P> The subject of that first show also was growth, and, everyone seems to agree,  it was the worst edition of "Third Thursday." It was staged at the North County  Fair shopping center, and the sound was atrocious, the milling crowd unruly.  </P> <P> A year later, the show has come a long way. It has built up a surprisingly  large audience, in addition to respect in the community, for its open, frank  discussions of current issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In the 6:30-8 p.m. time slot, it has attracted a Nielsen rating as high as a 8  points -- not spectacular, but solid for a public-affairs show. The audience  for Channel 39's 5 p.m. news show, in contrast, earned a 4 rating last quarter.  </P> <P> The small crew assigned to "Third Thursday" has become a traveling troupe,  taking the show around the county to different auditoriums each month. It is  almost routine for them, overcoming regular obstacles with relative ease.  </P> <P> This month's edition will air from Wangenheim Junior High School in Mira Mesa.  The subject, health-care costs, may not be as volatile as past topics, such as  abortion or animal rights, but  </P> <P> it is impossible to predict the reaction. It is, after all, live television.  </P> <P> " 'Third Thursday' parallels our mission better than any other single element"  of the station, general manager Neil Derrough said.  </P> <P> Channel 39's promotional slogan is, "We bring it straight to you." With no  frills and few concessions to traditional television glitz, "Third Thursday"  couldn't be any straighter.  </P> <P> It brings people together with vastly different points of view to talk about  issues. People watching at home can call in questions. In addition to five or  six panelists for each show, the audience is usually laced with a variety of  other people involved with the issue.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be here to at least express my support for the concept," said  Escondido City Councilman Jerry Harmon, who sat in the audience during the  growth show. "They're making a concerted efforted to do something, to give the  community a  </P> <P> forum on key issues."  </P> <P> Harmon wasn't called on during the show, but at one point a panel member  started discussing growth restrictions in Poway. While he talked, Levin hustled  up the aisle, and called on a member of the audience.  </P> <P> "I'm Linda Brannon, deputy mayor of Poway," the audience member said, launching  into a more accurate explanation of the situation.  </P> <P> It is up to Levin to orchestrate events, to ensure that each side has a fair  chance to speak. Before the growth show, he told the audience not to focus on  the hot controversy over development along the shores of Miramar Lake, warning  them that it was not going to be a 90-minute show on the one topic.  </P> <P> "Please, we ask you to minimize the rhetoric and maximize questions," he told  the crowd before the program began.  </P> <P> At this year's San Diego Press Club Awards, when "Third Thursday" won the award  for best discussion/interview program, the judges wrote, "The interaction  between the host and the audience keeps it interesting -- he's good!"  </P> <P> Levin is the ringmaster, keeping things lively and reasonably  non-confrontational. He chides the audience about not asking enough questions,  making them feel at ease when they rise to speak.  </P> <P> "Marty does a good job of ensuring there are balanced perspectives," said Herb  Cawthorne, a leader in the black community and a member of the growth panel.  "It is as fair as a show can be and still have some teeth to it."  </P> <P> "Third Thursday" producer Steve Corman realizes that the show will never rival  the ratings of "The Cosby Show" -- or, for that matter, "A Current Affair," its  competition on KGTV (Channel 10). A veteran of TV productions, with 20 years of  producing programs in Chicago to his credit, Corman nevertheless has found the  first year of "Third Thursday" to be a particularly rewarding experience.  </P> <P> "It's always been a dream of mine to be involved in something like this," he  said.  </P> <P> Associate producer Kurt Snider, after five years earning awards working on the  light and airy "P.M. Magazine" show, left Channel 8 last year to work on "Third  Thursday."  </P> <P> "I was tired of never-a-cloudy-day television," he said. " 'P.M. Magazine' is a  co-host driven show; content takes a back seat to presentation. The best part  about this show is that it's nothing but content."  </P> <P> Besides Snider and Corman, the regular "Third Thursday" crew is composed of  associate producer Jan Hudson, who spends about 20 hours a week working on the  show, and Amy Michael, who also produces the weekly half-hour show "San Diego  Headliners." Dr. Nee Howard, a semi-retired child-development specialist,  supplies research.  </P> <P> Additional crew members are brought in the night of the show, but it's the core  group that has to bring the show together month after month.  </P> <P> Hudson spends most of her time on perhaps the biggest problem the show faces  each month -- finding a location. The site has to be big enough for a studio  audience and the show's heavy lighting equipment. It also has to be situated in  such a way to allow the crew to clearly relay signals back to Channel 39.  </P> <P> A different site is used each month.  </P> <P> "One of the purposes of the show is to go to the communities, to make it  available and accessible," said Hudson.  </P> <P> Much of Michael's time is spent dealing with the problem of getting an audience  to the site. People love to get tickets, but they don't always show up. For  last month's growth show, more than 500 tickets were given out, but only about  225 people actually appeared the night of the show -- which turned out to be  just right for the Mira Mesa High School auditorium.  </P> <P> The three to four taped segments used during the show -- "fire starters" is the  way Corman described them -- are produced by Corman and Snider throughout the  month. They often work at night, since the editing suites at Channel 39 are  usually used by the advertising department during the day.  </P> <P> The composition of the panel is another challenge. The goal is to achieve  balance without blandness, fairness without mediocrity.  </P> <P> A bad panel can ruin a good topic. The program on gangs bombed, Corman said,  because there was no interaction among the panelists.  </P> <P> "We had people more into speechifying than making valid points," said Corman.  </P> <P> It is a common problem. Put people with causes on live television, in  particular politicians, and they usually will try to take advantage of the  opportunity to make a few points.  </P> <P> "Nobody's mind is going to be changed (by the show)," Levin said. "All you can  hope for is that at least (the audience) will understand where everybody is  coming from, and you hope it's enlightening."  </P> <P> The night of the show, uncertainty is more of a problem than the actual  mechanical setup of the light and sound systems.  </P> <P> In an unusual arrangement, director Randy Mickler, watching monitors at Channel  39's main studio, calls the shots -- switch to camera one, or fade to camera  two -- and relays the instructions to the technical director in the production  truck at the site via phone. Usually the director is at the site for remote  broadcasts, but Channel 39 opted for this novel method to help coordinate the  technical details already being handled at the Channel 39 studio.  </P> <P> "I was real skeptical at first, but it works very well," Corman said.  </P> <P> Beyond the introduction and the insertion of the commercials, few of the events  are mapped out, beyond a general guideline as to how things might best occur.  There is no script for any of the evening's events.  </P> <P> "The show itself is sort of free-flowing," Snider said.  </P> <P> The show's crew has become adept at spotting trouble before it happens. During  the first show on growth, they spotted representatives of one group with a  banner they clearly meant to unfurl during the show. The crew talked them out  of it.  </P> <P> There have been little problems, though. One show was done at a Loma Portal  elementary school directly in the Lindbergh Field flight path. The crew tried  to get into the rhythm of the planes, inserting tapes when a jet flew overhead,  but it was an example of the type of awkward situations that can develop on  live television.  </P> <P> During the program on the proposed SDG&amp;E merger with Southern California  Edison, there was a brief but potentially disastrous power outage. Before the  show on animal rights, the guests representing the different perspectives  practically refused to talk to each other, leading the crew to fear a show  featuring nothing more than glowering, silent combatants.  </P> <P> However, considering the potential for disaster, "Third Thursday" has lived a  charmed life, even without the protection of the short time delay used by most  so-called "live" phone-in shows. The callers are truly live.  </P> <P> "We haven't even had any last-minute cancellations," Corman said. "I live in  fear of a terrible rainstorm."  </P> <P> Every show has come together with few dramatic problems. And everyone involved  agrees the shows, if nothing else, are getting better.  </P> <P> Last month's growth show was truly a measure of how far the show has come in  the last year. The crew only ran two of the planned tape segments because the  interaction between the panelists and the audience was so good.  </P></p>

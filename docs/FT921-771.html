			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Husky Oil dents Hutchison Whampoa profit PROBLEMS with Husky Oil, a Canadian oil and gas producer, forced Hutchison Whampoa, the large Hong Kong trading company controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, to announce a 5 per cent fall in after-tax profits yesterday to HKDollars 3.3bn (USDollars 426.4m) in 1991 from HKDollars 3.5bn in 1990. Hutchison took an above-the-line write off of HKDollars 763m - its share of a provision Husky, of which it owns 49 per cent, has made for the fall in the value of its oil and gas reserves. Last week, Cavendish International, a Hutchison subsidiary, made a provision of HKDollars 462m for its share of Husky's write-off. Mr Simon Murray, managing director of Hutchison, said it was too early to say when Husky would improve, but he did not expect any in the short-term. If oil and gas prices did not rise 'then we will have to take another look at it.' Mr Murray scotched rumours of an imminent rights issue, saying there were no plans to have one this year. He said the company was financially strong and had no need of an issue to fund existing operations. The Husky write-off took the shine away from what analysts described as a very impressive underlying growth in profits from Hutchison's businesses, especially those in Hong Kong. Operating profit was up 15.5 per cent and, if the write-off was added back to pre-tax earnings, they would have shown an 18.8 per cent improvement, they said. Looking ahead, Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, said the continued strength of the Hong Kong property market, increased container traffic, and general growth with in the colony's economy due to its proximity to China, should all benefit the company's operations. The directors declared a final dividend of 48 cents, which makes a total for the year of 68 cents - up 4.5 per cent on 1990. Mr Li said that the company's property interests continued to make good contributions to profit in 1991. The property division benefited from the continued strong demand in Hong Kong for medium-sized residential units. Record growth was achieved in its container terminal operations through its 60 per cent subsidiary, Hongkong International Terminals (HIT). HIT handled 2.5m 20ft equivalent units (TEUs) through Kwai Chung container port. 'Future growth will be enhanced by the formation of a partnership with the China Ocean Shipping Company (Cosco) to develop half of the new Terminal 8 and Kwai Chung,' he said. The acquisition of Felixstowe Port, the biggest container port in the UK, was ahead of planned targets, Mr Murray said. Hutchison Telecommunications will shortly be launching its telepoint (CT2) business in the UK. This venture, of which it owns 65 per cent, has and will require large investment and that spending reduced profits from the telecommunications group last year. In terms of capital spending, Mr Murray said about Pounds 800m would be spent on CT2 and PCN (personal communications network) over the nest four to five years. Hutchison's share of that will be about Pounds 500m. He anticipated profit to flow from CT2 in two to three years and from PCN in about five years. Mr Li said while the initial operating losses in the start up phase of the telecommunications businesses overseas will erode profits from the cellular and paging businesses in Hong Kong, the potential of the company would be realised in the long term.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / 'Check-off' risk to unions or about 15 per cent of the total  - as a result of impending changes by the government to rules for the automatic 'check-off' of union dues by employers, according to Professor Paul Willman of the London Business School, an expert in union finances. Tomorrow's Queen's Speech is expected to include a proposal to make check-off illegal unless an employee gives written consent to the system every three years. The government may also require written consent every time the level of the union dues changes. 'Trade unions rely on a form of inertia-selling, and regular reconsideration of the check-off option would be regular reconsideration of union membership,' Prof Willman said. He added in an official response to last year's green paper on industrial relations that the check-off proposal would lead to 'considerable' loss of membership. Privately, many union leaders admit to similar calculations, although publicly they maintain that enthusiastic work-place campaigns to sign up for check-off could actually help increase membership. They cite the strong support for maintaining union political funds shown in the political levy ballots of the mid 1980s. Some unions operating in the public sector, such as Nupe, have almost 100 per cent of their members on check-off. The large general unions such as the TGWU and the GMB have more than 90 per cent on check-off. Skilled and white-collar unions have slightly fewer  - the engineering section of the newly merged AEEU has 80 per cent on check-off and the electricians' section has only 55 per cent. Most of those not on check-off pay by direct debit arrangements or, more traditionally, pay the shop steward. Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU, warned that if his union loses a large amount of income from the check-off rules 'it will simply increase the due-collection activity of 100,000 shop stewards during working time, which is what employers wanted to get away from with check-off'. Prof Willman says that most of the extra administrative cost of the new check-off arrangement will fall on employers. Some organisations, including the Engineering Employers Federation, are opposed to the change.</p>

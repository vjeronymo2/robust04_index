			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM MAN, 18, IN CUSTODY AFTER HIGH-SPEED ORANGE FREEWAY CHASE  </P> <P> An 18-year-old Anaheim man was in custody this morning and a second suspect was  at large after the two allegedly stole a car and led police a high-speed chase  on the Orange Freeway, where officers fired at a fleeing suspect.  </P> <P> Brea Capt. Jim Oman said the incident began when two men robbed a Brea woman of  her Acura Legend as she pulled out of her driveway at 9:30 p.m. Thursday. One  of the men pulled her from the car, struck her in the face and then sped away  in her car, while the other followed in a Nissan Maxima, Oman said.  </P> <P> The two cars headed south on the Orange Freeway, speeding up to 100 m.p.h.  (Story, Part II, Page 1.) The victim's husband followed them and overtook the  Acura on the congested Lambert Road exit in Brea. There, the Acura driver  jumped into the Nissan, and the husband got into his wife's Acura and continued  the chase back on the freeway -- this time followed by police officers.  </P> <P> The chase ended when the Nissan crashed into the highway's center divider near  Yorba Linda Boulevard. Police shot Jay Le once in the left shoulder as he  jumped from the Nissan and flashed what an officer thought was a gun, Oman  said. Police later found a toy gun in the car. The officer's name is being  withheld.  </P> <P> A bullet also shattered the windshield of a car driven by a 19-year-old woman  who was passing by the scene. She suffered minor injuries from broken glass.  </P> <P> Le ran across the freeway and hopped a wall into the Homestead Apartments on  Deerpark Drive. The other suspect ran across the freeway in the opposite  direction and escaped.  </P> <P> A resident of the complex directed police to a dumpster where Le was hiding. He  was taken to St. Jude Hospital in Fullerton, where he is under guard, booked on  suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, armed robbery  and grand theft auto.  </P></p>

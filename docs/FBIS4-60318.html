			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has  stated the following:    With support and success granted by Almighty God to the  soldiers of right--the soldiers protecting unity and freedom and  safeguarding democracy and constitutional legitimacy--and under  the growing high morale of the glorious brave fighters in the  valiant Armed Forces and their increasing confidence in their  combat capability and high efficiency in the decisive  confrontation of the gangs of apostasy and secession in the  Yemeni Socialist Party in the various axes and sectors, the  forces of unity and protection of constitutional legitimacy have  pursued their implementation of all combat missions in the  battlefields, liquidating the secessionist pockets and dens and  inflicting huge losses in the weaponry, vehicles, and equipment  of the gangs of the mutinous secessionist forces. [passage  omitted contained in referent item]    Moreover, the heroic and courageous hawks of the air in the  forces of both unity and protection of the constitutional  legitimacy carried out with precise and high efficiency and with  devastating blows the missions assigned to them in a number of  sectors where the gangs of rebellion and secession showed some  resistance.    On various axes, the units of our Armed Forces are still  receiving officers, noncommissioned officers [NCO's], and  soldiers joining the ranks of the forces of unity and protection  of constitutional legitimacy and declaring their condemnation of  the secessionist and rebellious gang which revealed its blatant  and destructive hostility to the people, the homeland, and  Yemen's present and future.    These officers, NCO's, and soldiers also stressed their  principled and courageous standing in the trench of the solid  defense of unity and of protecting both the constitutional  legitimacy and all the achievements and gains of the Republic of  Yemen.    The forces of both unity and the legitimate and  constitutional democracy continue to carry out their missions in  terms of chasing the enemies of both the people and their  unity--the despots of apostasy and secession as well as the  gangs mortgaged to their inevitable destiny. In the name of  God, the merciful, the compassionate: If ye will help (the  cause) of God, He will help you, and plant your feet firmly.  [koranic verse]</p>

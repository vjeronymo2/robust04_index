			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 5 SAPA -- All legislators elected to  provincial and national government structures, including the  state president, will pay income tax in terms of the Melamet  Commission report on remuneration of politicians released on  Thursday [5 May]. Commission chairman Mr Justice D A Melamet  said at a press conference in Pretoria the report also  recommended that all allowances, other than car allowances, be  abolished.    Free housing would be given only to the president and the  two  executive deputy presidents and no other housing allowances  would be allowed for any other grades. According to the report,  "if any person occupies a state house, a market-related rental  is to be paid to the state to cover such occupation".    "The committee has worked on the premise that all elected  membe ay income tax on their income as is the case with members  of the public. It, however, believes and recommends that the  right in relation to the pensions of an ex-state or  ex-vice-president and their spouses should continue to exist and  should not be taxed," Mr Justice Melamet said.    The new state president will receive R575,000 [rand]  (R409,000 after deductions) a year, and his deputies R500,000  (R338,247). The figures do not include allowances. Asked if  the amount was in line with what President-elect Nelson Mandela  had been preaching, that his salary would not be excessive, Mr  Justice Melamet said Mr Mandela and the present cabinet had  approved the salary scale. "In fact Mr Mandela was happy with  the recommendations of the commission because he would be taxed  and treated like any other member of the public," Mr Justice  Melamet said.    He said the scale was in line with that of international  countries and his committee, which was made up of people from  various sectors, was sure the scale was comparable with that of  the private sector. According to Mr Justice Melamet the  committee, in its recommendations, used a number of principles  to provide a basis for remuneration in the parliamentary system.  These included that the system should attract the best people  available for parliamentary duty; encourage individual growth  and participation in work teams and parliamentary committees;  encourage parliamentary work as a career; and provide for  transparency of the principles and pay involved.    The committee recommended a grading structure of the various  offices in the national legislature and for the new offices  provided for in the Constitution Act of 1993. It recommended  that all allowances where applicable, other than car allowances,  be abolished and incorporated in the basic salary attributed to  each post in the grading system. Parliamentarians, other than  the state president and executive deputy president, are to be  entitled to two free journeys a month for private use during a  parliamentary session between their home base and back.    Each incumbent is entitled to an allowance in respect of a  private motor car (which can also be used for official purposes)  of 20 per cent of the basic salary of the incumbent.    The committee also recommended that a pension fund along the  lines of those existing in the private sector be established for  politicians and had made further recommendations on the  envisaged pension dispensation. It was, however, pointed out  that certain provisions of the 1993 Constitution had to be  amended to enable the introduction of the pension arrangement  recommended.    According to the commission it was also noted that the  present medical benefit scheme was operating successfully and,  although the contributions were high, the benefits were  generous. The committee recommended that the medical scheme be  continued and made a number of recommendations for the  consideration of the scheme's management committee to bring  costs more in line with commercial schemes.    According to Mr Justice Melamet, the commission has also  drafted a bill for the establishment of a permanent commission  on remuneration of representatives envisaged in sections of the  constitution of the Republic of South Africa. "More  specifically the bill deals with matters relating to the objects  of the (permanent) commission, its constitution, remuneration,  powers, duties and functions as well as meetings of the  commission, the funding of its activities and the powers of the  president," Mr Justice Melamet said.</p>

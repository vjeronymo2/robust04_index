The Military  Topographic Service has carried out its activities in compliance  with the operative list of state secrets, he stressed. Besides  Bulgaria, all Western and East European countries except for  Russia took part in the project, Col. Ivanov said. Bulgaria's  participation was organized by the Institute of Applied Geodesy  in Frankfurt which is financed by the European Union. In  1992-1993 joint teams comprising representatives of the  institute, Bulgarian military topographers, scientific workers  and students determined the co-ordinates of 15 geodetic points  in the territory of Bulgaria. A database is being build, which  will make it possible for the geodetic and topographic services  to harmonize the national geodetic network with the European and  the world system of geographic co-ordinates, Col. Ivanov  explained. This, according to him, will help solve some  problems of the international air and sea navigation. The  Bulgarian system of co-ordinates is top secret and the  Frankfurt-based institute has no methodology that would enable  it to get classified data on the co-ordinates of geodetic points  in Bulgaria, Col. Ivanov said.    He denied the allegations that appeared in DEMOKRATSIYA that  classified information about Bulgaria's topography had leaked to  the West and Turkey. Today's issue of DEMOKRATSIYA leads with  an article describing the inclusion of the General Staff of the  Bulgarian Army in the Euroref Project as "an unprecedented  blunder" and "treason." Not mentioning names, the paper cites  the opinion of top military officials who said that the  Bulgarian supreme commander-in-chief, President Zhelyu Zhelev,  must hold the General Staff chief and the Army's civil  leadership responsible for having sold state secrets. There  were no Turkish military experts in the teams working in  Bulgaria on the Euroref Project, Col. Ivanov said. There were no  Bulgarian military experts in the teams implementing the project  in Turkey either, he went on to say. The head of the General  Staff Topographic Service denied the allegations that the  Bulgarian military working in the geodetic teams had been paid  handsomely. DEMOKRATSIYA's source is inaccurate and  ill-meaning, Col. Ivanov said describing the article as an  attempt to discredit the Bulgarian Army's Topographic Service  and its General Staff.</p>

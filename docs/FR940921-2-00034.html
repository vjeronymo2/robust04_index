In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Norwest Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Board authorized Norwest to underwrite and deal in, among other things, municipal revenue bonds pursuant to the prudential limitations and other conditions set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Citicorp, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated, and Bankers Trust New York Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987) as modified by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Order Approving Modifications to Section 20 Orders <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 751 (1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the conditions to which Norwest is subject pursuant to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Norwest Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is that the municipal revenue bonds underwritten by NISI must be rated as investment quality ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in one of the top four categories) by a nationally recognized rating agency. Norwest has requested limited relief from this condition to allow NISI to underwrite issues of municipal revenue bonds that are not rated by a nationally recognized rating agency so long as each issue of unrated bonds does not exceed $7.5 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Norwest supports its request for relief by contending that it is not cost effective for municipalities to obtain ratings for smaller issues of municipal revenue bonds. Norwest asserts that NISI's participation in underwriting these unrated municipal revenue bonds will benefit the communities that issue the bonds by providing additional competition in the market for this service. Norwest believes that the systems and procedures that it has in place to evaluate the creditworthiness of these issues should substantially mitigate any risk that may be associated with the underwriting of these bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than October 11, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The request may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Minneapolis (James M.

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Profits at Kodak slide 33% in fourth quarter Eastman Kodak, the troubled US photographic equipment manufacturer, yesterday reported a 33 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net income. The drop, however, was due largely to lower profits at chemicals operations which were recently spun off and one-time gains in 1992. The company reported net earnings of Dollars 201m, or 61 cents a share, down from Dollars 299m, or 92 cents, a year ago. Revenues dipped to Dollars 4.5bn from Dollars 4.6bn. Fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations totalled Dollars 203m, or 62 cents, down from Dollars 251m, or 77 cents, in the same period of last year, when the group had a 23 cents a share gain from the sale of Eastman Kodak Credit Corporation and other investments. Kodak, which has suffered a lacklustre profits record for years, ousted its chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore, last summer and replaced him with Mr George Fisher, formerly chairman of Motorola. For the full year it reported a netloss of Dollars 1.5bn, or Dollars 4.62 a share, due mainly to the adoption of new accounting standards, compared with net earnings of Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 3.53, in 1992. Mr Fi sher said that excluding special charges, 'the fundamentals show we are beginning to make real progress in reducing our cost base, improving productivity and strengthening our financial position'. Earnings from operations in itsthree continuing businesses - imaging, information and health - had increasedsignificantly for the year, including a 20 per cent gain in the fourth quarter,as manufacturing productivity improved and marketing, administration and research costs all declined. He said the company was well ahead of its plan to achieve Dollars 2.8bn in cash flow by the end of 1995, which would increase operating flexibility and allow the company to pay down debt. In the fourth quarter, earnings in the imaging division dipped 5 per cent, from Dollars 316m to Dollars 299m, while information turned a Dollars 12m loss into a Dollars 22m profit. Profits from the health care side rose 57 per cent, from Dollars 123m to Dollars 193m, while the discontinued chemicals business saw a 59 per cent drop to Dollars 45m.</p>

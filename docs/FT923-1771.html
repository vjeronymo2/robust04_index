			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Water reclamation works in Leicester Severn Trent Water has awarded BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL ENGINEERING the Pounds 9.4m Abbey Sewer contract in Leicester. The work involves driving a 6km tunnel from the water reclamation works near the village of Wanlip on the northern outskirts of Leicester, into the heart of the city. Approximately half the tunnel length follows the Melton Road, which is a busy residential and shopping street leading into the city. The other half is through a very rural area where the tunnel passes under a canal, the River Soar and a lake with only shallow ground cover. The tunnel will be lined with 2.44 metre internal diameter precast concrete bolted smoothbore segmental linings, erected within a full face tunnel boring machine which will be used to excavate through the Mercia Mudstone beds about 10-15 metres below the surface. The contract includes the construction of 17 precast concrete segmental manhole shafts between 6.75 metre and 3.05 metre diameter at depths of up to 16 metres. There is also a 370 metre length of 1.52 metre diameter tunnel and 300 metres of sewer in headings and trenches, required to connect up to existing sewers. Work on the 100-week project will commence by the end of October.</p>

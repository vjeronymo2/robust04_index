			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has come to our attention that a small number of health care providers believe they are complying with the literal terms of these safe harbor provisions, but are circumventing our intent not to protect agreements that are renegotiated based on the volume of business generated between the parties. They believe that they are protected if they enter into multiple agreements, each of which is for a period of one year, but when all the agreements are viewed together renegotiations are taking place more frequently (e.g., every month), with the terms of the additional agreements based in part on the volume of business being generated between the parties under existing agreements. For example, a one year personal services contract between a hospital and a high-volume referring physician is created for the physician to perform certain services. The next month a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> new <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  one year contract is created for a slightly different service, with the amount of payment influenced by the previous months referrals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This scenario does not comply with the requirement in each of these safe harbor provisions that the compensation not take ``into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.'' (&sect;&sect;1001.952(b)(5), 1001.952(c)(5), and 1001.952(d)(5)). However, because the principal problem in this situation is that the parties are creating multiple overlapping agreements, we are proposing to revise these three safe harbor provisions to expressly preclude such schemes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, it appears that some health care providers are attempting to pay for referrals by renting more space than they actually need from referral sources. Although such an arrangement would not fit within a safe harbor because the aggregate rental charge would be determined in a manner that would account for the volume or value of referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties, we are proposing to revise the safe harbor provisions in &sect;&sect;1001.952 (b)(5), (c)(5) and (d)(5) to expressly preclude this practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Clarifications to Referral Services Safe-Harbor (&sect;1001.952(f)) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;One of the standards in the referral services safe harbor provision requires that any fee the referral service charges the participant be ``based on the cost of operating the referral service, and not on the volume or value of any referrals to or business otherwise generated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> by the participants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the referral service *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.'' (Emphasis added) (&sect;1001.952(f)(2)). This language precludes protection where a referral service, such as one operated by a hospital,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> lowers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  its referral service fee to one of its staff physicians who participates in the service because that physician is a high-volume referrer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This language creates an ambiguity where the referral service tries to adjust its fee based on the volume of referrals  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> it makes to the participant. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, we propose clarifying the second prong to preclude safe harbor protection for payments that are based on the volume or value of referrals to or business otherwise generated by either party for the other party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Clarifications To Discount Safe Harbor (&sect;1001.952(h)) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Many people requested clarification of the safe harbor for discounts. Because there has been some uncertainty over what obligations individuals or entities have to meet in order to receive protection under this safe harbor, we propose dividing the parties into three groups: buyers, sellers, and offerors of discounts. In describing each party's obligations, we would revise paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2), and add a new paragraph (h)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, through a proposed new paragraph (h)(4), we would clarify that, for purposes of this regulation, a ``rebate'' is any discount which is not given at the time of sale. Consequently, a rebate transaction may be covered within the safe harbor if it involves a buyer under &sect;1001.952 (h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii), but it is not covered if it involves a buyer under &sect;1001.952(h)(1)(iii) because, under that provision,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all discounts must be given at the time of sale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also wish to clarify what has to happen for sellers to receive safe harbor protection. In the safe harbor regulation itself, we state that discounts will be safe harbored if both the seller ``and'' the buyer comply with the applicable standards as described in the rule. Yet in the preamble we state that sellers should not be held liable for the omissions of buyers. If a seller has done everything that it reasonably could under the circumstances to ensure that the buyer understands its obligations to accurately report the discount, the seller is safe harbored irrespective of the omissions of the buyer. To receive such protection, however, the seller must report the discount to the buyer and inform the buyer of its obligation to report the discount. To emphasize that the seller's obligations require more than superficial compliance with the safe harbor, we propose to add to that the seller must inform the buyer ``in an effective manner'' of its obligations to report the discount. We also propose adding a requirement that the seller ``refrain from doing anything that would impede the buyer from meeting its obligations under this paragraph.'' Thus, if the seller, in good faith, meets its obligations under the safe harbor and the buyer does not meet its obligations due to no fault of the seller, the seller would receive safe harbor protection. However, when the seller submits a claim or request for payment on behalf of the buyer, the seller must fully and accurately report the discount to Medicare or the State health care program. Likewise, when an offeror of a discount meets its obligations under &sect;1001.952(h)(3), and the buyer or seller does not meet its obligations due to no fault of the offeror, the offeror would receive safe harbor protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we are proposing to clarify whether any reduction in price offered to a beneficiary <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  could be safe harbored under this regulation. Congress protected ``a discount or other reduction in price  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> obtained by a provider of services or other entity <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' (emphasis added) and made no provision for such discounts obtained by a beneficiary. In &sect;1001.952(h)(3)(iv) of the regulation, we removed from safe harbor protection a ``reduction in price offered to a beneficiary *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.'' In that section, all we intended to remove from this safe harbor was ``routine reduction or waiver of any coinsurance or deductible amount owed by a program beneficiary.'' Thus, to the extent that a discount is offered to a beneficiary and all other applicable standards in the safe harbor are met, such a discount would receive safe harbor protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

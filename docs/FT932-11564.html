			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Brussels doubts over EC's steel support plans THE EUROPEAN Commission is concerned that the EC-wide plan to support the ailing west European steel industry could be derailed by member states' attempts to subsidise their national producers. EC industry ministers meet today in Brussels to discuss the progress of the plan so far, in the wake of the Commission's rejection last week of German proposals to restructure Ekostahl, the east German producer, and scepticism about a new rationalisation plan from Ilva, the loss-making Italian steelmaker. The Commission has not yet submitted formal proposals to the ministers on any of the most controversial state subsidy cases, but it is pressing for a special meeting in July to consider German, Italian and Spanish steel aid plans together. On Friday, Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, told Mr Michele Tedeschi, the managing director of Iri, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva, that the Commission needed to have a clearer view of the subsidies involved in the new plan, and the reduction of capacity it might involve. Iri claims the plan involves no state aid, and is based on the behaviour of a private sector shareholder. Commission officials fear this may herald lengthy negotiations which could jeopardise decisions on the other state aid cases, and the EC industry's own restructuring plan. 'It's out of the question to come to a decision on the Spanish plan, or on Ekostahl, if at the same time we drag our feet on Ilva,' said one senior official. The Ilva restructuring plan involves creating a company, Nuova Siderurgica, specialising in flat laminates. Nuova Siderurgica, with assets of L2,770bn (Pounds 1.19bn) and net shareholders' funds of L1,900bn, would be profitable and have a 'balanced' financial position, according to Iri. Net borrowing at the group would be just a fraction of Ilva's L7,583bn net debts at the end of last year. Other Ilva operations and shareholdings will be sold to raise L2,700bn. The proceeds would go to lower Ilva's debts. The group, Europe's fourth biggest steelmaker, reported a net group loss of L2,309bn last year on sales of L10,087bn.

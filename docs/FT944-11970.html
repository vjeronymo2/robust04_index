			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: BCH tumbles 38% in first nine months Pre-tax profits at Banco Central Hispano (BCH), the Spanish financial group, tumbled 37.6 per cent to Pta45.3bn (Dollars 363m) in the first nine months as a result of lower income from disposals and an increase in loan-loss provisions. In contrast, BCH's core banking business improved sharply over the period as the group raised operating profit 17.5 per cent to Pta104.9bn. Net consolidated profits fell 25.3 per cent to Pta32.3bn, by far the lowest among the leading domestic banks. This raises the prospect that BCH could be forced to reduce its dividend next year in order to strengthen its balance sheet. The bank's future profitability was nevertheless underlined by an improved net interest income, which rose 4.1 per cent to Pta235.3bn over the nine months. This was in spite of the drop in interest rates and the resulting squeeze on margins. Fees from commissions rose 6.9 per cent to Pta64.4bn and total net revenue advanced 5.5 per cent to Pta308.2bn. The brighter outlook for BCH's pure banking operations was clouded by the continuing need to raise the coverage for its damaged loan portfolio. This drain on resources was aggravated over the nine months by lower revenues from its treasury department and a fall in gains from disposals, which brought extraordinary income over the period down 35.2 per cent to Pta40.7bn. BCH has put aside Pta106.6bn for provisions between January and September, 33.7 per cent more than last year. This addresses the concerns of rating agencies, which have raised questions about the quality of BCH's assets and downgraded the banking group. At the end of September BCH's coverage stood at 76.6 per cent, without taking mortgage-linked guarantees into account. This figure is comparable to that of rival domestic banks and up from its 69 per cent coverage in June. BCH's non-performing loans represented 7 per cent of the group's total lending at the end of September - above the average for the sector, but 1 per cent down on the end of last year. BCH realised Pta30.3bn between January and September through the recovery of non-performing loans, 57.4 per cent up on the same period last year. BCH's return on assets stood at 0.40 and its return on equity at 7.8 per cent, figures well below the average for the sector in Spain.</p>

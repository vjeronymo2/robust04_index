			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / ICI up 40% on worldwide revival A combination of self-help and a surprising rise in demand assisted Imperial Chemical Industries to a 40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits during the first half. The UK's largest chemicals company posted profits up from Pounds 167m to Pounds 234m. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive and chairman designate, said the increase showed 'the first tangible signs of a widespread recovery in our worldwide markets. This is an increasingly robust performance from all our businesses. 'About half of the improvement came from self-help and half from better demand. Prices were the same level as last year.' Turnover increased 8 per cent from Pounds 4.15bn to Pounds 4.46bn. Sales volumes were up 6 per cent during the six months, but had risen 9 per cent in the second quarter from the same period last year. Currency movements reduced sales by about 1 per cent. Trading profits rose 52 per cent to Pounds 273m. Mr Hampel said the results had benefited by more than Pounds 210m from self-help actions since 1990. The target of savings of Pounds 490m next year was within reach, he said. Mr Hampel said ICI would continue to invest in its core assets. It would invest Dollars 100m to build one of the world's largest PET resin plants in North Carolina. PET is a material used to make plastic bottles. Separately, Mr Alan Spall, finance director, added that the group was looking at the possibility of building a new US plant to make PTA, a raw material of PET. The growth in volume had been driven by a number of factors, said Mr Hampel. New plants manufacturing Klea 134a, the CFC-substitute, and PTA had come on stream. European sales were lifted by an increase in market share as US manufacturers attempted to cope with an upturn in demand there. Finally, there had been some additional purchasing by customers anxious to buy before price rises. Mr Hampel noted a clear upturn in the market, but not as strong as might been deduced from ICI's second-quarter figures. The rate of sales growth was clearly unsustainable. Second-quarter growth in the UK was 13 per cent while the European continent saw 10 per cent growth after being flat for the first three months. European sales were boosted by a sharp rise in methanol prices, and the UK fertiliser business was now breaking even after a collapse of Russian imports. Mr Hampel stressed that ICI would never again build a new ethylene plant and that he was willing to consider selling stakes in the Wilton complex in Teesside possibly as part of the putative flotation of EVC, its PVC venture with Enichem of Italy. Earnings per share rose 34 per cent from 12.7p to 17p. The interim dividend was maintained at 10.5p. Lex, Page 14; Details, Page 18</p>

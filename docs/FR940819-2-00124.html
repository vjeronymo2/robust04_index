During the first quarter of CY 1994, the following incidents at NRC licensees were determined to be abnormal occurrences (AOs) and are described below, together with the remedial actions taken. The events are also being included in NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 17, No. 1, (``Report to Congress on Abnormal Occurrences: January-March 1994'').

Because it is difficult to measure the leakage of each valve individually, a maximum combined allowed leakage is specified for the inboard and outboard MSIVs, and the associated control and drain valves. This LCO is 0.71 standard cubic meters (25 standard cubic feet) per hour. During testing at Perry in 1992, the leakages through the MSIVs were approximately 12 times allowable. Due to a history of poor performance and multiple main steam line valve leakage, a detailed analysis of the 1992 MSIV leakage was performed. The analysis is required obtaining detailed information from the licensee; a number of calculations, reviews, and subsequent reanalyses; and multiple meetings among the staff to determine the impact on safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSIVs are designed to close and limit the release of radioactivity to the environment in the unlikely event of an accident. When the Perry facility was issued an operating license, there was reasonable assurance that the MSIVs would operate as intended, and the potential off-site doses resulting from postulated accidents, which includes assumptions regarding fuel damage and fission product release, would be below the guideline values for release to the general public. Because of the excessive leakage, the NRS staff, using conservative assumptions, calculated the potential off-site doses to the general public that might result from a postulated loss-of-coolant accident. Using the very conservative licensing basis calculational methodologies, the calculated dose exceeded the guidelines for release to the general public. A more realistic calculation using the new approach presented in draft NUREG&hyph;1465, ``Accident Source Terms for Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants'' (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NUREG&hyph;1465, ``Accident Source Terms for Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants,'' Draft Report for Comment, June 1992) showed that the potential off-site doses would not exceed the limits for release to the general public; however, additional measures would be needed to minimize exposure of control room personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cause or Causes_The licenses determined the reason for the excessive MSIV leakage during the 1992 tests to be excessive friction from oxide buildup, which caused end-of-stroke angular misalignment resulting in non-360-degree seat contact (Licensee Event Report 50&hyph;440/92&hyph;006&hyph;01, ``Local Leak Rate Test Results Exceed Allowable Primary Containment Leakage for Main Steam Lines A, B, and D,'' August 14, 1992). The reason for the difficulty of the Perry MSIVs to meet test leakage limits is design geometry. The MSIVs are ``Y'' pattern valves with the valve stem at 45 degrees to the piping axis. To seat properly, translational motion of the poppet at the moment of impact must change from the direction of the stem to a direction parallel to the axis of the pipe. Seating is made more difficult because of the large size of the valves (66 centimeters [26 inches] diameter) and the weights involved (4500 kilograms [10,000 pounds]). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Licensee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _In the early 1980s, Atwood &amp; Morrill, suppliers of the MSIVs, and the BWR Owners Group recognized the need for better maintenance and for modification of the MSIVs. Modifications included improved poppet nose guides to overcome eccentricity during seating and poppet anti-rotation devices. During the 1992 refueling outage, these modifications were installed by the licensee on the six (out of eight) MSIVs which have had leakage problems (Licensee Event Report 50&hyph;440/92&hyph;006&hyph;01, ``Local Leak Rate Test Results Exceed Allowable Primary Containment Leakage for Main Steam Lines A, B, and D,'' August 14, 1992). Based on leakage tests performed in 1993 and 1994, the modifications were successful in significantly reducing MSIV leakage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _NRC is closely monitoring the licensee's program and progress in reducing the leak rate through the MSIVs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

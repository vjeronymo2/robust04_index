			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Staubach Writes Bush About Eastern: Pro football Hall of Famer Roger Staubach  has expressed concern to President Bush about the Eastern Airlines strike and  bankruptcy reorganization, saying continued sales of Eastern assets could bring  the airline's eventual demise. In a letter to Bush dated Aug. 1, the former  Dallas Cowboys quarterback asked that a meeting be set up as soon as possible  between representatives of the Eastern pilots union and Roger Porter, Bush's  domestic policy adviser. Staubach wrote that his interest in the Eastern  situation stemmed from his personal relationships with many striking Eastern  pilots. Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said he had no comment on  Staubach's letter or on speculation that the former football player might get  involved in making a buyout offer for the company.  </P></p>

Satisfaction of European Union  Mediator David Owen"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Geneva, 9 Feb (ATS) -- Mediator David Owen said on  Wednesday [9 February] evening that he is very satisfied with  the meeting of the foreign ministers of the seven countries  neighboring the former Yugoslavia. The participants think that  a peaceful solution must be found to end the war in Bosnia, the  co-chairman of the International Conference on the Former  Yugoslavia, said.    On the other hand, Mr. Owen was very skeptical about the new  agreement reached between Serbs and Muslims in Sarajevo on  Wednesday. This agreement makes provision for a cease-fire from  noon Thursday and the withdrawal of the Serbian batteries to  positions on the hills which overlook the Bosnian capital. In  this connection, the European Union mediator pointed out that  numerous agreements had already been reached in the past,  without ever being respected.    He pointed out that the Geneva meeting was the first meeting  around one table by all the foreign ministers of the Balkan  states. The discussion related to the consequences of a possible  lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia. It also examined the  effects of the economic embargo imposed by the United Nations on  the new Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).    The Italian foreign minister explained that all the states  present in Geneva had declared their agreement on maintaining  the economic embargo. The states represented in Geneva were  Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania.  Turkey was invited but was not present. It apparently decided  not to attend at the last minute, arguing that the meeting had  little chance of producing practical results, according to some  diplomatic sources.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Independent bidders told to improve their offers The potential saviours of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday are being told that they will have to pay more or make their offers more attractive to shareholders. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, the newspaper group holding company, and the non-executive directors have reviewed the bid, offer and proposal that have been submitted and found them all wanting. Mr Hay Davison believes an auction is under way, although there are a range of complex issues involved. The proposal from the consortium which groups the two main existing shareholders - El Pas and La Repubblica, the founders, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, and Mirror Group Newspapers - is now being treated as a formal bid. The offer, which would see MGN take a 40 per cent stake, is pitched at between Pounds 2.40 and Pounds 2.80 a share. The board committee has indicated that the bid does not place an adequate value on the company and it is asking for more. The offer from Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland, which would put Pounds 21m of new money in the form of convertible shares worth Pounds 3 a share, giving Mr O'Reilly just under 25 per cent, is seen to be attractive. A flaw is the accompanying offer for only up to 20 per cent of the existing shares at Pounds 2.50. Institutions hold 52 per cent and those holding more than 20 per cent would probably want to sell. Mr O'Reilly is being pointed in the direction of a larger, more extended offer, possibly with a partner. Mr Conrad Black of the Telegraph Group is waiting in the background. The Telegraph earlier put forward a proposal which remains on the table. The deal would essentially take out the institutional shareholders who want to sell their shares and provide some 'topping up' money for the future of the paper. Apart from being able to print The Independent, the Telegraph would manage the business, apart from editorial, and offer a joint ratecard for advertising. The Telegraph is not pushing hard on the issue. Mr Dan Colson, vice-chairman, said last night: 'They know where we are. They know what the proposal is. The next move is up to them.'</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Prison officers start work-to-rule THE GOVERNMENT has plans to hold prisoners in police cells if prison officers escalate a campaign of industrial action, starting today, aimed at ending prison privatisation plans. The 23,000-member Prison Officers' Association has voted to introduce a programme of action in Britain's 130 state-run prisons, beginning with a work-to-rule from today. This involves refusing to work hours on top of the 39-hour week and to follow prison procedures to the letter. The association has warned it will step up its action later this month if the government is not prepared to introduce measures to halt overcrowding and market testing of prisons and prison services. The association says these are leading to 'unchecked criminality' in prisons. Mr John Bartell, association chairman, said further action would start on November 15 when prison officers would refuse to accept prisoners who had been held in police custody or privately-run prisons. Mr Bartell said that while he was sympathetic to the government's objective of introducing more controlled regimes in prisons he was concerned at business plans that measured governors' performance by the amount of time spent by prisoners outside their cells. The Home Office said yesterday it would closely monitor the strength of the action. Although there was a 79 per cent vote for industrial action, only 49 per cent of the membership voted. Mr Bartlett said his members were 'no longer prepared to have their safety jeopardised' in pursuit of 'an untested political objective'.</p>

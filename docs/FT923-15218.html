			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: Love, lust and voyeurism - Exhibition Thematic exhibitions tend to be viewed with deep suspicion. If the theme is too broad, and crucial loans unforthcoming, they run the risk of being uneasy assemblages of disparate objects incapable of telling us anything new. Giulio Macchi's ambitious multi-media exploration of Love: from Olympus to the Alcove at Turin's Mole Antonelliana, is no exception. From the first, the visitor is bombarded by a hotch-potch of images. The opening sequence, for instance, takes us from the 1970s and Robert Indiana's 'Love' carpet to Guido Reni's 'Eros' and the seicento in three paces, and sets a great Cranach beside a humble cupid on a candlestick. The visual confusion is disorientating, and made worse by the Mole space which allows one to see almost everything on each floor at the same time. It soon becomes apparent that this is not an exhibition about art - as the slipshod captioning bears witness. This is art as document of cultural history, and it is a potted history to boot. Macchi alights on one promising line of enquiry only to flit to another. Nothing is pursued, nothing explained. Individual exhibits or sequences may be fascinating, but juxtapositions are less frequently illuminating than banal or simply baffling. Enduring emblems of love set the scene. There are Venuses by Botticelli (sacred), Cranach (profane), Man Ray (bound), Arman (sliced), Yves Klein (blue) and Jim Dine (black). Boucher's is a cloud-borne confection strewn with pearls; Pistoletto's is almost submerged in a mound of old clothes. Hearts loom in abstract canvases or sit upon an outcrop of columns. Amorini come cast, carved and gilt, woven, painted,enamelled . . . Picasso's re-interpretation of Cranach is displayed but, inexplicably, on a different floor. Leering over all is Enrico Baj's repellent maiolica relief of an embracing Cupid and Psyche, Psyche's shiny red tongue obscenely protruding. It makes a travesty of the tenderness expressed in the Antique marble version of the group on loan from the Capitoline Museum in Rome. Baj's monumental panel is the first of many depressing late 20th century images of love. In 'The Arms of Seduction' we glimpse the enchanted world of courtly love. Medieval and Renaissance ivory combs and wooden caskets present gardens of love and fetes galantes. Menacing hints of alchemy and magic crop up in the weird fantasy landscape of Girolamo da Carpi. 'The Pact' dips into the codes of behaviour sanctioned by society. We find a 15th century tract against marriage and Chagall's 'Les Maries de la Tour Eiffel' as a joyful celebration of holy matrimony. An early 18th century sex manual, with illustrations treating the human body like fragments of classical sculpture, helpfully instructs its newly wed readers on the various combinations of genitalia of hermaphrodites. Bassano and Burne-Jones depict virtuous women. A 15th century birth salver depicting the Last Judgment stands in ironic contrast to the triumphalism of Valerio Admai's 1970 'Les Joies de l'adultere'. 'Intimacy Revealed' proceeds to unlock doors and rip off any number of brown paper wrappers. From the print room of the Uffizi comes a series of sexual fantasies by Fuseli, notorious but never exhibited. More schematic, works of reference even, are the couplings drawn by Francesco Hayez (he of 'The Kiss', which is here too). Beside them is a more conventional portrait of his model and mistress sitting up in bed. Additional paintings and drawings by Picasso and Le Corbusier contrast the public with the private. On general release, apparently for the first time, are frescoes, mosaics, sculpture and ceramics from the secret or 'reserve' collection of antiquities discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum. It is an extraordinary collection, interesting not least, as the catalogue essay reveals, in terms of subsequent attitudes towards it. Even the great Winckelmann was not granted access to the still shocking marble of Pan and the goat. Next comes 'Possession' - have not we had that already? - and violent abductions and violations, from illustrations of mythological rapes to Andre Masson's 'L'enlevement'. The fury of these scenes contrast with the docile languor of the harem. This section offers up such curiosities as a 15th century chastity belt, and death masks of a rapist and a wife murderer made for Turin's long closed museum of criminal anthropology. At the heart of the Mole's space-rocket interior is 'The Theatre of Love'. A series of beds are viewed to the sounds of great theatrical love scenes recorded by Luca Roncone. From here the 'siege d'amour' of around 1890 from an infamous Parisian brothel (was it really made for the Prince of Wales?) is only a footstep away. The cool classicism and unexpected comedy of Ledoux and Lequeu's projections of Revolutionary maisons de plaisir, make for a fascinating oasis before the latter part of the show's breathless romp around fetishism (shoes, leather), sadism (Dix), transvestism (Warhol), voyeurism and various homo-erotic acts. Surprisingly, the show has attracted neither the wrath of the Roman Catholic Church nor enthusiastic art lovers in dirty macs. Thankfully we are cheered by the burlesque of the magic lanterns in 'The Cinema of Love', and by the great love scenes of the silver screen. Nine extracts play continually, from Bunuel's Un Chien Andolou to Zabriskie Point. Around us Valentino, Garbo and Rita Hayworth smoulder from promotional posters. The show closes on a note of purification with 'The Triumph of Love'. That proves another odd-ball assortment from Dante to Jim Dine, the latter's 'Twins in the Forest' a life-size and roughly hewn Adam and Eve ornamented with spanners, saws, scythes and any number of tool-shed cast-offs. Geddit?] L'Amore: Dall'Olympo all'alcova' continues at the Mole Antonelliana, Turin, until October 4.</p>

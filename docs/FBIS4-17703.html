			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature compiled by </F> Nikolai Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Mircea Snegur met on Wednesday morning  President of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic Stepan Topal  and chairman of the Gagauz parliament Mikhail Kendigelian. The  meeting was held behind closed doors and journalists in Kishinev  received official information of its results.    The spokesman for the Gagauz leader, Andrei Ibrishim, told  Interfax that the two presidents discussed status of the regions  densely populated by the Gagauz. He said that the bilateral  commission was working successfully and the draft law may be  worked out shortly and submitted to parliament within a month.    The spokesman refused to disclose the essence of the  discussed document. He said, However, it coincides largely with  the earlier bill on a special legal status of Gagauzia with  account of proposals of the CSCE standing commission and US  independent experts.    Another problem urgent for Snegur is the settlement of the  situation in Transdniestria. Chairman of the parliament of the  self-proclaimed Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic, Grigory  Marakutsa, said that another round of the  Moldovan-Transdniestrian talks would be held shortly. Leaders of  Kishinev and Tiraspol deputies of both parliaments and senior  Russian officials are expected to take part.    According to Marakutsa, following recent elections in  Moldova, the situation for Tiraspol changed for the better and  hopefully, the two sides will agree to compromise. The  Transdniestrian leader believes that Kishinev should agree to  the creation of a confederative state to settle the situation.  He said that Transdniestria will be part of such a state until  Moldova is a sovereign state. However, the official Kishinev is  flatly against the variant, said Marakutsa. Its rapprochement  with Romania has suspended so far and no one will guarantee that  this will never happen.</p>

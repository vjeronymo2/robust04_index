			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Falling under the spell of the frontier spirit: The creation of a giant 'super-regional' Chock-full of capital and with little in the way of new loan growth to look forward to on their home turf, America's stronger regional banks have been on a buying spree lately. Their ambition: the creation of the US's first true nationwide banking groups as they hunt for new sources of revenue. Mr Victor Riley, the 62-year-old chairman of KeyCorp whose career will be capped by a merger with Society Corp, yesterday summed up the mood: 'It was apparent that a continuation of expense reduction is not something that either of us could live on forever.' The hunt for higher revenues has taken banks into new markets and new product areas. By linking their branch systems, many hope to create bigger networks selling a broader range of products, such as mutual funds and other investment-related services. Inevitably, the demand has pushed up the price of banks with good distribution systems and sound balance sheets. The average purchase price for US banks has crept up to 2.5 times net asset value - a substantial premium over the valuation put by the stock market on the banking industry, which is below 2 times net assets, says Mr John Leonard, a regional banking analyst at Salomon. With such a premium, will the shareholders of expansion-minded banks end up disappointed? No bank has yet proved that it can make a success of running a nationwide business handling a wide range of products, says Thomas Brown, a banking analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. The KeyCorp/Society transaction, structured as a merger, does not involve the payment of a premium to either company's shareholders. However, it is based on the ambitious assumption that KeyCorp's branch network, built mainly around small businesses and individual customers, can be used to generate more business for Society's 'products'. These are based on specialised corporate lending and asset management for medium-sized businesses. Meanwhile, there appear to be few obstacles to the quickening pace of US regional bank mergers. Though some states - such as Missouri and Minnesota - still put restrictions on interstate banking, most have relaxed their rules. The biggest single obstacle remains the Southeast Compact: an agreement between 13 south-eastern states requiring banks in the region to maintain at least 80 per cent of their deposits there. Some, like South Carolina-based NationsBank, have reached further afield into other states, such as Texas, only because the compact does not apply to takeovers of banks which are receiving federal government support. Against this background, the pace of bank mergers has been picking up. While two big deals hogged the headlines at the start of the decade - BankAmerica's takeover of Security Pacific and Chemical's merger with Manufacturers Hanover - smaller regional transactions have been accelerating. Last year, bank mergers worth Dollars 8.5bn were announced; this year, the figure will be considerably higher. 'There have been a lot of acquisitions in the Dollars 3bn to Dollars 5bn range,' says Mr Leonard at Salomon. NationsBank and Banc One, from Ohio, have set the pace through acquisition in recent years, but there is a growing queue to follow them. The KeyCorp/Society merger will create a third geographically diverse 'super-regional' banking group. The question now: who will be next? Fleet Financial and PNC - among the US's top 15 banks in terms of assets - are the two most frequently singled out as likely merger candidates, either with each other or with other banks. Each has a strong local base (Fleet in New England, PNC in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Ohio), a healthy balance sheet and a good return on capital. Each also has a management which has expressed interest in expansion. BankAmerica, the US's second-biggest bank with an extensive presence in the west, is also waiting in the wings. However, the difficulty it is experiencing in swallowing Security Pacific and the recession in California are widely expected to keep it on the sidelines. With this growing list of merger candidates, it was not surprising yesterday to see KeyCorp and Society injecting a poison pill into their deal to dissuade rival suitors. Unsolicited bids among US banks have not been a feature of the latest takeover wave. But as the pace picks up and the list of attractive merger candidates shrinks, an unwanted bid looks increasingly likely.</p>

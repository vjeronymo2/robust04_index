			<p>CSO       [Text] The move by Citibank out of the Argentine Banking  Association (ABRA), comprised of foreign banks in Argentina, and  into the Association of Argentine Banks (ADEBA), made up of  private banks financed by Argentine capital, caused a "great  stir" in the national financial system, according to the 21  March Buenos Aires daily CLARIN. Made on the heels of the 21  February banking deregulation decree, the move, which  "significantly alters the balance of power between ABRA and  ADEBA," according to CLARTN of 10 March, may be the beginning of  "even greater bloodletting" from ABRA, as "part of a strategy to  force a merger of the two banking organizations." While ABRA was  unhappy about the Citibank decision, as well as fearful that  other members might follow suit, private Argentine banks were  pleased to have the country's most important foreign bank as a  new member of their group. "It is an honor for us," asserted  ADEBA head Eduardo Escasany.    The two banking organizations came out on opposite sides of  the debate over the new banking competitiveness rules, which  opened up the Argentine market to foreign banks without  requiring "reciprocity" from their home countries. ADEBA,  demanding reciprocity, was the first to "scream bloody murder"  over the new rules aimed at reducing interest rates and the cost  of banking services in general, according to the 9 March LA  NACION. On the other hand, ABRA said the measures would  "stimulate competition" while increasing efficiency. When asked  whether the "oversized" Argentine banking market, totaling 164  private and public banks according to Central Bank data, would  discourage foreign banks from establishing themselves in  Argentina, ABRA economic adviser Jorge Lopez replied that  investment banks linked to the capital market would probably be  interested as long as the market remained stable and profitable.  He doubted, however, that commercial banks would enter the  market due to high costs. Quilmes Bank official Carlos Perez  cited "the possible reduction in interest rates and an increase  in capital inflows" as advantages of market deregulation.  However, he pointed to the possibility of greater capital  outflows as a disadvantage. "Foreign banks will send their  profits back to their countries of origin."    According to the 13 March CLARIN, large banks in Brazil and  Chile as well as Spain's Bilbao Vizcaya Bank (BBV) have already  shown interest in taking advantage of the newly deregulated  Argentine banking market. Brazil's largest private banking  group, Bradesco (Brazilian Discount Bank), is "very interested"  in adding to its current network of 3,000 branches. If  successful in this endeavor, Bradesco will become the first  Brazilian bank in Buenos Aires to have an aggressive Mercosur  [Common Market of the South]-oriented policy. Although other  Brazilian banks have yet to "pound the local pavement,"  businessmen say that deregulation is attractive enough to bring  them to Argentina within the next few months. Among Chilean  banks said to be interested in the Argentine market are  O'Higgins, one of Chile's "heavyweights;" BICE, which belongs to  the Eleodoro Mate Group; and the Edwards Group, owner of the  daily EL MERCURIO. Among other Latin American countries, Uruguay  is the most likely candidate to enter the market, according to  CLARIN.</p>

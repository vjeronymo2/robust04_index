			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CHILDREN IN CRISIS NEED 'COOL HOMES'  </P> <P> Volunteers are being sought to provide temporary housing, known as "cool  homes," for children of families undergoing counseling for serious problems.  </P> <P> "It's a cooling off for both parents and kids," said Brenda Benedict, crisis  services outreach coordinator for Interface, a nonprofit family services group.  </P> <P> "If tempers are still high or if kids are afraid to go home, we offer them a  safe place to stay."  </P> <P> Interface now has 10 cool homes and is looking for about 10 more. Interface  reimburses families for the children's expenses during the four- to five-day  stay.  </P> <P> Home volunteers are licensed in the same manner as foster families, and undergo  a lengthy application process. "We . . . go out and look at the arrangement,"  Benedict said. KIM KASH  </P></p>

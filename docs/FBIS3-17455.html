			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview With Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich </F> by Mayak correspondent Yuliy Semenov on 23 March -- place not  given; From the "Panorama" program]    [Text] [Semenov] Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, to what extent do  you see a settlement of financial and economic relations with  Russia as a way out of Belarus's economic crisis?    [Kebich] I think that not only Belarus, but also Russia and  the other CIS countries should, within the framework of an  economic union above all, allow the free movement of goods.  There are enough borders, enough customs services, and enough  queues on the borders. Nevertheless, all those engaged in  smuggling are in one way or another getting their goods through.  We think, therefore, that the treaty that is due to be signed  between Russia and the Republic of Belarus will to all extents  and purposes be a treaty within the framework of an CIS economic  union. Here we are in no way against such an economic union.    [Semenov] Nevertheless, as far as I am aware, the talks are  proceeding fairly slowly, although they are under way. What is  your assessment of their progress at this moment of time?    [Kebich] Although an optimist, I have been becoming of late  a  somewhat superstitious person. Therefore, I should like to  touch wood and say that this union will nevertheless come about.  There are more people who see a benefit in this union than  people opposing it. This does not demand a lot of thought. In  this matter common sense shows, to take the example of Europe,  that the way to rescue one's economy or improve one's economic  state lies first and foremost in integration. We have already,  so to speak, been through a phase of disintegration, when we  have been breaking off all kinds of economic links. Just see  now how in one way or another all politicians are beginning to  be more sober in their judgements on this issue. Ukraine too is  displaying a serious approach to this union.    [Semenov] There is talk that it is a matter of reviving the  USSR in a new garb.    [Kebich] Not at all. It would be impossible now to revive  it, even, forgive me, by employing forcible methods. It would  be simply impossible for us to go back to the former set-up. I  regard such ideas as simply ridiculous.    [Semenov] You are indeed an ardent propagandist of the idea  that the problem of energy resources be tackled on equal terms  for Russian and Belarusian customers, if such a union is agreed  upon. Is that not so?    [Kebich] Yes, it is, but in general I do not see the issue  as, say, Russian fuel and energy prices being low and fuel and  energy prices for Belarus high. I am in favor of closer prices.    [Semenov] In favor of them drawing closer to world prices?    [Kebich] Certainly. I think that this will most likely occur  within the next 18 months, no later.    [Semenov] And now a final question: It is now clear that the  day and hour when Belarus will get its first president is not  far off, and you are being named as one of the politicians who  are morally entitled to stand for the presidency. Could you, to  some extent, now define your position in this regard? If you  intend to stand, under what banner and relying on whom will you  set about the elections?    [Kebich] A law on presidential elections has not yet been  adopted. I am not entitled at the present time to say that I  would be a presidential candidate, until a law on presidential  elections is in existence. However, if I had occasion to stand  as a presidential candidate, I would nevertheless give top  priority to economic links with the CIS countries and with the  great Russian people, who are close to us spiritually, while, of  course, still observing the statehood of the Republic of  Belarus.</p>

In a survey conducted by the pressure group, Hong Kong  Policy  Viewers, only 26 per cent of 660 respondents said the PWC  represented Hong Kong people.    Forty per cent said the group did not represent them while  the remaining respondents, or 32 per cent, said they doubted  whether the PWC would represent their views.    The people who were questioned also said they were  dissatisfied with the present representation and appointment  system of the PWC.    PWC members are appointed by the Chinese government on the  recommendations of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and  the Xinhua News Agency, China's de facto embassy in the  territory.    The poll found that 63 per cent of the respondents were  dissatisfied with the choice and the manner in which the PWC  members were appointed, while only 15 per cent said they were  satisfied.    Spokesman for Hong Kong Policy Viewers, Simon Chiu, said  these figures showed the PWC did not have much credibility in  the eyes of Hong Kong people.    During the recent political row between Britain and China,  Governor Chris Patten said the PWC did not represent the view of  Hong Kong people.    But Chinese officials have maintained the PWC spoke for the  people of Hong Kong.    Chiu called on the Chinese government to appoint people from  different political camps to make it more accountable to the  people of Hong Kong so that it will have the trust of the people  of Hong Kong.    He said some of the PWC's meetings should be opened to the  public and the press.    "By opening some parts of their meetings to the press,  people  in Hong Kong can find out what the PWC is doing and have a  better understanding of its function," Chiu said.    He also called on the Chinese government to set up a better  channel through which the public can to express its views to the  PWC. [sentence as published]    The survey found that 48 per cent of respondents did not  believe the existing channel would allow the PWC to gather their  views while 31 per cent had reservations.    Chiu said the Hong Kong Policy Viewers would ask to meet PWC  members to voice their concerns.    The survey was carried out in the last two weeks of  December.</p>

Sunday February 20 NATO Ultimatum  to Bosnian Serbs Expires. Discussion in the Duma"]    [Text] The bombing of the territory of the former  Yugoslavia must not be allowed -- that demand was expressed in  all the speeches from Russian State Duma deputies at the  parliamentary hearings held by the State Duma's Committee on  Questions of Geopolitics under the chairmanship of the  historian, Viktor Ustinov.    During the discussion N. Stolyarov, the committee's deputy  chairman, asked this question: Will peace reign as a result of  the planned and coordinated third-party intervention in the  Balkan crisis? "It may be said unambiguously and with a great  degree of accuracy: No, no, no!" he said. The possible bombing  of the Bosnian Serbs will be the result of an inhuman and  dishonest political game. Russia must in no circumstances be a  party to this conflict.    A. Frolov, a member of the Geopolitics Committee, stressed  that since Russia's withdrawal from the ranks of the great  powers all the peacemaking missions conducted under the UN flag  have turned into unilateral interference in the internal affairs  of various states. Today we are seeing NATO's anti-Serb  tendency. With regard to this conflict Russia, regrettably, has  for a long time now not had a position of its own based on its  national and state interests.    Deputy Mikhaylov, a spokesman for the Defense Committee,  focused his speech on the fact that the present situation on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia is a consequence of the  shortsighted position taken by Russia on the Balkans. Russia's  leaders must do everything possible to prevent the barbarous and  inhuman bombing action.    Deputy N. Krivelskaya from the Security Committee asked  representatives of the Foreign Ministry: If Russia does not  exercise its right of veto in the Security Council, how will  Russia's foreign policy line be implemented at all?    In the course of the hearings parliamentarians came to the  conclusion that the UN Security Council's imposition of economic  sanctions on Yugoslavia, sanctions which Russia supported, has  done tremendous harm both to Yugoslavia itself and to other  countries and has shown itself to be completely ineffective.  Russia cannot accept the fact of air strikes against the Serb  positions because this act goes beyond the framework of the UN  Security Council's decision under Article 40 of the UN Charter.  Russia cannot accept the thrust of an ultimatum directed  against the Serbs alone. The State Duma asks all the warring  sides to call a cease-fire, completely demilitarize the Sarajevo  region, withdraw the troops and heavy artillery from the city,  and place the Sarajevo region under UN control. The deputies of  the Russian State Duma take the initiative of asking the  parliaments of the UN member states to immediately convene a  special conference on the settlement of the conflict by peaceful  means.</p>

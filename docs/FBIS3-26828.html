			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Third of seven installments: Report on interview with Hu </F> Angang [5170 7254 6921] and Kang Xiaoguang [1660 2556 0342]  specialists of the Group for Analyzing the National Situation,  under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, by staff reporter Liu Lu  (0491 7216); place, date not given: "Anticorruption  Perspective: `Keep the Armed Forces With Taxes,' and the Armed  Forces Must Be Prohibited From Engaging in Business"]    [Text] Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said that they put  forward five major reform proposals, and one of them was to  prohibit the armed forces from engaging in business and to  maintain the armed forces with tax revenues.    Hu and Kang explained: In a modern country, the armed forces  should be kept with government appropriations and must not be  allowed to engage in business activities. This is beyond  question. "We hold that the armed forces can be maintained only  with government appropriations, and must not engage in business  activities, so the armed forces should be supported with tax  revenues. At present, only in a very small number of countries,  such as Indonesia and Thailand, are the armed forces engaged in  business activities. In such countries, the degree of  corruption in the armed forces is very serious. There, the  armed forces have become a special interest group, independent  from state interests, a group that seeks its own political,  economic, and military interests. International experience  shows that allowing the armed forces to do business is  equivalent to giving a green light to corruption in the armed  forces."    Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang then changed their talk from  international practice to China's reality: Since the 1980's,  the Chinese armed forces have been deeply involved in  large-scale business activities, which have spread to all three  services and the three general departments of the headquarters.  All military regions, provincial military districts, and field  armies have set up their own business companies to pursue  profits and increase their own financial incomes in order to  make up for the serious insufficiencies in military expenses.  As a result, this has quickened the pace of commercialization,  localization, and corruption in the armed forces. The military  officers have always been discontented with such developments.    However, the financial capacity of the central government  has  remained at a very low level. Although China's gross national  product increased by more than 100 percent after 1978, the  government still could not support the 3 million troops and  repeatedly required the troops to "endure" difficulties. It  allowed the troops to engage in business so that they might  increase their income. This was a major failure of the central  government in performing its functions, and was also a  shortsighted practice that would result only in ruining national  defense and sowing the seeds of future turmoil and unrest in  China. Therefore, they put forward following proposals:    -- Strictly prohibiting the armed forces from engaging in  business. Business companies of all types established and run  by the armed forces should be closed down. This should include  the farms run by all military units. The assets may be  transferred or auctioned off. The military units cannot take  part in any profit-making economic activities, and should not be  allowed to receive any gifts or allowances from local  governments and civilian institutions.    -- The military budget should be increased substantially,  and  the armed forces should be maintained with state tax revenues.  Military expenses should come entirely from the government's  financial appropriations, which should be sufficient for  maintaining the normal operations of the armed forces in  peacetime. That is, it is necessary to ensure that the armed  forces' income in real terms will increase at a rate slightly  higher than the growth rate of the average income of the  civilian people throughout the country. Special appropriations  should be made in wartime to make up for the insufficiency in  military expenses. The scheme of "supporting the armed forces  with tax revenues" may be put into practice in two steps.  First, supporting the regular units with tax revenue, and  strictly prohibiting the field armies, the navy, and the air  force from engaging in business activities. Second, strictly  prohibiting all troops from engaging in business activities.    -- Part of the public property for national defense may be  produced through the market. For example, military provisions,  medicine, clothing, and other supplies, as well as airports,  roads, equipment, and instruments can be produced by  manufacturers that bid for orders placed by the military. Thus,  the armed forces do not need to strive for "self-sufficiency" by  arranging the production of everything they need. The General  Logistics Department will be just a "big buyer," and it will  decide what to buy from the market and will not be responsible  for what to produce. Most military enterprises should be  separated from the regular establishment of the armed forces so  that the size of the armed forces can be streamlined as well,  with noncombat units being reduced.    -- Redefining the armed forces' tasks and reducing excessive  nonmilitary expenditures. In modern society, the armed forces  should not perform too many functions and shoulder  responsibilities and burdens that are too heavy. Their major  function is to defend the country, and they should mainly be a  fighting force rather than a productive force. The armed forces  should not be turned into a major force in industrial production  or an entity in economic activities. They should not get  involved in the market economy or participate in any  profit-seeking or illicit business activities; still less should  they participate in local economic construction and be turned  into an unpaid or low-paid labor force. Of course, resisting  disasters and rescuing disaster-stricken people will remain one  of the functions the armed forces should perform. The armed  forces in all countries perform such functions.</p>

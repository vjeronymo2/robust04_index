			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: German shipbuilder sees surplus Bremer Vulkan, Germany's biggest shipbuilding group, yesterday forecast double-digit profits for the full year, following a DM191m (Dollars 119m) loss last time. The Bremen-based company said orders in the first six months had risen 32 per cent over the same period a year earlier, to DM2.9bn, with enough work to last until mid-1996. Bremer Vulkan said earlier this year it hoped to restart dividend payments in 1995. The group reported a DM3.8m loss for the first six months, compared with a profit of DM22m in the same period the year before. The restructuring measures and redundancies begun in the second half of last year were beginning to take effect, it said. About 2,600 workers lost their jobs in the first six months and a further 1,300 are due to go before the end of the year, bringing the group's workforce down to 24,000. Helped by the first-time consolidation of several new subsidiaries, turnover jumped 21 per cent in the first six months to DM3.16bn. Excluding the consolidation of the shipbuilding activities at the east German dock of Stralsund and other companies in the east German port of Rostock, turnover rose 2 per cent. Shipbuilding still makes up about 40 per cent of group turnover but the company is expanding its electronics, industrial and trading divisions.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Limited route for saving tax Sir, In the article 'Vehicles to catch before it's too late' in your Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (January 29) it is suggested that an individual receiving interest gross from a bank or building society account could save tax by closing and then reopening a savings account. This would take advantage of the 'prior year basis' of assessment, and falling interest rates, by ensuring that the tax charge this year was on a lower figure. Generally, this is appropriate only for interest received from the National Savings Bank. Otherwise, interest will in the main only be paid without deduction of tax by a bank or building society to an individual where the depositor has registered on Inland Revenue form R85 as a person not expected to be liable to tax. If that expectation is realised, no tax will be payable in any event. Second, and more importantly, the 'prior year basis' of assessment ceased to apply to such interest from April 1991. Such interest is now assessed on the 'current year basis'. Christopher French, head of financial policy, The Building Societies Association, 3 Saville Row, London W1X 1AF</p>

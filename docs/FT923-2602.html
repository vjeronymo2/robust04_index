			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / BR seeks ruling against strike BRITISH Rail confirmed yesterday that it was seeking an injunction against the RMT rail union, which has organised a one-day strike at a Manchester station. The action, planned for tomorrow, is over the dismissal of four guards at Manchester's Piccadilly station. BR says it sacked the four men because they took illegal strike action, inciting others to do the same. The RMT says BR breached a local staffing agreement.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANGS LEAVE GRAFFITI IN COURTHOUSE OFFICES  </P> <P> When prosecutors arrived for work this week at the San Fernando Courthouse,  where many violent gang members are brought to trial, they were startled to  discover gang slogans and nicknames scrawled over the walls of the supposedly  secure offices.  </P> <P> The discovery Tuesday alarmed prosecuting attorneys and caused San Fernando  Superior Court Judge John H. Majors to order all the outside locks changed.  </P> <P> Majors also barred the courthouse maintenance crew from the building and  notified Los Angeles County officials that he wants the company's contract  terminated. He concluded the only way an outsider could have entered the locked  offices is with the help of maintenance workers.  </P> <P> "No one had access to these offices with the exception of the cleaning people,"  Majors said.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter added: "It makes a mockery out of the  whole idea of a security system if, after hours, anybody can come in here and  do anything they want."  </P> <P> Gang slogans about the size of a hand were scrawled in black marking pen on  walls, in the women's restroom and on a blackboard where the status of trials  is listed. More markings were left on numerous pieces of paper inside the  private office of a supervising attorney who assigns trials to other deputies.  </P> <P> The discovery prompted fears by judges and prosecutors that others could enter  the courthouse after hours and plant bombs or hide guns for criminal  defendants.  </P> <P> "It was an eerie feeling to walk in in the morning and see that," said Percy  Ruffner, a legal assistant. "They were dropping little hints that they are  here. It's scary to realize that you are not safe here."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison, who prosecutes gang members and has 15  gang-related murder cases pending, at first said he feared someone might have  tampered with his case files and identified witnesses. But the files turned out  to be secure inside a locked cabinet.  </P> <P> Maintenance workers are the only people with unrestricted access to all the  offices in the building, including prosecutors' offices and judges' chambers,  Majors said.  </P> <P> The judge said he believes some workers might have given copies of the keys to  friends who are gang members, and he said he will find a new company to provide  courthouse maintenance. He could not immediately fire the company, however,  because it holds an extended contract with the county. But he said he had begun  the process of replacing the firm.  </P> <P> James Lee, owner of American Oriental Maintenance, whose workers have cleaned  the San Fernando Courthouse for about three years, denied that any of his  employees are gang members but conceded that they may have allowed friends into  the building while they were working.  </P> <P> He said his company will try to retain its contract to clean the courthouse and  added that the same workers have cleaned the building for several years without  problems.  </P> <P> Lee also contends that prosecutors have overreacted to what may have been  nothing more than a prank.  </P> <P> Nison, however, said the incident raises questions about how carefully private  companies screen employees that have unrestricted access to the courthouse.  </P> <P> "That's the most frightening thing," he said. "They should realize they have to  hire people who aren't going to compromise the security of the courthouse."  </P></p>

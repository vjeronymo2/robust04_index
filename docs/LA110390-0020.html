			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOROUGHBRED RACING TAKES A TRAGIC FALL  </P> <P> After watching the Breeders' Cup, I have changed my view on horse racing.  </P> <P> Is it fair for us to use these innocent animals and put their bodies through  such treacherous torment merely for our own entertainment and gambling  pleasure? Three horses were killed on this same day because of our own selfish  enjoyment.  </P> <P> Although horses are born to run, we should not force them to run and increase  their risk of a fatal injury, whether it be a heart attack or a broken bone.  Until enough of us decide to ban such a heartless sport, this cruelty to  animals will continue and more innocent horses' lives will be lost.  </P> <P> JOE CYPHER  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

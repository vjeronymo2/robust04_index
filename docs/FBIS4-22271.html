			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin: "The Proposition Concerning </F> Moscow's Neoimperial Ambitions: It Is Hardly Expedient for the  West To Try To Persuade Russia of This"]    [Text] The pinning of various labels on Russia's foreign  policy has been fashionable as of late overseas. The most  prevalent has been the proposition concerning the revival of  great-power ambitions. It is maintained that Moscow's "imperial  policy" is not some new phenomenon, it is inherent, it is said,  in the very nature of the Russian state. The democratic focus of  Russia's foreign policy is being called in question on these  grounds. Some Western politicians are even outlining the  standards of behavior in international affairs which Russia does  not have the right to transgress. For disobedience, such  punishments as an end to the organization of the strategic  partnership with Moscow, the accelerated admittance of the  Central and East European countries to NATO, a revision of the  plans for rendering Russia economic assistance, and much else  are threatened.    Our opponents are particularly irritated by the fact that  Russia is today organizing its foreign policy in accordance with  its national priorities, giving relations with the states of the  CIS and the Baltic pride of place. This has afforded a pretext  for Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian opposition,  to talk about realization of a "Kozyrev-Zhirinovskiy doctrine  for the purpose of restoration of the Union." Polish Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski is constantly talking about the  imperialist trends in Russia's foreign policy. Individual  participants in a recent international security conference in  Munich displayed their inordinate concern at the way in which  Russia is defending its national interests.    Quite sharply worded anti-Russian statements were heard at  an  international seminar on Central Asia and the Caucasus in  Tehran. They boil down to Russia being fingered as the principal  source of danger for the independence and sovereignty of the CIS  countries. Inventions concerning recompense for those same  imperial ambitions of Moscow and its involvement in the  incitement of regional conflicts are being whipped up. People in  the near abroad are also, to our great distress, being pulled  into this unseemly campaign at times. Lennart Meri, president of  Estonia, and Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the Supreme Council  of Ukraine Foreign Affairs Committee, like to expatiate apropos  Moscow's "imperial subterfuges."    Russia, like any important power, has its own geopolitical  reference points. Moscow cannot formulate its foreign policy on  assurances of like-mindedness and solidarity. Together with a  concurrence of interests it has also specific zones of priority  attention. This, it would seem, is an attribute of international  relations. The United States, for example, has repeatedly  declared Latin America and the Near East regions of its direct  interests. According to American press information, Washington  has ranked far-off Lithuania here also. Vilnius deems relations  with countries of Central and North Europe a priority. In Warsaw  Hanna Suchocka, former prime minister, constructed four main  areas of Poland's foreign policy activity. The Russian area is  mentioned only in the context of the Republic of Poland's  membership of NATO.    American observers, incidentally, do not reject the concept  recognizing the right to exist of regional spheres of influence  of the leading world powers, Russia included. Its essence is  that in their zones they are in that case required to act in  accordance with the rules of international law and under the  scrutiny of the world community in the shape of regional  associations. It is symptomatic that British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd considers the fact of Russia's interests in the  Baltic region perfectly normal.    Attributing neoimperial postulates to Moscow in this context  is not only unethical but inappropriate. It is not pursuing  tactics of intimidation or domination in any regions of the  world and is not undermining the independence of other states.  Russia does not have territorial claims on anyone, and its new  military doctrine is geared exclusively to defensive purposes.  Which cannot be said about that same Estonia, which is making  territorial claims on a number of areas of Pskov Oblast. One  wonders how far these claims are compatible with the aspiration  to become a full member of NATO, not to mention the Helsinki  accords and the Paris Charter for a New Europe.    Russia is oriented toward the European system of general  security which is being formed. It treats respectfully the forms  of international interaction which are being tested. But the  West sometimes thinks differently. Attempts are made at times to  impose its viewpoint on Russia at the time of the discussion of  problems of the former Yugoslavia and the Libya and Iraq  situation. Such a policy without Moscow is doomed to fail. It  would inevitably lead to a new spiraling of opposition in Europe.    Russia's expansion is discerned also in its peace-making  efforts at "flash points" of the former USSR. The epithets with  which Moscow is being rewarded for its mediating mission in the  disengagement of the belligerents are innumerable. It is being  recalled constantly that the CSCE has the key role in a  settlement of the conflicts on the territory of the CIS. But  Russia has never disputed the significance of such missions of  this organization, as, equally, CSCE circles recognize Russia's  efforts for a settlement of the conflict situations in certain  former Soviet republics. But the CSCE alone is not in a position  to extinguish the interethnic clashes in the former USSR. Local  national leaders have been forced into this conclusion also,  although there is not complete unanimity between them, of  course. In a joint message to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali,  Eduard Shevardnadze and Boris Yeltsin proposed consideration as  soon as possible in the UN Security Council of the issue of a  peacekeeping operation performed by the United Nations or with  its approval in Abkhazia based, if need be, on a Russian  military contingent.    There has been no adequate response in the West as yet to  Russia's sincere desire to establish peace at operational points  of the CIS. There is, I believe, just one reason: fear of  Russian hegemony on the territory of the post-Soviet space.    Russia's endeavor to protect the elementary rights of the  Russian-speaking population in Estonia, Latvia, and other  republics of the former USSR has been christened "great-power  approach" in certain overseas circles. Moscow's efforts in this  direction, of a diplomatic nature, as a rule, are seen as  nothing other than "political pressure, economic blackmail, and  aggressive intentions," and Estonia unabashedly employs the term  "intervention" even. And this despite the fact that only 42,300  Russians have Estonian citizenship, whereas the total number of  Russians in the Republic of Estonia constitutes approximately  half a million. And it is very odd that such discrimination is  proving no hindrance to the process of enlisting the Baltic in  Western security structures which has begun. The concerted  actions of the West in defense of the suffrage and civil rights  of the nonindigenous population in the Baltic would undoubtedly  weaken the anti-Russian campaign there and would be a serious  test of the viability of the policy of partnership. The findings  of international civil rights organizations are going in one ear  and out the other in Tallinn and Riga, meanwhile. And more  pressure is being put on Russia in respect to withdrawal of the  troops. It is not that far off, but Russian people will remain  here. And if the discrimination against them continues, will  this not threaten a repetition. Other countries have repeatedly  demonstrated to the world far from legal means and methods for  defense of the interests of their citizens. And public protests  were barely audible. Russia's position on this issue, however,  is for some reason or other invariably equated with "imperial  policy." It is hardly expedient to prompt Moscow to come to  believe in its "hegemonism."</p>

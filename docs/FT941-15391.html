			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Citibank tries to woo Muscovites Citibank, braving uncertainty about the rights of western banks in Russia, yesterday became the first to open a subsidiary in Moscow, writes Leyla Boulton. The new bank was inaugurated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, in Moscow for the US-Russian summit, and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, Russian central bank chairman. Mr Gerashchenko last year gave licences to a dozen western banks but their terms were curtailed by a presidential decree issued to woo Russian bankers ahead of last month's parliamentary poll. The decree said banks which received full banking licences but were more than 50 per cent western-owned could not serve Russian residents until January 1996. This in theory restricted them to offshore banking functions. President Boris Yeltsin later back-tracked on the decree - designed to meet banks' demands for protection from foreign competition - by telling the European Union terms would be softened for their banks. But nothing similar has been said to the Americans, or to third countries such as Turkey, whose Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi has agreed to cut its shareholding in a joint venture with Russia's Toko Bank to 50 from 51 per cent in order to evade restrictions imposed by the decree</p>

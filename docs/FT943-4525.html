			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Shop sales help Frost rise 34% Sales from branded corner shops were behind a 46 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits at Frost Group, the UK's largest independent petrol retailer. In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits reached Pounds 4.88m (Pounds 3.34m) on turnover up 32 per cent to Pounds 108.2m (Pounds 81.8m). Earnings per share amounted to 5.2p (4.2p) and a dividend of 2.7p (2.2p) will be paid. Mr James Frost, chairman, said the profits rise reflected 'not only the acquisition programme of the last two to three years, but also the advances made in our forecourt shops.' Since the beginning of 1994 Frost, which trades as Save Service Stations, has purchased or exchanged contracts on 37 new sites, bringing the total to 213 petrol filling stations or sites. Further acquisitions were likely, he said. The chairman said sales in the forecourt shops had been buoyant through the recession and overall margins had been helped by the Smilies branded corner shops introduced 18 months ago. 'We are replacing the traditional corner shop with a service to the local community,' Mr John Murgatroyd, finance director, said. Mr Frost said motor fuel sales looked 'more positive than at any time over the past three years'. The company's intention was to enter the motor fuel wholesaling market next year and it would target a small number of the 12,000 privately owned petrol filling stations in the UK to supply under the Save brand. Mr Frost said sales on a site by site basis had been maintained despite a 2.3 per cent reduction in national motor fuel sales following the introduction of additives to improve engine efficiency. Last October Frost made a 5-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 21.3m. At the interim stage it had net cash of Pounds 3m.</p>

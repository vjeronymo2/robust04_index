			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Nato jets strike at Bosnian Serbs: More attacks threatened over seizure of weapons Nato jets launched an attack in Bosnia yesterday and threatened more strikes after Serb troops seized a tank and other weapons under United Nations control, violating the Sarajevo security zone. The Nato attack by 14 jets was the first since April and highlights the increasing pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, who have been left isolated this week by their refusal to endorse an international peace plan for the region. Lt Gen Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, called for the strike after Bosnian Serb forces ignored threats that they faced an attack if they violated a heavy weapon exclusionary zone around the capital. He said the only target hit was a Serb armoured vehicle fitted with a heavy 76mm gun, known as a tank buster. He warned that if the Serbs did not return the heavy weapons as they had promised, more air attacks would be launched against them. 'At 18:32 (16:32 GMT) Nato aircraft engaged a target of the Bosnian Serb army that was in violation of the total exclusion zone around Sarajevo. The target was a tank buster that was engaged by cannon and we think destroyed,' Gen Rose said. British, American, Dutch and French aircraft, based at Gioia Colle in southern Italy, took part in the raid on four targets, but all bar two US jets failed to engage their targets due to 'weather and other difficulties'. The raid comes a day after Serbia itself cut links with the self-declared Bosnian Serb state. Telephone links and border traffic between the two Serb neighbours were closed yesterday, further isolating the Bosnian Serb leadership in Pale. In April, allied planes bombed Serb targets in the UN-designated safe area around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. Since then, Bosnian Serbs have fired on UN troops and ignored warnings to stay away from exclusionary zones. The UN hesitated to retaliate in the hope of fashioning a peace agreement, but Bosnian Serb leaders on Wednesday rejected a western-brokered peace deal that would partition Bosnia-Hercegovina almost equally between Serbs and the Croat-Moslem coalition. Early yesterday, a T-55 tank, anti-aircraft gun and two armoured personnel carriers were taken in a raid on a UN weapons collections point in Ilidza, a suburb of Sarajevo. Mr Fred Eckart, UN spokesman in New York, said the attack was justified by the weapons seizure and the subsequent shooting at a French helicopter sent to retrieve the equipment. After the attack, UN officials said Bosnian Serbs had indicated they would return all weapons taken from the UN store. The Serb officials were said to have regretted taking the equipment. Nato has more than 100 aircraft based in Italy, from where past strikes have been launched. The planes enforce an international ban on military flights over Bosnia and offer support to UN peacekeepers on the ground. Milosevic blocks traffic to Bosnia, Page 2</p>

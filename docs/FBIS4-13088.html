			<p>BFN     [Text] In Jammu and Kashmir, security forces claim to have  achieved notable success in their operations against the  militants. One hundred and three militants were killed during  the last month. Security forces have seized more than 13,000  weapons, including 11 lakh ammunition, and about 40,000  grenades. An official spokesman told our Jammu correspondent  that this is mainly because of cooperation being extended by  people who are fed up with militancy sponsored by Pakistan.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ERRATIC WINDS HELP FUEL RAGING MT. LAGUNA BLAZE  </P> <P> A raging fire, fueled by erratic winds and dry chaparral, burned out of control  on Mt. Laguna late Sunday night, threatening residents of a nearby Indian  reservation and forcing the evacuation of campers.  </P> <P> By 8 p.m., the blaze, which began about 8 a.m. Sunday, already had claimed more  than 2,000 acres in Thing Valley near Laguna Mountain Road, about 35 miles east  of San Diego near Interstate 8, officials said.  </P> <P> Although no one had been injured and no structures had been destroyed by that  time, the fire, dubbed the "Thing" by firefighters, was spreading quickly in  two directions through the steep, chaparral-covered mountains, forestry  officials said.  </P> <P> "It's going like a freight train," said Rosalinda Ewen, a spokeswoman for the  U.S. Forestry Service.  </P> <P> Another fire, at Morettis Junction between Highways 79 and 76 near Lake  Henshaw, earlier claimed some 40 acres. But that blaze, which began about 12:35  p.m. Sunday, was nearly contained by nightfall, officials said.  </P> <P> Authorities were unsure of how long it would take to stifle the Mt. Laguna  blaze, which was heading both north and south of the valley.  </P> <P> Some officials, however, indicated it might take at least several days to  collar the fire.  </P> <P> More than 400 firefighters and 20 engines from 14 local, state and U.S.  forestry crews battled the blaze on the steep terrain, while five air tankers  and eight helicopters tried to snuff it out from above, according to officials.  </P> <P> "The winds are 15 to 20 m.p.h., and it's very rocky terrain, very dry, heavy  brush," said Audrey Hagen, a spokeswoman for the California Department of  Forestry. "We haven't had a normal rainfall, so it's very, very dry out there  in the back country."  </P> <P> The Mt. Laguna blaze is the largest of several fires this summer in and around  San Diego County, officials said.  </P> <P> In just one day, it destroyed more land than last week's Dogpatch blaze, which  burned about 1,150 acres.  </P> <P> Authorities cleared the Burnt Rancheria campground of visitors before the fire  swept through. Residents of the Cuyaipe Indian reservation, home of the  Southern Diegueno Tribe, late Sunday were being allowed to stay in their homes,  officials said.  </P> <P> "We have strike teams out there to protect those structures," Hagen said.  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol officials had closed Sunrise Highway near Interstate  8 by early Sunday evening.  </P></p>

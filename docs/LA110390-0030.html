			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> DEFENSE QUESTIONS CENTRAL PARK JOGGER  </P> <P> The scarred woman known as the Central Park jogger was cross-examined for the  first time since she was gang-raped and nearly beaten to death. One defense  lawyer refused to question her, but the other asked about her sex life, her job  competence, her physical condition, her memory and whether she had been  assaulted by the men in her life.  </P> <P> Many of his questions were not answered because the prosecution's objections  were sustained. Two of six teen-agers indicted in the attack are on trial now  on charges of rape, assault and attempted murder. The lawyer for defendant  Kharey Wise suggested that the woman's injuries were less serious than the  prosecution claimed and that a man she knew might have attacked her.  </P></p>

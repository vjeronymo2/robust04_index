			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Time Warner in joint Japanese TV venture The US entertainment group Time Warner is planning to form a joint venture with two Japanese companies, Itochu and Toshiba, and the US regional telephone company US West, to spend Dollars 400m on building cable television systems in Japan. Although both Time Warner and US West declined to comment, a spokeswoman for Toshiba in Tokyo yesterday confirmed that the four companies were considering joining forces to set up a company to develop the Japanese cable market. 'We are still in the middle of discussions, but we may finalise a decision soon,' she said. She would not give details and said nothing concrete had been decided. Toshiba and Itochu are already linked to Time Warner through their joint ownership of a 12.5 per cent stake in Time Warner Entertainment, the subsidiary which runs the group's cable television operations. US West owns 25 per cent of the business. Earlier this month Tele-Communications, the largest US cable operator, announced a joint venture with the Sumitomo Corporation to develop cable systems in Japan.</p>

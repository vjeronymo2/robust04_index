The appointment came  some days after Yakovlev had been telephoned by Sergey Filatov,  head of the president's administration, who had offered him the  post, saying that the offer had come from Boris Yeltsin  personally.    Asked by IZVESTIYA what his official duties would be and  what  was behind the establishment of the post, Aleksandr Yakovlev  made the following comment:    "It is not a new post. It was filled in the Russian Supreme  Soviet by Anatoliy Sliva, deputy chief of the State Law  Administration. The functions of the president's representative  in the Federal Assembly stem from the constitutional rights and  duties of the head of state in relation to the legislative body.  As is known, the president is entitled to initiate legislation.  Moreover, according to article 83, he will submit for approval  by the Federal Assembly candidates for the following posts --  government chairman, chairman of the Central Bank, judges of the  Constitutional, Supreme, and Supreme Arbitration Courts, and  also general prosecutor. The president needs a skilled lawyer  to successfully perform the aforementioned functions.    [IZVESTIYA] Does this mean that this is the president's way  of avoiding constant contacts with legislators?    [Yakovlev] Of course not. Depending on the importance of  the question under consideration, the president will address the  deputies of both parliaments. For example, he will soon be  delivering a message to parliament. My role is to help with  legal advice and consultations, ensure feedback betweenm the  head of state and the Federal Assembly, and break down  information barriers. And, if need be, put the lid on any  conflicts that might be brewing.    [IZVESTIYA] How often do you intend to visit the Duma and  the Federation Council?    [Yakovlev] I will have to go there regularly. At any rate,  whenever presidential draft laws are being examined.    Aleksandr Yakovlev is a doctor of juridical sciences. Since  1975 he has headed the criminal law and criminology sector at  the Institute of State and Law, where he will continue to work  on half pay. Yakovlev links the inivtation to join the  president's team to his recent conspicuous participation in the  work of the Constitutional Conference as one of the coordinators  of the group of representatives of the federal organs of  authority.    The post of representative of the head of state in the  Federal Assembly is an addition to the structure of the  president's administration. Aleksandr Yakovlev and his  apparatus, comprising several lawyers, will be located in  Staraya Ploshchad.</p>

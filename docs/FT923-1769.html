			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (7): 'Brain drain' worries region  -Britain's brightest students are using their skills on the mainland NORTHERN Ireland produces some of the brightest academics in Britain. However, few of them stay on to play a part in revitalising the country's most economically depressed region. While pupils in Northern Ireland achieve higher marks than pupils elsewhere at A-level, one third of those who go on to higher education each year do so, not in local universities, but in the rest of Britain. 'Many of them are our science and technology 'high fliers' and many do not come home to pursue their careers and play their part in economic regeneration and social progress,' Lord Grey of Naunton, Chancellor of the University of Ulster, said at a summer graduation ceremony this year. 'This is our own 'brain drain' and is not something which Northern Ireland - which relies so much on its indigenous human resources as opposed to mineral wealth - can afford,' he said. A recently qualified first class honours graduate at the ceremony summed up his feelings: 'There is limited scope for me in Ulster. I don't particularly want to leave the province but from a career point of view I've got little alternative. Obtaining a degree does not guarantee me anything.' Education standards compare favourably with those of England and Wales - 26.3 per cent of Ulster pupils achieved two or more A-levels in 1989/90 compared with 20.1 per cent in England and 17.4 per cent in Wales. Just over 27 per cent of 18-year-olds in Northern Ireland enter higher education compared to just over 19 per cent in the rest of Britain, according to figures for 1990/91. At the other end of the attainment spectrum, however, the position is disturbing. More pupils leave school without a qualification of any kind in Northern Ireland than in any other region of Britain. Roman Catholic teenagers are more likely to be in such a position. A report commissioned by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights identified a 'significant minority' of Catholic schools where a high proportion of male school leavers are unqualified. The latest statistics show that almost 16 per cent of Catholics leaving have no qualifications. Social and economic disadvantage allied to low self-esteem have been cited as possible factors in the poor performance. Two new Catholic schools are to be built in Belfast and Londonderry at a cost of Pounds 8m. The schools will provide 15,000 places and will address the shortage of places for Catholic pupils. Education in Northern Ireland is undergoing radical change with the reforms reflecting the particular needs of the province. The government encourages educating Protestant and Roman Catholic children together, although it is not policy to impose integrated schools on parents. Several integrated schools at primary and secondary level have been set up and more are in the pipeline but, while an important area, it remains small in terms of total pupil enrollment. The aim of the reform programme in Northern Ireland is to provide a system which can raise standards and give parents a wider choice. Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland maintains the 11-Plus tests whereby a place in grammar or secondary school depends largely on a pupil's performance in two of mental agility tests. The new examination structure marks a shift towards continual assessment and will test children at the ages of eight, 11 and 14. It means that next year thousands of Ulster children will face a three day examination on top of the controversial 11-Plus tests. Primary seven pupils will be sitting new exams in English, maths and science in February, just three months after the 11-Plus tests. While the 1993 tests are a dummy run before they become official in the 1993/94 school year and replace the 11-Plus, educationalists have voiced fears that, if the results of the new tests differ substantially from the 11-Plus exams, public confidence in the new system will be undermined. While anything which does away with the pass-or-fail syndrome system of the 11-Plus will be generally welcomed, teachers unions argue that, if the assessment is to be completed within working hours, it will be at the expense of teaching pupils. Teachers, they say, are already overstretched, under-valued and leaving the profession in large numbers. But the government says the changes will help maintain Northern Ireland's reputation for good quality education. Current education spending, at just over Pounds 1bn a year, represents a rise of 21 per cent in real terms over the past 10 years. However, the IRA's campaign has thrown up added problems for many schools. Last year the cost of criminal damage and injury claims arising from concerted bombing attacks on commercial targets led to a moratorium on public spending. Although the temporary spending freeze was lifted in April, a number of important school projects were delayed.</p>

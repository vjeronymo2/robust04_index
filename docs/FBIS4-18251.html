			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Monitored in progress] </F>   [Excerpt] ...A UN report on Somalia, which so far has been  kept secret, has been leaked. The report, written by General  Gustav Haegglund, the future commander in chief of the Finnish  Defense Forces, and two others, criticizes peace enforcement  projects such as Somalia and recommends remaining within the  traditional peacekeeping operations. The controversial report  was written in February, but it has not been presented to the  Security Council. Johanna Gallant reports from Washington:    [Begin Gallant recording] According to the 200-page report,  the UN and the United States share responsibility with clan  leader Mohamed Farah Aidid on the bloody confrontations in  Mogadishu last autumn. The report also criticizes the unclear  command structures of the UN troops that took part in the  Somalia operation. The troops from the United States and Italy,  in particular, operated too independently and did not let  themselves be placed under the command of the UN. The United  States had its own military base with its headquarters in  Mogadishu and the Americans were leading the attempt to disarm  the supporters of Aidid. This unsuccessful attempt turned into  a three-month bloody war in the town. The report accuses both  the United States and the UN of a policy that was too aggressive  and led to suffering among countless civilians. The report  recommends compensation to the civilian victims of the conflicts  between the UN and the Somalis. The Commission also recommends  that the UN should return to traditional, neutral peacekeeping  after the failed peace enforcement attempt.    The United States had had enough of the Somali operation  last  October when 18 U.S. soldiers died in Somali ambushes in  Mogadishu. At the initiative of the Americans, the Security  Council set up a commission of three men to investigate the  events of last autumn. In addition to Gen. Haegglund, the  commission includes a judge from Zambia and a general from  Ghana. The report by the commission was presented to the UN  Headquarters on 24 February, but the Security Council has not  been allowed to discuss it. The report has been kept secret,  and according to newspaper reports, the secretary general has  asked the commission to change the report -- in vain, because  the commission has refused to change a word. There were  suspicions that the report was kept secret and publication was  delayed because negotiations between the clan leaders were under  way at the time the report was concluded and the idea was not to  disturb them. Another reason might be that there was an  unwillingness to annoy the countries that came in for criticism,  such as the United States, just as troops from these countries  were asked to perform peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.  Johanna Gallant, Washington. [end recording]    Gen. Gustav Haegglund has announced that he will comment on  the report only when the contents have been made public.  Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, who has just returned from the  UN, also refuses to comment on Haegglund's report. Rehn says  that peace enforcement operations such as in Somalia have  normally failed. [passage omitted]</p>

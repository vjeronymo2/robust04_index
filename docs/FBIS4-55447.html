			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wojciech Zaluska: "Center Accord's </F> Congress--Kaczynski Is Always Right"]    [Text] Although the Center Accord [PC] lost the  elections and split internally several times already, Jaroslaw  Kaczynski had no problem whatsoever with retaining the post of  party chairman.    During a congress held on Saturday [14 May] and Sunday, he  was supported by almost all 290 delegates. They responded to  his speeches with standing ovations and voted for a list  prepared by Kaczynski of candidates to the party's leadership.    Kaczynski was able to say then: "Our opponents"--he did not  say who they were--"tried to destroy us using the Office of  State Protection and attacks in the mass media. They did not  succeed. We are stronger now than at any time in the past. The  most dedicated activists have remained in the party. We have  gotten rid of career-oriented ones and also of those whose  assessments of the PC were based on GAZETA WYBORCZA and NIE  weekly."  <H5>  Just One Mistake </H5>   During his 40-minute speech, the PC chairman admitted having  committed just one mistake: He was not ruthless enough when it  came to opposition inside the party: He had not thrown out  Olszewski's supporters earlier, and he tolerated "party  do-nothings." Apart from that, he has always been right.    But leaders of other center right-wing parties made a major  mistake: They refused to join forces before the 19 September  elections. As a result, the center right wing has no  representatives in the Sejm, even though it could have had as  many as 150.    Unification of the center right wing is goal number-one for  Kaczynski. He made the first step, with the Christian-National  Union, the Peasant Accord, the Movement for the Republic, and  the Conservative Coalition. Last week, the "five" formed a  confederation named "Alliance for Poland." They will gladly  accept new members. Kaczynski repeated at the congress: "We  have no enemies in the right wing."  <H5>  Strong Words </H5>   After a break lasting six months, Kaczynski returned to his  strong anticommunist and anti-Walesa rhetoric. Depriving the  Democratic Left Alliance, the Polish Peasant Party, and Lech  Walesa of power is goal number-two for Kaczynski. The president  is a danger to democracy and Instruction 0015 is a symbol of his  rules. The postcommunists are reinstating arrangements that  existed in the period of the Polish People's Republic [PRL], and  they are waging a war on national traditions and the church.    Kaczynski argued that only the right wing is capable of  severing ties to the PRL's legacies. Only the right wing is  capable of "building a new Poland that would be free of the  communist mentality."    Kaczynski wants to begin the process with a radical  decommunization and file-checking [lustracja]. He announced the  removal of "PRL people" from the Army, the police, the state  administration, and banks.    "The Hungarian example shows that, without such measures,  even four years of center right-wing rules bring bad results,"  Kaczynski said. He was making a reference to the recent  election triumph by postcommunists in Hungary.    In Kaczynski's view, the postcommunists in Poland want to  take advantage of the upcoming self-governmental elections in  order to take over power in towns and villages. "It is our  obligation to successfully resist the offensive," he appealed to  his confederation partners.  <H5>  Strzembosz for President </H5>   The entire post-Solidarity camp should come up with just one  candidate in the presidential elections. The center right wing  has been promoting Supreme Court Chief Justice Adam Strzembosz,  but it first wants Solidarity to approve him, followed by the  Freedom Union.  <H5>  Dispute About Punishment </H5>   The congress was well prepared but boring. Everyone agreed  with the chairman on everything, with one exception: When  Kaczynski proclaimed a draft resolution calling for increasing  the fight with crime, a storm broke out.    The PC chairman suggested radical measures: reinstating the  death penalty, imprisoning even 13-year-old criminals,  restricting conditional releases, punishing severely for drug  trade and possession... Among others, former Senator Leszek  Piotrowski argued with Kaczynski by saying that the restrictive  ideas will get bad reception in the mass media and in Europe,  with which we have been integrating.    But Kaczynski did not give up: "Crime is on the rise. The  law must begin protecting victims, not criminals," he said.  "One must increase police powers; murderers cannot be in a  better position than their victims."    These arguments got a positive reception by the majority of  candidates. The resolution was supported by 120 delegates, with  70 against.</p>

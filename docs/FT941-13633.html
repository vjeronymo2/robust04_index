			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / CBI optimistic on business trends A Confederation of British Industry survey yesterday painted a more optimistic picture of business trends than last week's report from the British Chambers of Commerce. The CBI was unabashed by the discrepancy. It pointed out that most of its replies were received after the start of January; the British Chambers of Commerce survey was carried out between November 26 and December 17. The CBI also said its report covered larger companies and included a wider range of questions. This does not account for all the discrepancies. Smaller companies, tied to the fortunes of the domestic economy, seem to be performing better than larger ones. This should have made the Chambers of Commerce survey, focused on smaller companies, more optimistic than the CBI report. An encouraging sign in the CBI survey is that orders and output are increasing faster than forecast in the last report in October. Total new orders grew at the strongest rate since January 1989, with a balance of plus 11 per cent experiencing an increase. That compares with just plus 5 per cent expecting an increase in October. The trend also appears to be strengthening, with plus 22 per cent - the highest figure since October 1988  -expecting order growth to continue over the next four months. The pound's recent strength does not appear to have had a substantial impact on export orders. The balance of those experiencing an increase was plus 8 per cent while plus 18 per cent expect a rise over the next four months. However, the percentage of those naming prices as the main constraint on export demand rose to 56 per cent, from 52 per cent in October. A balance of plus 9 per cent saw growth in manufacturing output over the last four months, a slightly higher figure than in October. The CBI forecasts that output will grow by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1994, based on its survey figure showing a balance of plus 16 per cent expecting an increase. Furthermore, the balance of companies intending to increase spending on plant and machinery over the coming year was positive for the first time since July 1989. More companies have cut domestic prices than raised them over the last four months, and the same trend is true in export prices. There is a strong balance of plus 12 per cent in favour of increasing prices over the next four months. Price pressures are being eased by companies' tight control on costs. Unit costs fell faster than at any time since 1958, when the survey was first conducted, with 12 per cent more companies reporting a fall in costs over the past four months than an increase, and 5 per cent more expecting costs to decline than to go up.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading London's derivatives markets saw record turnover and huge premiums yesterday. The buying played a significant role in driving the FT-SE 100 Index to a new high after the Budget, writes Peter John. Volume in Footsie futures for December topped 30,000 contracts, which represented an underlying value of some Pounds 2.5bn and the highest turnover ever. Also, furious activity in traded options drove the daily turnover above 90,000 contracts, nearly two-thirds of which reflected activity in the Footsie. One dealer said: 'Everyone was involved, UK institutions, US investment houses, marketmakers taking profits and setting up positions. The Budget has renewed interest in the London market.' On most arithmetic models the December contract should be priced at or just below the underlying cash market. But yesterday when it opened at 3,213 it was at a premium of about 15 points and it continued to push ahead throughout the day. At best it hit 3,274, and while it eased back to 3,259 by the official close, it pressed ahead again in after-hours' trading to reach 3,265 and show a premium of 32 points to cash. The premium reflected the dearth of stock in the underlying market and most dealers expected the Footsie to rise by a further 20 points when it opens today. One important element behind the rise was closing of bear positions by pension funds, who had been particularly worried about Budget changes to advance corporation tax and bought Footsie put options as protection. Implied volatility on at-the-money puts fell from 18 per cent to 14 per cent yesterday.</p>

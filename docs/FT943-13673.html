			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / E German incentives extended Investment grants and tax incentives for enterprises in eastern Germany, which were due to end next year, will be extended until 1998, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, said yesterday. He said a further DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) in addition to the annual DM10bn would be put aside for investment grants, or subsidies, while companies will be allowed to continue to write off against tax 50 per cent of capital investment in equipment. In addition, DM1.2bn will be allocated to research and development in the five eastern states. The east German economy is expected to grow by about 8 per cent this year, but any growth is coming from a low base - the region's gross domestic product fell by over 30 per cent between late 1990 and 1991, and unemployment, officially at 16.2 per cent, is slowing down not as a consequence of the availability of new jobs, but, according to economists, because the unemployed, particularly women, are no longer being registered on the unemployment register.</p>

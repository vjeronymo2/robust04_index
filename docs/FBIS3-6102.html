			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press statement issued by the spokesman of the Committee </F> for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, CPRF, on 15  March -- read by announcer]    [Text] Recently, a working-level delegates contact was held  on several occasions for the exchange of top-level special  envoys of the North and South. However, no reasonable  [ungdanghan] results have been produced due to the South side's  unreasonable acts. In this connection, the spokesman of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  issued the following press statement [tamhwa] on 15 March.    Press statement issued by the spokesman of the CPRF:    Recently, working-level delegates contacts for the exchange  of top-level special envoys of the North and South, which was  suspended in October of last year, were held on several  occasions at Panmunjom. A series of progress has been made in  the contacts, but no reasonable results have been produced yet.  We can view that this is wholly attributed to the unreasonable  acts of the South Korean authorities who are creating a barrier  before the exchange of special envoys and who do not welcome the  early settlement of the exchange of special envoys.    As already known, at the sixth working-level delegates'  contact held on 12 March, our side showed a broad-minded and  tolerant position regarding the four demands that we justly  presented. As one of the new measures to realize the exchange  of special envoys between the two sides as soon as possible, we  put forth constructive proposals that we inform the people at  home and abroad in the form of a joint communique that the two  sides have reconfirmed their intention for the exchange of  special envoys and have agreed to the exchange of special envoys  as soon as possible, and that at the same time the two sides  sincerely discuss and bring to a conclusion the draft agreement  on procedural matters presented by each side.    This kind of epoch-making measure not only gives the  condition to all the more achieve, ahead of schedule, the  exchange of special envoys, it also gives hope to all the people  who are worried about the future of the exchange of special  envoys. Moreover, it creates a significant opportunity which  provides a turning point in the new beginning of North-South  relations.    If the South Korean authorities truly want to realize the  exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and the South  from the position of dissolving today's acute confrontational  situation and achieve, ahead of schedule, reunification in the  nineties, they must rightly show a positive response to our  rational and patriotic initiative.    Nevertheless, in the 12 March contact, while making remarks,  the South side acted if it had interest in the exchange of  special envoys, but it showed a negative attitude in putting it  into practical action and rejected our constructive proposal.    This kind of attitude by the South Korean authorities on the  exchange of special envoys is giving disappointment to the  people at home and abroad who are watching over the Panmunjom  working-level delegates contacts. As already known, we proposed  the exchange of special envoys of the North and South first.  This is the best way to smoothly and quickly discuss and  resolve pending issues between the North and South including the  issue of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and the  nation's grave matters for the country's peace and peaceful  reunification through the top-level political determination and  under the principle of national independence and great national  unity.    When the top-level special envoys of the North and the  South travel between Pyongyang and Seoul and historic top-level  North-South talks ensue, it will be no doubt that an epochal  turning point will be made in North-South relations and a  decisive stage will open in achieving the nation's ultimate goal  of reunification in the nineties.    This is why we initiatively raised the exchange of the  top-level special envoys of the North and the South, which the  South side could never have imagined, prepared for working-level  delegates' contacts in Panmunjom, and exerted every effort to  smoothly open the road for the two sides' special envoys to  visit Pyongyang and Seoul.    The reason our side demanded the South side suspend all of  its large-scale nuclear war exercises against fellow countrymen,  stop talking about an international alliance system against us  for the nonexistent nuclear issue, cancel the plan to introduce  new arms--including Patriot missiles, and clearly show an  attitude to retract the remarks that it cannot shake hands with  those who have nuclear weapons, was to successfully realize the  exchange of the top-level special envoys of the North and the  South without twists and turns in conformity with their  primordial missions.    Our demands, which are truly just in terms of the nation's  craving and of the lessons from past North-South dialogues,  received active support from public opinion at home and abroad  and even won sympathy from many people in South Korea.    Because the exchange of North and South special envoys is a  precondition of the two sides' top-level talks and the missions  of the special envoys are urgent and important for the sake of  the country and the nation, it has become an inevitable  prerequisite to remove the obstacles blocking the achievement of  the exchange.    Nevertheless, the South side avoided expressing a clear  attitude toward our just proposal, thus casting a shadow on the  future of the special envoy exchange, which after much effort  had been finally scheduled, and jeopardized its destiny.    At such a time, to break through the difficulty laid in  front  of the special envoy exchange, our side evaluated and analyzed  what the South side said in the sixth working-level contact held  on 12 March: that the issues of discontinuing all large-scale  nuclear war exercises and abandoning the international alliance  system could be discussed after the special envoys are exchanged  in the future; that although conditionally, it decided to  suspend Team Spirit '94 joint military exercise some time ago  and withheld the plan to introduce Patriot missiles; and that  regarding the remarks that it cannot shake hands with those who  have nuclear weapons, the situation is now changed because there  is no intelligence which shows the North has developed nuclear  weapons. Based on this, we believed that although not  sufficient, such a position is an expression of the South side's  understanding of the feasibility of our four-point proposal.  Bearing this in mind, we proposed to proclaim at home and  abroad that the two sides reconfirmed their will to exchange  special envoys and agreed to exchange special envoys at the  earliest possible date.    Our side's broad-minded measure and constructive proposal  is just in every respect and is a manifestation of an active  position on the exchange of special envoys. However, when  viewing that the South side is not accepting the issue of  releasing the joint communique without any reasonable reason, we  cannot but doubt whether they truly have the will for the  exchange of special envoys and whether they will actually carry  out the exchange of special envoys.    Also, even while discussing the procedural matters for the  exchange of special envoys, the South side assumed the attitude  that it cannot accept the issue of easing tension, the issue of  great national unity, the issue of settling the method for the  fatherland's reunification, and the issue of abiding by the  principle of national independence which our side put forth in  regulating the duties of the special envoys. It is nothing but  clear that rather than bringing about fruitions in the exchange  of special envoys, the South side is trying to make the  working-level delegates' contact only as a show off.    As such, the South side opposed the issuing of the joint  communique that the two sides of the North and South agreed for  the exchange of special envoys, and even opposed including the  fundamental and principle problems in regulating the duties of  the special envoys. Therefore, this creates an artificial  barrier in the exchange of special envoys, and furthermore the  South side is carrying out acts of intentionally putting the  breaks on the third round DPRK-U.S. talks.    While acting as such, the South side is intent on making  nonsense by saying that the exchange of special envoys is a  precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and that the  exchange of special envoys must be achieved before 21 March, the  date for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    In the third clause of the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New  York contact which was concluded on 25 February, it only  specifies that the working-level delegates' contact shall be  resumed for the exchange of special envoys of the North and  South. No other items were specified. There can be no other  explanation for this and moreover, the South Korean authorities  have no justification to come forth with any kind of condition  by interfering in the process of explaining this problem.    Our side resumed the working-level delegates' contact for  the  exchange of special envoys at Panmunjom, and it was already held  on three occasions. Moreover, our side assumed a broad-minded  position to draw the contact to the doors [munhogu] of the  exchange of special envoys. This is being viewed as having  progressed the contact even more so than the content of the  DPRK-U.S. joint agreement.    Even so, the South Korean authorities ignored our sincerity  and positivism and even put forth unreasonable preconditions  which do not even fall within their authority, and made  distorted false charges. Also, for them to say that they cannot  issue a joint communique on the exchange of special envoys is in  reality to dissipate the exchange of top-level special envoys of  the North and South itself, and this cannot but be interpreted  as an act of putting a wet blanket over the third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks.    We claim that if the South Korean authorities truly have the  will to improve North-South relations and discuss and resolve  with us all pending issues between the North and South including  denuclearization, they must correctly show the will for the  exchange of special envoys which all the people can understand,  and make a resolute decision on accepting our side's proposal on  procedural matters.    We will continue to watch over the attitude of the South  Korean authorities.</p>

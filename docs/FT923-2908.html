			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: It Runs in the Family - Theatre Ray Cooney outdoes even Lord (Jeffrey) Archer in his versatility. Not only has he bought the Playhouse Theatre from the former Tory MP and writer who found it did not make money. Cooney has opened it with his own play, directs it and acts in it as well. Indeed, his acting is so good that it helps to explain why he writes such splendid farces. It Runs in the Family may not be quite the best of them, but you would have to be in the most churlish mood not to enjoy it. The piece ought to have opened at Christmas, for it starts with 'Jingle Bells' and has the doctors and nurses of St Andrew's Hospital, London rehearsing for the annual pantomime. Snow is seen falling through the famous Cooney windows which, as so often, are set centre stage and bound to play a prominent part in the action. Yet never mind that it is still only September. The coach parties have already begun to arrive in force and although this may not be a play to arouse gales of laughter, it is strong on the steady chuckle. The pantomime is only a sideshow. The real business is the annual Ponsonby lecture to be delivered by the neurologist, Dr David Mortimore (John Quayle) before the junior health minister and neurologists from all over the world. The trick, the hospital governor explains, is not to plead abject poverty, as that would fail to impress the foreign visitors, but to persuade the minister that the place needs more money. In practice we never get that far. There are interruptions all along the line, beginning with the arrival of Nurse Tate (Sandra Dickinson), an old flame of 18 years ago, who reveals that she has Mortimore's son, a distinctly punk youth demanding to meet his father for the first time. From then on it is the customary fun and games. Mortimore has a wife from whom the facts must be concealed. One of Cooney's techniques is to allow one lie to lead to another until there is multiple confusion and nobody knows who is who. He does this time and again, and the pace seldom flags. The characters are stock: an old man in a wheel chair (perfectly played by Henry McGee) who develops an astonishing new lease of life and has fun with a soda syphon; Matron (Jacqueline Clarke), hard on the surface but soft underneath, and an old fashioned police sergeant in Windsor Davis. There is a part for the veteran Doris Hare. The windows come in when it looks as if the punk youth (William Harry) is about to fall from the outside ledge. Matron and doctors hang on to him. A slight criticism: seen from the stalls, there is not much sense of vertigo. The main pleasure of the evening comes from Cooney himself. He plays Dr Bonney, not a high flyer and certainly not the sort of man to be invited to give the Ponsonby lecture. Watch how he knows his deficiencies, the way he wears his jacket, the expressions on his face even when he is not in the forefront of the action. This is the performance of a man who knows that farce is a very high art. Cooney enjoys every minute. By Christmas, the production should be even better. Playhouse Theatre (071 839 4401)</p>

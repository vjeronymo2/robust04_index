Senior officials from both sides yesterday agreed to set up a committee to co-ordinate the Moldovan and Romanian parliaments and agreed to consider an investment fund for Moldovan-Romanian joint ventures to encourage economic integration. This seem certain to anger ethnic Russians and Ukrainians who make up nearly 40 per cent of Moldova's population. Such fears were a trigger for bloody fighting this summer in the break-away Trans Dnestr region of Moldova.</p>

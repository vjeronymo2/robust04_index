			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds fall as focus remains on economic growth German bund futures fell back over a point as the market continued to focus on the prospect of economic growth and the likelihood of another high money supply figure to be released this week. The market chose to ignore the release of favourable inflation figures yesterday, maintaining a bearish mood, and as bund prices tumbled, they dragged the other European government bond markets down in their wake. The German market is anxiously awaiting the release today by the leading economic research institutes of their growth forecasts for 1994, dealer said. Bond analysts and dealers said that the market has chosen to focus on recent comments by German politicians and Bundesbank officials suggesting that economic growth may be picking up. Last week, Mr Rexrodt, the Economics Minister, said growth could even be somewhat better than forecast. Yesterday, Bundesbank board member Mr Edgar Meister was reported saying there were signs of recovery in the west German economy. Some economists at investment banks, meanwhile, have revised their growth forecasts upwards. As a result, the bund market is nervous that the Bundesbank could slow down or halt its already snail-pace easing in short-term rates. Meanwhile, the M3 money supply figures for March are due to be released this week. After the annualised 17.5 per cent growth in February, dealers expect the March figure still to be in double-digits and well above the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent target range. With the economic recovery and M3 figures providing the main focus, the release of favourable inflation figures was largely ignored by the market. April inflation figures from North Rhine-Westphalia were better than expected, with annual CPI growth slowing to 3.0 per cent from 3.1 per cent in March, while the monthly increase remained unchanged at 0.2 per cent. This follows the release on Friday of the inflation figures from the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg where inflation was up 0.3 per cent on the month and 3.1 per cent on the year. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.74 and fell to 93.58 before settling at 93.65. The drop in bund prices depressed the other European government bond markets, pushing French debt prices lower in the absence of significant domestic factors. Swedish government bonds tracked the bund market lower, but saw additional downward pressure as a result of the disappointing 'mini-budget' announced yesterday. One analyst pointed out that many of the measures announced in the supplementary budget are due to be phased in over a long period of time and could be jeopardised by the autumn general election. In addition, the Swedish bond market has seen heavy new supply - both of index-linked and of conventional stock - in recent days, which dealers said had weighed down the market. Short-dated UK gilts opened on a soggy note ahead of Wednesday's auction, while the decline in bund prices further depressed the market, leading to a fall of a point from the previous close. The release of the economic growth figures was in line with expectations and dealers said the gilt market chose to ignore the domestic economic data and focus on the bund market's decline instead. Britain's gross domestic product rose 0.7 per cent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 1993 and was up 2.6 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier. The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 106.26 at the opening to a low of 105.26, settling at 106.09. Longer-dated US Treasuries posted solid gains yesterday afternoon as traders followed through on last week's encouraging rebound. The improvement followed a decision by the Treasury to postpone Wednesday's supply auction in honor of former President Richard Nixon, who died at the weekend. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/16 better at 89. The yield eased to 7.145 per cent, 27 basis points lower than at last Monday's close. The two-year note was off  1/16 at 99 3/16 , to yield 5.555 per cent. Bonds generally meandered in directionless trading for most of the morning. There was little economic news to drive the market, but a weakening trend in US securities overseas cast a shadow. Traders were unruffled by news of a 5.7 per cent rise in sales of existing homes last month, after a 9.6 per cent fall in February. The recovery offered no convincing evidence of a fresh surge in housing activity nor an unsettling escalation of inflationary pressure. On the contrary, the market grew bolder in the conviction that the economy was not as strong as it had feared just a fortnight ago. Although there was no further indication of a slowdown, the long bond climbed steadily during the afternoon.</p>

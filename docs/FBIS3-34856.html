			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Committee has  concluded the meetings it held in Amman yesterday and today.  The Jordanian side to the talks was headed by Dr. Sa'id  al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of higher education,  while the Palestinian side was led by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the  PLO Political Department.    During its meetings, the committee reviewed issues of  bilateral and Arab concern to promote the overall bilateral  cooperation and coordination to the required level in all areas.  The committee also reviewed recent developments in the peace  process, including the agreement the PLO and Israel signed in  Cairo on 9 February, which constitutes a major step toward the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, which is the first  part of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles.    The two sides expressed satisfaction with the climate of  understanding that permeated the talks, something which promotes  bilateral coordination. This climate also demonstrates the need  to promote and enhance this coordination in all areas, given  that it is a realistic response to the special, historical, and  fateful relationship between the two peoples, as well as a  response to the common challenges facing them.</p>

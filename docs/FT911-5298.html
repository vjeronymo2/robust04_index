			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Australian Bonds: Employment figures trigger sharp rally LAST week the Australian bond market gave investors some of their best action for months. Long-term treasury bond yields dropped 26 basis points during hectic trading to 11.08 per cent, their lowest level for 11 years, and three-year bonds slid under 11 per cent to 10.9 per cent. Last week's yield contraction turned suddenly into a full-blooded rally when institutional traders and investors realised they had to grab what could be the last of some of the developed world's highest long-term returns before yields and the economy fell even further, into a recessionary heap. The buying, when it came, was all the more frantic because a smaller-than-expected treasury bond tender of ADollars 800m (USDollars 630m) announced early in the week suggested that stock would be scarcer than earlier anticipated. After three years of federal government surpluses and large-scale bond buybacks by Canberra, blue chip Commonwealth bonds are now in short supply. Aggressive buying by Japanese institutions also heightened fears that trading stock would be limited. The catalyst for the rush on bonds and, to a lesser extent, three-month securities was news that employment had fallen by a further 82,400, and that the unemployment rate had risen from 8.7 per cent to a worrying 9.2 per cent. To put this employment drop in perspective, it would be equivalent to a deterioration of 1m jobs in the US. The market believes this sharp fall in employment will lead to inflation - currently 6.9 per cent - falling faster and further than expected. According to Mr Vince Le Blanco, a dealer at Bankers Trust Australia, the country is one of the few which has brought recession upon itself rather than being dragged down by the downturn in the US, UK and Canada. 'It is out of step with the other industrialised economies. Australian inflation is falling faster than these other western economies so everyone is climbing in for the long bonds.' Traders had begun the week buying long bonds with some confidence when the Reserve Bank clipped 0.5 per cent off the official cash rate, reducing it from 12 to 11.5 per cent. Thursday's alarming jobless statistic convinced the market that further easing of official rates would follow and so turned the buying into a stampede. Mr Robert Credano, a fixed interest analyst at Macquarie Bank, says lower inflationary expectation had been responsible for reducing long-term bond yields, and the easing of monetary policy triggered the drop in short-term rates. 'The reduced inflationary outlook has had the greater effect on the long end of the market,' he said. This change of sentiment over the week is quite significant, given that the market had been reluctant to push yields down this far in either the 1986 or 1983 recessions. After three years of punishing official interest rates and heart-breaking current account deficits, the authorities appear finally to have snapped the back of inflation, but at the cost of breaking the economy. This success has come at a further cost of the growing number of jobless in Australia, but for the bond market the news is all good.</p>

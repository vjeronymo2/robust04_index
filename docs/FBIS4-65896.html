			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gun Falth: "National Criminal Police Corps </F> Getting New Leadership"]    [Text] Jorgen Almblad, best known as the prosecutor in the  Palme case, will be the new head of the National Criminal Police  Corps. His title will be National Criminal Police chief. Not  quite as distinguished as SAPO [Security Police] chief, which  has the rank of commissioner.    But organizationally they will be on an equal footing, as  Almblad will command a more independent National Criminal Police  Corps.    "I needed only two seconds to think it over when I was asked  this morning. This is the most exciting job one can have if one  is interested in operational police activity," Almblad said at  Thursday's [14 April] news conference just after he was  appointed by the government.  <H5>  Not Unexpected </H5>   He said he was bowled over. However, his appointment was not  unexpected. Since 1989 he has been the second in command at  SAPO, in charge of counterespionage, and since Mats Borjesson's  recent retirement he has led the entire organization.    DAGENS NYHETER has been informed that Almblad stated that he  would not remain at SAPO unless he became its permanent chief.  And last week it was not he but Anders Eriksson who was named as  Borjesson's successor.    Eriksson will take over on 1 May. Almblad will leave SAPO  the  same day.    The National Criminal Police Corps, the Swedish FBI, is  primarily known on account of its former chief, Tommy Lindstrom.  This unconventional and unbureaucratic person performed a  hazardous balancing act in the gray zone between prohibited and  permitted police methods.    In the end it was too much of a strain for the National  Police Board, RPS. This is illustrated by the fact that  Lindstrom has now been suspended from his job and is under  indictment for falsifying documents and making false statements  under oath. Additional indictments can be expected.  <H5>  Without Supervision </H5>   It was against this background, among other things, that  one-man investigator Hakan Winberg proposed that the central  police organization be remodeled.    The highest police leadership had no real supervision over  the National Criminal Police, and it was necessary to remedy  this unsatisfactory state of affairs. The chief of the National  Criminal Police Corps, like the head of SAPO, should have  managerial qualifications and does not need to have experience  in the field, in Winberg's opinion.    The role of the National Criminal Police Corps in providing  operational support for police districts around the country in  difficult crime investigations has also become less important as  the districts themselves acquire qualified detectives.    At the same time serious crimes requires a central criminal  intelligence service and international police cooperation.  Winberg proposed that this be the main task of the National  Criminal Police.    RPS did not approve the proposals. A parliamentary committee  was appointed, after National Police Commissioner Bjorn  Eriksson, among others, acted and made it a political issue, to  the government's annoyance.    But RPS itself has already reorganized the National Criminal  Police Corps. And it could be difficult to make changes when the  parliamentary committee presents its proposals at the end of  1995.    The reorganization is based on establishing two new  assistant  commissioner posts for the National Criminal Police in addition  to the chief commissioner. The government decided to do this on  7 April.  <H5>  Over 300 Employees </H5>   The three police commissioners will head the secretariat and  the criminal intelligence and crime-fighting units respectively.  Two police superintendents will take care of Interpol and guard  duty. Almblad will supervise the more than 330 employees.    What are the qualifications that make him suitable for the  job? Is he the operationally experienced police chief Bjorn  Eriksson wanted and asked the government for?    Almblad himself says:    "I have been with SAPO for five years. And I have worked as  a  prosecutor and judge. In addition I have had international  contacts in recent years, and that will be useful."    Gunno Gunnmo, the chairman of the Policemen's Union, was  informed of Almblad's appointment only hours before it was  announced. He is not entirely satisfied about this.    "We think it is important to have an advance discussion on  the National Criminal Police Corps' organizational changes, the  demands they place on the chief, and the extent to which these  demands will be met by the person to be appointed," Gunnmo said.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Swedish No voters lead poll The campaign to win Swedish entry to the European Union was jolted yesterday when an opinion poll showed a swing against membership, in contrast to other recent polls showing the Yes side set for a narrow win in the referendum on November 13. The latest poll, in the newspaper Aftonbladet, gave the No camp 38 per cent support against 36 per cent in favour of membership. Most worrying for the Yes campaign, led by the Social Democratic prime minister, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, and strongly supported by most of Sweden's political and industrial establishment, was the poll's finding that significantly more of the 25 per cent of voters yet to make up their minds were more inclined to vote No than Yes. The poll was cited by market dealers as the main factor behind a sharp rise in long-term interest rates and a weakening of the Swedish krona yesterday.</p>

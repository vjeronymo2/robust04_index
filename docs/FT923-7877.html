			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Fowler outlines Tory party changes SWEEPING changes to the management and finances of the Conservative party were foreshadowed yesterday by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman. In an open letter to Tory activists ahead of the party conference in October, Sir Norman also issued a gentle warning that the planned celebration of Mr John Major's election victory should not be spoilt by arguments over the economy and Europe. His letter confirmed that the initial conclusions of a post-election review of party organisation point to the need for much closer and more formal links between Conservative Central Office and local party organisations. It also announced that the sharp cuts in spending announced by Central Office are to be accompanied by the creation of the post of director-general to improve day-to-day management. The considerable degree of autonomy enjoyed by local associations has been reflected in mutual suspicion between Central Office and many grass-roots activists. Some associations that operate under the party's National Union refuse to contribute to Central Office funds, while party managers in London have only a small say in the choice of election candidates. Sir Norman signalled that he planned to ease such tensions by 'welding' together the various wings of the party in a single management board that would draw its representatives from constituencies and other voluntary organisations as well as from Central Office. He acknowledged the party's disappointment with its election performance in many marginal constituencies by announcing an improved career structure for full-time party officials and increased resources for those seats. Sir Norman also signalled a drive to recruit more women parliamentary candidates and more potential MPs with experience of commerce and industry.</p>

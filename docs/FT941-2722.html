			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Building societies face sharp squeeze on funds Britain's personal savers last month continued to desert building societies in search of better returns on their money. The net outflow of Pounds 404m was the highest for 7 1/2 years. Strong competition for retail savings - from unit trusts and National Savings products in particular - led to the fourth consecutive monthly outflow, according to figures released by the Building Societies Association yesterday. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at stockbroker UBS, said the pressures on societies 'rule out any prospect of a mortgage rate reduction in the foreseeable future'. Evidence of the continuing scale of withdrawals coincides with signs that societies are recovering in terms of mortgage lending. Net new mortgage commitments rose from Pounds 1.83bn in January to Pounds 2.93bn in February, the highest level since July 1993. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said last month's savings figures reflected not just fierce competition for funds but 'distortions caused by the payment of the second instalment on the BT3 share issue'. Pressure on societies' retail funding has intensified with the launch of the pensioners' guaranteed income bond. National Savings said last week the bond had attracted Pounds 480m in February. It pays an annual fixed rate of 7 per cent gross for five years, and has been bought by nearly 90,000 people. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the UK's sixth largest society, said societies did not need to attract new savings in order to meet mortgage demand. Net advances of principal in 1993 totalled only Pounds 9.43bn, compared with Pounds 24.09bn in 1990. Societies are hoping that before the end of the year the limits on wholesale funds they can raise will be relaxed, but if mortgage demand picks up more sharply and they have difficulty attracting retail funds, they have the option of increasing the rates they offer on savings and the charge on mortgages. Mr Longhurst said the intense competition among lenders for new mortgages meant across-the-board rate reductions were unlikely. The previous largest monthly outflow was in September 1986 when savers withdrew money for the TSB Group flotation. Upturn is a mixed blessing for societies, Page 6</p>

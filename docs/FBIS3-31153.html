			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 10 (CTK) -- Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  said today the government and the Civic Democratic Party (ODS),  of which Klaus is chairman, believe the civil war in Bosnia  should not be resolved by external intervention but by internal  settlement.    In his personal view the air strikes which the NATO Council  threatened Bosnian Serbs with unless they withdraw heavy  artillery from surrounding Sarajevo are "unfair". "Personally I  see it as a little unfair to say: Ground troops no but from the  air yes. That seems too easy to me and I don't know if it is  fair," Klaus said.    Given the non-existence of a front and the unclear positions  of the armies, the government considers external intervention  could lead to "far greater massacres and catastrophes," Klaus  said.    On Wednesday [9 February] the NATO Council gave the Bosnian  Serbs 10 days from February 10 to withdraw all heavy artillery  including tanks and mortars to a distance of 20 km from the  center of the besieged Bosnian city of Sarajevo and deliver them  into the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops, NATO  will conduct air strikes against their positions.</p>

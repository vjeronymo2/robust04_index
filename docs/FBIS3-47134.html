Referring to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, he  pointed out: China supports the stance of realizing the  denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and maintaining  security and peace on the peninsula. We hope that the nuclear  issue will be resolved reasonably through dialogue. We do not  approve of using means of imposing pressure or sanctions since  such ways can bring an adverse effect and produce discrepancy on  the issue.</p>

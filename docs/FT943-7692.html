			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Friendly metropolis - Though its crime rate is high, Sao Paulo is a safe city for foreigners to visit It may lack the scenic charm of Rio de Janeiro, and suffer from pollution and a high crime rate, but Sao Paulo is a dynamic and generally friendly city that is geared towards business. Paulo The city was largely founded on Brazil's coffee industry in the last century. Since the 1950s, industrialisation has spread and transformed Sao Paulo into South America's biggest and most economically powerful metropolis. Foreign visitors usually arrive at the city's international airport in Guarulhos. From there, you can catch one of the half-hourly executive buses that tour the top hotels in the centre, or go to the reliable cooperativa taxi stands, where the fare is paid in advance. Money can be changed at the airport, hotels or bureaux de change, known as doleiros. The latter usually offer the best rates, but they often do not accept traveller's cheques. The approach from the airport to the city centre is unprepossessing. Much of the route follows the river Tiete, one of the world's most polluted waterways. As you approach Sao Paulo, the horizon becomes crowded with the centre's skyscrapers, like a mini Manhattan, but this impressive sight is diminished by dreary concrete flyovers and roadside shanty towns. The city's more attractive face is the chic Jardins area, which borders the modern Avenida Paulista, the main financial and business district. Many of the luxury hotels, such as the Maksoud Plaza and Mofarrez Sheraton, are in Jardins. Other upmarket hotels, including the Ca d'Oro and the Hilton, are nearer the old downtown centro. A few of the big banks and companies have head offices in the centro, but many have moved to the Paulista financial district or to suburbs, such as Santo Amaro in the south. For this reason, as well as the frequent traffic jams, leave plenty of time to get to appointments. Do not worry too much about getting lost - it is almost inevitable. Sao Paulo is a bewildering mass of one-way streets, similar-looking modern buildings and motorways, with few natural landmarks to help orientation. However, taxis are plentiful and still relatively cheap. Unlike their counterparts in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo taxi drivers are usually safe and honest. The driver calculates the fare by matching the number on the meter with a table of prices. There is also a small but efficient underground system, to be avoided at rush hours, and a complex bus network, to be avoided at all times. For business meetings, Paulistanos, as the city's residents are known, are usually punctual. Exchanging business cards is customary, but executives tend to be less formal than in other Latin American countries - it is common to use first names fairly soon. Bring a light suit, because the city can get very hot. If you arrive in Brazil's winter, between June and September, you may need thicker clothing, including pullovers and a coat. There are few tourist sights in Sao Paulo, but there is a wide variety of restaurants. With a population of nearly 17m, Sao Paulo is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, with large communities of Italians, east Europeans and Arabs, and the largest Japanese settlement outside Japan. Liberdade, the Japanese neighbourhood, has several good restaurants, including Sushi-Yassu in Rua Tomas Gonzaga. Rua Treze de Maio in Bixiga, the Italian district, also has a large number of restaurants and bars. Other recommended restaurants are Massimo's in Alameda Santos, Jardins; the Ca d'Oro hotel; and, for north-eastern cuisine, Andrade's in Rua Arturo de Azevedo, Pinheiros. Brazil's national dish is the rather heavy feijoada, a meat and black bean stew originally eaten by slaves. Feijoada is traditionally eaten on Wednesdays and Saturdays accompanied by a caipirinha, which is cachaca (sugar cane alcohol) with lime, sugar and crushed ice. Caipirinhas are delicious but deceptively strong. For a flavour of the real Sao Paulo, visit a local football match. The city is home to several excellent teams, including Sao Paulo FC, South American champions; Palmeiras, Brazilian champions; and Corinthians. There are games virtually the year round, and tickets can usually be bought at the turnstiles. Violence is unlikely, but avoid wearing jewellery or expensive watches. Sao Paulo has a high crime rate, but this is usually restricted to poorer districts; business travellers are unlikely to run into difficulties. However, it is not advisable to walk around the centro late at night - if in doubt, take a taxi.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GALLERY ARTICLE COLLECTS KUDOS AND CRITICISM  </P> <P> If street noise is any indication, it seems likely that mail regarding your  article "You Can't Always Get What You Want" is something very close to 100%  unfavorable. Although I have not been conducting a poll, several artists and  gallery owners have volunteered to me that the article was unfair and overly  negative. When they get into specifics, it becomes obvious that they have  missed the point altogether and are reacting to things that weren't even  implied.  </P> <P> There are collectors, and there is a market in Orange County. If I didn't  believe that, John Thomas would have moved to Santa Monica. Of course, we must  find a way to tap the market. It was good to read that, in many cases (i.e.  newsletters, etc.), we are doing the right things.  </P> <P> There are problems. I agree completely that the lack of focus is one of them.  If there were an equivalent to La Cienega in L.A. or Colorado in Santa Monica,  there would be more incentive for Orange County residents to stay closer to  home.  </P> <P> On the other hand, to many there is some attraction in having to go somewhere  else to find the "good stuff." The grass is always greener. There are even  collectors and art consultants in Los Angeles (who) insist on going to New  York!  </P> <P> I could go on and on (such is my nature) but will restrain myself. The point is  that I for one appreciated the article. There is a problem, and you have helped  by calling attention to it.  </P> <P> JACK BUICK  </P> <P>  Buick is the owner of the John Thomas Gallery in Fullerton.  </P></p>

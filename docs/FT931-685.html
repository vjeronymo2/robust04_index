			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Index-linked gilts In theory, index-linked gilts should have been a beneficiary of the Budget. The lower tax credit on dividends which has reduced the yield on equities does not affect gilts. The yield on index-linked gilts, which are perhaps best viewed as a surrogate equity rather than a bond, has thus become more attractive relative to shares. Over time this could lead institutions to devote more of their cash-flow to the index-linked market. But there is unlikely to be a rush. One problem is that running yields on index-linked gilts are still too low to attract yield-conscious investors in equities. Another is that even those who believe that devaluation and the government's economic problems will eventually rekindle inflation also have to worry about real yields in the short run. On this matter index-linked gilts take their lead from the conventional market. And this market is again worried about supply. Then there is the structural problem of liquidity. Extra sales have increased the size of the index-linked market by more than Pounds 5bn in the current financial year. That amounts to an expansion of some 40 per cent, but there is still no real trading liquidity. So buyers of index-linked may face punitive dealing costs if they want to sell. The worry is that the market may never become liquid whatever its size. The high cost of carry makes index-linked unattractive to market makers.</p>

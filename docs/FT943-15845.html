			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Employment - faulty predictions and outdated welfare system (2) Sir, Your thoughtful leader, 'The wages of inequality', did not go deep enough. The welfare system we have today was essentially the creation of the distinguished economist Sir William Beveridge, later Lord Tuggal. His report, signed by him alone, was published as a white paper in 1942. Its main feature was a scheme of social insurance against 'interruption and destruction of earning power and for special expenditure arising at birth, marriage or death'. Beveridge reflected the national mood of the time. The country was united by war and determined to avoid a repetition of the enormous social damage done by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The structure he conceived has achieved its original purpose handsomely. It is a tribute to the underlying thinking that it has lasted more than 50 years. But it is now out of date. The mood and the environment of the 1990s are totally different. We have four decades of boom/bust cycles behind us and yet another developing round us. General levels of affluence and the expectations of beneficiaries are two or three orders higher. We are learning the hard way the political and economic limits to what modern society can and will support by way of benefits; and at the same time that a significant degree of unemployment may be endemic. The proportion of society which is past earning age and therefore past contributing to the system has markedly increased. The fundamentals and the objectives of social insurance require a complete rethink. We need another Beveridge, to design a system for the 21st century. Nothing short of this will get us anywhere.

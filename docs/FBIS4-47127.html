			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maksim Polinin: "Yeltsin's Excursion into </F> Intelligence"]    [Text] It is claimed that nothing like this ever  happened before in the history of Russia and the USSR. For the  first time, the head of state visited the headquarters of the  Russian Federation's Foreign Intelligence Service. He gave a  30-minute speech to the operational staff, and he spent more  than two hours in a circle of the service's managerial  personnel. The KURANTY editorial staff learned about some of the  details of this meeting and the impressions and opinions of its  eyewitnesses. On the whole, the experts give a very high  evaluation to Yeltsin's excursion into intelligence.    However, to make the picture complete and to realize the  importance of this meeting, we will look back two and a half  years ago. Iron Feliks did not last on what seemed to be his  permanent pedestal. He crashed to the ground in such a way that  the subunits of the once monolithic KGB went flying in various  directions. The elite intelligence service--the First Main  Directorate--which was called on to resolve extremely important  tasks, mainly abroad, was also knocked out of it. A serious  reform of the special institution was started--it began to be  called the Central Intelligence Service when the Soviet Union  was still in existence. The Gorbachev-Yeltsin dyarchy generated  the idea of creating "an original Russian" intelligence service  under the conventional designation "Federal Security Agency."  Specialists note that the period of time from Putsch No. 1 to  the Belovezha Agreement is marked by black days on the calendar  of the country's intelligence service. The operational staff  basically remained silent, although it can be imagined what went  on in the heads of the employees. Many could not take it--they  went into civilian work. But, in one way or another, a nucleus  of professionals was preserved nonetheless. They were all  assembled under the abbreviation FIS [Foreign Intelligence  Service] and were told: "Get down to work." However, doubts  among the workers remained--what did the high leadership of the  country have in mind for them? Moreover, these doubts were  somehow stirred up little by little both at home and abroad.    Bayonets in the Ground? It was said "Get down to  work." But how? All of the foreign political guidelines were  disrupted, there were no enemies, including the principal one,  which was presumed to be the United States. The "fraternization"  of Moscow with Washington led to a sharp drop in Russian  intelligence activity not only in the United States, but also in  practically all of the countries of the world. The financial  squeeze forced the FIS to reduce to a minimum the level of work  in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. There were persistent rumors  that the Americans are insolently pressuring the Russian  leadership with respect to a reduction in intelligence functions  of the FIS against them, but R. Gates, director of the CIA at  that time, bluntly told his Russian colleague, Ye. Primakov, of  the need to veto agent and operational work of the Russian  intelligence service on U.S. territory.    In assessing those "cursed days," professionals recognized  that the lack of demand for intelligence was very clearly felt  then, and this brought on gloomy predictions regarding its  future. Approximately the same mood prevailed among employees of  the Russian intelligence service right up until Yeltsin's visit.    The Paralysis Is Being Abolished. And so, on the  sunny day of 28 April, a presidential motorcade drove up to the  FIS headquarters--a complex of buildings whose main building  resembles the NATO citadel in Brussels. The 800-seat hall is  over filled, although the operational personnel who remained in  their offices were not deprived of the opportunity to hear the  president on a local radio relay.    According to the testimony of eyewitnesses, Yeltsin, dressed  in a perfectly tailored blue suit, headed for the rostrum  without hurrying. Thousands of eyes gazed intently at the  powerful figure of the president in the expectation--what has  the eminent guest brought with him?    The tension in the hall was replaced by goodwill and  approval  from sentence to sentence. In the middle of the speech, the  attendees, with an expression of pleasant surprise on their  faces, listened to the speaker and agreed with him in a majority  of cases. "You know better than I that there are forces abroad  that would like to keep Russia in the condition of a manageable  paralytic," Yeltsin said. "But I am convinced that only a  powerful, democratic, and prosperous Russian state will become a  factor in acquiring new prospects peacefully. It is our common  task to make Russia such a state."    Diversity of Opinions. One common positive moment  exists in the rather broad range of evaluations of Yeltsin's  speech among intelligence employees: The president for the first  time openly recognized the importance and necessity for such a  specific service as the FIS. His speech can in full measure be  called conceptual. Yeltsin demonstrated real knowledge of the  subject, and he assessed the functions of the intelligence  service and the quality of its information very highly.    Global problems facing the country were publicly tied in  with  the tasks of intelligence for the first time. The importance of  such a statement of the question was that the president, in a  rather tough form, made clear the need to receive valuable,  timely, warning intelligence information. "I expect that in the  future your operational information, analytical conclusions, and  recommendations will receive only good marks... We expect  intelligence data from the FIS that are necessary for making  fundamental state decisions on questions of Russia's foreign and  domestic policy, the conduct of our economic policy, and the  support of scientific-technical progress." (From B. Yeltsin's  speech of 28 April in the FIS.)    At the same time, although encouraging statements were made  and firm guarantees were given of the "necessary concern for  each intelligence officer," no one will say now how all of this  in fact will be implemented. Some specialists think that the  train has already left--the outflow of qualified personnel from  the intelligence service has assumed an irreversible character,  and many of the functional directorates of the service have been  bled white. But, to continue to keep intelligence on a financial  hunger ration is equivalent to transforming it into something of  a toothless department. It is not accidental, after all, that  CIA patriarch Allen Dulles in his work "The Craft of  Intelligence" wrote that a poor intelligence service cannot  achieve hoped for results.    It is also not entirely clear to professionals how it is  possible to fulfill the task assigned by the president to  systematically keep abreast of the situation along the entire  perimeter of the Russian borders with neighboring countries. The  fact is that Moscow has signed numerous treaties with a majority  of the now independent states surrounding Russia about not  conducting intelligence activities against each other.    Yeltsin talked about the legal basis for the FIS, but  experts  emphasize that the Law of the Russian Federation on Foreign  Intelligence, under which the signature of a "nonpolitician,"  Khasbulatov, still stands, requires significant revision. For  example, Article 9 of this act concerning contacts of the FIS  organs with the Russian public became outdated a long time ago.    Diverting Parallels. But what about our overseas  friends-rivals? Judging by everything, they did not like the  fact that their recommendations on stopping all Russian  intelligence activity on U.S. territory were not heeded in  Moscow. Then the Ames case came to light, which seemed to form  Washington's position on this score: They said, we seemed to  have come to an agreement, but you, so-and-sos, are recruiting  CIA employees.    In the meantime, there was no mention on the part of the  United States about any reduction in the work of the American  intelligence services against Russia. The U.S. President  regularly visits Langley, and not just once a year, in order to  give his blessing to the intelligence activity of CIA agents.  Here is what he said, for example, during his last visit to CIA  headquarters on 4 January of this year: "The conclusion of the  Cold War has strengthened the security of the United States,  but, after all, it is precisely intelligence, acting in very  different ways, that helped gain victory in this confrontation."  But what follows further is a quotation from Yeltsin's speech,  and compare: "The period of global confrontation in  international politics has ended, but its inertia is strong  today. The Cold War has turned into a scattering of hot and  smoldering conflicts... Military force factors can once again be  activated at any moment." Curious coincidences in the views on  what is occurring, is it not true?    And again Clinton: "But today's renewed peace also remains  full of dangers and, judging by many events, it is becoming even  more complicated and difficult to correctly understand the  processes that are occurring." He is seconded by Yeltsin: "I  understand very well that, perhaps, there has not been a more  difficult period for the FIS than the present one. And this is  determined most of all by the present international situation.  Its main feature is the large scale and the high speed of  changes that continuously further complicate an already  complicated world."    These theses were pronounced at different times by the  leaders of different countries, but their thoughts are  absolutely identical. Somebody, probably, can reproach Yeltsin  for plagiarism (he made his speech almost five months later than  Clinton). But it is exactly this kind of plagiarism, it seems,  that the FIS employees expected from the Russian  president--there is a desire, at least in words, to be on an  equal footing with colleagues from the CIA.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: JP Morgan tops emergingmarket debt league table J. P. Morgan has emerged as the leading trading firm in impaired and restructured secondary market debt, with turnover in 1993 of close to Dollars 200bn, according to a market survey conducted by Risk magazine. Many market participants reported increases in trading volume of more than 100 per cent, in a record year for emerging market debt trading. American banks took the top five places in the survey, while Morgan Grenfell, which topped the list last year, fell to sixth place with a relatively modest volume increase of 60 per cent to Dollars 107.9bn. Turnover in the market is estimated by traders at Dollars 1,000bn to Dollars 1,500bn, about three times the estimated size for 1992. Continental Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Venezuela-owned VestcorPartners, based in Miami, re-entered the rankings, while Banco Santander and MG Emerging Markets, owned by Metallgesellschaft, the German oil and metals group, fell out of the top 20. Metallgesellschaft is winding up its debt trading operations following its recent heavy losses in derivatives trading. J. P. Morgan also headed the list for emerging market options trading.</p>

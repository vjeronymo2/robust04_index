			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yegor Gaydar met journalists today to share his  thoughts with them about our economic condition.    [Correspondent Matskaviecus] Yegor Gaydar at his news  conference today categorically denied rumors that he had  supposedly called on the West not to give financial aid while  Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin are in power. The former vice premier  stated that the present government has acted erroneously and  dishonorably by promising industry money which it is not in a  position to pay. The Russia's Choice leader believes that this  year's budget is in need of major changes. Gaydar also dislikes  the excessive growth of expenditure on the state apparatus and  the method of financing the provinces which in the future will  lead to discrimination in favor of Russia's northern regions at  the expense of the southern regions.    Incidentally, the budget for 1994, according to Deputy  Pochinok, who was also present at the news conference, will be  adopted at the earliest only in June.    Today, the head of Russia's Choice gave a dignified reply to  the premier's fairly harsh words concerning heads of  laboratories who jump into ministries, after whose tenure of  administration the country is shaking as if in a fever.    [Begin Gaydar recording] Laboratory head is the only  scholarly level which I jumped over. I went straight from being  the head of research workers to being appointed institute  director. The only thing I can say in regret is that he  [Premier Chernomyrdin] evidently did not manage to share his  ideas with me about laboratory heads and ministers when he was  working under my command as part of the Russian Government. [end  recording]    [Matskaviecus] The Russia's Choice faction will support the  idea of a memorandum on concord, Gaydar said, only if it is  convinced that it is not just another fig leaf covering up the  political ambitions of individual leaders.    Commenting on Nixon's visit and his choice of people to  meet,  Gaydar thought that the former U.S. president simply did not  have a real opportunity to evaluate the sincerity of one  political leader or another. Gaydar himself did not bother to  meet Nixon today.    [Begin Gaydar recording] Yes, I postponed our meeting with  former U.S. President Richard Nixon in order to make a further  study of the situation. [end recording]</p>

A major portion of his  address dealt with domestic issues and made little reference to  diplomatic issues. President Clinton, who became President by  advocating his plan "to rebuild America," originally indicated  that he planned to place emphasis on domestic affairs. On top  of this, off-year elections are to be held this coming fall. As  a result, he has apparently made it clearer that he intends to  turn his attention more toward internal affairs.    The President's State of the Union address includes an  outline of the U.S. Government's domestic and diplomatic  policies over the coming year. Particularly since this was  Clinton's first such address, it has attracted the world's  attention. However, it could not avoid being rated as  unimpressive due to its domestic affairs-oriented content.    In his address, the President praised himself for "making a  good start" concerning his first year at running the government.  According to research by a periodical specializing in  Congressional affairs, over 84 percent of the bills reaching  Congress during Clinton's first year as President were passed.  Since the periodical began such research in the early 1950's,  this figure ranks third after former Presidents Dwight D.  Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. It shows Clinton's  extraordinary leadership over Congressional steering.    When Clinton was first inaugurated, critics charged that his  policies lacked focus and were inconsistent. However,  supporters praised his uncompromising realism. Generally,  experts give high ratings to Clinton for his accomplishments  during his first year as President. His declined support rating  has resurged to the 60-percent level he enjoyed at the time of  his inauguration.    Recovery of the U.S. economy has been the greatest  contributing factor in Clinton's regaining his popularity.  Whether the President can also make dazzling achievements  during his second year depends on whether he can ride on the  favorable winds of the time.    As prime priority policy goals for his second year, the  President presented three pillars: fight against crime, health  care system reform, and welfare system reform. Concerning the  fight against crime which is of the greatest interest to the  American people, Clinton has already sent a comprehensive crime  prevention bill to Congress that includes recruiting 100,000  more policemen. As part of the crime prevention plan, a law on  hand gun control was enacted last year. It is hoped that  greater gun control will be promoted, such as introducing a  system requiring gun licenses.    Concerning health care system reform which aims at having  every American covered under health insurance, President Clinton  hopes that Congress will pass the bill worked out under the  leadership of Hillary Clinton, the First Lady. Tentatively, the  focus of attention will be on the contest between this bill and  a number of other bills proposed by some Congressmen which  Congress is currently examining.    The President has decided to continue with his plan to give  priority to problems of the people and boldly deal with social  issues which tend to be ignored.    The greatest task facing President Clinton is that of  solidifying his foundation for reelection by having his party  win in the off-year elections. The President hopes to form a  majority that encompasses a broad range of the population by  winning over the middle class in addition to traditional  Democratic supporters. He will need to patch up relations with  leaders of the Democratic Party and labor unions with whom he  clashed regarding ratification of NAFTA. He also needs to  quickly regain public confidence that has been lost due to  consecutive scandals involving women and the Whitewater scandal.    Regarding diplomatic affairs, a task has emerged for the  President to reconstruct his team in charge of diplomacy and  national security, as this team has been considered a weak point  in the Clinton administration. Bobby Inman, who at first agreed  to succeed Les Aspin as secretary of defense after the latter  announced his resignation, decided not to accept his nomination.  Finally, William J. Perry, deputy secretary of defense, was  just promoted to fill the post. There has also been deep-rooted  criticism against Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for national security  affairs.    In his State of the Union address, President Clinton  indicated U.S. leadership is essential to global stability. For  the United States to exercise its leadership without repeating  the mistakes it has made in Somalia, Haiti, and former  Yugoslavia, it is indeed necessary to promptly form a strong  team to handle diplomacy and national security.</p>

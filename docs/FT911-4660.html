			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises above 27,000 on heavy arbitrage buying HEAVY arbitrage buying pushed share prices up yesterday and, while hopes of monetary easing subsided with no clear action from the central bank, the overnight rally on Wall Street boosted sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average opened at the day's low of 26,859.35, topped 27,000 for the first time since March 19 for a day's high of 27,092.02, and closed 167.07 higher at 26,980.37. Domestic institutions stayed away, but volume rose from 380m to 450m shares. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said that the rise in volume reflected the return of investors from smaller markets to the first section. Advances led declines by 619 to 372, with 158 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section issues rose 9.99 to 2,028.82 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.59 to 1,540.42. Companies gained on heavy business exposure in the US. Bridgestone, the tyre maker, added Y30 to Y1,150, and Makita Electric Works Y50 to Y2,150. Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities said that the activity indicated that investors were willing to commit money into companies on hopes of an early recovery of the US economy. Electricals were also strong on Wall Street. Sony added Y150 to Y6,790, and TDK Y200 to Y5,880. Electrical machinery makers were stronger on the labour saving theme. Fanuc rose Y200 to Y5,790 on sales of its industrial robots, and Fuji Electric, the most active issue of the day, added Y20 to Y910 on growth in automation equipment. Pioneer Electronic climbed Y230 to Y5,050 on reports that it will launch a compact disc recording system. Taiyo Yuden, an electrolytic capacitor maker which is expected to supply the blank compact discs, also rose Y101 to Y1,090. Interest rate sensitive, large-capital issues fell on profit-taking, Nippon Steel by Y6 to Y489 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries by Y6 to Y633. Sanwa Shutter rose Y60 to Y1,710 on strong earning forecasts thanks to brisk sales of its shutters, sliding doors and doors. Buying spread throughout the sector, with Bunka Shutter adding Y50 to Y2,300 and Sankyo Aluminium Industry climbing Y10 to Y1,720. Nippon Oil rose on higher oil prices. Rumours that some countries in the Gulf will join up with Japanese distributors in new projects also encouraged investors, but the issue fell on profit taking and ended down Y10 at Y1,130. Cosmo Oil fell Y9 to Y810. Retailers gained on good earnings results for the year ending last February. Ito Yokado, the supermarket chain which posted 11.4 per cent in pre-tax profits, rose Y20 to Y4,370, and Seven Eleven Japan, which announced a 26.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, added Y230 to Y7,300. In Osaka the OSE average rose 98.62 to 30,156.12 on volume of 46.2m shares. Rohm, a semiconductor equipment maker, added Y80 to Y3,030 on heavy buying by a major Japanese brokerage. Investors were attracted to forecasts of a 20 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the current year. Roundup THE ENTHUSIASM of the region's response to Wall Street's overnight gains was blunted by airport fears in Hong Kong. Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were still closed for a public holiday. Bombay was also closed. HONG KONG talked about the stalled airport talks, added fears about a planned rail strike in the US, and accepted that consolidation was in order after the market's recent dramatic gains. The Hang Seng dropped 30.45 to 3687.01 as turnover eased from HKDollars 1.12bn to HKDollars 992m. Banks posted the sharpest losses, followed by properties and the commercial and industrial sector. Utilities declined moderately. NEW ZEALAND, a recent form horse, was given an additional boost by news that the domestic consumer price index rose by only 0.6 per cent in the quarter ended March 31, the smallest quarterly rise since 1969. Equities rose 2.3 per cent as the Barclays index closed 33.08 higher at 1,458.73, and turnover rose from NZDollars 30.8m to NZDollars 35.7m. Fletcher Challenge led from the front, 10 cents higher at NZDollars 3.90 in volume of 3.2m shares. Brierley Investments, which has tended to lag behind other stocks during the recent rally, picked up 3 cents to NZDollars 1.09 on the heaviest individual volume of 5.3m shares. TAIWAN rebounded from Tuesday's 6.3 per cent fall. The weighted index rose 137.75, or 2.6 per cent, to 5,451.06. Turnover, however, fell from TDollars 78.7bn to TDollars 58.7bn. SINGAPORE came back from a holiday to a gain of 1.9 per cent, the Straits Times index closing 27.62 higher at 1,513.52 as turnover climbed from SDollars 137m to SDollars 194m. AUSTRALIA rose 1.3 per cent, with the accent again on industrials as the All Ordinaries index finished 18.9 higher at 1,490.6, its highest level since last September and the market's fifth consecutive rise. Activity was concentrated in the leaders, and turnover was not high in spite of a rise from ADollars 164m to ADollars 237m. The property, civil engineering and finance group, Lend Lease, rose 35 cents to ADollars 16.55 as it said that it would form a joint venture with State Bank of New South Wales in the life insurance and retirement savings business. News Corp gained 28 cents at ADollars 9.06, largely following a rise in the stock on Wall Street. MANILA saw more profit-taking as the composite index fell 9.53 to 1,080.93, after a decline of 5.44 on Tuesday.</p>

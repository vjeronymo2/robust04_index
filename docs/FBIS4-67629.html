These show that in January there were 174 new reports of  AIDS  cases bringing the cumulative total to 8,842 cases.    In order to provide a wider range of information about AIDS  and HIV in the United Kingdom, the Communicable Disease Report  has recently introduced a new schedule for publication of  surveillance data. This is designed to focus on different  aspects of the data throughout the year. So that a wider  audience can also benefit from this improved presentation, the  monthly and quarterly routine Press Notices will in future be  replaced by new quarterly formats. These will provide  considerable additional information over that presented  formerly. This is the last in the current series of Monthly and  Quarterly AIDS and IV figures. The new format will begin in  April. [passage on editorial notes omitted]    Further data on AIDS is available in the PHLS Communicable  Disease Report, which can be subscribed to by contacting Editor  CDR, PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, 61,  Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ.    The accompanying material (eg. tables, reports, graphics)  are  not suitable for electronic display.</p>

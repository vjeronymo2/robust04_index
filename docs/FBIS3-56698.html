Andrey Kozyrev said that defense of Russians' rights in the  former Union republics is one of the main strategic issues in  Russian foreign policy. In his opinion, the question of dual  citizenship has now become a key element here. The minister  stressed that it has of late proved possible to secure greater  understanding on this score.    Among other most pressing problems the minister pointed to  the need to boost the effectiveness of existing cooperation  mechanisms and to create new ones, as well as to develop a  short-, medium-, and long-term strategy for forming an economic  union.    The minister spoke about military and military-technical  cooperation and underlined the need to retain a Russian military  presence in this region. "We should not leave regions that for  centuries have been spheres of Russian interests. We should not  be frightened of these words." The "security vacuum" created as  a result of the Russian troops' withdrawal will "inevitably be  filled by other forces, by no means always friendly forces,  moreover, and in many cases directly hostile to Russian  interests," the minister stressed.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Major will urge business to seize opportunities MR JOHN MAJOR will tonight make a direct appeal to British industry and business to seize the opportunities on offer, as the government steps up its efforts to create economic confidence. In a break with tradition, the prime minister will use his speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet in London to focus on the economy rather than foreign affairs. The move is part of a concerted effort by senior ministers to keep plans to pull the economy out of recession, announced last Thursday, at the top of the political agenda. Mr Major will tell his audience that following the Autumn Statement from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, measures are in place to enhance confidence and lead to economic recovery. His message is that all that is needed now is for the private sector to take advantage of the current circumstances and openings. Mr Lamont yesterday also urged business to make the most of the opportunities available, but refused to rule out tax increases in his next Budget. Speaking on BBC television's On The Record, he emphasised that the 3 percentage point cut in interest rates and the large devaluation of sterling since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism in September amounted to a 'very considerable relaxation' of policy that would give a 'very important stimulus' to the economy. He conceded that unemployment, currently 2.87m, would continue to rise 'for some time', but said the measures he announced last week to help specific sectors of the economy would assist the employment situation. Mr Lamont expressed particular concern about the housing market and will today meet mortgage lenders, when he is expected to press for the bank base rate cuts to be passed on swiftly to borrowers. Lenders have used recent cuts to widen margins rather than ensuring borrowers gained the full benefit. The chancellor would 'neither rule in nor rule out' tax increases in his next Budget in March, and said the high level of government borrowing was a 'worrying feature' of the present economic situation. This was why the government had agreed a very tight spending round in the Autumn Statement, he said. A judgment on whether or not to raise taxes would be made in March or at the end of next year, when the first unified Budget covering government spending and revenue raising will be delivered. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, immediately labelled Mr Lamont 'the unemployment chancellor', and challenged him to admit that thousands of people would lose their jobs in the coming months. Mr Brown will seek to press home his argument on Wednesday at the start of the two-day Commons debate on the Autumn Statement. Before then, both Mr Lamont and Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, will face questions from the cross-party Treasury committee. The scale of the government's task in trying to create confidence was underlined by a Harris poll for Granada's World in Action programme, which found that 84 per cent of those questioned believed Britain was worse off financially than a year ago, and 52 per cent believed it would be worse off still in a year.

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Overseas growth behind 20% advance at Courts Courts, the home furnishings retailer, achieved 20 per cent rise in both pre-tax profits and turnover in the six months to September 30, fuelled by overseas sales sharply up by 30 per cent. The shares edged ahead 3p to 798p. At group level, profits grew to Pounds 3.27m (Pounds 2.72m) pre-tax and turnover to Pounds 124.6m (Pounds 103.7m). Operating profits of Pounds 8.06m (Pounds 6.89m) were boosted by a Pounds 663,000 exceptional gain from the disposal of shares in the Mauritian subsidiary as a result of its rights issue. Interest charges were up at Pounds 3.51m (Pounds 3.31m) as borrowings grew to Pounds 55.3m (Pounds 43.5m). Gearing, including deferred profit, rose from 35.5 to 38.4 per cent. The transfer to the deferred profit reserve almost trebled to Pounds 1.94m (Pounds 770,000) as a result of the increased overseas sales. Mr Bruce Cohen, chief executive, said the size of the rise in the transfer was because of a big increase in the group's in-house credit business. The amount comprises the interest element and the gross profits on goods sold. The deferred profit reserves now total nearly Pounds 50m, which Mr Cohen said would flow into future profits over a maximum of three years. If the credit business was not handled by Courts itself, Mr Cohen said, the group would be ungeared. Turnover in the UK increased 9 per cent. Here, expansion was concentrated on the Superstore format. Courts' 32 Superstores account for about 70 per cent of sales, with the 58 high-street shops making up the balance. So far, only the south is represented, but Mr Cohen expects to go national in the next two to three years. Overseas sales grew so strongly on the back of expansion in south-east Asia, particularly Singapore and Malaysia. There are now 120 stores in 13 countries; 14 were opened in the first half and six have been opened since, with three more due soon. Earnings expanded to 6.84p (3.94p) and the interim dividend is held at 2p. While the pay-out is not a foreign income dividend, last year's final was and this year's final might be.</p>

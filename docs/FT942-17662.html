			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Greek lobby slows US plans on Macedonia The influential Greek lobby in the US appears to have had some success in slowing down the Clinton administration's announced plan to proceed to full diplomatic relations with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. While the State Department has continued to insist this week that an embassy would eventually be established in Skopje following the decision to recognise Macedonia despite Greek objections, it declined substantive comment on an apparently well-sourced column by Mr Jim Hoagland in the Washington Post. This pointed to a critical White House meeting on March 9, which brought together President Bill Clinton, Vice-President Al Gore, and national security adviser Tony Lake with a Greek-American delegation, led by Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland. Mr Hoagland quoted a satisfied member of the delegation as asserting that Mr Clinton said he had already decided not to go ahead and open an embassy until progress was made in the Greece-Macedonia dispute. The president's thinking was reported to be in accord with that of the Greek government. The State Department, which has been critical of Greece's behaviour towards Macedonia, was not represented at the meeting. But Mr George Stephanopoulos, the senior adviser who is the son of a Greek Orthodox priest, was. Mr Hoagland also saw the influential hand of Ms Nancy Soderberg, a member of Mr Lake's staff, in the president's reported decision. Mr Victor Comras, the diplomat reportedly in line to be ambassador to Macedonia, may be despatched, but only as head of a diplomatic liaison office.</p>

This will help expand cooperation in all spheres,"  Kazakhstan's Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko said.    The statement was made at the meeting with visiting  Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam in Almaty on Monday.    Tereshchenko stressed that Vietnam has accumulated rich  experience in combating inflation, strengthening currency  relations and developing the light industry. Kazakhstan and  Vietnam could cooperate in establishing joint ventures to  process agricultural produce and produce gas and oil, the prime  minister added.    Kazakhstan has skilled geological cadres and could help  Vietnam with gas and oil prospecting and training specialists,  the premier said.    The Vietnamese minister recalled that Vietnam was one of the  first countries to have recognised the independence of  Kazakhstan. He believes further development of relations would  be beneficial to both countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Josef Motinga] </F>   [Text] The permanent secretaries of State House and the  Cabinet will now attend Cabinet meetings and a number of other  secretaries have been promoted. This decision was taken by  Cabinet during its Fifth Ordinary Session on February 15, and  was yesterday announced by Nguno Wakolele, the permanent  secretary in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.    The former permanent secretary at State House will now be  called secretary to the President, and will have an equal rank  with that of secretary to the Cabinet. Eddie Amukongo, who now  holds that position, has been acting secretary to the Cabinet.  Wakolele said the former deputy permanent secretary at State  House, would now be deputy secretary to the President. That  post was held by Dr. Ndeutala Hishongua. The post will be the  equivalent to a permanent secretary and its holder will be the  accounting officer at the Presidency.    The permanent secretary in the Office of the Prime Minister  will now be deputy secretary to the Cabinet but still keep the  first position. Dr. Peingeondjabi Shipo holds that position.    The acting permanent secretary for Home Affairs, Shetu  Hamunyela has been confirmed as permanent secretary. He has  been acting in that position since the relocation of Frieda  Williams to the Ministry of Works, Transport and  Telecommunication as permanent secretary.    Explaining the reasons for the changes, Wakolele said the  permanent secretaries to State House and the Cabinet were  serving in sensitive positions and should be able to attend  Cabinet meetings. Only the deputies would not be allowed to  attend.    In addition, the permanent secretary to State House could  receive delegates should the President not be present, he said.    The changes had been planned since December last year. The  changes had nothing to do with an individual, said Wakolele,  responding to a question on whether they had anything to do with  the transfer of former Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Petrus  Damaseb, as Namibian Representative to the Joint-Administrative  Authority.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Rover car output falls sharply ROVER car output fell heavily in the first quarter of this year, but UK national output figures were boosted by higher production at Nissan and small gains by Vauxhall and Ford. Overall UK car output in the first three months of the year fell by 0.8 per cent to 343,318 from 346,163 in the corresponding period a year ago, according the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Rover car production fell by 14.4 per cent to 94,937, while output of the Land Rover division's Range Rover and Discovery vehicles declined by 19.2 per cent to 9,346. Rover slipped into fourth place in the new car sales league after being overtaken for the first time by the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen. Rover car sales in the first three months were 32.1 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago, compared with a fall of 11.1 per cent in the overall UK new car market. Its market share fell to only 12.0 per cent from 15.7 per cent a year earlier. It experienced a recovery in May, but for the first five months its sales were still 20.9 per cent lower than a year before, although it regained third place behind Ford and Vauxhall. Output of Rover's ageing Maestro and Montego models was more than halved in the first quarter, while production of its most popular Rover 200/400 range declined by 16 per cent. Among the loss-making UK specialist carmakers, Group Lotus, a subsidiary of General Motors of the US, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of Vickers, the UK engineering group, continued to suffer a severe drop in output. THE number of vehicles in Britain rose by 0.6 per cent last year compared with a rise of 2.6 per cent in 1990, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday. The number of cars on the road rose 0.96 per cent to 22.7m, but the number of other vehicles fell - lorries by 9.4 per cent, buses by 1.6 per cent, and motorcycles by 6.4 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         UK VEHICLE PRODUCTION  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                       1992        1991      1992/91                                     Jan-March   Jan-March   % Change  --------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                               343,318      346,163       -0.8 Rover (British Aerospace)           104,283      122,521      -14.9  -cars****                           94,937      110,957      -14.4  -Range Rover/Discovery               9,346       11,564      -19.2 Ford (excl.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuwait City, Jan 30 (AFP) -- OPEC may decide to  reduce oil production to prop up falling crude prices, at its  next ministerial meeting scheduled for March 25, Kuwaiti Oil  Minister 'Ali al-Baghli said in remarks published Sunday [30  January].    The minister, quoted by the Kuwaiti daily Al-Anba', said a  cut in output "would be agreed on if OPEC was sure it would lead  to a bolstering of crude prices."    In December the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council --  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and  Bahrain -- said it was ready to lower production to stabilise  prices if other producers worldwide pledged to do the same.    Omani Oil Minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari recently  toured producers outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting  Countries to seek their support for the GCC [Gulf Cooperation  Council] offer, but his initiative has not affected the oil  markets.    OPEC members fear a resumption of oil exports by Iraq,  suspended under the embargo imposed on Baghdad after its  invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, may push oil prices to new  lows.    Last month they fell to their lowest level in five years,  deepening a trend that began in the second half of 1993 due to  excess supply, recession in industrial states and the spectre of  Iraq's return to the oil market.    "OPEC will hold an extraordinary meeting immediately the  embargo on Iraqi oil is lifted," al-Baghli said.    Iraq hopes the oil embargo will be lifted this year,  following its acceptance in November of long-term weapons  monitoring -- one of the Gulf war ceasefire conditions laid down  by the United Nations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Crimean] President Meshkov's decree on Crimea's  independent military policy is illegal, and for this reason its  implementation would be against the law. This is said in a  statement released by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry's  press-service on March 24. The statement notes that "Crimeans  must be drafted, Ukrainian troops be deployed, and servicemen be  trained in line with the Ukrainian Defence Ministry procedures  and in the interests of Ukraine's defence potential."    "Pressure by President Yuriy Meshkov on the Crimean Army  Commander and open threats are inadmissible," the statement  notes.    According to a decree earlier signed by Meshkov, Crimean  citizens will be drafted for service exclusively on the  territory of the peninsula.</p>

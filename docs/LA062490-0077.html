			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE $115,000 RACING SHELLS FOR NEWPORT AQUATIC CENTER  </P> <P> The article (June 13) on Amateur Athletic Foundation funding in Orange County  featured a great photo of the junior women's quad boat from the Newport Aquatic  Center. These girls will be going on to national-level competition later this  month and, hopefully, also will continue to row at the high school and  collegiate level.  </P> <P> I would like to point out that the Newport Aquatic Center offers the only  opportunity for any woman of any age to row in all of Orange County. The two  collegiate programs in Orange County, at UC Irvine and Orange Coast College,  both offer men's teams but do not have rowing programs available to women.  There are no other high school rowing programs in the county.  </P> <P> Although the Newport Aquatic Center is marginally able to keep its doors open  from month to month on its membership fees, it is only through the generosity  of organizations such as the AAF and the donations of individuals that programs  like this one for high school kids can be offered. The article makes reference  to lessons being offered for $50, while failing to mention that this is the  cost of a five-lesson series.  </P> <P> It is the purpose of the Newport Aquatic Center to promote the sports of  kayaking, canoeing and rowing at all levels of ability, and the center is  wheelchair-accessible.  </P> <P> MARTHA SINGER  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

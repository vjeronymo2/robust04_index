			<p>BFN     [Text] Odessa, 20 May -- "The aggressive aspirations of the  imperial-military Kiev, which is striving to trample down  Crimea's sovereignty, deserve resolute condemnation. Yuriy  Meshkov will not be right if he yields to blackmail and agrees  to compromises," this is how Lev Vershynin, the cochairman of  the Civil Congress of Ukraine, commented on the latest  developments in Crimea in an interview with a UNIAR  correspondent. He said that the Odessa branch of the Civil  Congress will issue a relevant statement in connection with the  latest events in Crimea.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UCSD LOSES TO WHEATON  </P> <P> The temperature was over 80 degrees for Saturday's NCAA Division III men's  soccer quarterfinal game between Wheaton (Ill.) and UC San Diego at UCSD's  North Campus Stadium, and Wheaton took the field in heavy long-sleeved jerseys.  </P> <P> The Crusaders' shirts were 75% polyester, 25% cotton and bright orange. With  "Wheaton" printed on the front in large blue lettering, the players looked like  Wheaties cereal boxes on legs.  </P> <P> They also looked hot, having left behind a climate 50 degrees cooler. And it  seemed those jerseys could well determine which team would advance to the final  four.  </P> <P> But after Wheaton defeated the Tritons, 1-0, those jerseys looked like the game  dress of champions.  </P> <P> The Crusaders (20-2) made it quick and easy, scoring 15 minutes 38 seconds into  the game when midfielder David Anthony played a ball off his chest and over  UCSD goalie Brian Siljander. Siljander, thinking Anthony was going to kick the  ball, started to dive. Then he watched helplessly as Anthony floated the ball  over his head.  </P> <P> "It was a perfect ball and I just ran it in," Anthony said. "(Siljander) didn't  know what to do, I was so close to him."  </P> <P> The play was set up off a long throw-in by Bill Pitkin and keyed when  midfielder Phil Wolf made a flick pass toward the left post that Anthony  received and juggled. The goal was the first allowed by UCSD (17-3-1) on a long  throw-in this season, and it left Triton Coach Derek Armstrong dismayed.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed," he said. "I'm struggling to find somebody who played well.  Goal-wise, we dried up in the playoffs. The team was capable of winning the  whole thing."  </P> <P> It didn't help that UCSD controlled the ball for most of the second half but  was unable to convert 13 shots, six of which were smothered by Wheaton goalie  Doug Allen.  </P></p>

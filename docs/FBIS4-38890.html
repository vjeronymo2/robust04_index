			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetsky] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 2 June TASS -- The delay in  handing over Dniester coupons, the unit of local currency, is a  well-planned action by Moscow and Kishinev with an aim to exert  pressure upon the Dniester region at the talks on the withdrawal  of Russia's 14th Army, Dniester leader Igor Smirnov told today a  meeting of bankers and local government officials in the  regional capital Tiraspol.    Speaker of the Dniester local parliament Grigoriy Marakutsa  returned on Thursday from a business trip to Moscow, where he  failed to settle the coupon issue with Russian authorities. The  coupons were printed late last year at Russia's Goznak mint on  Tiraspol's order and cost the region 1.5 billion Russian  roubles. The move was prompted by Moldova's decision to  introduce its own national currency, the lei, which the Dniester  authorities refused to recognize and ordered to keep Soviet  roubles in circulation. This sent inlfation soaring and brought  the regional economy on the verge of collapse.    In addition to it, the situation changed considerably  following last October's events in Moscow. Seeking not to sour  relations with Moldova, the Russian leadership decided to hold  up the transfer of the coupons to Tiraspol. Early this year,  Russia's supreme arbitration court ruled to satisfy the claim of  the Dniester region and obliged the manufacturer to hand over  the coupons to the customer. However, this has not been done so  far.    According to well-informed sources in Tiraspol, Moscow  demands that the Dniester leadership coordinate its actions with  Kishinev. The Moldovan authorities believe that Dniester's own  currency will complicate the process of settlement, which is  expected to be discussed at next week's round of  Moldovan-Dniester talks. The talks will be mediated by the  Russian president's special envoy Vladlen Vasev.</p>

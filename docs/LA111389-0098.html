			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH TRIES TO SOFTEN POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF ABORTION ISSUE  </P> <P> The White House sought today to minimize abortion as a political issue in 1990  and gave belated recognition to Sunday's rallies in the capital and across the  nation by pro-choice activists.  </P> <P> Striking a conciliatory tone after weeks of strong anti-abortion statements,  presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "People should take a position on  this issue according to their strong moral and religious and personal beliefs,  and that should be the deciding factor -- not politics."  </P> <P> Fitzwater's comments came as abortion rights activists were pledging to channel  their energy from last week's election victories into 1990 political campaigns  to assure that women continue to have freedom of choice.  </P> <P> Despite President Bush's strong sentiments against abortion and his recent  vetoes of two abortion financing bills, the President welcomed Sunday's capital  rally, attended by more than 150,000 people, Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> "We certainly approve of the rally and are glad that they (participants) have  exercised their right to speak out," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Republican gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, who share  Bush's anti-abortion views, were defeated in off-year elections last week.  </P></p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Letter: The coalition that will realise a goal of Indian decentralisation Sir, Joe Rogaly's excellent article, 'Passage to India' (April 23), and David Housego's two field reports from Kashmir (April 22 and 24) highlight very vividly the problems of over-centralisation in India. Two points, however, need further elaboration. First, that the resistance to the centralised Indian state does not come only from states like Kashmir, Punjab and Nagaland/Mizoram, where Moslems, Sikhs and Christians respectively are in a minority, but also from many Hindu-majority states in the non-Hindi-speaking regions like Assam (for secession), Orissa (the chief minister there threatened secession), Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and West Bengal (for greater autonomy). This phenomenon is a manifestation of the conflict between many nationalisms in India and a unified Hindi-dominated Indian nationalism articulated by the Indian centralist state. These non-Hindi nationalist movements, having remained dormant during the struggle for Indian independence, are now reasserting their identities. Mr Rogaly's suggestion that Indians, in order to 'realise their potential', need to not only move towards confederation but also 'risk that in the end some of them go their separate ways' is, indeed, very full of insight and bold. Second, Rajiv Gandhi's coming to power - which in Mr Rogaly's opinion may be the probable outcome of this month's general election - will not lead to decentralisation of power because Mr Gandhi's Congress party, reared in the Nehru political culture of centralisation, is programmatically opposed to decentralisation. Only a long-term defeat of the Congress by a coalition of parties representing different nationalisms can possibly realise the goal of decentralisation. Pritam Singh, Oriel College, Oxford</p>

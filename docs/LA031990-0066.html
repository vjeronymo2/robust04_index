They didn't want to write a  scene that couldn't be shot.  </P> <P> Not today. As Richard Edlund, the Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor of  "Raiders of the Lost Ark," puts it: "Now virtually anything can be done  (visually). If you can describe it, you can do it."  </P> <P> Yet Jonathan Erland of the special effects house Apogee Inc. says newer doesn't  always mean better. "There are two versions of 'King Kong.' The remake enjoyed  a lot of advanced technology unavailable to the original film makers. Yet I  don't know anybody who prefers the remake. The original had a much clearer  vision of what it was about."  </P> <P> The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has no visual effects branch,  leaving the selection of Oscar nominees up to a committee made up of art  directors, cinematographers and others recognized as experts in special  effects.  </P> <P> Here are this year's visual effects nominees and what some experts in the field  think of them.  </P> <P> John Bruno, Dennis Muren, Hoyt Yeatman and Dennis Skotak.  </P> <P> "The Abyss."  </P> <P> "Two radically different environments -- water and air -- were cut seamlessly  together," notes academy member Bill Taylor, co-owner of Illusion Arts, the  company that did effect work on "Glory" and "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." "Smoke  was used to simulate underwater in certain sequences, such as when (the divers)  came upon the crashed sub. These had to be combined with miniature underwater  scenes and full-scale underwater scenes."  </P> <P> To create the underwater illusions, veteran special effects expert Linwood G.  Dunn says the visual effects people combined new techniques with the refinement  of known technology. Relying on information supplied by the film's producers,  Dunn notes that the film contained 290 effects shots covering 21 minutes of  film.  </P> <P> "Working with full scale all the way down to one-eighth-inch models required  all the tricks in (the visual effects) bag," Dunn says.  </P> <P> One effect that excited academy members was the image of the underwater aliens.  "The alien creatures and their minisubs were completely transparent," Taylor  says. "All the working parts were visible. That's never been attempted before."  </P> <P> The computer-generated water tendril that snakes through the ship's interior  and touches actress Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's face is another example of  the film's "trailblazing."  </P> <P> Richard Conway and Kent Houston.  </P> <P> "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen."  </P> <P> "The film charts no new ground in terms of technology," says Taylor. "But it  uses every existing technology -- mechanical effects, photographic effects,  models, miniatures -- and exploits them beautifully."  </P> <P> Erland, who worked on the original "Star Wars," says "Munchausen" reminded him  of "Star Wars."  </P> <P> "There's been a tendency since the first 'Star Wars' to get a little  pretentious about effects. The later ('Star Wars') films were more proficient,  but the first one had a sense of panache and the sheer joy of storytelling. We  got that back with 'Munchausen.' "  </P> <P> Dunn says the film included more than 275 optical effects, involving the  photographing and combining of multiple images. "And all were vitally important  to the story, which is a major factor in our voting."  </P> <P> Ken Ralston, Michael Lantieri, John Bell and Steve Gawley.  </P> <P> "Back to the Future Part II."  </P> <P> Taylor says the visual effects producers of this film took classic techniques  and, in Taylor's words, "pushed them further than ever before."  </P> <P> The split-screen technique, for instance, allows an actor to play multiple  roles. In one shot in this film, however, Michael J. Fox played four roles  while the camera moved.  </P> <P> "Often when you do an effect, the camera locks up and nothing moves until after  the effect," says Edlund. "An audience detects that kind of rigidity."  </P> <P> Here, split-screen and movement were achieved simultaneously through a Vista  Glide motion picture dolly that can repeat moves over and over again.  </P> <P> "Motion control cameras have been used before, but never as extensively,"  Edlund says. "They did nervy things too, like when Michael J. Fox 2 grabs a cap  off Michael J. Fox 1's head."  </P> <P> "That's a case where technology facilitates a performance," adds Erland. "To  most people in the effects business, the ability to enhance the storytelling is  most appealing."  </P> <P> " 'Back to the Future' required the construction of 30 models intricately  detailed down to each nut and bolt," says Dunn. "The flying cars in the aerial  freeway ran from 3 inches to 2 feet. One shot required compositing about 100  effect elements."  </P> <P> Creating the hoverboard sequences, in which Fox skates through the air,  entailed a massive mechanical effects job, involving huge cranes with complex  wire rigs built to fly actors safely around.  </P> <P> Another classic technique pushed to the limits involved a night shot of the  flying car. It's a seamless cut from a miniature to a full-sized car.  </P> <P> "The car is flying high in the air in the distance," recalls Taylor. "As the  camera pans, the car flies behind a lamp post and the real actor comes out in  one continuous shot.  </P> <P> "In the first part (of the shot), they're using a half-foot-long model car. The  second half is a full-sized car with actors. When the car passes behind the  lamp post, they switch. The difficulty of making it match so perfectly is just  breathtaking to professionals."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SMITH, STOKLOS SPIKE LOCAL HEROES' HOPES  </P> <P> The best story lines never happened at Tuesday's finals of the $75,000  Manhattan Beach Open volleyball tournament.  </P> <P>  Story No. 1: The King of the World beats the King of the Beach. Two-time  Olympic gold medalist Karch Kiraly, after retiring from the U.S. national  volleyball team with a weekend USA Cup victory over the Soviet Union, begins  his full-time pro beach career by beating Sinjin Smith, the winningest beach  player in history -- on the Fourth of July no less.  </P> <P>  Sorry. Smith and Randy Stoklos devastated Kiraly and Brent Frohoff, 15-5, to  take the winners bracket title and earn a place in the tournament finals.  </P> <P>  Story No. 2: Local heroes break Manhattan Beach Open victory record. Mike Dodd  and Tim Hovland, who grew up in Manhattan Beach and Playa del Rey,  respectively, capture "the Wimbledon of beach volleyball" for an unprecedented  sixth time, making them the top team and top individual players in the 30-year  history of the event.  </P> <P>  Nope. Not this time. Despite jumping off to a 12-7 lead in the finals, Dodd  and Hovland were worn down by the tenacious defense of Smith and the vicious  jump-serves of Stoklos -- as well as the sweltering heat and two exhausting  matches against Kiraly-Frohoff -- and couldn't hold on. Smith and Stoklos won,  15-13, beating Dodd-Hovland for the first time in the Manhattan Beach Open  finals.  </P> <P> OK, so let's talk about Smith and Stoklos, whose six tournament victories are  the most on this year's tour; whose 10 wins and $134,185 each in prize money  were the most on last year's tour, and whose 97 and 77 open championships are  the most of all-time.  </P> <P> "We've got the monkey off our back. We finally won this one," Stoklos said  after his second Manhattan victory with Smith and third overall. It was the  team's first victory over Dodd-Hovland in the finals. (Smith-Stoklos won  Manhattan in 1986 when Dodd and Hovland were committed to another pro event in  New Jersey.)  </P> <P> Smith, however, denies a "monkey" ever existed, pointing out that the last time  Dodd and Hovland won the event in 1987, Smith and Stoklos were playing in  another pro tournament.  </P> <P> "I don't know who created the hype, the belief that Dodd and Hovland own the  Manhattan Open," said Smith, who has won the event four times, including once  with Kiraly in 1980. "We've done very well there. Most of the games have been  decided by two points, so you can't say they've dominated us."  </P> <P> Still, Dodd and Hovland found a way to win in the past -- a fact of which  Stoklos was well aware.  </P> <P> "It was still going through my mind at 14-13," Stoklos said. "But when I got  that ace, I said, 'There is a God.' "  </P> <P> The ace -- a speeding jump-serve that got past Hovland and landed just inside  the tape -- actually came at 13-12 and brought Smith-Stoklos to game-point,  14-12. Hovland narrowed it to 14-13, ending a seven-point Smith-Stoklos run  with a soft spike into the back court. But after nine consecutive sideouts, a  Stoklos block was touched by both Hovland and Dodd before falling to the hot  sand for the final point, giving Smith-Stoklos a 15-13 victory.  </P> <P> The winners attributed their success to Smith's idea of continually  jump-serving the tiring Dodd and Hovland. The jump-serve is an offensive  weapon, Stoklos said, which puts the opponents immediately on the defensive by  making them handle a serve that has the speed and trajectory of a spike.  </P> <P> Also, Smith and Stoklos used the element of surprise by occasionally spiking on  the pass rather than using the second hit to set the ball for a spike. The  quick attack -- a Smith pass to the net that is spiked or softly tapped by  Stoklos before the other team is in position -- is a Smith-Stoklos trademark  that accounted for three straight points, carrying the winners from a 12-10  deficit to a 13-12 lead.  </P> <P> "We always try to give them something different to think about," Smith said.  </P> <P> Despite what he terms the "hype" of Dodd-Hovland's dominance of the Manhattan  Beach Open and Kiraly's return to the beach game, Smith sees Tuesday's result  as just another tournament victory.  </P> <P> "Randy and I, I'm sure, feel the same way, that every tournament is important,"  he said. "How can we think this is more important than a $100,000 tournament  somewhere else? But because we're playing in California and we're so close to  our homes and it's (Dodd and Hovland's) home, it's nice to win."  </P> <P> Smith, however, says there is no longer the feeling that Manhattan Beach  belongs to Dodd, Hovland and the other players who train at the foot of Marine  Avenue (known as "Marine Street") and Santa Monica is the home turf of Smith,  Stoklos and the players who frequent nearby State Beach.  </P> <P> "There wasn't a real feeling that (the crowd) was more for them than for us,"  said Smith, who attributes the end of volleyball provincialism to the formation  of a professional players association made up of players from all areas. "There  were some outspoken people who I felt were for Hovland and Dodd, but I think I  would have noticed if they were overwhelmingly for them."  </P> <P> Hovland agreed that the Manhattan crowd wasn't all in the "Hovie-Dodd" corner,  but he boldly proclaimed: "We still run the South Bay."  </P> <P> "There's definitely a feeling (of protecting your home turf)," Hovland said.  "There's a big feeling of camaraderie between the locals at Marine Street, the  players at State Beach and the small contingent in Orange County."  </P> <P> Losing to Kiraly-Frohoff in a hard-fought 15-10 match Tuesday morning was  Dodd-Hovland's undoing, Hovland said. They then went to the losers bracket and  had to beat Steve Obradovich and Craig Moothart (15-5) and Kiraly-Frohoff again  (a 17-15 marathon in the consolation finals) to earn their championship shot  against Smith-Stoklos.  </P> <P> Kiraly -- believed by some to be the world's best beach volleyball player -- is  already a force on the pro tour, having won three tournaments with Frohoff this  season. But Smith downplayed the significance of his 15-5 rout of Kiraly in the  winners bracket final.  </P> <P> "For me, having Karch on the tour means one more great player out there for me  to compete against," Smith said. "For the tour, it really helps out. It creates  much more interest. Media-wise, it means we'll be taken more seriously."  </P></p>

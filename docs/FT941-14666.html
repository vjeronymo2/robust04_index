			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: YRM deficit rises to Pounds 1.2m In his first statement since taking over as chairman of YRM, the building design consultancy, Mr Tony Hunt unveiled an increase in losses from Pounds 498,000 to Pounds 1.19m pre-tax for the half year to end-October. Losses per share emerged at 8.15p (2.78p) and the interim dividend is omitted - 0.5p was paid previously but the final was passed as the full year deficit reached Pounds 1.98m. With all areas of business suffering 'extremely difficult' trading conditions turnover fell from Pounds 7.89m to Pounds 5.5m. Mr Hunt said, however, that the rebuilding in the City of London had brought work for most divisions and that in Berlin, instructions had been received for refurbishment work on a chain of hotels.</p>

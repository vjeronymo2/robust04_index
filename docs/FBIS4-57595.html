The ceremony sealed the deep friendship and spirit of  camaraderie existing among us since Cuba opened its doors to us.  This was stated at the ceremony by (Makayia Mochia), permanent  ANC representative to Cuba.    [Begin (Mochia) recording] In raising this flag here, we  acknowledge the fact that our friendship and camaraderie are  entering a new and more significant phase. The protocols signed  recently in Pretoria between our two governments bear witness to  this fact.

The ceremony gave Robaina an opportunity to give a brief  address:    [Begin Robaina recording] Allow me, at this time, to render  homage to the South African people, the main protagonists in  this long struggle, who through perseverance and undying will,  and even at the risk of their lives, made today's victory  possible.

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: IBM debut in parallel processing INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the US computer company reeling from declining sales in its key mainframe market, is today expected to unveil its first machine using parallel processing, a relatively new technology which could help shore up its mainframe revenues. The company is due to hold a news conference to discuss a new scalable parallel processing system and enhancements to its existing family of RISC-based (reduced instruction set computing) workstations. Parallel processing involves using a multitude of off-the-shelf microprocessors to solve problems. Traditional mainframes use a few, very fast and very expensive processors. Parallel processing, which offers buyers much cheaper computing power, has already been introduced commercially by companies such as Hewlett-Packard and NRC. IBM will follow up this announcement on February 9 by unveiling enhancements to its ES/9000 mainframe line.</p>

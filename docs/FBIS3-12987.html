He recommended extending the closure for as  long as possible in order to prevent terrorists from crossing  the Green Line in order to carry out attacks.    Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that the police  minister was speaking during a visit to Beersheba prison where  he inaugurated two new structures which can accommodate 300  prisoners.</p>

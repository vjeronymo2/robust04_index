			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Gilgenberg, Vladivostok city </F> manager, by Raisa Fomicheva; place and date not given:  "Vladimir Gilgenberg: `There Is Hope...'"]    [Text] Vladimir Aleksandrovich Gilgenberg, 38 years  old, manager of the city of Vladivostok, married, has been  nominated to the Kray Duma from the Republican Party.    [Fomicheva] Vladimir Aleksandrovich, you have power today.  Quite a lot! You manage the city. What is prompting you to run  for the Kray Duma?    [Gilgenberg] The law is being flouted here in the presence  of  all the branches of authority. Everyone has already sensed that  it is bad living without deputies. Deputies are a restraining  and controlling factor for the executive branch. They compel all  the organs to work.    [Fomicheva] That is, you are moved only by a desire to help  the kray?    [Gilgenberg] I decided several years ago that Moscow was not  for me, I am a person of my own kray, my own city, [line missing  in original] position, after all, it is a new one--city manager.    The position has existed for a long time in world practice.  And if we are aspiring to a market economy, this kind of  position will also exist. It is possible that it has not yet  achieved the necessary level with my performance. At the present  time, it is necessary to expend a lot of effort on the attacks  of the kray administration, which authorized the subordinate  organs not to subordinate themselves to the city mayoralty. But  in the meantime we received a letter from the Ministry of  Justice yesterday which states that the mayoralty is right on  all questions. But they frayed our nerves for three months, and  inflicted damage on the city in a useless fight. Who will answer  for this?    [Fomicheva] What is authority to you?    [Gilgenberg] I would not want that feeling--of authority.  The  work is difficult and thankless, but I will work until we get  democracy going.    [Fomicheva] Here is a question for you from a meticulous  reader: Are you planning to go to the FRG? It is said that you  agreed to this position because you want the same kind of  position in another country.    [Gilgenberg] I have relatives in the FRG. They asked me: Are  you not insane to remain in Russia at such a time? I answered  that I will only go there when everything is fine in Russia, and  when it is necessary to help Germany.    [Fomicheva] A question from many readers: Why has it become  so dirty in the city?    [Gilgenberg] It would be strange if it were clean,  considering that the kray administration authorized the rayon  authorities not to show up for four months at planning meetings  and conferences in the mayor's office. So, under conditions of  such anarchy, the city became swamped in garbage. But the  administration for services and utilities was disbanded back  during Yefremov's time. We are now restoring it. Relations with  the sanitary inspection service have also become tense. The  chief doctor, who did not punish those responsible for the dirty  conditions, has compiled a protocol against me as the manager.  But about 200 persons work in this system. I recall a case in  the former USSR, in the city of Solikamsk: The chief doctor shut  down plants with injurious wastes. She was summoned to the party  bureau, a scandal broke out, and the whole country came to the  defense of the chief doctor, letters were written, telegrams  sent. You do not investigate such heroes here. No one is fined,  no appeals are made to the mayor's office. There is no sanitary  militia. Then at least let the district militia officer look  after cleanliness together with the yardmen. I think that it  will be said in any house now that, against the background of  the fights between the two administrations, the yardmen are  practically not working. I think that the residents should come  out in spring and tidy up; after all, they also are littering.  But I can imagine what the VLADIVOSTOK newspaper will write in  this regard: "The mayor's office has acknowledged its impotence  and has decided to summon everyone to volunteer weekend work.  But, after all, not in one city of the world do residents  conduct themselves so unwisely. As if it were not their yard,  home, and street. They do not give a damn, they litter, they  move on.    [Fomicheva] You were the deputy of a kray soviet and enjoyed  great authority among your voters. I remember that grateful  letters addressed to you were sent to our newspaper. You have  experience. What do you think? Will you succeed in leaving the  old [illegible word] soviet?    [Gilgenberg] A Duma of 40 persons also cannot solve all  problems immediately. However, it is not a matter of the number  of deputies. At the end of the 1970's I was in the state of  Vancouver, where the parliament consisted of 200 persons, but  they all wanted the best for their state. We have a different  psychology and a habit of constantly living in a fight with one  another. Beginning with the Pioneers, remember: "In the struggle  for the cause, be prepared!" Now, everything depends on the  voters. If they in all seriousness elect worthy people, the Duma  will be able to change the situation.    [Fomicheva] Did you easily collect the signatures for your  registration as a candidate?    [Gilgenberg] Yes.    [Fomicheva] But how did you collect them?    [Gilgenberg] I do not know, my supporters did this in the  microrayons.    [Fomicheva] Did you use your official position? We have a  lot  of letters that talk about such cases in other cities.    [Gilgenberg] In no way!    [Fomicheva] A commission headed by Nelli Yakimenko from the  human rights committee came to Vladivostok to look into the  dispute of the two administrations. Did you meet with it?    [Gilgenberg] Of course. I have known Yakimenko for a long  time: We worked together in the militia, and we joined the  democratic movement together. But this time I met her as a  person who was an official from Moscow. She has set herself up  well in the capital, and the apartment question was resolved.  But, after all, there have been a lot of commissions, and we  hope that they will gain an understanding.    [Fomicheva] What is it like in the mayor's office now?  Quiet?    [Gilgenberg] Those who came to work along with Cherepkov  have  mastered the situation and are working. We are accepting new  people for a probationary period.    [Fomicheva] I wrote once that when we were electing a mayor  we had a poor idea of what it meant. Are you planning a trip  abroad for training?    [Gilgenberg] This is an interesting question. We are  planning  one. Cherepkov's trip to Japan has already fallen through. Now  he is being invited to Italy. Four employees have been invited  to Alaska. However, we cannot leave yet, work in the city has  not been settled. But, then, imagine what we will hear about the  trips. "They left for a rest," it will be said.    [Fomicheva] You will excuse me, but even you have the old  viewpoint! So, let them say it! In any country a person goes  where he has a mind to, and it is only in our "camp of  socialism" that a trip by someone in a managerial position is  accompanied by "howling" in the newspapers. Previously, this was  understandable, as they traveled on party money. But now?    [Gilgenberg] When we were getting buses from South Korea, I  wanted to go myself, but I did not allow myself to do so for  this reason. Although today a trip abroad is really open to  everyone, and any cooperator has traveled through Turkey,  France...    [Fomicheva] You have always wanted democracy to come, when  you started the movement for it with Yakimenko. But are you  living well today?    [Gilgenberg] I will answer you like this: The builders of  both socialism and a society with market relations are one and  the same. And the methods are old, unfortunately.    [Fomicheva] Well, is it good for you or not?    [Gilgenberg] There is the hope that it will be good. And I  think that it is absolutely necessary to retain one principle of  socialism: A person should not fall below a certain level. And  it seems that there was a higher morality.    [Fomicheva] But this is all in your power as the city  manager. Perhaps, start with pornography on vendor stands. After  all, children pass by. Such, excuse me, nonsense is being  disseminated in many aspects of life where we are smartly trying  on the garments of foreign life. Without a moment's hesitation.  But they do not accept pornography there either. What do you  think of the decision of the State Duma on the amnesty?    [Gilgenberg] It seems to me that this question should have  been decided by lawyers at an international level. I am not very  pleased that they were all released. But at the same time, in  periods of crisis, the leadership was completely changed in all  countries. A younger generation of politicians should normalize  the situation in Russia.    [Fomicheva] And in the kray? Will the two administrations  reach an agreement?    [Gilgenberg] I hope that common sense will prevail among the  kray leadership. And then Maritime Kray has every chance of  coming out of the crisis.</p>

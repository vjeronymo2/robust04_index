			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (11): An industry slow to adapt  -The country's sugar production has halved in eight years FOR MANY years the main pillar of the Dominican economy, the sugar industry has recently undergone some difficult years. As the region's second largest producer after Cuba, the Dominican Republic has seen production fall by a half between 1983 and last year. In 1983, the industry accounted for 35 per cent of the country's foreign earnings; last year its share fell to 16 per cent, writes Canute James. The decline has been the result of changes in the economics of international sugar, which have overtaken an industry that has been slow to adapt. At the root of the problem has been the State Sugar Council (CEA), an enterprise created in 1966 to manage the large holdings once owned by President Rafael Trujillo, the dictator assassinated in 1961. Favourable world prices masked a high degree of inefficiency, until depression overtook the international sugar market about a decade ago. Falling prices and high production costs, compounded by outbreaks of cane rust disease which caused depleted yields, exposed the company, and forced it to diversify its operations and sell off land, reducing the area under canes. Much of this land is now taken up by non-traditional agriculture, tourism resorts and free trade zones. The country's other producers, Central Romana (once owned by Gulf and Western) and the Vicini Group, which are both privately owned, also suffered, but were better able to adapt. The sugar industry was also hit by reduced access to the US market with a cutback by Washington of import quotas. Fluctuations in domestic US output led to an increase in the Dominican quota to 333,000 tonnes in 1990, but this has again been cut to 232,500 tonnes this year. At the same time, the Dominican Republic has not made use of preferential access for its sugar to the European market. When it signed the Lome Convention, traditional suppliers said they feared Dominican sugar would depress prices on the EC market. The Dominican government said it would not ship sugar to the EC under preferential terms granted by the Convention. A more recent setback to the country's industry has been the break-up of the Soviet Union, to which it has been supplying between 50,000 and 225,000 tonnes a year. Industry officials and bankers say there is uncertainty about the future of sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States. The sugar industry was hit last year by a row over allegations that Haitian children were being used as labourers on farms owned and operated by the CEA. The Dominican government, stung by accusations from human rights groups that it was condoning child slavery, ordered the deportation of thousands of Haitians who, it said, were illegally resident in the country. Government officials say wages in the sugar industry do not encourage Dominican workers, but there appears to be no worry about the supply of labour for the industry. Rather, Mr Frederico Echineque, executive director of the Dominican Sugar Institute, says that this year production will be higher than last year. The industry is moving into new areas, using the byproducts of the canes for such products as chemicals for the paint industry. But it is unlikely that the industry will abandon production of sugar as its main undertaking. It provides a livelihood for 80,000 people in a labour surplus economy.  ------------------------------------------------         SUGAR PRODUCTION (in tonnes**)  ------------------------------------------------             Total   Exports to    Exports to                         the US      the USSR  ------------------------------------------------ 1983    1,209,456      640,128        45,156 1984    1,133,341      614,159        55,175 1985      920,699      465,085       224,689 1986      894,538      357,789        51,243 1987      815,549      302,804       146,315 1988      776,630      228,900       219,560 1989      693,004      285,136       122,239 1990      589,664      310,297        33,115 1991      628,269      290,310*          n/a  ------------------------------------------------ *Estimate   **Raw value  ------------------------------------------------ Source: Dominican Sugar Institute  ------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Profits advance 10% on flat turnover REED International, the publisher, increased its interim pre-tax profits by 10 per cent to Pounds 94m despite what it said were very difficult market conditions. Turnover was flat at Pounds 758.6m (Pounds 760.8m) in the six months to September 30. Reed said the increase in pre-tax profits understated the underlying trading improvement because of changes in the timing of operating profits and lower disposal gains. Operating profit showed a double-digit improvement in three business segments which bore the brunt of the economic downturn during the past two years - consumer publishing, up 60 per cent; business-to-business, up 13 per cent; and books, which rose 17 per cent. Mr Peter Davis, chairman, said: 'Unfortunately I am not able to report any signs of economic recovery. Only in US business advertising has there been any upturn, but this is relatively weak and the improvements so far could be reversed if there is a setback to business confidence. 'In the UK we must now be concerned that unless the government is able to re-establish confidence in its economic policies, there will be a further decline in a number of our markets, instead of the hoped-for recovery.' Earnings per share rose 8 per cent to 11.7p (10.8p). The interim dividend was increased by 5 per cent to 5p. As a result of the proposed merger with Elsevier, Reed will change its year-end to December 31, and its result for a nine-month period will be announced in March.</p>

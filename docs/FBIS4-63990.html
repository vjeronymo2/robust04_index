			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is in favor of reaching agreed-upon decisions  on the major provisions of a treaty on banning nuclear tests as  soon as possible (by next spring), the director of the Russian  Foreign Ministry's press and information department, Grigoriy  Karasin, said in connection with the talks resumed by the  Disarmament Conference in Geneva.    Russia's Foreign Ministry views these talks as a major  direction of its efforts in the current year, he stressed at  Thursday's briefing. He pointed to Moscow's intention to  "contribute to the endeavors to create favorable conditions for  next year's conference on extending the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty."    According to the diplomat, "Russia favors a realistic and  evolutionary approach to developing the system of international  control over the implementation of a treaty on banning nuclear  tests, which would provide for using at its initial stage  seismic methods, instruments for surveying radioactivity in the  atmosphere, and on-site inspections."</p>

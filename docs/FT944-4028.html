			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Fallout): Take VAT] Now for refunds - The options for those who paid in advance for fuel Paying for fuel in advance was this spring's surprise tax-saving trend. More than 1m households settled gas or electricity bills one or more years ahead to avoid incurring value added tax on what they used. According to British Gas, 600,000 of its account-holders paid an average of Pounds 650 or Pounds 700 before the first stage of VAT was imposed in April this year. If you were one of them, how do you stand now that the planned rise in the VAT rate from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent is not going to take place? And should you try to reclaim some or all of the money? Gas and electricity companies have indicated that they will provide refunds if asked. But accountants say that if you paid one or two years ahead, it is not worth claiming it back, particularly if you are a higher-rate tax payer. Indeed, the pre-payment should still turn out to be a reasonably good investment. Maurice Fitzpatrick, of accountant Chantrey Vellacott, calculates that paying in advance from March 1994 for two years of fuel bills will result in an average tax-free net return of 6.6 per cent a year. (This assumes annual fuel bills of Pounds 750, spread evenly over the year, and a 4 per cent rate on money left on deposit). A 6.6 per cent return is not as high as projected originally when the second year's VAT rate was expected to be higher, but is still better than most people would get from a building society or other low-risk investment. What if you paid for more than two years? Logically, this was never an option - after two years or so, the amount of interest lost made pre-payment look less and less attractive. Nonetheless, a number of people - perhaps keen to deprive the Treasury of some tax, even at their own expense - did pay for five or 10 years' worth of fuel. For them, reclaiming money covering bills after spring 1996 probably is worth-while. Fitzpatrick, however, raises a potential problem. If refunds are available freely, he says, it is conceivable the Customs &amp; Excise could argue that money paid in advance was, in fact, a deposit rather than genuine pre-payment. On this basis, it might be able to demand back payments of VAT on bills already paid at the zero rate. So far, though, there is no indication that it will take this view. If you move home within the two-year period, of course, you will have to reclaim your pre-payments. But there is unlikely to be any problem here. If you opted to cut your tax bill by increasing the energy efficiency of your home with double glazing, insulation and so on, your improvements will now take longer to pay for themselves - although they should still prove a good buy eventually. After all, reducing fuel consumption for environmental reasons was a major reason for introducing the tax in the first place. It is the surest way of lowering your tax bill over the long term.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Good soldier's bitter end: David Buchan looks at the lasting consequences on French politics of Pierre Beregovoy's death France, or at least the entire French political world, is still in shock after Pierre Beregovoy's suicide on Saturday. The self-administered death of the former prime minister, little less than a month after leaving office, has put a temporary freeze on all political activity and on the announcement this week of a new government programme. The wider inquest on the death of Mr Beregovoy, who will be buried today in the central French town of Nevers, has already begun. The immediate reaction of many politicians has been to take the tragedy out on the press. Few were as extreme as Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, who yesterday implicitly accused 'certain media' of the 'murder' of the former prime minister by allegedly hounding him over an interest-free property loan which Mr Beregovoy received from a dubious business acquaintance. Other, more thoughtful politicians acknowledged that Mr Beregovoy's death could have as lasting consequences a reinforcement of the already-emollient political style of Mr Edouard Balladur, who succeeded Mr Beregovoy at the Hotel Matignon, the prime minister's residence, and an accelerated drive within Mr Beregovoy's faction-torn socialist party to close ranks and to rebuild itself. There is also the unknowable effect of the tragedy on President Francois Mitterrand's desire to stay out his two remaining years in the Elysee, after the loss of someone who was among his most loyal - yet, by some accounts, most abused - lieutenants. It is impossible to be precise about the consequences of a tragedy because no one knows what exactly led to it. Mr Beregovoy left, as far as is known, no suicide note. The dramatic headlines all came yesterday - France has few Sunday newspapers to do justice to something that happens on a Saturday, the day Mr Beregovoy shot himself with his bodyguard's revolver. But none was as expressive as Le Figaro's cartoon, showing the former prime minister ascending to heaven with the French republic's symbolic figure of Marianne simply asking 'Pourquoi?'. By choosing to take his life on May 1, Mr Beregovoy seemed to want to leave a message. For this metalworker-turned-prime minister, the date had great symbolism, not only politically but also personally. As he recounted several times, it was on May 1 that at the age of 17 he got his first job on the railways in 1942, that on demobilisation from the army in 1946 he became a salesman for Gaz de France, the state utility, and that years later, in 1981 he became President Mitterrand's first chief of staff at the Elysee. But what the precise message was may forever remain obscure. Some fellow Socialists, including his brother Michel, were quick to say the last straw for Mr Beregovoy was the revelations in February this year that he had borrowed FFr1m (Pounds 120,000) interest-free from the late Roger-Patrice Pelat to help buy a small apartment in Paris's smart 16th arrondissement after the Socialist defeat in 1986 interrupted his stint as finance minister. Certainly, he had weathered other scandals that had broken around him, such as the case of alleged insider trading concerning Pechiney's purchase of Triangle in 1988 and involving Mr Pelat again and Mr Beregovoy's own chef de cabinet when Mr Beregovoy returned to the finance ministry in that year. The Pelat loan affair, breaking less than a month before the March parliamentary elections, must have been particularly galling for Mr Beregovoy, who had always vaunted his honesty and who made stamping out corruption a particular theme of the premiership that he assumed in April 1992. But Mr Beregovoy's explanation of the loan, and in particular his repayment of it by the end of 1992, were accepted with little demur, and neither the press nor his political opponents made much of it during the campaign. It was hardly the vendetta that Mr Leotard, who has had his own real estate dealings subjected to judicial inquiry, seemed to suggest yesterday. Was the rhetoric of the victorious right responsible for making the former premier crack? Certainly, leaders of the new centre-right government did not spare Mr Beregovoy and his colleagues in their condemnation of the Socialists' management of the economy. Even Mr Balladur got carried away a bit on the campaign trail, in claiming that the Socialists were leaving the economy 'in its worst state since the second world war'. Certainly, France's public finances, especially its social security deficits, are in a mess, and Mr Beregovoy was said to have been nervous about the 'audit' of state finances, which was to have been published yesterday, but which Mr Balladur has now delayed. But such 'audits' are not unusual measures for an incoming administration to take. The Socialists did the same when they first took power in 1981. It is a standard political means by which a new government paves the way for unpopular measures such as the tax increases that Mr Balladur plans. The bitter pill of parliamentary defeat might have been sugared for Mr Beregovoy, had Mr Balladur publicly acknowledged the good part of his inheritance from his predecessor - the strength of France's money and its trade balance. For Mr Beregovoy rightly prided himself on his sound management of France's external economic position. Again, it must have been galling for the Socialist former prime minister to see French interest rates falling - partly on the markets' confidence in so strong a new conservative government, but also partly because of the fortuitous decline in German rates - so soon after his departure from the Matignon and before the new government had the time to put any new policies into action. If the Balladur government were rabidly reactionary, one could speculate that Mr Beregovoy's tragic demise might have a moderating effect on it. But it is not, and there are probably enough centrists to prevent it taking such a course in the future. Aside from removing one of its few working-class leaders, the long-term effect of Mr Beregovoy's death on his own party may be to bring its warring ranks together. The former prime minister had tried to stay on good terms with both Mr Laurent Fabius, the Mitterrandist party boss, and with Mr Michel Rocard, the party's presidential contender in 1995, who recently toppled him. Mr Beregovoy's role as the unfortunate captain who went down with his governmental ship in March was not really a bone of contention in the Fabius-Rocard row. His role was strongly criticised by the left-wing Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, but the latter has since left the party. Yet, probably the bitterest thing which Mr Beregovoy had to swallow in his long career was that President Mitterrand left it until the party was crumbling into internecine warfare and the economy sliding into recession to name him to the top government job. On entering the Matignon, he is said to have commented bitterly of his predecessors: 'The president chose Fabius because he was the youngest, Rocard because he was the most brilliant, Cresson because she was a woman. Finally, he named me, when it was already too late.' None the less, the good soldier plugged on, apparently believing that some miracle might turn up. He even bravely deluded himself that he could do something about rising unemployment, an issue which mattered greatly to this former union organiser. But no miracle ever materialised.</p>

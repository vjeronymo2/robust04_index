			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Unholy saga of the church's missing millions: The average clergyman's annual pay is about Pounds 12,000. But the Church Commissioners have let Pounds 500m slip through their fingers because of ill-judged investment THE CHURCH Commissioners, who manage Pounds 2.7bn of investments on behalf of the Anglican clergy, have some explaining to do. Over the past two years no less than Pounds 500m has slipped through their fingers. That mind-numbing sum is the amount by which they have been forced to write down the value of their property investments after an ill-judged decision to expand their property holdings at the top of the 1980s property boom; and it has been magnified by a controversial decision to finance speculative property developments with borrowings, mainly from National Westminster Bank, that reached nearly Pounds 520m at their peak last year. The outcome is that the Church's income is sharply down in real terms and Anglican parishioners are being asked to fill the hole in the commissioners' finances. How did this august body, which ranks a number of distinguished City figures on its asset committee, get into such a mess? The commissioners claim the disaster was caused by forces outside their control. In pamphlets distributed in parishes across the UK they have declared that investment income will be flat over the next few years because of the recession. They have warned that the amount they contribute to the pay of the church's 11,300 clergy will be cut from 45 per cent last year to a mere 30 per cent in 1995. Dr George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury and chairman of the commissioners, was reported in the Church Times earlier this year as saying that 'the finances of the Church of England have been badly hit by inflation'. Yet a detailed investigation by the Financial Times into the church's losses in property suggests a rather different explanation. The badly-timed decision to add to the church's already extensive property by borrowing to invest in a series of speculative developments raises serious questions about the management and accountability of this discreet but powerful institution. How could this happen? Part of the answer depends on the peculiar history of the Church Commissioners. They were the product of a merger in 1948 between the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and Queen Anne's Bounty, whose combined assets were then worth more than Pounds 200m. Most of those assets were in farms and property ground rents, some dating back to the dissolution of the monasteries. A minority was invested in gilt-edged stocks. Not until the merger did the men who invested the church's money have the power to invest in ordinary shares. Since then the commissioners' task, under the Church Commissioners Measure of 1947, has been to continue providing pensions, pay and housing aid for the clergy and its dependents. In effect, they run a cross between a pension fund and a private investment trust. They do so within broad ethical guidelines that preclude investment in armaments, alcohol, tobacco and other controversial businesses. Since the 1950s the church's investment managers have sought to exploit the potential of one of the country's oldest estates in partnership with leading property developers. With the help of entrepreneurs, such as Lord Rayne of London Merchant Securities, the balance of the Church Commissioners' property portfolio has changed from predominantly agricultural and residential, to commercial. Huge residential estates, such as Maida Vale estate in north London, which had belonged to the bishops of London since the Middle Ages, were largely sold off and the proceeds reinvested in offices, shops and industrial premises. This change of emphasis, as Oliver Marriott has recorded in his book The Property Boom, was highly profitable for the commissioners. At the start of the 1980s property still accounted for more than two thirds of the church's investments, compared with a little over 20 per cent for the average pension fund. Then the trouble began. The past decade has been near-disastrous for commercial property investment. According to a leading performance measurement survey run by the WM Company, UK property produced a total annualised return, including capital and income, over the past ten years of 9.7 per cent. This compares with the return on all investments held by the average pension fund in WM's survey of 15.6 per cent. On a rough calculation that underperformance could have cost the clergy anything between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m a year in today's money over the course of the decade. The commissioners' problems were compounded by errors of timing. In 1983, when the dollar was riding high and money was pouring into real estate development in the US, they joined the American real estate stampede. Advised by Chesterton, the property agents, they bought offices, shopping centres and warehouses from Tampa, Florida to Minnetonka in Minnesota, to Sunnyvale, California. Their approach was idiosyncratic. The Church Commissioners' property man, until his resignation last year, was Michael Hutchings. In the words of a former colleague, Hutchings, a flamboyant character, was 'temperamentally disinclined' to fly. To monitor the church's investments in the US, he used to cross the Atlantic on the QE2 and then travel the continent by train, car and bus. He also attracted some notoriety world by sending his own cases of wine ahead of him; but without obvious beneficial effect on investment performance. By the end of the decade the return on the church's US properties was even worse than on the British ones at an annualised 7.3 per cent. A decision was taken to reduce the American portfolio. But as the commissioners cut their US losses, their large investment in agricultural property was doing even worse. The commis sioners say that they hold farmland for 'historical reasons' and argue that tenanted farm land has been hard to sell. So their longstanding policy has been to reduce their holdings whenever vacant possession has been obtained. In 10 years this has cut the acreage by 10 per cent to 155,000 acres, recently valued at Pounds 211m. But the investment performance has been abysmal. One broad indicator is the annualised return over the past 10 years on agricultural properties in the respected IPD databank. This was a mere 1 per cent. However, other institutions appear to have been much more successful than the commissioners in selling tenanted land. According to IPD, tenanted land in its database has come down from just over 500,000 acres to 277,500 acres over the past 10 years. A leading agent in the agricultural property market said: 'Even in the early 1980s the commissioners' agricultural commitments looked incredibly over-exposed. They are immensely traditional landlords and so wrapped up in this that it has clouded their judgment. I am surprised they did not try to shift more.' Another property expert wondered whether the commissioners might have become too attached to the seigneurial trappings of land ownership - visiting farms, presiding over dinners for the tenantry and dispensing engraved goblets to longstanding tenants - despite potential conflicts with the financial needs of the clergy. According to one insider these duties were seen as terrific fun and were enthusiastically performed by some members of the commissioners' asset committee. Between the start of the 1980s and the end of 1988 the commissioners reduced their property holdings from 67 per cent to 57 per cent of their total portfolio. Even at that level they were heavily at risk when compared with the average pension fund, which had reduced property from more than 20 per cent of the portfolio to under 10 per cent over the same period. Then the commissioners took a fateful decision. They not only increased their commitment to property, but did so on borrowed money for speculative development. This move, which was to take property back up to 64 per cent of the portfolio by the end of 1990, was highly controversial. Earlier ventures into property development had been financed mainly by selling property on the existing estate. Yet, in their 1990 annual report, the commissioners described the decision to borrow for developments as being 'in accordance with normal commercial practice'. Leading fund managers consulted by the Financial Times found this statement bizarre. For a closed fund with no new money coming in, borrowing for high-risk speculative development was, in their view, extremely unorthodox. Even for a contributory pension fund with a positive cash inflow, borrowing is usually regarded as a questionable practice. In those cases where pension funds have been tempted to borrow for property development, as at the ICI, Unilever and Electricity pension funds in the 1970s, the outcome proved exceptionally damaging to their finances and performance. So it turned out with the Church Commissioners. Back in 1988 their unsecured borrowings of Pounds 192m from National Westminster Bank bore interest at between 9.15 per cent and 14 per cent. By the time total borrowings topped Pounds 500m in 1990 the commissioners had ceased to disclose the interest rates in their annual report. But they were undoubtedly burdensome. In effect, the church had decided to go into debt just before real rates of interest, after adjusting for inflation, rose to their highest level since the Depression of the 1930s. Most of the developments were brought to the commissioners by Chesterton. Some, such as the Metro Centre at Gateshead in north east England have proved successful. This scheme, on which the commissioners arranged long-term borrowings of more than Pounds 100m, attracts high-spending shoppers from Norway and Denmark, as well as the immediate area around Newcastle. It was recently valued at over Pounds 200m. Others have proved problematic. Among the retail developments the Marlowes Centre at Hemel Hempstead, undertaken jointly with Martin Landau's City Merchant Developers (subsequently merged with property group Imry) and Sir Robert McAlpine, is only 75 per cent let. Beechwood Place shopping centre in Cheltenham, undertaken jointly with developers Arrowcroft, is 50 per cent empty. Even in those developments that have found tenants, costs have often exceeded budget, while revenues have fallen short. A striking feature of many of these development partnerships, in which the commissioners provide most of the finance and the developers the expertise, is their apparent generosity to the entrepreneurs. Under a formula known in the property market as a 'profit erosion' deal, the developers sell the land to the commissioners on day one. They then share some limited risk in the development by agreeing to pay the commissioners a guaranteed rent for up to two years after completion, regardless of whether the building fills up with tenants. But thereafter the commissioners are unprotected. In many cases they have given the developers a 40 per cent share of the profits and assets. According to property market experts approached by the Financial Times, this looks on the high side. With hindsight, it has unquestionably proved to be so in certain instances. A case in point was a partnership with Oxford &amp; Cambridge Estates, run by Andrew Oakes, a former partner in agents Richard Ellis. The partnership was set up in mid-1989 to develop a business park of more than 300,000 sq ft near Banbury in Oxfordshire, with profits shared 60/40 in favour of the commissioners. By mid-1990 Oxford &amp; Cambridge was in liquidation. One of the most difficult of these speculative developments is at Ashford in Kent, where the commissioners, jointly with Imry Merchant Developers, have spent more than Pounds 65m buying agricultural land, and options on land, covering 2,000 acres in all. The site, originally assembled by property entrepreneur Jim Cookson, was another of the projects introduced to the commissioners by Martin Landau. The plan is to build a giant office and shop complex to benefit from the Channel Tunnel's main junction point in Kent. But this grandiose vision is proving controversial. Local Anglicans have been angered by the potential disruption of communities and have questioned the scheme's financial soundness from the outset. Some protested directly to Dr Robert Runcie when he was still Archbishop of Canterbury. This was not the first time that the commissioners faced controversy over the social consequences of their role as landlords. Part of their Paddington estate used to contain pockets of prostitution, including an area near Paddington Station known as Sin Triangle. And, in spite of being powerless to act under the terms of 19th century leases, the commissioners were accused of paying the clergy from the proceeds of immoral earnings. More recently the commissioners have been forced to justify their investment policies in the High Court by the Rt Rev Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford, who rejected the idea that the church's interests were best served by maximising investment returns. Dr Runcie's response to criticisms of the proposed development at Ashford was robustly commercial. 'We have to face the fact,' he said, 'that in many parts of the country, development is the price we have to pay for economic expansion.' His view appears not to have been shared by Chris Patten, environment secretary at the time and a Roman Catholic, who rejected the outline planning application. According to documents seen by the Financial Times, the open market value of the site without planning consent was estimated to be only Pounds 15m after the rejection, compared with its original cost to the partners of Pounds 65m. More than Pounds 200m of the write-down against the church's property portfolio relates to developments such as these. The consequences for the church's income, which is what really matters to the clergy, are depressing. So why did the commissioners go out on such a limb? The Financial Times asked Matthew Oakeshott, of Olim, the independent fund manager which runs property portfolios for large pension funds and Oxford Colleges, to look at the commissioners' annual report. He was struck by the exposure to property, when compared with the average pension fund, the property holdings of which are now down to 7 per cent. Oakeshott was also surprised that the commissioners attributed their faltering income to recession, since the property income of most long term funds continues to rise. He diagnosed a lack of clarity about performance objectives: if this were a large pension fund it would be normal to have more information about the management structure, clearer figures on investment returns and an attempt to address the issue of asset allocation directly. That view would apply with equal force to earlier annual reports. Performance is mainly discussed in terms of individual asset categories such as shares or property. No figures are given for the total return on the funds. In the absence of any clear statement of long-term asset allocation policy, says Oakeshott, they appear to be judge and jury in their own case. Much the same might be said of the commissioners' advisers, Chesterton, in the sense that they provide valuations for the property performance measurement, as well as advising on purchases. Sir Douglas Lovelock, the First Church Estates Commissioner, said the commissioners decided to borrow for property development because they were under pressure to generate more income to meet rising pension costs in the early 1990s. Without borrowing, they could not have invested in such a big development as the Metro Centre. Developments, he added, also provided an element of diversification away from offices into retail property. The commissioners, unlike some, had not been badly hurt in central London offices, the worst hit area of the market. 'Ideally,' he said, 'we would have sold farms and offices, but we cannot do it fast enough. We are reducing our property, and would like to reduce further.' On the borrowing, he said: 'Hindsight does not lead me in a different direction' and added that the borrowings were not high by the standards of property companies. It seems odd, however, to compare this arm of the Anglican church with a property company. Other sources close to the commissioners suggest that the decision to borrow may also have been indirectly influenced by pressure from the National Audit Office, which vets the accounts. Under the 1947 Church Commissioners' Measure, the commissioners are allowed to spend money on pay and pensions only out of earned income, a rule designed to protect the interests of tomorrow's clergymen against those of today. Within that constraint, property development creates problems because it depletes income during the long gestation period before developments generate revenue. In their earlier developments financed from their own resources, the commissioners found a means of smoothing their overall income through the separate subsidiary companies that undertook the developments. While these were legal, the National Audit Office is believed to have worried about the spirit of the arrangements. By borrowing money on which the interest was rolled up until completion of the development, the commissioners' current income has been protected from an interest charge now running at more than Pounds 50m a year. They have also had the benefit of high money market interest rates on sums set aside to repay the borrowings. But now that borrowings must be repaid, the fat receipts from money market accounts are being replaced by very low returns on property. Hence the income crisis and the demands now being made of Anglican parishioners. The Church Commissioners have been obliged to sell off many of their better properties while the market is at its lowest level for many years. The clergy, whose average annual income is little more than Pounds 12,000, is no doubt meekly accepting the commissioners' explanation of events, while the Anglican laity reaches into its pockets with as much goodwill as it can muster. In an organisation where questioning the performance of well-meaning people might be seen as un-Christian, no investigation into the disaster has been announced. But not everyone has emerged poorer from the saga. While the commissioners continued to increase their property holdings, one of their partners, Martin Landau, was bought out of Imry in a takeover at the peak of the boom. While investors in the bidding company, Marketchief, lost all their money - the company is now the subject of a rescue led by Barclays Bank - the irrepressible Landau is a tax exile in Monte Carlo.</p>

When comparing the average of  1993 to the average of 1992, the level of consumer prices  increased 20.8 percent.    Taking into account basic groups of goods, the prices of  food  products experienced a growth of 16.6 percent and those of  non-food consumer goods of 19.4 percent. These are the most  important and most widely consumed groups and thus have a big  impact on the overall price level.    Prices in public catering increased 27.5 percent and those  of  services by 28.7 percent.    The difference between the year-on-year and average annual  price growth was caused by the fact that prices grew the most at  the beginning of 1993, while in 1992 they grew the most at the  end.

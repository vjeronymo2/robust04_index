			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Caracas fixes single rate against dollar: Bolivar pegged in new foreign exchange controls The Venezuelan government announced a single exchange rate of 170 bolivars to the US dollar late on Tuesday, following more than a week of deliberations on new foreign exchange controls. On June 23, the last day of trading, the bolivar stood at about 200:Dollars 1, down from 106 at the end of 1993. The imposition of exchange controls came after months of heavy pressure on Venezuela's international reserves, caused by a crisis in the banking system, much rumour and a marked deterioration in the economy. Announcing the controls, Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said he hoped they would be temporary. They would be accompanied by a series of macroeconomic measures aimed to balance the 1994 and 1995 budgets, he said, giving no details. The government had rejected the idea of a parallel free market in foreign exchange, he said, because it feared 'destabilising agents' would create an unacceptable gap between the official rate and the parallel rate. Any foreign exchange trading outside the official system would be illegal and subject to penalties, he warned. The controls will cover imports, expenses of Venezuelan students abroad, external debt payments for the public and the private sector, spending by travellers, and 'small remittances' by foreigners in Venezuela to relatives abroad. Officials stressed that the government would meet all international commitments and provide foreign exchange to international investors, to allow for profit remittances. Mr Sosa also argued that the new exchange rate would help international investors, by removing the penalty of the 'speculative' exchange rates seen in recent months. He said the system of assigning foreign exchange would be 'highly automated and transparent', and would be set up with the help of PDVSA, Venezuela's national oil company. However, foreign exchange trading at the new rate was not to resume yesterday, as planned, due to 'technical questions' at the central bank. Commercial banks said yesterday that they expected trading to resume on Monday. The new programme is Venezuela's fourth foreign exchange system since President Rafael Caldera took office in February. The first was a crawling-peg system used by the central bank until its president, Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, resigned at the end of April over disagreements with the Caldera administration. This was followed briefly by a limited auction system at the central bank, then by a modified version of a Dutch auction, in effect until June 23. Mr Sosa stressed that the government has enough monetary reserves to meet Venezuela's import and foreign debt obligations, but not enough to finance capital flight. Officials estimate 'normal' foreign exchange sales to be about Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.5m) each business day. PDVSA supplies the central bank with about Dollars 40m a day from oil exports. The central bank has not issued figures on monetary reserves since April, when the bolivar began to slip, but a Caracas daily, citing figures from the government planning office, reported that gross international reserves at the end of May stood at Dollars 9.9bn, down 21 per cent from Dollars 12.6bn at the end of 1993.</p>

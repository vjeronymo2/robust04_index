			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Fight breaks out over US painkillers An ugly spat broke out in the Dollars 2.3bn-a-year US painkillers market yesterday when the maker of Advil, the second biggest-selling non-prescription analgesic, accused two companies of making false claims in advertisements for a rival brand. American Home Products, which makes Advil, said it had filed a lawsuit against Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products company, and Syntex, another US drugs group, for making misleading statements about their painkiller Aleve, launched on the US over-the-counter market in June. Procter &amp; Gamble is also involved in a dispute with Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer group, over soap powders. Advil is a branded version of ibuprofen, which has grown in popularity at the expense of older aspirin-based analgesic products. In June, sales of Advil and other established analgesics, such as the top-selling Tylenol, were threatened when Syntex joined with Procter &amp; Gamble to launch Aleve, an over-the-counter version of the drug naproxen sodium, previously sold only under prescription. Yesterday American Home Products accused Procter &amp; Gamble and Syntex of misleading consumers with 'unwarranted and unsubstantiated claims' for Aleve's effectiveness. Among the most serious, it said, was the suggestion that Aleve lasted longer than Advil because the dosing interval was longer. The longer interval was because of safety concerns. Procter &amp; Gamble said all its claims for Aleve were true and it would vigorously defend them.</p>

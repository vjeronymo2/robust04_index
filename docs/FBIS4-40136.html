			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was  operated on at Moscow's Central Clinic last Friday to grind his  gall stone by ultrasound. As Interfax has learned, the surgery  was performed on recommendations by the German specialists who  examined Chernomyrdin at the Mainz University Clinic last week.    The operation is reported to have gone well, and doctors say  it will take the patient a few days to recuperate. A government  spokesman has reported that Chernomyrdin is due to be back at  work from a short leave on June 16.    As has been reported the premier is scheduled to travel to  the U.S. later this month to attend a session of the  Russian-American commission which he co-chairs with U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore. On his way to the U.S., Chernomyrdin  plans to stop over in Italy.    He underwent a similarly successful operation at a clinic  last autumn. However, surgeons recommended that he be examined  at a specialized clinic abroad. It was after that examination  that repeated surgery was recommended.</p>

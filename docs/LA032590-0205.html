			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES;  </P> <P> LATINOS MUST STAND, DELIVER FOR THE CENSUS;  </P> <P> REPRESENTATION: FUNDS, REPRESENTATION AND GENERAL WELFARE ARE AT STAKE.  </P> <P> The 1990s will be a decade of change for the Latino community in Orange County  and elsewhere. As policy-makers debate issues that will affect Latinos over the  next decade, the Bureau of the Census is compiling the data that will inform  this debate. April 1, 1990, signals the beginning of the bureau's attempt to  obtain a complete tally of the Latino community.  </P> <P> At issue is whether the Orange County community will be counted completely. A  complete count is essential to its well-being. Census data is used to  reapportion political districts. The data is also used to distribute federal  and state funds, and assess the social and economic needs of the community.  </P> <P> Once residents receive the questionnaire, the issue becomes whether they will  fully disclose the characteristics of their living situation. For Latinos, a  number of factors make full disclosure less likely. A large immigrant community  distrustful of the government may not respond to the questionnaire at all.  Another complication is that questionnaires will be mailed out in English only.  Spanish-speaking persons will be referred to a toll-free number where they can  request a questionnaire in Spanish. Many people may not bother to call, or not  get to the message in Spanish.  </P> <P> Another factor is the high cost of housing that contributes to families  doubling up in small apartments. Many of these families fear being evicted if  authorities discover how many people are living in the unit. The same high cost  of housing also contributes to large numbers of unrelated people sharing living  space to save money.  </P> <P> In order to avoid discovery of this overcrowding, people may not respond or may  limit their response to include only the "legal" number of residents allowed.  And many Latinos are homeless. In addressing a complete count of the Latino  community, these persons must receive special attention.  </P> <P> Despite the many ways that Latinos could be missed, there are solutions.  Community awareness specialists have been working with community groups,  agencies, churches, schools and amnesty classes to get the word out for over a  year. Complete Count committees have been organized nationally to focus on  counting high-interest groups such as Latinos. There will be Spanish-language  advertisement campaigns. These are positive steps that will help achieve a  complete count. However, the Latino community must take active steps to ensure  full disclosure on the questionnaire.  </P> <P> Only the Latino community can assure Latinos that full disclosure will not  jeopardize their living situation. Only the Latino community can assure its  "hidden" members that full disclosure is in the best interests of everyone.  Only the Latino community can give life to the educational efforts of the  Census Bureau. Without that active and continuous involvement, a complete count  cannot be achieved.  </P> <P> The active involvement into overcrowded barrios, to areas where immigrants are  concentrated and day laborers gather, and to places where the homeless sleep  will mean working beyond census day on April 1. The more difficult task of  retrieving questionnaires that fully disclose the characteristics of Latino  households must remain a central focus for Latinos through the summer of 1990.  </P> <P> By educating the community on the need for full disclosure, Latinos will ensure  that the 6% to 8% of the community missed in the 1980 census is counted in  1990. This factor will produce significant gains for everyone, but especially  for Latinos because political representation will be increased, additional  funds will be allocated to the community and more social services will be  provided.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- Assistant Foreign  Minister Choe Tong-chin said Wednesday there has been no talk of  resuming inter-Korean dialogue, but he expected action by  Pyongyang shortly as it is a prerequisite to a third round of  high-level North Korea-U.S. talks. Choe cautiously predicted  resumption of inter-Korean dialogue, while elaborating on the  surprise news that Pyongyang had agreed to full-scale nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in  a government-party meeting at the Democratic Liberal Party (DLP)  headquarters.    An IAEA inspection team may leave for Pyongyang as soon as  this weekend, Choe reported to party policy-makers.    Under a previous agreement worked out at talks in New York  last December, North Korea can begin the third round of  high-level talks with the United States only when it makes  significant progress in inter-Korean relations such as an  exchange of envoys, Choe explained.    The third Pyongyang-Washington talks will touch on a wide  range of issues including North Korea's complete return to the  nuclear non-proliferation treaty, sincere implementation of the  declaration on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, and improvement  of bilateral relations in the political, economic and security  areas, he said.    With its acceptance of IAEA inspections, Pyongyang is  expected to open dialogue channels with the United States, South  Korea and the UN nuclear watchdog, he added.    Choe declined to comment on whether North Korea has agreed  to  the special inspections repeatedly requested by the IAEA.</p>

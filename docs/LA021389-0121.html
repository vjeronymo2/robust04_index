			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAKER TOUR OUTSHONE BY GORBACHEV;  </P> <P> SECRETARY FINDS IT HARD TO COMPETE IN EUROPEAN SWING  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, on his first diplomatic tour of West  European capitals, is finding it difficult to compete with the public relations  blitz of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a senior U.S. official said  today.  </P> <P> Baker also is having his problems with West German leaders and their reluctance  to support the upgrading of NATO's tactical nuclear missiles, the official  said. But after touching base in six of the 15 allied capitals, Baker's biggest  problem is Gorbachev and the inroads he has made in Western European public  opinion.  </P> <P> "There is just an attraction, an intriguing quality to Gorbachev that you have  to answer somehow," said the official, who participated in most of the meetings  Baker has held on his trip.  </P> <P> "We have no answer," the official told reporters as Baker flew back to West  Germany for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disarmament Trends  </P> <P> Responding to strong disarmament trends among the German people, Kohl last week  proposed a delay of two or three years in upgrading the short-range Lance  missile deployed in the country.  </P> <P> The North Atlantic Treaty Organization faces a decision in a few months on  whether to double the range of the U.S.-built rockets from 70 miles to about  150 miles.  </P> <P> Kohl told reporters he wants NATO to build into its defense strategy a  disarmament mandate if the allies go ahead with a plan.  </P> <P> After talking to the chancellor, Baker told reporters that he hoped the issue  could be settled at a NATO summit meeting, which is being planned for late May  in Brussels.  </P> <P> He said Kohl gave assurances that he was not "backing off" West Germany's  approval of a NATO declaration last year, saying the allied defense should mix  nuclear and conventional weapons that "will continue to be kept up to date."  </P> <P> Covering 15 capitals in eight days is testing Baker's endurance. Today, for  example, was a three-country day with stops in Denmark, Norway and West  Germany. Tuesday will be no easier, with Baker going to Turkey, Greece and  Italy.  </P></p>

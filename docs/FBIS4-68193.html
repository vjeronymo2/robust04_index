			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Edward Gorman report: "MI6 Fears IRA May Obtain Missing </F> Afghan Missiles"]    [Excerpts] Kabul -- American attempts to control the black  market in Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, first supplied eight  years ago to rebels fighting the Soviet Union's army in  Afghanistan, are proving virtually futile.    Inquiries by THE TIMES in Afghanistan and Pakistan suggest  hundreds of these highly sophisticated and deadly shoulder-held  weapons have now gone astray in south Asia and the Middle East.  A serious fear in British intelligence circles is that the IRA  will succeed in buying or being given the weapon and the  training to enable its terrorists to use it.    The heat-seeking infra-red Stinger, which is difficult to  deflect with flares or chaff once it has locked onto a target,  would transform the military balance in Northern Ireland,  allowing the Provisionals to shoot down military transport  helicopters virtually at will. At a stroke this would cripple  army logistics in the province and force a substantial rethink  on military strategy. A constant watch for signs that IRA  members or their representatives are on the hunt for the Stinger  in the arms bazaars of the Middle East and Asia is being mounted  by British intelligence, but so far none has been detected.  However, at least one alert has been issued in the past year in  Pakistan.    An accompanying danger is that Iran may supply Stingers to  the Provisionals or has already done so. At the end of last  month, the full extent of Iranian contacts with the IRA was  disclosed by British intelligence sources after a leak to a  Greek newspaper, prompting a diplomatic dispute between the two  countries. The Iranians are known to be among the main  beneficiaries of Stingers sold by Afghan Mujahidin commanders  first obtaining them in 1987 when they "confiscated four  launchers and 16 missiles from a commander, and are now thought  to have many more of the weapons."    The IRA is not the only danger. The Americans fear Islamic  radicals may attempt to use the missiles against civilian  passenger aircraft and the Turks are concerned about Kurdish  rebels getting them. Other countries known to have Stingers  include Libya, Iraq, North Korea, and militant Palestinian  groups. [passage omitted]    Inquiries suggest that, of the original estimated 1,000  intended for Afghanistan, around 300 were used inside the  country, 200 are now stored in the arsenals of Pakistan, a  further 200 have already gone missing, and about 300 are still  in the hands of former Mujahidin commanders. The numbers are  unverifiable but are regarded as a reasonably accurate guide by  diplomatic sources. These sources say of the 300 still in  Afghanistan at the beginning of this year. about 100 have  recently been sold, including around 60 to the Americans who  have paid between $85.000 and more than $100,000 for each  launcher. The North Koreans, who closed their embassy in Kabul  last month, are thought to have bought at least 30, with another  ten going to the Iranians and two to the Iraqis. The Americans  are not willing to discuss the programme beyond confirming that  it is still going on. [passage omitted]</p>

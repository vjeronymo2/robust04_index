			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Observer: Sunday disservice Former presidential hopeful Ross Perot should stick to chat shows. If anyone still thinks the jug-eared millionaire holds promise, they were not listening to his grilling on last weekend's 'Meet the Press'. Repeatedly quizzed by journalists over his plans to slash health spending, Perot claimed he had left his 'very detailed list' at home. He would have brought it had he been asked, he wailed, as the Wall Street Journal reminded him this was not 'some piddling little detail', but over half of his total proposed spending cuts. Just stopping short of making history by becoming the first guest in 46 years to walk off the show, Perot tried to turn the tables. 'Washington doesn't keep books. It's like flying blind in a 747 down on the deck, wide open through the mountains at night in the fog,' spluttered the one-time master of the sound bite. When someone politely enquired whether Perot planned to stand again in 1996, the Texan replied that he hoped it would be unnecessary. As a Republican candidate then? 'That would be up to them.' All in all, as Clinton's campaign strategist James Carville remarked, Perot would have been better off in church last Sunday.</p>

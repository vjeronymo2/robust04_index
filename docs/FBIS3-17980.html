			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy </F> by Georgiy Chernomorskiy; place and date not given: "Ukraine  Will Live Up to Its Commitments"]    [Text] [Chernomorskiy] Many of our citizens are surely  concerned about the implementation of the trilateral agreement  signed by the Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian presidents to bring  nuclear weapons out of Ukraine. What can you say about this?    [Radetskyy] A total of 2,000 combat units are subject to  removal. The first train with 60 combat units left Ukraine for  its destination site on 4 March. One could ask, why only 60?  Just because this is a technically founded norm. The next  trainload was due to leave for Russia on 9 March. This did not  happen, though; and it was not the fault of Ukraine. The point  is that there was an information leak in the Russian press that  revealed the departure date. Can you imagine what could have  happened if some lunatic, or a group of people, had decided to  follow the example of Herostratus [who burned a famous Greek  temple to become famous]?    I believe that it would be better if journalists stuck to  the  Hippocratic principle of "do not harm." As for the next  shipment, it did leave Ukraine, but not before we made sure that  all precautionary measure were taken along its route. Ukraine  has always had a serious attitude toward its commitments.    [Chernomorskiy] The press has recently published a lot of  articles about the excessive number of generals in the Ukrainian  Army. They say that Ukraine has more generals than all of the  NATO countries combined.    [Radetskyy] The Ukrainian Army, numbering more than half a  million servicemen, has 260 generals. So, in this respect, it  is not all that different from other Armed Forces in Europe.  But this issue did not appear out of nowhere -- Ukraine does  have many generals. The point is that they are attached to  different ministries and committees, and have nothing to do with  the Army. Plus, 260 is not a final figure. Under certain  conditions, it could be revised and reduced. These conditions,  however, do not exist at present.    The Academy of Ukrainian Armed Forces will become  operational  on 1 September. Beside Ukrainian officers, it will accept  foreign and CIS officers for study. As it will need experienced  scholars, generals with vast expertise will surely be invited to  teach at this institution.    [Chernomorskiy] A lot of speculation was raised by the  statement of Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander in  chief of the Ukrainian Navy, when he said our country has no  intention of selling its share of the Black Sea Fleet. At the  same time, Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister,  insists that the agreements made in Massandra be honored.    [Radetskyy] There was no Massandra agreement as such, to  begin with. Only an agreement on intentions was signed. I  believe that these intentions will be implemented only by mutual  agreement of the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, who are also  commanders in chief of their Armed Forces. They are empowered  to make a final decision. In any case, we should clearly define  what is subject to division or sale. This is why on 15 March,  we began an inventory of the Black Sea Fleet assets as of  December 1991, after which Russia and Ukraine are to determine  to what degree the fleet should be scaled down. In the end, the  final course of action is to be made during the third stage. In  any case, Ukraine will not be left without the fleet. Even  today, the Ukrainian Navy includes five combat ships, and there  are still new ships under construction at Ukrainian shipyards!    [Chernomorskiy] What is the situation in the Air Force?  According to evidence gathered by our newspaper, 300 pilots  have applied for discharges; because of fuel shortages, they  rarely get the chance to fly, losing their skills. The 19  unique TU-160 aircraft, costing $250 million a piece, are also  sitting idle on the ground. Their maintenance must be quite  expensive, I presume. Maybe we should sell them?    [Radetskyy] Your paper's evidence is, to put it mildly,  overstated. There were no more than 100 pilots who requested  discharges. These were primarily officers whose length of  service makes them eligible for retirement. Some want to change  their citizenship and move to another CIS country for permanent  residence. This is a natural process. At the same time, I admit  that there are reasons for concern. Depending on the type of  aircraft, the standard annual flight time for U.S., German, or  Dutch pilots is 160-180 hours. This norm was a little lower in  the former Soviet Air Force. In Ukraine, it is 25-40 hours in  most Air Force units. Of course, the pilots did not fold their  wings. They fully exploit training facilities, which  unfortunately, cannot substitute for real flying.    Now, about the TU-160's, as Ukrainian airspace is too small,  our strategy does not envision employing these planes. I  personally believe that these planes can be sold -- not for  money, though. The dollars or rubles that we would receive for  them could get past the Defense Ministry, disappearing in  different channels. We would be better off if the other party  would pay with components for combat and army aviation vehicles,  fuel, or diesel fuel for housing construction. Of course, it is  up to the government and president whether or not those planes  need to be sold.    [Chernomorskiy] You mentioned housing construction. How many  servicemen are without a place to live? How is this problem  being tackled?    [Radetskyy] As of 1 March 1994, there were 78,236 officers  and warrant officers in the Ukrainian Armed Forces without  housing. According to a state program, the Defense Ministry will  receive between 24,000 and 28,000 apartments annually.  Unfortunately, the state is not in a position to implement this  program right now. Last year, we were given only 14,000  apartments in spite of the active engagement of several foreign  companies in the housing projects. Things will hardly improve  over the next two years. I would like to note, however, that a  great deal depends not only on the state budget, but on the  attitude of local authorities as well. For example,  Dniepropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankovsk, Lvov, and Chernigov Oblasts  cope with the problem of housing for the military much better  than other regions.    [Chernomorskiy] What are your impressions from your recent  trip to the United States?    [Radetskyy] I was part of the president's team and, at the  same time, a guest of newly appointed U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry. I was quite impressed with my visit to the  Pentagon, but it was not over its size or number of hallways. I  was stunned by the atmosphere of openness. You know, I am not  20 years old and can tell real candor from phony. All my  questions were comprehensively answered. They saw a partner in  me, not a potential adversary.    I also had a chance to visit West Point, the oldest military  academy in the United States. Our readers would be curious to  know that this military institution recently began to admit  women. Representatives of the fairer sex account for 12 percent  of all cadets at the academy; beautiful, but not weak. I myself  saw young women do 50 and more push-ups. U.S. servicemen have  an almost fanatical attitude toward sports. One could think  they want to restore the traditions of ancient Sparta. West  Point cadets are the elite of the U.S. Armed Forces. I am very  pleased that the U.S. defense secretary and I reached an  agreement on sending a group of our boys to study there.    Finishing on the topic of military educational, I must admit  that serious blunders were made while reforming our system of  military education. Incidentally, this issue was brought up in  parliament by deputies of different orientations. I believe  that the Defense Ministry conducted too passive a policy in this  sphere, and did very little to turn our academies into forges  turning out officers for CIS and other countries.    U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has recently paid a  return visit to Kiev. The Americans were pleased with its  results, and expressed their hope that contacts between our two  ministries will continue to expand and strengthen.</p>

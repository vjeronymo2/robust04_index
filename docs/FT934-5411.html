			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Building quality The Financial Times Architecture Award, which reached its final stage yesterday, shows that the best building in the UK today remains of a remarkably high standard. A large entry probably reflects the culmination of the UK development boom of the 1980s - many of the entries were commissioned at that time and completed later. But to be able to field a set of recent buildings as distinguished as Stansted Airport, the Cranfield Library, Schlumberger Research, the IBM/MEPC joint venture at Bedfont Lakes near Heathrow, as well as the winning Queen's Stand at Epsom, is a real achievement. With almost one third of the architectural profession in the UK unemployed and the top practices having much of their work abroad, the question is whether these standards can be maintained. Recession in the construction industry is the main worry. But business could do more to encourage good work, as could the government - especially when it comes to the few new buildings it commissions directly. As Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of the FT jury, said at yesterday's presentation, quality buildings require good clients as well as good architects. But Britain lacks the 'culture of good design' that is understood at the highest level in other European countries. Buildings that have been let or sold well in the City in recent years have tended to be those that were well designed. Better buildings do mean better business, while employees rightly have rising expectations about their working environment. A glance at the empty and decaying Paternoster Square by Saint Paul's Cathedral shows the real cost of poor architectural and planning standards. Cost paring by fee bargaining and 'design and build', where the architect plays a minor role in the design and construction team, does not provide the best long-term value for money. Award schemes are one way of raising clients' sights. But the main answer lies in visual and architectural education that should continue, with informed and sustained advice, into the cabinet room and the board rooms of Britain.</p>

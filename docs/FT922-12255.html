			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (10): From cloth to an airborne market - Baxter, Woodhouse and Taylor BAXTER, Woodhouse and Taylor has come a long way since 1836, when it started out as a cloth manufacturer in Manchester. This year the firm has won a Queen's award for exporting super-lightweight air ducting and insulation for the aircraft industry. 'As the marketplace changes, we have had to change with it,' says Mr George Sampson, sales and marketing director at Baxter, Woodhouse and Taylor. 'Thirty years ago we got into the aircraft business. Because of our expertise in manufacturing commodities in cloth, our product for the aircraft industry is basically a fabric, glass fibre,' he says. The company's main business is now producing a large range of lightweight ducts for aircraft environmental control systems, which are engineered rather than fabricated. The ducts can also be used in other vehicles. The company's products can be found in 85 per cent of the western world's aircraft, and 60 to 70 per cent of its business is carried out overseas, largely in America, where the world's airline industry is centred. Customers include such famous names as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Mr Sampson attributes the company's success to quality and reliability. 'It is a high-tech, big money but very fickle industry. If you make a promise, but you break that promise, you are dead,' he says. 'We are almost obsessive in terms of getting out there and finding out what the customer wants, and acting immediately,' says Mr Sampson. Although the company is on the opposite side of the Atlantic to many of its customers, it makes use of modern high-speed communications and transport to fill orders overnight if necessary. In the aircraft industry, relationships are important, and can sometimes mean winning orders over lower-priced competitors. 'We have an intimate relationship with all our customers. They know they can rely on us,' says Mr Sampson. The company brochure boasts that no task is too trivial, which also helps win customer goodwill, he says. The company can respond fast to a small order when an aircraft is being refitted. 'Environmental control systems are always left to the very end, and half the time something is forgotten. Most of our products are almost hand-made, and therefore flexible of labour. We don't have to tool up, so we can turn round very quickly.' The company's air ducts are up to 60 per cent lighter than comparable products, giving them an advantage since extra weight means smaller profits because fewer passengers can be carried. 'The product is not particularly high-tech, but it services a high-tech area,' says Mr Sampson. In spite of the recession, which has been particularly severe in the aircraft industry, Baxter's sales rose 20 per cent last year. This is partly because sales are not entirely dependent on the air frame manufacturers of new aircraft. The company also supplies parts for the refurbishment of second-hand aircraft, a sector which has expanded as spending on new aircraft has dropped. 'People are spending money on used aircraft, refurbishing them to a high standard,' says Mr Sampson. The company is based at Adlington, near Macclesfield in Cheshire, and employs 300 people, mostly women, at three sites. It is considering setting up a factory in the southern states of America, near its main customers. Direct flights between Manchester and Atlanta airport have made the prospect more feasible.</p>

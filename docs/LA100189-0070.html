			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REALTY FIRMS FIND CLIMATE TOUGHER  </P> <P> A new Laventhol &amp; Horwath survey of the U.S. real estate industry reveals  that 85.8% of U.S. real estate firms believe it is more difficult to do  business today than it was two years ago, and 53.1% think the situation will  get even worse.  </P> <P> Real estate firms were asked to identify factors that represent limitations or  constraints on their future growth and profitability.  </P> <P> Heading the list of concerns were overbuilt markets (75.6%), state and  government regulations (63.8%), environmental controls (60.1%), community  opposition to construction development (53.4%) and impact fees (45.1%). Federal  government regulations, including tax reform, were judged to be a relatively  minor issue.  </P></p>

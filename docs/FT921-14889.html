			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Not so miraculous: Christopher Parkes asks whether industry is moving out of Germany In a land where people are reputed to have the best, longest and most expensive education in Europe, it is not unreasonable to expect them to be able to tell the time. But the Germans are having problems. There are those who say it's five to midnight in midwinter, and unless someone does something soon, the country's economy will turn into a pumpkin. Then there are those who claim it's midday in midsummer . . . and it looks as though it will turn out fine again tomorrow. Over-dosing on education, it seems, can be a dangerous thing. So too, according to the doomsayers, can excessive health care, too much unspoilt countryside, early retirement, too many holidays and too much pay for too little work. This is a theme that has been taken up lately almost with one voice by German industrialists. They argue, at length, loudly and persistently, that Standort Deutschland - Europe's prime industrial base  - has lost its charm and risks losing its key role in manufacturing. Not only do foreign investors shun the place, but now German industry is moving away to escape the unwelcome consequences of the economic miracle. The figures prove it, they claim. In 1990 German companies invested DM30bn (Pounds 10.50bn) overseas, while foreigners invested only DM3bn in Germany. Outsiders readily cite a host of disincentives to investing in Germany. A report last year from the Japanese External Trade Organisation (Jetro) blamed high taxation, high pay, low flexibility in the workforce and over-generous social security as the main reasons against investment. It echoed precisely the complaints turned up in a poll a year earlier among members of the US Chamber of Commerce in Germany. Industrial labour costs of DM39 an hour are the highest in the European Community. About 10 per cent of gross national product - almost DM5,000 a head - is spent yearly on health care, thus raising industry's ancillary labour costs. Environmental laws obliged the country's chemical industry to spend DM8bn last year - 60 per cent more than any of their competitors - on cleaning up their act. Total public expenditure on education, rising 8 per cent annually, is about DM100bn a year. A German works 500 hours a year less than a Japanese, and he takes all his generous holiday allowances. As Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the other day, the federal republic is becoming the holiday republic. Working times, moving steadily down to 35 hours a week across industry, are another bone of contention. Working lives are abbreviated by late starts after university. A typical graduate takes his first job at 29, and at present, retires at around 62. Mr Peter Stihl, president of the national chamber of trade and industry (DIHT) encapsulates widespread concerns: 'I have little faith in a country where it is considered revolutionary for shops to be allowed to stay open after 6.30.' Pay is an over-riding worry, and topical in the light of the current strife in wages negotiations. 'If we want to stay competitive with our products,' said Mr Marcus Bierich, chairman of auto component maker Robert Bosch, 'we must work in low-pay countries where wages are upto 90 per cent lower than in Germany.' Recent moves by top German companies, it is said, underline the problem: Mr Edzard Reuter, head of Daimler Benz, declared recently there were some products the company could no longer afford to make in Germany. 'Making a diesel engine in our works at Unterturkheim costs half as much again as the same engine made in South Korea,' Mr Reuter said, stressing industry's complaints about high wages and ancillary social security and other costs, which amount to 46 per cent of the total labour bill. The Mercedes-Benz car subsidiary is reported to be considering building its first full-scale overseas car production works in Mexico. Bosch has shunted its manufacture of car loudspeakers to Mexico and Malaysia, shedding 1,500 German jobs. Siemens is exporting car wiring systems manufacture to Czechoslovakia and Turkey - along with an unspecified number of jobs. BASF is moving fertiliser production from the Rhine to Antwerp, and last year spent only half of its DM5bn investment budget at home. According to Mr Wolfgang Jentzsch, a senior member of the BASF board, for Ludwigshafen, one of the group's long-standing manufacturing bases, 'it is already five past midnight'. The ticking-clock argument has been going on and off in Germany since the early 1980s, when Eurosclerosis was a fashionable economic disease. Since then German industrial arteries have pumped through almost a decade of continuous expansion, creating more than 3m new jobs in the process. But in the last few months, the question of Germany's competitiveness as a manufacturing centre has been raised with renewed insistence. Indeed, it has taken on the air of a concerted public relations campaign, dressed up with apt one-off quotes from industry leaders, to attract public attention. Cynics say that this has more to do with events such as the unexpected burdening of Germany with 16m more people from the east, the wreckage of the DDR's economy and the resulting economic surge and slowdown in the west than with a sudden worsening of industry's cost base. Mr Johann Eekhoff, state secretary in the economic ministry, the first notable to use the word 'recession' in a speech late last year, takes the strain coolly, and industry's appeals with a pinch of salt. 'Whenever Standort Deutschland comes up, you must always listen for the undertones,' he says. He remembers the last alarm bells, when Japan was about to sweep in and trample all over European industry. There is always, he suggests, a hint of protectionism. For Mr Eekhoff, the key to Germany's enduring attraction as an investment base is demonstrated in the country's ability to generate new jobs. 'We created 800,000 last year. That cannot be a bad sign,' he says. There is, he points out, no real sign that domestic investment has run into the sand. After a 10 per cent surge in 1990 and a real 6 per cent increase in capital expenditure last year, spending on new plant and equipment at home even in these straitened times is expected to increase by a real 3 to 4 per cent in 1992. As the latest report from the Bundesbank said, 'readiness to invest in the German economy continues unbroken'. Recent forecasts also indicate that a further 250,000 new jobs will be created this year. Increased overseas investment by German companies, says Mr Eekhoff, is a natural result of German wealth. The opening of opportunities in Czechoslovakia and Poland provides a chance for Germany to show itself as a 'good neighbour'. Coastal sites near developed ports make more natural bases for chemicals works than inland riverbanks. Aluminium factories would be better off in energy-rich Ukraine or Russia, Mr Eekhoff says. The current round of 10 per cent pay claims, an echo of last year's wages boom when industry was prepared to pay any price to keep production going to feed demand in the east, may be hitting the headlines at the moment. But it is no more important than the other issues being raised by industry, many of which were being addressed and dealt with long before the current debate began. Basic changes in health provisions, introduced in 1989, drove down government spending on health by 9.5 per cent in their first year. Wide ranging corporate tax reforms, although the first stage is stuck in the federal legislature's fraught approvals process, are on their way through. The national pensions programme has recently been adjusted to keep people at work for longer. No one suggests that the process of adaptation to so many changed economic, political and geographic circumstances can be hurried. But Chancellor Kohl sent a clear message for the medium and long-term future last weekend and perhaps set the pattern for the future development of the Standort Deutschland debate. 'We must rethink our priorities,' he said. 'We must examine what is absolutely essential now, what can be put off, and what we can do without.' Industry is already ahead of him. Given German car makers' losses of market share in the US, a Mercedes works next door in Mexico would seem to be an essential step to help Mr Reuter compete more effectively with the Japanese. And an expanding economy based on high-tech, high added-value engineering industries can, like the Japanese, probably do without relatively low-tech, low added-value businesses like fertilisers and loudspeakers.</p>

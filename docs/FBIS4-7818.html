			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Edvard Popovic: "Mercep's Knin Brigade"] </F>   [Text] In its second convention, held in Zagreb on 26  February of this year, the Association of Croatian Volunteers of  the Homeland War (UHDDR) ceased to exist in the form it has had  since its founding on 19 February 1993. It was conceived as an  association outside and above political parties, and, as its  founder and first president Zvonimir Trusic spelled it out in  his introductory address, "as a nongovernmental organization  that would bring together those who went to war and took their  status into their own hands without waiting for a call from the  government. Rejecting the role of the government "from the other  side of the mirror" and the role of the extended hand of any  party or group within any party ("the volunteers did not intend  and will not establish any parallel government...for us the  CROATIAN STATE is sacred...we have not and will not take into  our hands anything for which there exists authorized government  bodies and agencies...we do not allow and will not allow  ourselves to be taken over by anyone, to be included in any of  the current political conflicts"). In his introductory address  to the Association Trusic defined it as a kind of (moral)  proofreader: "Because of the many bad things happening around us  now, the Croatian Volunteers are resolutely joining the fight  against war profiteering, we condemn criminal acts of robbery of  government property, we demand confiscation of property gained  through war profiteering and theft."  <H5>  Threats and Outbursts </H5>   In order to achieve the stated goals and to define other  goals that will cover the broadest interests of the membership,  the Association had to be reorganized and bylaws adopted and a  new president and members of working bodies elected, which was  the job to be done in the second convention. The initial  constructive and ceremonial enthusiasm of the convention,  however, turned into a verbal gunfight that caused a majority of  the delegates to leave the Vatroslav Lisinski Auditorium even  before the vote. An unpleasant impression was left both by the  uncontrolled outbursts from the speaker's stand and in the  corridors (there were threats against those gathering  signatures, Trusic said), and also by the "tussling for the  microphone and denial of the right to speak to certain  distinguished members and guests (that right was denied Mile  "Hawk" Dedakovic, Branko "Younghawke" Borkovic, Brother  Vjekoslav Lasic, and a hundred others who had something to say).  A new president was elected (Tomislav Mercep), vice-presidents  (Juraj Njavro, Dario Kordic, Stjepan Spajic, and Pajo Simic),  and members of the central committee (Branko Miloloza, Marijan  Sola, Djuro Brodarac, Dusko Cikan and Kresimir Cop). The by-laws  were not adopted, concern for the general interests of the  volunteers remained in the background on this occasion, and,  judging by the departure of a goodly portion of the those  present before the convention was over, the first big convention  of the UHDDR might well have been the last.  <H5>  "Occupation" of the Association </H5>   One gets the impression, and this was pointed out by  Zvonimir  Trusic, that it broke down over the attempt of one current  within the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] to turn the  Association into an instrument and use it as a powerful lever  for promotion of its own political objectives. The whistling,  the hooting, the dissatisfaction and departure from the hall  during the speech of Vuco Vukojevic and certain others showed  that some of the volunteers refuse to allow the interests of the  Association to be subordinated to the interests of this or that  political grouping. Although it was said in the HDZ corridors at  the convention that that group of malcontents were actually  politically aligned with the HOS [Croatian Defense Force] and  the Rightists, when mutual accusations like this are made, the  truth is always somewhere in the middle. But things are not so  unambiguous, and this stormy convention shows that the conflict  within the HDZ, postponed at the last convention of the HDZ,  broke out in the convention of the UHDDR, that is, that the  faction which withdrew for tactical reasons in the HDZ  convention (as it itself put it at the time) attempted to  'occupy' the Association of Volunteers as a springboard for  future political showdowns. SLAVONSKI OBZOR of Vinkovci confirms  that these are not mere empty speculations by recalling  withdrawal of the nomination of Branimir Glavas, Vladimir Seks  and Tomislav Mercep at the HDZ convention referred to. Recalling  as well the words of Tomislav Mercep, who explained his own  withdrawal and the withdrawal of most of the right wing of the  party in terms of a "desire to once again take a step out of  good will, but it will not last beyond 1 April 1994." that was  the deadline given the president of the state and HDZ, it is  said, to "do what he has promised the party and the people."  <H5>  Respected and Armed </H5>   Has that current, then, chosen this association of Croatian  volunteers for its (possible) backup base? If so, why? there are  several reasons for this choice. The attitude of most of the  Croatian public toward the UHDDR is full of respect, emotional,  often altogether uncritical, which is precisely why the  Association was a prefect shield for promoting political  interests of any option or party provided they could swallow it  up. The job of the current of the HDZ, it is assumed, would be  easier because Mercep, one of its fair-haired boys, enjoys a  passable reputation and has the support of a large number of  members of the UHDDR. What is more, the UHDDR, which has about  6000 registered members, in spite of certain organizational  deficiencies, is a compact entity bound by solid ties of  solidarity in wartime and alleged political extremism. And  something else, a sizeable portion of the members of the UHDDR  who remained outside the Croatian armed units, whether the army  of the police, are armed and represent an experienced military  force that must command respect.    Something of the kind was first stated in public by Tomislav  Mercep when he was a guest on the program of Croatian Radio-TV  "Latin Writing." He mentioned the Knin Brigade, which numbers  6,500 armed fighting men, but he did not go into the details.  Toward the end of last year, we were told by Gen Martin Spegelj,  at the convention of Croatian Veterans of the Homeland War  (HVDR) in Kutina a representative of the Kutina chapter of the  UHDDR welcomed establishment of the sister organization, but  declined the possibility of collective membership of the UHDDR  in the HVDR, justifying this in terms of the fact that a brigade  was just then being formed to be commanded by Mercep, and all of  this supposedly with the consent and knowledge of a high  official of the defense ministry, who will arm the brigade and  fully equip it.  <H5>  Reason Prevailed </H5>   Be that as it may, the emotional outbursts (Mercep, Sosic),  politicized to the extreme on certain occasions (Vukojevic),  were more suitable to political gatherings in which the  electorate is mobilized than to meetings whose job is to resolve  very serious problems like the problems of the Croatian  Volunteers. There is evidence that reason nevertheless prevailed  in the end in the speeches of volunteers who declined the  possibility of politicizing the association (a good example of  this is the speech by a volunteer from Ogulin) and pointed to  current problems, beginning with the "endemic" problems of the  volunteers all the way to the general problems like war  profiteering or the attempt to establish a parallel army and  government.    The convention of volunteers fell apart at the end. The  calculation that the volunteers would serve as a stick that  could be used in the postponed showdown within the HDZ proved  rather hollow. The volunteers let those who counted on their  "political emotions" and their "extremism" know quite clearly  that their emotions are reserved for the Croatian state and  Croatian interests, and their "extremism" is directed  exclusively against the occupier and cannot be used for internal  showdowns between Croats.    In an interview with SLOBODNA DALMACIJA Tomislav Mercep, the  new president of the UHDDR, took a sporting view of the thing:  he said that the convention was right and proper and it is the  right those who lost to be angry. Zvonimir Trusic, former  president, thinks quite differently and is announcing  establishment of a new association. The best comment on the  meeting came from those who left the hall before the end of an  event which was supposed to be their convention, but turned into  a political game and verbal exhibition by those who are too  often inclined to privatize the interests of Croatia as a whole.</p>

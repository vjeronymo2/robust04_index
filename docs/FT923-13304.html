			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Technology: A mover and a shaker WERNER BAUER is light years away from most people's idea of an academic scientist. A fast-talking 40-year-old who starts each day with a swim in Lake Geneva, he bristles with get-up-and-go energy. He is also a firm believer in decisive management and accountability. 'From the beginning, I wanted strong managers in the lab who could influence decisions and make things happen,' he says. 'I don't believe in co-ordination. I believe in power. I'm a Bavarian.' Yet, he has also exhibited a keen sensitivity and concern for the human touch. Before taking up his job, he took extensive soundings among the lab's researchers, interviewing 200 in two months. To find out whether they were 'analysts', 'lateral thinkers' or 'implementers', he asked them questions such as whether they owned a motorbike and how they serviced it. 'You can tell a lot about people's skills from their answers,' he says. Then he moved into action. About 30 older staff were persuaded to take early retirement, and the lab's sprawling operations were grouped into seven departments. In choosing department heads, Bauer looked as much for administrative and personnel management skills as for scientific ability. Each is expected to act as a 'pusher', setting goals for members of his team and monitoring their performance closely. A hierarchy of priorities has been set for research, by dividing it into four categories: basic science and technology; development of techno- logical tools; projects sponsored by the SBUs; and short-term tasks closely related to the market. Bauer and Suter lay much stress on good communications and human relationships. To build team spirit, Bauer has installed relaxation areas in the labs, where researchers can meet and talk, and organises cultural events such as musical evenings and art displays. Though some old-timers have found it hard to adjust, Bauer insists most of his staff have responded positively. 'Almost 100 per cent of them are now really working for Nestle,' he says. Bauer's next task is to integrate research with Nestle's network of international development centres. The ultimate goal is to speed innovation by synchronising R&amp;D more closely. But changing such a complex set of relationships in a company Nestle's size will be a gradual process, he says: 'We have to build up trust. That will take some years.'</p>

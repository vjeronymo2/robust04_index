			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance brokers suffer The insurance broking sector came under substantial pressure and provided the market's heaviest traded stock in Willis Corroon as well as one of the day's keenest sell stories in Sedgwick. It was Willis Corroon, the UK market's second biggest insurance broker, that caught the eye late in the session when a block of 8.6m shares, roughly 2 per cent of the company's issued capital was sold into the market and subsequently placed around the 130p level. Willis shares closed a net 5 lower at 137p. The stake sale and other trades took turnover in the stock up to 22m, the highest single day's activity for almost four years. Insurance broking specialists said the shares had been among the market's worst performers since the company caused acute disappointment in the market by announcing poor first quarter results. Since those figures Willis shares have dropped from 239p to yesterday's closing level. Willis' interim figures are expected next month. Sedgwick, the biggest insurance broker in the UK, also came under pressure, the shares sliding 7 to 164p as Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker, reduced its profits and dividend estimates for the group. The broker focused on a host of minus points affecting the group, notably concerns about soft US market renewals for July, difficulties in the wholesale and commercial lines business in London, worries about expense controls and employee benefit business and the slide in the dollar, although CLL said Sedgwick had hedged most of its dollar exposure for the current year. CLL cut its end-1995 profits estimate from Pounds 111m to Pounds 100m, and reduced its dividend estimate from 7p to 6.8p.</p>

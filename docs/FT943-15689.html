			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Railtrack closer to deal with union The signalling workers' dispute that has disrupted Britain's rail network over the past four weeks is much closer to a settlement than either Railtrack or the RMT transport union are prepared to admit in public. Railtrack believes the glare of publicity has diverted attention from the attractive details of its three-part productivity package which it presented to union negotiators at the conciliation service Acas on June 27. The package would give the signal staff on average an extra Pounds 335 in their pay packets between now and the end of September. This would take the form of a 6 per cent unconsolidated rise in basic rates from July 1 and an immediate Pounds 200 lump sum for every signal worker in return for agreeing to be paid by credit transfer. In addition, all staff would get a 2.5 per cent annual pay rise, payable at once. Railtrack has calculated that the first two parts of its self-financing efficiency package are worth more than the extra Pounds 240 signal staff would have received by October 1 if the company had agreed to a 5.7 per cent interim pay rise. Such an offer, designed to restore signalling staff differentials, was discussed with the RMT in early June before the one-day strikes began. The company hopes that by the end of September a full restructuring deal can be negotiated with the union that will provide most signalling staff with rises in their basic rates of 13 to 26 per cent. Railtrack is spelling out clearly on its telephone hotline what the total package would be worth to each signalman. So far the staff have lost around Pounds 260 each in pay for going on strike. Both the company and the union accept the need for a restructuring deal and agree on the need for a joint working party to hammer out final details by October 1 to enable signal staff to benefit from improved pension arrangements. After that date the pension fund will be split up and the improvements will not be possible. Railtrack believes it has now shaped a highly attractive package for staff and that there is enough common ground to resolve the conflict. Relief signalling staff have told Railtrack, however, that they need more detail on the way they are to be compensated for the cut in earnings they will suffer as a result of the proposed package. The company is keen to stress that the details of the self-financing deal are open to negotiation but not the principles behind it. Yesterday, Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, asked Railtrack to provide what he called 'vital information' on the package. He wants detailed figures on the effect of the savings Railtrack would achieve over the next 15 years and specific earnings and weekly hours required by each grade. Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, said yesterday after hour-long talks with Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, that he hoped there could be a settlement of the signalling staff dispute 'before too long'. Although he added that his meeting at the transport department was 'routine', Mr Horton said there had been, 'among other items', a discussion of the conflict that has closed down most of the railway network for the past four Wednesdays. Yesterday it was revealed in a written Commons answer that part-time board members receive a Pounds 500 payment for each board meeting they attend in addition to their annual Pounds 10,000 salary.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Portable DCC out this summer Electronics makers Philips and Matsushita, co-developers of the Digital Compact Cassette, yesterday announced the development of a portable version of the next-generation audio system, writes Emiko Terazono. The companies will start marketing the walkman version of the DCC this summer, starting in Japan at the price of Y60,000 (Pounds 320). With the launch of the portable DCC, consumers may finally see the expected marketing battle with Sony's digital audio system, the Mini Disc, launched last year. While the main difference between the two systems is that DCC is a tape format and Mini Disc is a disc format, Matsushita argues that its portable system is smaller, lighter and its batteries last 1.6 times longer than the Mini Disc.</p>

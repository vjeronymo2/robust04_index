			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Partners reap the fruits of reconciliation - The uneasy marriage that created Europe's largest packaging group The brief history of CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging company, has always been presented in terms of matrimonial analogies. So it was three years ago when, after a brief flirtation, a marriage was announced between the packaging interests of Metal Box of the UK and Carnaud of France creating the biggest packaging company in Europe. The doting parents claimed it was the fashion to get hitched in the rapidly-unifying European market place and held out great promise for the merger. But, sadly, it was not long before the two partners indulged in a series of tiffs culminating in last November's departure of Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the chief executive, amid much national acrimony. Mr Jurgen Hintz, a neutral German-American reared in the Procter &amp; Gamble marketing school, was called upon to become chief executive. And less than a year into his job, the disarmingly open Mr Hintz appears to be making sense of the alliance having encouraged the two sides to make up. The early fruits of the reconciliation became apparent last week when CarnaudMetalbox, initially known as CMB Packaging, posted a reassuring 9 per cent increase in interim net earnings to FFr549m (Dollars 115m) with operating margins widening from 9.1 per cent to 9.8 per cent. Mr Hintz argues that, barring unforeseen economic difficulties, the company will continue its progress this year and finally begin to fulfil its early dreams. Mr Philippe Lubineau, analyst at stockbrokers BZW Puget Mahe in Paris, believes he may be right and has upgraded his profits forecast to FFr1bn for the full year representing a 17 per cent improvement. 'CarnaudMetalbox has been one of the very few companies providing good news recently. But you have to pay for it in the price,' he says, observing that the company stands on a multiple of 14 times next year's forecast earnings - a 30 per cent premium to the French market. In spite of the progress that has been made, Mr Hintz argues that further financial benefits can still be squeezed from the integration process. 'Frankly the company did not work very well when we merged. But the logic of the merger was absolutely right. Business is globalising faster in reality than perception,' he says. Although the media emphasised the national frictions between the two partners, Mr Hintz argues that greater problems stemmed from organisational differences. 'On the one hand there was MB which was over-centralised in the classic British fashion. On the other, was the wild-eyed naively decentralised Carnaud. The difference in corporate culture was bigger than that between Frenchmen and Englishmen,' he says. 'This issue has never been fully settled. But there is now a sense in the organisation that there has to be a better way of doing things than when we were like the old Carnaud or the old MB,' he adds. Greater financial benefits should stem from the further rationalisation of operational systems, he argues, as the disparate Carnaud operations are brought under central control. 'We have 33 banks in France and have to go through books of figures on a Friday night with a well-chewed pencil,' Mr Hintz says exasperatedly. Quick to demonstrate his impartiality, he also points out deficiencies in MB's former operations which spent 90 per cent of their research and development budget on plastics while 90 per cent of their business was still in metals. CarnaudMetalbox highlights three strategic imperatives: to strengthen its European steel business through reaping further economies of scale; to bolster its position in the beverage cans and plastics markets; and to grow its health and beauty business, making products such as lipsticks, compacts and mascara cases - by acquisition, if necessary. The company believes it has great scope for geographical expansion. Although western Europe accounts for 85 per cent of sales, CarnaudMetalbox believes it can increase sales in Turkey, Asia, and particularly eastern Europe. However, the main worry niggling investors is the long-term uncertainty concerning its shareholding arrangements with MB-Caradon, the company's original parents, and the French investment group CGIP, still retaining their 25.5 per cent stakes. Analysts suggest it would come as little surprise if CGIP were to increase its holding while MB-Caradon reduced its exposure confirming the increasingly Frenchwards tilt in the company's outlook. Any such move is likely to wait until the grim economic outlook desists. In the meantime, Mr Hintz will just keep on trying to improve the company's operational performance. 'I think the packaging industry is in a state of metamorphosis. In management and technological terms this industry feels to me like the 1970s. It is going to become a lot more sophisticated. We just have to hunker down and do the professional thing,' he says.</p>

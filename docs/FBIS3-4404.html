Present at today's  rally were leading comrades of the provincial party committee,  people's congress, government, and committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, including He  Zhukang, Gao Yan, Liu Yunzhao, Zhang Dejiang, Wang Jinshan,  Zhang Yueqi, Zhou Zaikang, Wang Yunkun, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian,  Quan Zhezhu, Wei Minxue, Sang Fengwen, and Liu Xilin; principal  responsible persons of city and autonomous prefectural party and  government leading bodies; all the members of the leading bodies  of the various departments of provincial organs; principal  responsible persons of the central units and departments  stationed in Jilin; and some section-level cadres of provincial  organs.    Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, presided over the rally. Gao Yan, deputy secretary  of the provincial party committee and governor of Jilin, first  appraised the performance of official duties by party and  government leading bodies and leading cadres under the  administration of the province. On behalf of the provincial  party committee and government, he also read a decision on  commending leading bodies and leading cadres who achieved  outstanding performance of official duties in 1993. He said:  To comprehensively implement the party's cadre line, improve  leading bodies at all levels, and encourage a vast number of  cadres to raise spirits, work in a down-to-earth manner, and  make contributions to building a developed border province near  the sea, the organization department of the provincial party  committee began overall, thorough, and meticulous appraisals of  the 1993 work in late November 1993. Including work of the  party and government leading bodies of the eight cities and one  autonomous prefecture in the province, the leading bodies of the  88 provincial departments and bureaus and the offices stationed  outside the province, and 469 leading cadres, appraisals were  conducted in line with the opinions of the official duty  performance of the leading bodies and members of the cities, the  autonomous prefecture, and departments of provincial organs,  which were discussed and approved by the standing committee of  the provincial party committee last year. Judging from the  appraisals, the overwhelming majority of the party and  government leading bodies for cities, autonomous prefectures of  the province, and departments of provincial organs were able to  emancipate the mind, vigorously make progress, seek truth from  facts, and work in a creative manner in line with the  requirements put forward at the 14th party congress and the  sixth provincial party congress; and fulfilled their annual work  tasks and targets fairly successfully, thus making positive  contributions to Jilin's development of the economy and other  various undertakings. The provincial party committee and  government decided to commend and award party and government  leading bodies and leading cadres who distinguished themselves  in the performance of their official duties in building the  province's two civilizations.    First, the 17 leading bodies with outstanding performance of  official duties, including the Changchun city party committee  and government, were commended through a circular order, and  each member of the leading bodies was awarded with 1,000 yuan.    Second, (Ma Junqing) and 44 other leading cadres with  outstanding performance of official duties were commended  through a circular notice, and each was awarded with a one-grade  wage increase.    Third, the leading bodies of the 10 central departments and  units stationed in Jilin, including the provincial power  industrial bureau, were commended through a circular order, and  each member of the leading bodies was awarded 1,000 yuan. (Yu  Fu) and 10 other leading cadres were commended through a  circular notice.    Through a circular notice, the rally also commended 25 of  the  59 units and 45 of the 298 leading cadres whose performance of  official duty was fairly prominent in 1993.    After the awards were given, He Zhukang, secretary of the  provincial party committee, gave a speech. On behalf of the  provincial party committee and government, he first extended  warm congratulations on the commended leading bodies and  comrades and also expressed heartfelt thanks to all the cadres  in the province who made contributions to Jilin's reform,  opening up, and modernization drive in the past year.    He Zhukang said: To meet the needs in the modernization  drive and in establishing the socialist market economy system,  the provincial party committee has endeavored to improve leading  bodies and the contingent of cadres in a very important place by  actively probing into the reform of the cadre system over the  past few years. It reformed the system of selecting and  promoting cadres and adopted the method of [words indistinct] to  openly select and appoint leading cadres. After this, it  reformed the system of appraising cadres. Last year, it began  to appraise the performance of official duties by leading bodies  and leading cadres under the administration of the province.  This work has yielded fairly good results although it is just  in its initial stages. Practice has proven that the system of  appraisals of leading bodies and leading cadres conforms to the  direction of the reform of the cadre system. It will play an  important role not only in improving leading bodies and the  contingent of cadres but also in upgrading the overall quality  of cadres and promoting Jilin's work provincewide. We should  continue to adhere to and extensively apply this system.    He Zhukang pointed out: Judging from the inherent impetus of  the system of appraisal of official duty performance, this  system is applicable not only to leading cadres at all levels  but also to ordinary cadres. Therefore, party committees at all  levels should gradually improve the appraisals of the cadres  under their respective administration. Organization and  personnel departments should conscientiously summarize  experiences and strive to improve this system in the process of  practice so that it will comply with the system to appraise  state public servants and lay a good foundation for establishing  a scientific cadre appraisal system.    In his speech, He Zhukang, expounded upon the specific  common  characteristics of the leading bodies and leading cadres  commended for outstanding performance of official duties based  on the results of the appraisals. He pointed out: These  prominent characteristics can be summarized as the spirit of  reform and opening up, the spirit of pioneering the way forward,  the spirit of seeking truth from facts, the spirit of honesty  and self-restraint, and the spirit of selfless devotion. These  five kinds of spirit exemplify the spirit of wholehearted  service to the people, which is the basic reason behind the  outstanding performance of these leading bodies and leading  cadres. We should greatly advocate such a spirit of commending  these leading bodies and comrades in our future work, on all  fronts of the province and make Jilin's modernization drive more  successful. The provincial party committee and government urge  all party and government leading bodies and leading cadres in  the province to earnestly learn from the advanced units and  individuals commended at this rally, further lift spirits to  work hard, promote unity, rally forces, and, in line with the  requirements of the central authorities, make sure that  opportunities are seized to deepen reform, open wider to the  outside world, promote development, maintain stability,  comprehensively fulfill the various tasks for promoting the  economy to a new height as put forward by the provincial party  committee and government, and promote in a down-to- earth manner  the grand cause of building a developed border province near the  sea.</p>

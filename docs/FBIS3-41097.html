What was until recently the symbol of prosperity and good  fortune, coca is today associated with poverty and desperation.  Abandoned towns, empty shops, unfinished buildings, houses for  sale, and impoverished farmers are now the new image in the  Huallaga region. In the old coca towns, which have become  virtual ghost towns, trade is scarce and the economy is shaky.  The entire region is facing a serious crisis because of a  shortage of the dollars that came from narcotrafficking and the  resultant drop in trafficking in the Huallaga area.    A Juanjui peasant told EXPRESO: "We used to make money from  coca, now we lose. Months go by without selling any coca and  when we do we sell it at below its market value."    Last year, cocaine paste sold for $1,500 per kilogram, today  it is worth $200.    The drastic drop in prices follows the strict military  control of the Huallaga region, which has forced traffickers to  transfer their main operation centers to the northern and  southern regions of the country. It seems to herald the end of  the coca boom in the region.    Alto Bravo Mayor Tenazoa Ushinahui said: "Selling coca is  not  a lucrative trade anymore. The strict control has caused prices  to plummet."    The decrease in narcotrafficking activities in this, the  largest coca-producing region in the world, has brought changes  to Huallaga.    Settlers and officials of the region are not the only ones  to  express concern over the critical situation affecting the  region. Even a local beauty queen expressed her opinion during a  recent beauty pageant in a San Martin district. In an outburst  of sincerity when the jury asked her about trafficking "Miss  Chazuta" bitterly complained about "low drug prices." She  subsequently did not win the contest.    Despite its limitations, the military control established in  the region since the middle of 1993 is the main reason why  prices have dropped and trafficking activity has decreased.    Huallaga settlers believe the Peruvian Air Force [FAP] is  mainly responsible for the change in trafficking activities.  This has been achieved even though the FAP's antinarcotics  struggle faces serious difficulties: It has almost inoperative  radar and less sophisticated planes than those used by the  traffickers. The proficiency of the FAP's Tucano [T-27] planes  to intercept traffickers' planes in the region is acknowledged  but not always welcomed. One Tarapoto settler complained:  "Because of the Tucano planes, there are no more `trafficking  flights' like before." The reputation of the T-27's in the  region is such that a local orchestra named themselves "The  Night Toucans."    Police operations and the downing of several planes have  forced traffickers to transfer their operation centers to other  regions where there is no control, and to change their flight  routes and schedules to avoid repressive actions. These actions  have forced Colombian pilots to increase their fees; they now  charge $100,000 per flight, before they charged only $20,000.    Military and police activities have been unable, however, to  stop an increase in trafficking activities in other regions.    The number of trafficking interdiction operations by the  police rose in 1993 by over 20 percent compared to 1992. The  figure rose from 3,180 to 3,938 in just one year.    Although slightly above that of 1992, the volume of drugs  seized in 1993, over 8.5 tonnes, is notably less than the years  when there was no military control.    The coca farming areas and the production of cocaine base  have increased throughout the Upper and Lower Huallaga region,  and the Udcayali, Ene, Apurimac, and Pichis Palcazu areas.    The Center of Development and Research of the Upper Jungle  [Centro de Desarrollo e Investigacion de la Selva Alta]  (Cedisa), has stated that coca is farmed in the 200 sub-basins  of the rivers of San Martin. Biavo, Ponaza, Mishiquiyacu,  Huayabamba, Saposoa, Sisa, Mayo, Sauce, Aibsea and Cumbaza are  among the most important.    In the Upper Cumbaza region, just 600 km from Tarapoto,  Cedisa experts have detected at least 600 hectares of coca  plantations. Thus, trafficking has not been eradicated from the  entire Huallaga region. Even when there is a shortage of  flights and dollars, traffickers continue to operate in coca  producing area villages.    The price of white coca paste surged from $220 to $330 per  kilogram last September just because two flights were made to  the region. This caused such excitement among Huallaga  residents that, in their eagerness to sell the devalued white  powder, residents of Shamboyacu--an eight-block hamlet in the  Ponzaza valley of the San Martin forest--grabbed the drug they  had stored and went to sell it in the middle of the street. The  "coke balls"--of processed cocaine--were sold to the highest  bidder.    Each flight seems to reawaken the villages of the region  from  the inactivity imposed by the shortage of dollars. Tarapoto,  the capital of San Martin region, is by no means an exception.  Following a flight, customers crowd discotheques, like  "Papillon" and "Tropicana," where "middlemen" (drug stockists),  policemen, and many pretentious local ladies mingle.    Despite the sharp decline in trafficking in the Huallaga  region, it is too early to shout victory. The appearance of  poppy fields in the region and peasants' avowed willingness to  replace coca with poppies makes one to agree with Juanji Deputy  Prefect Eduardo Maldonado, who contends that "drugs will remain  the most profitable business of the region for a long time."</p>

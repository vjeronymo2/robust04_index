			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Ladin and Oleg Falichev: "Russian </F> `Nuclear Umbrella' Under the Kazakh Sun?"]    [Text] The talks between the delegations of the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan in Almaty ended on 25  December. A considerable part of those talks was devoted to  military problems.    On the basis of the results of the meeting the heads of  governments signed among other things the memorandum "On Mutual  Understanding on Questions of Ensuring the Functioning of the  Baykonur Space Center." Commenting on the documents presented  for signing, Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Council of  Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation, noted that they  now make it possible to carry out all work at the space center  normally and determine the procedure for the shipment across the  border of the goods necessary for work to be conducted at  Baykonur. The Russian military contingent is remaining here and  its daily life and activity will be governed by Russian laws.    Viktor Stepanovich also added that the heads of the Russian  and Kazakhstan governments have been instructed by those states'  presidents to prepare documents on military and  military-technical cooperation in January 1994.    What does the memorandum say? It is important that it speaks  not only about the space center but also about the test ranges  sited on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan and about  military cooperation. It is envisaged that Russia will use the  military installations under lease from the Republic of  Kazakhstan. In this regard the operation of the Baykonur space  center and the test ranges will be ensured by the Russian  Government or authorized organs of state administration. The  Russian military formations supporting these installations are  stationed on Kazakhstan's territory temporarily. Their status  will be determined by a separate agreement.    During the talks process the heads of the Russian and  Kazakhstan governments expressed mutual satisfaction at the fact  that the Republic of Kazakhstan has affiliated to the nuclear  weapons nonproliferation treaty as a state not possessing  nuclear weapons. The Russian side has expressed a readiness to  offer guarantees of safety to Kazakhstan as a nonnuclear weapon  state together with other depositories of the nuclear weapons  nonproliferation treaty and at the same time to give military  assistance if necessary to repulse external aggression and to  counter other encroachments on the security and territorial  integrity of the Republic of Kazakhstan.    The sides recognized the need to begin holding bilateral  talks on the implementation of the START I treaty and the  package of Lisbon accords as well as the need to agree a  timetable in the very near future for the withdrawal of all the  nuclear warheads in the Republic of Kazakhstan to Russian  territory.    At the talks the sides also examined questions of scrapping  the strategic offensive weapons stationed in Kazakhstan and to  reimburse the republic the equivalent value of the fissionable  materials and components of the nuclear weapons and so forth.    As we can see, they relate to the most acute and vital  problems affecting the life and service of Russian servicemen in  this republic. The fact that the ice has finally been broken  here is perhaps the most important outcome of these talks.  After all, people in uniform, for all their discipline and  composure, must have clear prospects and guarantees of social  and legal protection. Here, you would think, there is still  broad scope for the work of the politicians and lawyers: In  addition to Baykonur and the ranges there are other Russian  military units stationed in Kazakhstan. For example, it has  part of the missile early warning system. Status and the  conditions for continued presence abroad must be defined for  these units, too. Meanwhile, unfortunately, all they can do is  wait and hope.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Confidence returns to the gilts sector - Capital &amp; Credit The UK government bond, or gilt, market is in a confident mood. It swept aside last week's figures showing accelerating UK economic growth and rallied in the face of Tuesday's three-quarter point rise in US short-term interest rates. It may soon face more serious tests of its new-found confidence, however - a turn upwards in UK inflation and the next rise in UK base rates. It is no secret that this has been a difficult year for gilts. Fears that economic recovery in the US and Europe would be inflationary and lead to sharply higher interest rates around the world have sent bond prices tumbling, and gilts have suffered particularly badly. This was partly because the UK's economic recovery was further advanced than that of its fellow European countries and partly because of the UK authorities' poor track record in controlling inflation. The large size of the UK government budget deficit, and the enormous amount of new gilt issuance this implied, also weighed heavily on investors' minds. The price of 10-year gilts fell by more than 19 per cent from their highs in January and yields climbed by almost 3 percentage points to a peak of around 9 per cent in September. Since then, however, there have been encouraging signs of a recovery in gilts, at least in relation to other countries' bond markets. Yields have dropped back only slightly, to around 8.6 per cent. But the yield spread between US and UK 10-year government bonds, having widened to more than 150 basis points in the summer, has now narrowed to about 60 basis points. The reason for this is continued good news on inflation. In spite of economic growth of over 4 per cent, inflation - at 2 per cent - remains at a 27-year low. The financial markets, suspicious all year of the government's willingness and ability to keep a tight reign on price rises, are starting to believe, albeit grudgingly, that maybe it can and will. The fall in yields is reflecting this. 'Gilts have rallied in recent months as expectations about inflation have slowly improved,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at investment bank DKB International. 'Investors are now becoming more willing to commit money to the gilts market.' Mr Lyons believes there is now an asymmetrical relationship developing between the US and UK government bond markets. 'It will be difficult for gilts to put on further gains in isolation from other markets, particularly the US,' he said. 'If Treasuries rally then gilts will be pulled up with them, but if Treasuries fall then gilts will be supported by the UK's favourable domestic conditions.' Those domestic conditions - the strength of the UK recovery, inflation and interest rates - remain the key to how the gilt market performs over remaining weeks of 1994 and into next year. 'The question that has to be answered is whether this recovery is any different from previous ones, in which renewed growth has triggered inflation, higher interest rates and balance of payments problems,' said Mr Lyons. Although inflation remains subdued, there are signs that inflationary pressures are building up in the economy. Mr David Miles, senior UK economist at the US investment bank Merrill Lynch, calculates that spare capacity in the economy is dwindling rapidly. 'If the economy continues to expand at its current rate, it will start to overheat and be heading towards inflationary territory by the end of next year,' he said. He points to the rise in producer input prices as a sign of future inflation. Rising commodity prices have pushed up costs to many manufacturers, yet producers have not passed these rises on into output prices, thus squeezing their profits. 'Companies may try to to recoup that squeeze in profits by raising prices over the coming year,' said Mr Miles. Wage settlements, currently rising at about 3 3/4 per cent a year, may also start to accelerate as unemployment continues to fall, putting further upward pressure on costs and prices. All this points to a rise in UK interest rates. The consensus among City analysts seems to be that it will come early next year. However, when it does it may not be bad for gilts - certainly the last rate rise, in September, was generally enthusiastically received as a well-timed move to head off future inflation. In the meantime, the gilt market has something else to occupy its attention  -next week's Budget on November 29. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is expected to reaffirm the improving state of the nation's finances and cut his forecast for next year's public sector borrowing requirement. This would be yet another lift to the gilt market's confidence.</p>

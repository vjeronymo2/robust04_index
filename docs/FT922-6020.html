			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Little change for Andrews Sykes Increasing profitability from smaller subsidiaries enabled Andrews Sykes Group to improve in the second half and produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.2m for the year to March 31. That compared with Pounds 1.32m last time. Turnover fell to Pounds 56.8m (Pounds 62.6m) and operating profit to Pounds 3.44m (Pounds 4.29m) but interest charges were cut to Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 2.98m). Profit was struck after redundancy costs of Pounds 208,000, against last year's Pounds 941,000 for redundancies and reorganisation. Mr David Hubbard, chairman of this plant hire group, said cash flow continued to be strong and bank borrowings were reduced by Pounds 3.3m with gearing falling from 110 to 89 per cent. Further action was taken to reduce overheads and staff numbers had been cut by 14 per cent during the year. After a substantially heavier tax charge, earnings per share fell to 1.2p (3.2p). The final dividend is 3p for a maintained total of 4.4p.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The market in Australia is steady again this week, with only a very slightly dearer tendancy affecting wools of better style. Tender and drought-affected wools are meeting with erratic and restricted demand. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator at 580 cents is slightly higher than last week and than at the closing sales in December, before the Christmas recess. Offerings in Australia in the next few months are well down on a year ago, but with Soviet demand lacking and patchy erratic buying from China and Eastern Europe the market at present only seems able to hold its own.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTERY WINNINGS  </P> <P> How much have you won on the California Lotto this year?  </P> <P> My wife, Helen, is now ahead exactly $520, and that's only since the first week  of January. After years of trying, the most she ever won was a fiver (dollars,  that is) and that was last December.  </P> <P> So, instead of going to the local 7-Eleven, she started putting her  $10-twice-a-week "investments" into a glass jar.  </P> <P> That's how she got $520 ahead, last count.  </P> <P> Pretty soon, now, she's planning on taking that grubstake to Las Vegas where  she's bound to be better entertained and, possibly, even win a little.  </P> <P> JACK B.

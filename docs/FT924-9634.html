			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: NYSE calls for inquiry into SelectNet system THE New York Stock Exchange has called for an inquiry into the the all-electronic share trading system run by Nasdaq, a rival stock market operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers. In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities industry watchdog, the NYSE argues that elements of Nasdaq's SelectNet trading system circumvent the SEC's rules on information disclosure. SelectNet allows traders to negotiate prices and execute trades over a computer screen. This is more advanced than normal Nasdaq market trading, where share prices are listed on screens but most trades are initiated over the telephone. Currently, only Nasdaq stocks can be traded on SelectNet, but Nasdaq filed for SEC approval earlier this year to begin trading NYSE-listed stocks on the system. The NYSE's opposition to SelectNet is based on its claim that prices are not disseminated widely enough on the system to ensure that the standards of price discovery mandated by government regulations are met.</p>

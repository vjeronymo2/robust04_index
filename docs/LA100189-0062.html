			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME ISLANDS STILL AFFECTED BY HUGO  </P> <P> Dramatic headlines might lead you to believe that Hurricane Hugo wiped out the  entire Caribbean. Not so.  </P> <P> About 16% of the Caribbean resort islands were affected, but Hugo did little or  no damage to more than 40 other vacation islands when it roared northwest from  landfall at French Guadeloupe Sept. 18-19.  </P> <P> The best-known Caribbean islands, stretching south and east from Florida to the  coast of South America, cover a distance comparable to that of the west coast,  some 1,300 miles. Hugo hit the equivalent of Portland to Seattle, and left an  area the size of the California coast virtually unaffected.  </P> <P> Hugo's detailed itinerary included tiny Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, and St.  Croix (which lies 40 miles south of its sister U.S. Virgin islands, St. Thomas  and St. John), plus Vieques and Culebra and the eastern half of Puerto Rico.  From San Juan, Hugo headed northwest to Charleston, S.C.  </P> <P> Although the hurricane pruned and toppled trees and raged against buildings,  splintering those that showed any sign of weakness, Hugo's main effect on  neighboring islands was downed electrical power lines and trees, high seas and  torrential rains and flooding.  </P> <P> Sand and sea water gushed through many beachside hotel rooms, but was  tirelessly swept out again as the first step toward post-hurricane recovery.  Most hotels have hurricane insurance and will refurbish, repair and rebuild,  when necessary, for the winter season.  </P> <P> Before Hugo, the region was anticipating an unprecedented boom for the winter  months, traditionally the peak season. Some places may benefit from  reservations originally intended for Hugo's islands, but the hard-hit hotels of  Puerto Rico expect to recover -- to claim the business they had expected.  </P> <P> Guadeloupe's Novotel, in the Bas du Fort area, entertained guests throughout  the hurricane, and other properties around the towns of Gosier and Bas du Fort  are already recovering.  </P> <P> Sailors can expect challenges in finding charter yachts. Hundreds were yanked  from their moorings in the United States and British Virgin Islands, to be  slammed onshore in a kamikaze action that destroyed both buildings and yachts.  </P> <P> Antigua's English Harbour, on the other hand, coddled its yachts, as the harbor  did when 18th- and 19th-Century British fleets knew it as a safe haven and home  port. Most yachts anchored there and in nearby Falmouth Harbour survived.  </P> <P> Yachts in marinas in Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada and other  islands south of Dominica were well away from Hugo's route. Bookings intended  for now-ruined yachts will bloat the already plump market in the southern  islands.  </P> <P> Scuba divers should anticipate cloudy seas surrounding the islands in Hugo's  path. A roiling ocean changes the sea floor, damaging coral, displacing fish  and churning once-clear waters for weeks after the event. Check with dive  masters to be sure that seas surrounding your island are clear enough to offer  the sights you're hoping to find.  </P> <P> Among the islands affected by Hurricane Hugo (phone numbers listed are for the  country's tourism office in the United States):  </P> <P> Antigua and Barbuda, West Indies. Hugo's calling card was mostly winds and high  seas that swept sand into some beach-front places. When the rubble was cleared,  most places had been spared. For more information, call (212) 541-4117.  </P> <P> British Virgin Islands, West Indies. Many yachts were damaged by Hugo's winds  and rain, and hotels received a pummeling. However, most hotels on Tortola and  Virgin Gorda will be in good shape by winter. The Little Dix Bay was accepting  guests a few days after Hugo went north. Call (212) 696-0400.  </P> <P> Dominica, West Indies. Most of the banana crop of this agricultural island was  wiped out by Hugo, whose impact was felt in the northern sector. Call (212)  682-0435.  </P> <P> Guadeloupe, French West Indies. Two islands -- Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre --  were battered and bruised by Hugo's visit. Basse-Terre, the western island,  suffered least; Grand-Terre's southeast coastal town of Saint Francois was  crushed. Although many seaside shack bistros were destroyed, they will be  rebuilt as soon as food supplies warrant.  </P> <P> But Hotel Arawak and Hotel Salako, both in Gosier on the southern coast of  Grande-Terre, are open.  </P> <P> For the upcoming winter, Club Med's enclave at Sainte-Anne, where the south  coast bends north on Grande-Terre, expects to be in full swing, as do most  hotels at Gosier and Bas du Fort. Fall will be spent recovering, with help from  mainland France. Call (212) 757-1125.  </P> <P> Montserrat, British West Indies. Like a farmer shearing his sheep, Hugo denuded  this once-verdant, mountainous island. Not only were all crops ripped from  their sockets, but houses were splintered. Immediate British aid was soon  followed by help from other quarters, but it will be a long time before this  tiny island will be fully recovered. Montserratians have always been known for  genuine hospitality; they'll be ready for visitors when life's essentials are  in place. Call (212) 682-0435.  </P> <P> Nevis, West Indies. Although buzzed by Hugo's winds and rains, most hotels  escaped serious damage. Places like Montpelier and Golden Rock are 18th-Century  plantation buildings built for hurricane survival. Hermitage continues to offer  its family-style hospitality. The island is linked to sister St. Kitts by a  ferry from Charlestown to Basse-Terre, the capital on St. Kitts. Call (212)  535-1234.  </P> <P> Puerto Rico. Hugo turned most buildings on Vieques and Culebra to rubble and  cut a mean swath from the east end to San Juan, before heading north. Most  boats in the 600 slips at the recently opened marina at Puerto del Rey were  smashed.  </P> <P> Although top-floor penthouses felt the brunt of the wind, most San Juan hotels  fared reasonably well. The Art Deco Normandie was open throughout; the Caribe  Hilton had some damage that will be repaired for the winter season. The  Excelsior and other high-rise hotels that are not on the beach had guests  throughout.  </P> <P> The Beach House shoveled the unwanted sand out of its dining room and will soon  welcome guests to its Ocean Beach locale. The El Canario inns are also back in  business.  </P> <P> Other properties unaffected or affected only minimally include: Condado Beach,  La Concha, El Convento, Mayaguez Hilton, Ponce Holiday Inn, Days Inn Ponce, ESJ  Towers, Hyatt Dorado Beach, Hyatt Regency Cerromar Beach, Howard Johnson and  Palmas del Mar.  </P> <P> Although more seriously effected, the Empress and Dutch Inn will be open for  the season.  </P> <P> October travelers will not be able to reach El Yunque rainforest, but beaches  are intact and almost all hotels are expected to be restored to full service by  then.  </P> <P> It will take a while to rebuild and clean up the islands of Vieques and  Culebra. Call (212) 599-6262.  </P> <P> Saba, Netherlands Antilles. This tiny island, the tip of a volcano, was blasted  by Hugo. Many Saban cottages were turned to rubble. Some remain, and can be  rented this winter. Call toll-free (800) 344-4601 or (516) 261-7474.  </P> <P> St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands. The island was pummeled by Hugo. His  visit set off a storm of domestic violence, including widespread looting and  other crimes. It will take a lot of hard work to rebuild what had been a  thriving tourism economy, but Cruzan residents have done it before (following  the Fountain Valley killings in 1979) and are doing it now.  </P> <P> The Buccaneer and Carambola Beach Resort, two of the largest hotels on the  island, plan to reopen about Nov. 1. The Cormorant Beach Club will be closed  for repairs until Dec. 15. DIVI St. Crois was seriously damaged and will be  closed for at least six months. Schooner Bay in Christiansted remains open. The  Colony Cove will be closed for about two months for repair. Call (212)  582-4520.  </P> <P> Sint Eustatius (Statia), Netherlands Antilles. Sleeping quietly until Hugo  roared in its ear, Statia's small beachfront hotels took a beating. Be sure to  check ahead if you are planning to visit. Call (800) 334-4606 or (516)  261-7474.  </P> <P> St. John, United States Virgin Islands. On the fringe of the uproar, St. John's  beachfront properties suffered some damage from high tides, crashing seas and  wind. Rebuilding and refurbishing should be complete at luxurious Caneel Bay  and some parts of Virgin Grand. Call (212) 582-4520.  </P> <P> St. Kitts, West Indies. Although seas lurched drunkenly at beachfront  properties in the area known as Frigate Bay, the small hotels in the mid and  north sections of the island survived almost untouched. Call (212) 535-1234.  </P> <P> St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. The airport area of Charlotte Amalie  felt Hugo's full fury. However, the Island Beachcomber hotel, which is in that  area, expects to be rebuilt for the winter season. Villa Fairview, a guest  house on the hillside, welcomed visitors throughout. Call (212) 582-4520.  </P></p>

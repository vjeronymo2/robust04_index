			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Romanians count the cost of luxury - Common Markets / Giles MacDonogh tries to find something worth buying in Bucharest BUCHAREST is a city replete with the usual eastern European contrasts: the luxury hotel - well, by Romanian standards it counts as a luxury hotel - where a largely foreign clientele pays what it considers to be rock bottom prices for food and drink; and, across the way, the little street market where pitifully small quantities of food change hands for what locals consider to be intolerably inflated sums. The hotel is called the Buchuresti. The market is on the other side of the Calea Victoriei behind one of Bucharest's loveliest small Greek orthodox churches. It is called the Piata Amzei. A market will generally give you a good idea of the local diet; but you will get only a limited impression of what an inhabitant of Bucharest eats from the Piata Amzei, for it sells only fruit, vegetables, flowers and cheese. I was there in the spring when the only fruits to be seen were a few bruised apples and pears. The vegetables were more interesting. They were arranged in little lots on newspapers: posies of spring garlic which Romanians chew with their soup as if they were spring onions; and an early spring speciality, a reddish-blue leaf which is used to make a meatless Lenten soup called ciorba de loboda. Muddy parsnips were set beside little heaps of chicory. In a far corner of the market a salesman was doing brisk business selling excellent acacia and 'poliflori' honeys at 1000 lei and 800 lei a jar. When a lorry turned up loaded with fresh eggs the driver was virtually mobbed by old women in headscarves. Eggs were clearly a rarity. Not so cheese. This was sold from a covered building by dour men wearing white aprons and trilby hats. The best is a hard ewes' milk cheese called brinza. Some wheels are sold smoked. A soft, fetta-style ewes' milk cheese was also available as was a cows' milk curd called telemea. In some places you may buy a whey cheese called urda, but I could not find it here. As I walked back to the Calea Victoriei, a drink shop caught my eye. There was a whisky for sale called 'Big Boss' which purported to come from 'the Highlands'. Later I discovered that it came from the highlands of the Lebanon. Dodgy as it was, it cost 2,600 lei (about Pounds 2.50), which is a lot for a Romanian. Seventy per cent of this is taken by the government in tax. Whisky is chic, but the local spirit drunk in the country is tzuica, a plum schnapps similar to slivovitz. It can be coarse stuff. I personally preferred the version made from quinces in Transylvania which is tempered for a year in Mulberry wood casks and sold at a more modest price. Meat is the most important part of the Romanian diet. The gustare, or first course, of a typical meal is all meat. In spring you might get drob, a cake of lamb tripe which was translated for me as 'mixed organs'. It was liberally sprinkled with pepper and bound with an egg. Another Wallachian delicacy is babic: a mutton sausage made in horseshoe lengths and flattened under stones. It is hard on the teeth. Romania's national soup is ciorba de burta. This, I was told, was what used to sustain the Christian janissaries, elite troops, in the Ottoman army. It translates as 'sour stomach soup' and is made from tripe. It can be an alarming sight if you are unused to tripe. You blend the soup to your own liking by adding garlic sauce, vinegar or cream and eat it with green chillies and spring garlic. Another popular soup is a puree of stinging nettles. After the excitement of the first two courses, the main course might come as a disappointment: sarmate are similar to Greek dolmas, with vine leaves often replaced by cabbage leaves. The basic blend can change from region to region but basically it is meat and rice. Sarmate are eaten with mamaliga, polenta made into a cake the size of Christmas pudding and cut with a string. Little meat balls are also popular. These are also eaten with ferociously hot chillies. Sadly, to eat such authentic Romanian dishes you may need to be asked into someone's home or entertained on a farm. The face of Romania which is reserved for foreign tourists is rather different. In the restaurant Velvet, on the other side of the Hotel Buchuresti, you will have difficulty finding any Romanian dishes whatsoever: the food is all western. There is no cheese and no Romanian spirits. The vodka is neither Russian nor Polish, but comes from Finland; and for the privilege of feeling you might be just about anywhere, you will pay the equivalent of a Romanian citizen's monthly salary.</p>

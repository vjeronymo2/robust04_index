			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of communique issued by the Clandestine Indian </F> Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National  Liberation Army in the Chiapas State mountains of southeastern  Mexico on 20 April]    [Text] Communique by the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary  Committee-General Command (CCRI-GC) of the Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN], Mexico.    20 April 1994.    To the people of Mexico:    To all the peoples and governments of the world:    To the national and international media:    Brothers:    The CCRI-GC of the EZLN addresses you to point out the  following:    First -- The EZLN acknowledges the honest and serious  efforts by Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for Peace and  Reconciliation in Chiapas, and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz to  create favorable conditions that may lead to the continuation of  the dialogue, the objective of which is to ensure a just and  dignified peace. During the past days, the commissioner as well  as the mediator have sought to solve several obstacles that  block the peace process. The EZLN applauds the genuine  disposition of these two Mexicans.    Second -- The EZLN applauds the release of several  civilians,  unfairly charged with being members of our troops, and sees this  as a good sign leading to the continuation of the dialogue for a  just and dignified peace.    Third -- In return, the CCRI-GC of the EZLN hereby orders  the  partial deactivation of the red alert in effect throughout its  territory, and the return of part of its troops to their  respective communities and ejidos as of 23 April 1994.    Fourth -- If this favorable climate to a dialogue continues,  the EZLN will renew the consultation process with its grass  roots as soon as possible, at regular intervals and beginning  with those less vulnerable territories.    Fifth -- The EZLN reiterates its disposition to a true  political solution to those just demands that motivates its  struggle, and applauds the sincere efforts by the Mexican  civilian society as well as all personalities to search for  dignified solutions to crucial national problems through reason  and not through force.    Continuing with our popular demands for liberty, justice  democracy for all Mexicans. Liberty! Justice! Democracy!  Respectfully:    [Signed] Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee -- EZLN  General Command. General Headquarters.    [Issued] Southeastern Mexican mountains, Chiapas State,  Mexico, [no date as published] April 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Talabani: I Did Not Request Arms From </F> the Europeans"]    [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iraqi Kurdish Leader  Jalal Talabani told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that he did not  ask the officials in Paris and the other European countries he  recently visited to supply the Iraqi Kurds with arms.    He said that his talks with these officials covered a  request  for assistance in training local Kurdish police forces for  maintaining internal security and protecting employees of the  United Nations and the relief organizations operating in Iraqi  Kurdistan.    He added that French Defense Minister Leotard, British  Minister of State at the Foreign Office Douglas Hogg, and  Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana "expressed willingness to  study that request and inform us of their position later on, and  so did the German officials I met with previously."</p>

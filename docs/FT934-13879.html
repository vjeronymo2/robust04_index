			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Senior politicians warn about electing Bloc Quebecois candidates TWO of Canada's most senior politicians have warned of the dangers of electing Bloc Quebecois candidates in next Monday's election, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Mr Robert Bourassa (right), Quebec's premier, said that a vote for the BQ could be 'very risky. It can be counter-productive to favour the instability of Canadian institutions'. Federalists in Quebec have been hoping Mr Bourassa, arguably the most respected politician in the province, would intervene on their side in the election campaign. But opinions are divided on whether his remarks will have a significant impact. Mr Michael Wilson, the former finance minister who is not standing for re-election, wrote in a commentary in the Globe and Mail newspaper yesterday that 'without a strong, truly national voice in parliament, the debate (on Quebec's place in Canada) could become nasty and divisive for the country.' He said strong support for the BQ and the Reform party, based in western Canada, 'could generate significant risks for Canada'.</p>

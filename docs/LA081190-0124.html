			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POOL OFFICIAL HAS STROKE AFTER ONE MAN DROWNS  </P> <P> In a tragic chain of events Friday, an Irvine man died after losing  consciousness at the bottom of a community swimming pool and during the ensuing  commotion the manager of the pool collapsed from a near-fatal stroke.  </P> <P> About 50 people were swimming and playing in the Olympic-size pool when the man  disappeared under 9 feet of water. Many of the people were young children  participating in summertime swimming classes. It took a few minutes for the  stricken man to be rescued, police said, party because other pool-goers at  first thought he was swimming underwater.  </P> <P> The man, identified by police as Dinh Quan, 54, was pronounced dead on arrival  at College Hospital Costa Mesa after the 4:25 p.m. incident at the Village Park  Recreation Center pool in the 4500 block of Michelson Drive.  </P> <P> The pool manager, identified by police and relatives as Mary Hatt, 45, of  Irvine, was listed in critical condition at Healthcare Medical Center of  Tustin. Her husband, Daryle Hatt, who was at the pool at the time, said late  Friday that his wife had suffered a stroke and was not responding to treatment.  </P> <P> Hatt said that his wife was on-site manager of the pool, which is operated by  the Village Park Homeowners Assn. in the University Park section of Irvine. The  pool is open to members and guests of the 636-home association.  </P> <P> Relatives of Quan declined comment when reached at the College Hospital  emergency room.  </P> <P> An autopsy was to be conducted on Quan to determine the cause of death, Rodgers  said. According to witnesses at the scene, Quan had been at the bottom of the  pool for at least four minutes, police said, and was registering no pulse when  rescuers pulled him out.  </P> <P> "You could just see that he was full of water," said Alex Abshier, a swim  instructor who dove down to retrieve the stricken man. "He was all bloated and  blue."  </P> <P> According to Police Sgt. Ron Flathers, one swim student was practicing in the  deep end of the pool when he noticed a man lying face-down on the bottom in the  deep section.  </P> <P> At first, Flathers said, the student thought the man was holding his breath,  but then realized something was amiss. The student yelled for Abshier to help.  Abshier, who was teaching a child at the shallow end of the pool, said he swam  over immediately as a lifeguard sitting in a tower also ran to help.  </P> <P> "I saw him lying there so I carried him up to the top of the surface," said  Abshier, 20, an Irvine resident and UC Irvine student. "The lifeguard ran  around the deck and helped me pull him out of the water. I yelled for someone  to call 911. Then I began CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and  mouth-to-mouth. But he wasn't breathing at all. He had no pulse."  </P> <P> While the rescue efforts were under way, witnesses said Hatt was excitedly  telling everyone to get out of the pool. Suddenly, Flathers said, she began  experiencing severe breathing problems and sat down on a lounge chair near the  stricken Quan. Signy Peck, 19, a swim coach from Irvine who happened to be  nearby, said Hatt appeared to be crying and was perspiring heavily.  </P> <P> "She looked very upset," Peck said. "I asked, 'Are you OK, Mrs. Hatt?' She  turned away and kind of collapsed."  </P> <P> While trying to revive Quan, Abshier said he remembers hearing Peck yelling  that a woman needed CPR.  </P> <P> "It was really scary," Abshier said. "I was thinking, 'What is going on?' "  </P> <P> It took Irvine police and paramedics between three and five minutes to arrive  after being called, witnesses at the pool said. In the meantime, Peck and a  friend visiting from Boston, Sarah Selder, 19, tried to revive Hatt. They took  turns applying mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and checking her pulse.  </P></p>

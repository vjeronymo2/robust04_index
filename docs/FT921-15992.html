			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UN chief wary of big Yugoslav peace force THE United Nations is sending 50 military observers to Yugoslavia immediately to monitor the ceasefire, Mr Boutros Ghali, secretary-general, said yesterday. In a report to the Security Council, he said he would not recommend deploying a larger peace-keeping force in Croatia until he believed Yugoslav leaders had accepted the terms of a broader peace plan. The terms include withdrawal of the federal army from Croatia, disarming of Croat and Serb paramilitary units, and creation of three demilitarised areas into which peace forces would be sent. The ceasefire forged last Friday by the UN between the army and the Serbian and Croatian governments appeared to be holding yesterday. But, Serbs in Krajina, the self-proclaimed republic which forms an enclave in Croatia, are continuing to reject terms for sending a UN peace-keeping mission. Also, leaders in the region of Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srem in eastern Croatia said yesterday they wanted any UN force to be stationed not in their territory but deep in territory 'controlled by Croatian paramilitary forces'. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia yesterday vowed his republic would regain control of all its territory held by the federal army and Serb reservists. 'We will not cede one inch of territory,' he told reporters in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's special envoy to Yugoslavia who is now in New York, recommended that Mr Ghali seek Security Council agreement to send observers as soon as possible to assess the possibility of dispatching a 10,000-member force. 'This would have an enormous psychological impact,' a western diplomat in Belgrade said yesterday. 'It might finally stop the fighting. But then the real work - defining post-Yugoslavia's borders - will begin.' France said yesterday it was was ready to contribute up to 4,000 troops to an international peace-keeping force in Yugoslavia. Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister, said: 'Whether it is within the framework of the UN or within that of a European force, we are ready to send between 3,000 and 4,000 men. That would be about a quarter of the total force that has been mentioned.' Croat officials are concerned that the international community is making territorial concessions to Serbia in return for peace, and at Croatia's expense. Mr Zdravko Tomac, Croatia's deputy prime minister, warned: 'We are prepared to continue the war if anybody tries to take an inch of Croatian soil from us.' A third of Croatia is occupied by the army and Serb forces.</p>

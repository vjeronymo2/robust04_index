			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb June 2 TASS -- The UN and Russian envoys to  former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi and Vitaliy Churkin left  Zagreb for Geneva early on Thursday for a meeting on Bosnia,  TASS was told at the Zagreb headquarters of the UN peace-keepers.    The Geneva talks were in question until the last moment  because Akashi had no guarantees that Bosnian Serbs would stand  up to their promise and withdraw their remaining units from the  3-kilometre zone around Gorazde. The Muslim leadership refused  to participate in the talks if the Serbs do not withdraw.    On Thursday Akashi received a message from Bosnian Serb  leader Radovan Karadzic confirming that the troops would be  withdrawn.    Churkin told TASS that the degree of readiness for the talks  at which a complete end to hostilities in Bosnia is to be  discussed, is "very high". He added that "serious discussions"  would go [as received] about a number of details, but "chances  for success are very high".</p>

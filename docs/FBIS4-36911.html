			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 14 Jun (MENA)--A responsible source in north  Yemen has stressed that the Yemeni Government rejected the  proposals that the rebels made today to Lakhdar Brahimi, UN  envoy to Yemen.    In a statement broadcast here tonight, the source fully  denied news media reports that Yemen had accepted the proposals.  In spirit and essence, the source said, the proposals  constitute a flagrant violation of Security Council Resolution  No. 924, and they contradict the resolution in text and spirit,  as the source put it.    The source said Yemen had announced it had accepted  discussion on the possibility of activating a joint military  committee, which was formed by a decision from President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, in its full formation. The committee comprises  six Yemeni Armed Forces officers, five Jordanian officers, five  Omani officers, and the military attaches of France and the  United States in Yemen.    It should be noted that Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, head of  the proclaimed government in Aden, presented a proposal to  Lakhdar Brahimi earlier today calling for the establishment of a  team of observers drawn from a supervisory committee consisting  of 11 military officers representing the Arab League, south  Yemen, north Yemen, Oman, Jordan, and the military attaches of  the United States, Russia, France, China, Britain, and a UN  representative.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: KOP plans to raise FM3bn in overhaul KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, has announced plans to raise nearly FM3bn (Dollars 511m) to enable it to avoid for the moment having to call for direct state support. The money will be raised through a rights issue and a debt issue in the domestic and international markets. The issues are part of a broader overhaul which will include a bonus issue and a reduction in the nominal value of the bank's shares to FM10 from FM20. The exercise is designed to keep the bank's international capital adequacy ratio at 9 to 10 per cent in 1993 and 1994, when it will face further heavy losses. 'This is an opportunity for our shareholders to take a stand in favour of private share ownership,' said Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chairman and chief executive. 'Our aim is to do everything possible to avoid resorting to government support.' Halving the value of the group's shares will release FM1.86bn to meet future losses. However, the group's share capital will be restored to its original level through one-for-two bonus and rights issues, which will each amount to FM930m. The plan is to launch the rights issue at the end of March, without a government guarantee. Any rights not taken up will be offered to new shareholders. The bank says most shareholders have responded positively to the scheme. In the next stage, the group will seek to raise FM2bn in tier 2 capital through the domestic and international debt markets. Mr Teppo Taberman, executive vice-president, said the bank aimed to launch at least four issues in late 1993 and early 1994, with the international issues on the European and US markets being guaranteed by the government. The group said it expected its 1993 result to be 'distinctly better' than 1992's FM3.7bn loss. But the group does not expect to return to profit until 1995.</p>

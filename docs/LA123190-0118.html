			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 12 GUERRILLAS DIE IN ISRAELI RAID ON BASE;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: THE DEATH TOLL IN THE AIR ATTACK ON A PLO FACILITY IS THE HIGHEST OF  THE YEAR. IN JERUSALEM, AN ARAB WOMAN IS KILLED BY HER OWN BOMB.  </P> <P> Israeli planes bombed a PLO guerrilla base near Sidon early today, killing all  12 of the fighters manning it, police and the PLO said. It was the highest  death toll in 21 such attacks this year.  </P> <P> The police report said the jets destroyed a one-story base belonging to Yasser  Arafat's Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organization's largest faction.  </P> <P> The base was in a lemon grove 7 1/2 miles southeast of Sidon, a southern port  city that is the Palestinians' main stronghold in Lebanon.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command said its planes returned safely to  base after hitting "a launching pad for attacks on Israel."  </P> <P> The air raid came a day after Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets landed in  Israel's self-designated security zone and across the border in northern  Israel. The rockets caused no damage or injuries.  </P> <P> Police and the PLO confirmed in separate statements that all the guerrillas  were killed.  </P> <P> "There were no survivors. Those dug out alive died in ambulances before  reaching hospital," a police spokesman said.  </P> <P> Police said 28 people were killed and 82 wounded in the 20 previous Israel  raids into Lebanon this year.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem today, a bomb ripped through a toilet at an outdoor market in the  heart of the Jewish quarter, killing an Arab woman who apparently was handling  the explosives, police said.  </P> <P> They said the victim was a 24-year-old woman from the occupied West Bank.  </P> <P> "Apparently the person who was handling the charge was killed in this toilet  stall," said police Commissioner Yaacov Terner. She was alone in the toilet,  and there were no other casualties, he said.  </P> <P> The explosion occurred at about 11:30 a.m. at the Mahane Yehuda market. Terner  said the woman was "torn to pieces," but a witness said she was still alive  immediately after the blast.  </P> <P> Shopkeeper Meir Cohen said he ran into the toilet and found the woman lying  under a fallen door. "She was alive, the woman. I lifted her head. She moved  her head as if she wanted to speak, wanted help," he said.  </P> <P> Cohen said she had something in her hand that he feared might be another bomb,  so he ran to nearby police to summon help.  </P> <P> A PLO military communique issued in Tunis claimed the Israeli air strike was  part of a "massive military operation" Israel was planning in southern Lebanon.  </P> <P> It said Israel pushed troop reinforcements "estimated at two brigades" into its  self-designated security zone in southern Lebanon three days ago, but gave no  other details.  </P> <P> The reported buildup could not be independently confirmed.  </P> <P> Fatah, the largest and oldest of nine groups under the PLO, marks the 26th  anniversary of its foundation Tuesday.  </P> <P> In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the army today confined 1 million Arab's to  their homes ahead of the Fatah anniversary. Authorities closed schools in the  territories.  </P></p>

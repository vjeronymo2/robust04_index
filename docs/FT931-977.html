			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UN effort to halt Bosnia onslaught THE commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon, arrived in Belgrade yesterday to try to stop a Bosnian Serb onslaught in eastern Bosnia. Bosnian Serbs were reported to be poised last night to overrun the besieged Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa, which would force a refugee exodus and prove a serious reversal for the international peace plan granting the area to Moslems. Gen Morillon's visit to the Serbian capital reflected a belief that the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, would be able to exert pressure on ethnic Serb forces in neighbouring Bosnia. 'I have come to ask him to help me implement every demand. The most urgent being a permanent ceasefire and an air corridor around Srebrenica . . . If that cannot be achieved I will be obliged to report back to the security council,' the French general said. In an earlier meeting with Mr Milosevic, Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, the special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) tried to win access for relief organisations to Srebrenica, where up to 60,000 Moslems have been trapped for nearly eleven months by a Serb siege. Despite assurances from Mr Milosevic that he would lend his influence to get UN access, a UNHCR official said: 'We are not terribly optimistic. We have been given such assurances in the past which have not borne fruit.' A UN official yesterday warned that Srebrenica was in imminent danger of falling to Bosnian Serb forces. At the same time Sarajevo radio said Serb forces had launched an attack on Zepa, a smaller Moslem enclave, south-west of Srebrenica. Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy head of the UN operation in Bosnia, said the Serb seizure of Srebrenica would have serious political and humanitarian consequences. 'The Bosnian Serb army is moving forward steadily within the area, taking village after village. I am afraid that if there is not a ceasefire the whole of that pocket could fall within 15-20 days,' he said. Serb leaders on Wednesday had agreed to an evacuation of wounded Moslem soldiers and civilians from Srebrenica in exchange for Serbs from Tuzla, the Bosnian government stronghold. But the helicopter relief operation was suspended after Serb shelling killed at least three people and injured several, including two Canadian UN soldiers.</p>

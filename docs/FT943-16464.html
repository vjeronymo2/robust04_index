			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Cabinet plan to reform Whitehall pay bargaining: Top civil servants to be put on personal contracts A Cabinet Office white paper due out this month will propose ending centralised pay bargaining in Whitehall, giving individual departments control over civil servants' pay and conditions. In addition, about 2,000 top mandarins at grade five (assistant secretary level) and above will be put on to personal contracts, with pay linked more closely to their success in cutting civil service costs. There is also likely to be a reduced emphasis on annual targets for market-testing, the process by which civil servants compete against outside bidders for their work. The Treasury has become concerned over the cost of market-testing, while many contractors are reluctant to bid because most contracts are won by departments' own teams. There will be increasing encouragement for privatisation, with departments encouraged to get out of 'non-core' activities such as information technology and buildings maintenance. The Treasury wants to see much greater use of 'benchmarking', through which managers compare costs with the most efficient comparable organisations and restructure their own to achieve similar levels. The white paper has been drawn up amid great secrecy by Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, and approved by the prime minister and a group of senior cabinet colleagues. Those include Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. It foresees a decline in civil service numbers from 554,000 last year to below half a million over the next four years, the lowest level since the second world war. When the Conservatives came to power in 1979, there were 732,000. The main driver of change will be the freeze on running costs, which forces departments to operate on declining real budgets until 1997. Ministers believe permanent secretaries and agency chiefs will have to cut costs radically to stay within targets. To give them greater flexibility over pay, the biggest element in civil service costs, departments will take over all personnel functions, including pay bargaining. Ministers, however, have rejected fixed-term contracts for senior civil servants, because of fears that that would politicise Whitehall. Such contracts have been advocated by civil service critics such as Sir Peter Kemp, the former permanent secretary responsible for many of the government's public-service reforms. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said last night that the CBI would welcome the end of national pay bargaining in the civil service. 'It would be a natural consequence of the freeze on running costs,' he said. 'Without that sort of flexibility, the civil service will soon run up against skill shortages and local recruitment difficulties.' But Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the FDA top civil servants' union, said her members would judge the white paper on three criteria: 'Will it promote civil service effectiveness rather than the dogma of the marketplace? Will it sustain ministerial accountability and the political neutrality of the civil service? And will it make the machinery of government more open to public scrutiny?'</p>

The interim administration of Bop put him into what it called  protective custody at his residence in Motswedi as a temporary  measure, apparently in an effort to stabilize the situation, but  the measure was lifted this afternoon after Dr. Mangope  telephoned Inkatha Freedom Party leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi  and asked him to mediate with State President F.W. de Klerk on  his behalf. Dr. Mangope had telephoned the Office of the State  President earlier but was told that Mr. de Klerk was in a  meeting. In a telephone interview Dr. Mangope's son Eddie told  TV news what happened.    [Begin Eddie Mangope recording] Chief Buthelezi called him  out of the meeting and posed this simple question: Why do you  do this to President Mangope, and if it were you would you ...  [changes thought] How would you feel if you were not allowed to  be visited by your son, being under house arrest. [end recording]    Earlier today Dr. Lucas Mangope said his residence was being  guarded by South African Defense Force soldiers. He spoke to TV  news by telephone.    [Begin Mangope recording] I was surprised to be told by Dr.  van der Walt this morning, only when I inquired, that I had been  placed under house arrest -- well, he called it protective  custody -- those of my family who are with me -- namely, my  daughter and son, and my wife -- may not leave our premises and  that my family ... family members may not come in to see me,  including my own children.

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MANHATTAN BEACH ACTS TO CURB STREET NOISE  </P> <P> The Manhattan Beach City Council is moving to control noise by reducing the  hours during which construction may be done and restricting the use of leaf  blowers in residential areas. The council may also hire a consultant to revise  the city noise ordinance, which officials say contains standards that are  difficult to enforce.  </P> <P> At a public hearing this week residents complained of being awakened by leaf  blowers and of eating breakfast to the sound of hammers and saws.  </P> <P> The council called for an ordinance limiting construction to between 7 a.m. and  6 p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Saturdays, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays  and holidays. The use of leaf blowers in residential areas would be limited to  hours between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays.  </P> <P> A vote is expected Feb. 20.  </P></p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / SFO increases threshold for fraud investigations to Pounds 5m THE Serious Fraud Office will in future investigate only alleged frauds involving Pounds 5m or more, Mr George Staple, the SFO's new director, announced yesterday. It will also probably take on new cases only where it expects to use its unique Section 2 powers to compel interviewees to give evidence, he said. The SFO's decision to tighten its criteria for accepting new cases, including raising the threshold from Pounds 2m, was prompted by an unprecedented rise in the value of alleged frauds, Mr Staple said. It is expected to maintain its case load at about 60 cases a year. A former partner at City law firm Clifford Chance, Mr Staple last month took over at the SFO from Mrs Barbara Mills, the new director of public prosecutions. Speaking after publication of the SFO's annual report yesterday, Mr Staple said the value of alleged frauds rose from Pounds 1.6bn in 1990-91 to Pounds 5.3bn in 1991-92. The inquiries into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and Maxwell dealings were largely responsible for the increase. 'While the caseload of the SFO has remained at around 55 to 60, size and complexity has increased. This reflects the increasingly high value of cases taken on by the SFO and puts a much greater strain on its resources,' Mr Staple said. Last year, the SFO brought prosecutions against 58 defendants and achieved a conviction rate of 66 per cent - a marginal increase of 3 per cent over 1990-91. The most common type of fraud handled by the SFO was frauds on investors, followed by frauds on banks and creditors of companies. The use of Section 2 powers increased from 765 in 1990-91 to 793 in 1991-92. Mr Staple called for the improvements in existing procedures rather than root-and-branch reform. He backed the continuation of the jury system for fraud cases and the use of criminal, rather than civil, proceedings in cases of apparent dishonesty. Mr Staple proposed the introduction of new rules to compel a defence to state its case earlier during legal proceedings and suggested allowing all SFO cases to be transferred from magistrate's to crown courts without committal proceedings in order to bring cases to trial sooner.

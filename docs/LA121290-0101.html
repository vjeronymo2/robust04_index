			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BASKETBALL PREVIEW 1990-91;  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL TITLE WOULD ADD TO ESPERANZA'S SPORTS LEGACY  </P> <P> Esperanza High School has earned its share of athletic glory since the school  opened in 1973.  </P> <P> The football program has produced five teams that have qualified for Southern  Section championship games, including the 1990 Division III title winners.  </P> <P> The baseball program is perennially among the best in Orange County and was  ranked No. 1 in the nation in 1986 when it won the Division 4-A title.  </P> <P> Championship banners that chronicle Esperanza's athletic success fill the gym,  a subtle reminder to the players on the basketball team that success has eluded  them.  </P> <P> "I was looking up there the other day, and there's only one (1981) league  basketball championship banner hanging on those walls," Coach Mark Hill said.  "We're hoping to add a second one this year. The league (title) is still up for  grabs in my mind."  </P> <P> Esperanza and defending champion Los Alamitos are co-favorites to win the  league title. But Loara, with guard Tes Whitlock, and a vastly improved Katella  team should not be overlooked.  </P> <P> "Tes Whitlock is capable of carrying Loara to the league title," Los Alamitos  Coach Steve Brooks said. Brooks should know; Whitlock scored 54 points against  his team last season.  </P> <P> Katella has missed the playoffs the past three years after qualifying for 22 in  a row, but Katella Coach Tom Danley says this year's team compares with past  championship teams.  </P> <P> "I saw Esperanza twice in the Valencia tournament and they look good, but they  can be beaten," Danley said. "On a given night, anybody can beat anybody else  in this league."  </P> <P> CYPRESS  </P> <P> Coach: Kevin Loftus (third year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 10-16, 2-8 in league.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Five.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Two.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Adrian Gutierrez (F, 6-3, Sr.); Joe Groover (F, 6-2, Sr.); John  Lin (G, 5-10, Sr.); Courtney Smalley (F, 6-3, Sr.); Youssef Semaan (G, 5-10,  Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Lance Brooks (G, 5-10, Jr.); Vince Laguana (G, 5-7, Jr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Last year, guard Jared Rice carried Cypress, averaging 26.2 points per  game and making 55 three-point shots. This year, Smalley has been a one-man  show, averaging 24.8 points in five games, including a school-record 45 against  Huntington Beach. Cypress is starting two juniors -- Brooks and Laguana -- in  the backcourt, and so far they have been inconsistent. Esperanza used its  superior height to pound Cypress, 81-48, in the Valencia tournament. Smalley is  the tallest player on the team at 6-3.  </P> <P> KATELLA  </P> <P> Coach: Tom Danley (25th year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 6-18, 2-8 in league.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Six.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Two.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Roger Arias (F, 6-4, F); Kevin Carlson (F, 6-5, Sr.); Dave  Jensen (G, 6-2, Sr.); Eric Martinez (G, 6-1, Sr.). Top newcomers: Brian Carlson  (F, 6-5, Soph.); Vince Encarnacion (G, 5-10, Jr); Bernie Perkins (C, 6-5, Jr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Katella has fallen on hard times the past three seasons, with a 19-47  record since it won its last league title in 1986-87. "It hasn't been much fun  the past couple of years," Danley said. The talent pool went dry for three  years, but Danley is encouraged this season, particularly with the play of the  Carlson brothers. Kevin is a a two-year starter who high jumped seven feet as a  junior. He is averaging 23.5 points a game. "We have some size and the ability  to go seven or eight deep," Danley said.  </P> <P> EL DORADO  </P> <P> Coach: Wayne Carlson (third year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 15-11, 5-5 in league.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Five.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Two.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Mike Johnson (G, 6-2, Jr.); Brian Loyd (G, 6-2, Jr.); Bill  McAdam (F, 6-4, Sr.); Matt Raya (G, 5-9, Sr.); Brett Tomko (F, 6-4, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Brett D'Arc (C, 6-6, Jr.); Shawn Holcomb (G, 6-3, Jr); Mark  Selway (G, 5-11, Jr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Carlson is touting Brian Loyd as one of the top juniors in the county.  Loyd is averaging 15.3 points a game, but Brett Tomko is the team's leading  scorer with a 17-point average. The Golden Hawks are a young team with five  juniors among their top eight players, but Carlson says they will contend for  the title. "Loyd and Johnson are outstanding shooters," Carlson said. "We lack  height, and we'll be going through a learning process early in the season with  so many juniors on the team."  </P> <P> ESPERANZA  </P> <P> Coach: Mark Hill (third year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 16-11, 8-2 in league.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Five.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Four.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Brett Evans (G, 5-11, Sr.); Joe Foss (G, 6-4, Sr.); Matt Kordik  (F, 6-6, Jr.); Matt Thimgan (C, 6-5, Sr.). Top newcomers: Jeff Campau (G, 6-1,  Soph.); Randy Wilson (F, 6-5, Jr.); Fabien Ziegler (F, 6-4, Jr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Esperanza is the most experienced team in the league with three  three-year starters -- Evans, Thimgan and Foss. Foss averaged 13 points as a  sophomore, 21 as a junior and 26 in five games this year. Esperanza has  out-rebounded every team it has played this season; Thimgan leads the team in  rebounding with an 11.2 average. The Aztecs are the tallest team in the league  with six players at 6-4 or taller. In its only loss, Esperanza blew a  seven-point lead in the final 1:45. Esperanza will travel to Illinois to play  in the 10,000-seat Metro Center in the 27th Rockford tournament Dec. 26-29.  </P> <P> LOARA  </P> <P> Coach: Ed Prange (first year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 15-7, 4-6 in league.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Three.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Charlie Gipson (F, 6-1, Sr.); Tes Whitlock (G, 6-1, Sr.).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Ron Harris (G, 5-10, Jr.); Glen Maggio (G, 5-10, Jr.); Jason  Vaughn (C, 6-4, Sr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Whitlock was the second-leading scorer in the county last year with a  29.8 average and had a high game of 54 points against Los Alamitos, the  third-highest in county history. He has picked up where he left off, averaging  36 points in four games, including a 30-point outburst in one quarter against  Pacifica. No one questions Whitlock's ability, but the supporting cast will  determine the Saxons' season. Charlie Gipson will provide additional scoring  and Ron Harris is the point guard. Prange has dismissed Dan Wassink, a  returning starting forward, from the team for disciplinary reasons.  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> Coach: Steve Brooks (ninth year).  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 20-7, 9-1 in league.  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Six.  </P> <P> Returning starters: Two.  </P> <P> Top returnees: Keith Boldon (F, 6-3, Sr.); Jason Cunningham (F, 6-4, Jr.); John  Daugherty (G, 6-2, Jr.); Geoff Graham (F, 6-5, F); Bryan Hakala (G, 6-1, Sr);  Eric Schluntz (C, 6-5, Sr).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Steve Carbone (G, 6-2, Soph.); Brian Kadlac (C, 6-8, Jr.).  </P> <P> Outlook: Which Los Alamitos team will show up? The one that beat Mater Dei,  56-55, or the one that fell behind by 31 points in the second quarter and lost  to Tustin, 78-56? The key is the play of point guard Bryan Hakala, who  struggled to nine points against Tustin, scoring only two in the opening three  quarters. He came back to score 23 points in the upset of Mater Dei. Boldon  scored 44 points in a 103-100 victory over University but hasn't reached double  figures since. Cunningham is the team's top athlete and most consistent player,  averaging 17 points per game.  </P> <P> Thursday -- Freeway League.  </P></p>

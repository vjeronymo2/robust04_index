Shokin, Submikron Scientific  Research Institute; UDC 621.382]    [Abstract] Recovery of the amorphized silicon crystal  lattice at an annealing temperature below the melting point by  the solid phase epitaxial recrystallization mechanism (TFER) and  the attendant complex processes of impurity atom redistribution  and embedding, point defect and capture center generation, etc.,  are discussed, and an attempt is made to examine solid phase  epitaxial recrystallization in amorphized silicon layers with  ion-implanted Sm and Yb. These rare earth metal (RZE) impurities  were selected due to their low solubility in silicon and,  consequently, the low concentration of active atoms. KDB-12  &lt;100&gt;  Si slices were used as the source material, and [.sup]152[/]   Sm[.sup]+[/] and [.sup]174[/]  Yb[.sup]+[/] ions were implanted in a  Vezuviy-5 unit. The samples were annealed in an atmosphere of  nitrogen. The solid phase epitaxial recrystallization processes  were studied by the methods of Rutherford's backscattering (ROR)  using primary [.sup]4[/]He[.sup]+[/] ions with a 1,500 keV  energy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (VIMS) in an IMS-3F  unit; the backscattered ions were recorded by a solid state  semiconductor detector with a 17 keV energy resolution, and the  primary O[.sup]2[/][.sup]+[/] ion beam with an 8 keV  energy and 1-2 A current was scanned into a 0.5x0.5 mm  pattern. Rutherford backscattering spectra and Sm and Yb  concentration profiles in ion-implanted Si samples are plotted,  and the ion implantation and heat treatment conditions are  summarized. The study shows that after the heat treatment, the  impurity distribution is characterized by three types of peaks;  on the surface, slightly off-surface in the case of incomplete  recrystallization, and on the boundary between the amorphized  layer and crystal substrate. The effect of impurities on the  recrystallization rate, i.e., the solid phase epitaxial  recrystallization front velocity, is examined: given a 470C  annealing temperature, it is equal to 0.9+/-0.1 nm/min for Sm  and 1.7+/-0.1 nm/mm for Yb, which is grater than that of  Si[.sup]+[/]-implantation by three- and sixfold,  respectively. The characteristics of ion-implanted rare earth  elements in Si during heat treatment may be used in  semiconductor technology for producing heat- and  radiation-resistant semiconductors, getter areas, small  p-n-junctions, and other applications. The authors  are grateful to Yu.A. Klimov for constructive discussions.  Figures 4; tables 1; references 8: 6 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

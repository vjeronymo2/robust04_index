			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT WOULD WORSEN TRAFFIC IN FAIRFAX AREA;  </P> <P> NEW STUDY RELEASED ON FARMERS MARKET PROJECT  </P> <P> A massive new development at Farmers Market would worsen traffic congestion in  the Fairfax District despite measures proposed by the city's Department of  Transportation, a draft environmental impact report said Thursday.  </P> <P> In response to the latest report, A. F. Gilmore Co., the owner and developer,  said it is "committed to the exploration of all feasible traffic-mitigation  measures" in the area of its 31-acre site at the corner of 3rd Street and  Fairfax Avenue.  </P> <P> The company said it expects to spend $20 million toward that end: $1 million  for a computerized traffic signal system, new signals and right-turn lanes;  $2.5 million to encourage workers at the site to commute by car pools and  public transportation, and $17 million in traffic-mitigation fees required by  the city for long-term improvements.  </P> <P> For its part, the city has proposed widening Fairfax Avenue, installing traffic  signals at several intersections, and computerizing traffic control to mitigate  traffic.  </P> <P> But, the environmental impact report concluded, traffic generated by the  shopping mall, theaters, hotel, office tower and residential apartments  proposed for the site would result in "significant impacts" at six of 11 major  intersections even after the initial mitigation measures are in place.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Methane Deposits  </P> <P> The report cited other likely environmental impacts, including possible  disturbance of underground methane deposits, but it said they could all be  mitigated except for the substantial increase in traffic and a small increase  in smog.  </P> <P> Farmers Market is just across 3rd Street from the Ross Dress For Less shop,  where an underground pocket of methane exploded in 1985. The report said the  new buildings should include vents to prevent such dangerous buildups.  </P> <P> "The generated traffic is very, very substantial, no one's denying that," said  David Weintraub, a city planner who oversaw the environmental impact report.  </P> <P> "With all the things they're going to do, they can fix most of it, but there's  going to be trouble at those particular intersections," Weintraub said.  </P> <P> The draft report, to be rewritten after a 70-day period of public input, was  prepared at the expense of the A. F. Gilmore Co., which traces its ownership of  the land back to 1880.  </P> <P> Once part of the Mexican-era Rancho La Brea, the land was used over the years  for a dairy, an oil field, a bank, a gas station, a baseball park and a  drive-in theater.  </P> <P> The corner of Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street became an outlet for San Fernando  Valley produce farmers in 1934, and the market has since become a tourist  attraction.  </P> <P> The latest plans are the first to cover the entire property, one of the largest  undeveloped areas on the Westside.  </P> <P> A spokesman for City Councilman John Ferraro, whose district includes Farmers  Market, said it was too early for Ferraro to make a final decision on the  proposal, which calls for 2 million square feet of development.  </P> <P> "If it does not over-congest the area, he'll support it," the spokesman said.  </P> <P> According to the environmental impact report, more than half of the 11 nearby  intersections are already filled to what is supposed to be their maximum  capacity during the evening rush hour. Three of them carry even more cars than  they are designed for.  </P> <P> But 3,395 additional trips can be expected during a typical evening rush hour  if the Farmers Market project goes ahead as planned, the report said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Steps Fall Short  </P> <P> The steps proposed by the Transportation Department would improve the flow of  traffic at five intersections, but no improvements are possible at three other  corners, and mitigation measures would fall short at the remaining three, the  study found.  </P> <P> The city's recommendations include a new lane of traffic between 3rd Street and  Beverly Boulevard on Fairfax Avenue, which would allow the installation of a  right-turn lane at the Beverly Boulevard intersection.  </P> <P> New traffic signals would be installed at the intersections of Beverly  Boulevard and Stanley Avenue, and at the 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue  entrances to the project.  </P> <P> The developer would also help pay for a computerized traffic-control program  that the city hopes to introduce in much of the Westside.  </P> <P> Pat Gibson, a transportation planner hired by the Gilmore Co., said other  things could be done to improve the traffic flow, but they were excluded from  the environmental impact report.  </P> <P> For example, the $17 million the company expects to be required to pay to the  city's Traffic Mitigation Fund could go to buy property that would be used to  widen existing streets, he said.  </P> <P> "We'd have to buy right of way, and since that's not directly under the control  of the developer, the city won't let you put that in as a mitigation measure,"  he said.  </P> <P> The report quoted city traffic engineers as saying the likelihood of such land  buys was "extremely limited . . . or not feasible altogether."  </P> <P> The Farmers Market project has been in the works for at least five years, but  the release of the environmental impact report revealed more details about it  than had been available before.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tower Would Be Shifted  </P> <P> Plans call for the original food courts at the corner of 3rd Street and Fairfax  Avenue to remain, whereas newer buildings, including one that is topped by the  tower that is the symbol of Farmers Market, would be removed.  </P> <P> Hank Hilty, president of the Gilmore Co., said the tower would probably be  erected somewhere else on the property. "It's kind of our image," he told a  community group Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The Gilmore Adobe, built in 1852, would be converted into a restaurant.  </P> <P> Other plans include new shops along Fairfax, a retail complex of 1 million  square feet, with landscaped atriums, theaters and restaurants, a hotel with up  to 600 rooms, an office building of about 225,000 square feet and a 150-unit  residential complex adjoining Pan Pacific Park.  </P> <P> Hilty said the hotel and office towers would be placed away from the street to  minimize the impact of the project on the neighborhood. He also said the  development falls within the limits imposed by the slow-growth Proposition U  initiative, which was passed in 1986.  </P> <P> But public protests are expected during the 70 days that are available for  citizen input before the final report is drawn up.  </P> <P> Diana Plotkin, vice president of the Beverly-Wilshire Homeowners Assn., called  the development "just too large for the 30 acres it sits on."  </P> <P> She recalled that city officials were talking about a development of no more  than 1 million square feet at the site several years ago, when a Metro Rail  station was planned for Fairfax Avenue. At that time the adjacent CBS property  was also part of the proposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Ludicrous'  </P> <P> "So to ask for 2 million square feet on 30-some acres, without a rail system,  is ludicrous, for lack of a better word," she said. "The infrastructure just  couldn't handle the kind of traffic this project would bring in."  </P> <P> After the final report is submitted, the developer would need approval from  various city agencies before the project could begin.  </P> <P> Approval may be delayed because other projects have also been proposed for the  area, including a 650,000-square-foot retail development owned by the company  that controls the nearby Park Labrea apartment complex.  </P> <P> Hilty said that if all goes well he hopes to see construction begin in the  summer of 1990, with completion of the first phase in 1993 and the second phase  in 1994.  </P></p>

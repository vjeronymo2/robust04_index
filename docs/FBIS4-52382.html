			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "It Is Not Time To Hasten North-South Economic </F> Cooperation:]    [Text] Some people in business and academic circles  recently called for separating North-South economic cooperation  from the nuclear problem for the sake of promoting North-South  relations.    The assertion of the business quarter appears, at first  sight, to have propriety in logic. First, in the event that the  labor- intensive light industry of South Korea, whose  competitive power is falling behind with each passing day, is  moved to the North or subcontracts with the North Korean side,  production costs would be drastically reduced. In other words,  as North Korea has cheap, good-quality, well-trained labor power  in abundance, it would offer an excellent opportunity to  revitalize our light industry. In addition, since the price of  land in North Korea is not burdensome, one's investment of  capital in North Korea would undoubtedly be successful.    Besides, some businessmen in the South believe that when  they  expand their enterprises by properly managing their business in  North Korea, their influence and pressure would certainly help  the North Korean regime turn to the moderate line from the  hardline.    The theory put forward by the academic circle pertaining to  the separation of economic cooperation from the nuclear issue  appears to be emphasizing only the idealistic point of view. In  other words, since North Korea is suffering a serious food  shortage, we should seek improved relations with the North by  starting an agricultural exchange first, thus separating it from  complex political and security issues. This theory stresses  that we should also enable the Korea Agricultural Corporation  and other various farmers' organizations to come forward for  agricultural cooperation with the North.    Another pretext put forward by the academic circle for  promoting economic cooperation is the urgency in the long- and  short-range economic development plans of North Korea.  According to a recent report, research organizations and  advisory organs in the United States and Japan, not our country,  received requests from the North Korean Government for working  out long- and short-range plans for national land development  and economic development in North Korea.    If this report is true, unique, independent plans, which are  not linked with the South Korean economic structure and land  utilization situation, would be adopted. As a result, even  after our nation is reunified, economic division would persist,  thus hindering the nation from becoming one country in  actuality. This would cause the people's concern. Therefore,  the assertion stresses, economic exchange with North Korea  should be realized even before the nuclear problem is resolved.    All these allegations sound reasonable at first glance.  However, if we evaluate them in a cool-headed manner, we will  come to realize that these are indeed dangerous and immature.  There is no change, first of all, in the Kim Il-song  dictatorship whatsoever, and North Korea is overflowing with the  so-called chuche idea, stressing that "Korea is one and it is  under the benevolence of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il." Even if  our business firms and organizations propose economic  cooperation, it would not be accepted so easily as we expect.  This would be possible only through the benevolence of Kim  Il-song and his son. Thus, our proposal would be reduced to  merely a "begging."    The North Korean regime is attempting to use the  humanitarian  standpoint heightened in our side as a weak point. The North  Korean regime, in an emergency, would apply various restrictions  to our business firms that advanced to North Korea, and would  threaten with such disadvantageous restrictions in a bid to use  them as a negotiation card.    What is important is, above all, for our government, while  maintaining a cooperative system with world nations, to urge the  North Korean regime to make a change in its policies. However,  North Korea will not make such change voluntarily. The change  would be possible only when North Korea hangs out a white flag  toward the whole world or when internal confusion occurs within  its system.    Therefore, the act of hastening economic cooperation with  North Korea will only reduce the probability of its change, and  will not be helpful in achieving reunification.</p>

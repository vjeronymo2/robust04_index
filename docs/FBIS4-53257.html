			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [MINJU CHOSON 22 April editorial: "Let Us Brilliantly </F> Fulfill the Tasks of the Adjustment Period in Socialist Economic  Construction"]    [Text] The seventh session of the Ninth DPRK Supreme  People's Assembly [SPA] discussed the issue of successfully  implementing the task for the adjustment period in socialist  economic construction set forth by the Workers' Party of Korea  [WPK] and adopted a relevant decision. This is a clear  manifestation of the firm and invariable determination and will  of the Government of the Republic and all the people to  brilliantly realize the plans and intent of our party, which has  established the upcoming three years as a period of adjustment  in the historic turning point of entering a new high stage of  socialist construction and set forth a revolutionary economic  strategy.    As unanimously stressed again at the current SPA session,  the  task for the adjustment period in socialist economic  construction set forth by our party is a most correct and  revolutionary economic strategy that has proceeded from the  prevailing situation, the changed international circumstances,  the demands of our developing revolution, and our present  economic situation. Reflected in the strategy are our party's  lofty will and revolutionary intent to rapidly improve the  standard of the people's living and to develop our economy into  a chuche-oriented economy that is not shaken by any economic  blockade of the imperialists.    Our party's establishment of the adjustment period in  socialist economic construction and its decision of the  rewarding tasks to be fulfilled in this period is another proud  demonstration of the extraordinary leadership ability of our  party, which has set forth the wise and expedient tactics by  familiarizing itself with the demands of the developing  revolution, the rapidly changing situation, and realistic  possibilities with brilliant wisdom and scientific insight and  which is constantly leading the revolution and construction  along a single road of victory by turning adversity into  prosperity and misfortune into fortune with matchless courage  and iron-like will.    Successfully fulfilling the task of the adjustment period is  of important significance in constantly advancing socialist  construction, in firmly defending the popular mass-centered  socialism of our own style, and in further enhancing its  superiority and invincible vitality.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: "The  revolutionary economic strategy established by our party is to  thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy, the light  industry-first policy, and the trade-first policy in the  adjustment period; to firmly give priority to coal industry,  power industry, and railway transportation, which are the  leading sectors of the national economy; and to continuously  develop the metal industry."    The task for the adjustment period in socialist economic  construction set forth by our party is to thoroughly implement  the agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy,  and the trade-first policy; to firmly give priority to the coal  industry, power industry, and railway transportation, which are  the leading sectors of the national economy; and to continue  developing the metal industry. The basic goal of this  revolutionary economic strategy is to completely solve the  problem of the people's living by concentrating all possible  efforts on developing agriculture, light industry, and trade for  two to three years to come; to normalize production in all  sectors by giving priority to the leading sectors of the  national economy; and, thus, to fully enhance the might of the  existing economic foundation.    The economic task in the adjustment period is a brilliant  milestone and an honorable revolutionary and rewarding struggle  task, which promises a new advance in our people's struggle for  socialist economic construction.    When the party's revolutionary economic strategy is  materialized a new turn will be effected in agriculture, light  industry, and foreign trade and, thus, our people's  long-cherished desire to live in tile-roofed houses, eat rice  and meat soup, and wear silk clothes, will be brilliantly  realized in the near future, and the people's material and  cultural life will be more affluent and prosperous in conformity  with the inherent nature of socialist society. At the same time,  along with the development in agriculture, light industry, and  foreign trade, the leading sectors of the national economy will  be firmly advanced, and metal industry will also vigorously  develop. As a result of this, other economic sectors will also  be further strengthened, and our self-reliant economy and its  might will be extraordinarily strengthened.    In this way, our people will be able not only to live  independently without being shaken by any economic blockade by  the imperialists, relying on the firmly deepened self-reliant  economic foundation and the chuche-oriented economic power, but  also to brilliantly solve their food, clothing, and housing  problems according to their ideal and desire and to further  enhance the superiority and might of the popular mass-centered  socialism of our own style.    The economic task for the adjustment period presented by  the party firmly guarantees a great new upsurge in our country's  socialist economic construction, as well as guarantees our  people a worthwhile future.    As the brilliant milestone of the adjustment period was  presented, our people came to have a powerful guarantee for  actively coping with the prevailing situation and for firmly  occupying a new attack position to reach higher uplands of  socialism.    Our party's presentation of the task for the adjustment  period in socialist economic construction is vigorously arousing  all the people to launch into a new struggle and register heroic  feats. It also serves as a great encouragement that gives hope  and faith to the progressive people of the world who is  advancing toward socialism while dealing a hard blow to  imperialists and reactionaries who disparage and attack  socialism.    All the working people should brilliantly implement the task  for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction,  with great faith and dignity in struggling with revolutionary  economic strategies under the wise leadership of the great  leader and the great party.    The WPK report on successfully implementing the task for the  adjustment period in socialist economic construction, which was  deliberated at the recent SPA meeting, and relevant decisions  adopted at the meeting are generally reflecting the goals for  each unit to achieve in implementing the task for the adjustment  period, the direction to push ahead with the goals, and specific  measures and means to achieve them.    The decisions on general measures to successfully implement  the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic  construction, which SPA made after due consideration, are  obligations that our functionaries and all working people should  regard as a law, a supreme order, and should completely  implement. The decisions are also the SPA's task to implement  through the sublime struggle to realize its aspiration and  desire to achieve the growth, prosperity, and development of the  country and to improve the people's welfare.    All functionaries and working people should have fresh  resolution and determination to become vanguards of the rank  carrying out the worthwhile struggle to implement the economic  tasks for the adjustment period and to become creators of  miracles and feats.    What is the most important here in struggling for this aim  is  to thoroughly understand the party's strategic intent behind the  presentation of the task for the adjustment period in socialist  economic construction and to have firm ideological resolution  and determination to unconditionally implement the task.    Our party's strategic intent behind its presentation of the  task for the adjustment period in socialist economic  construction is to remarkably elevate the people's living  standard in a few years, to firmly strengthen the country's  economy into a chuche-oriented economy that enables us to live  on our own strength, and to occupy a new attack position to  reach higher uplands of socialism. Only when we deeply  understand the party's revolutionary intent, consider it a firm  faith of ours, and fill ourselves with extraordinary resolution  and stern fighting spirit to implement it without fail, can we  successfully implement the immense and worthwhile task for the  adjustment period in socialist economic construction that we are  faced with under the grave situation today.    With fervent loyalty to the party and the leader, all  functionaries and working people should make active efforts to  deeply understand the party's idea and intent and make it their  flesh and blood, as well as their firm faith. In particular,  they should sincerely study and learn the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song's teaching and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il's remarks regarding the party's new revolutionary  economic strategy, the great leader's New Year's Address, the  decisions made at the 21st plenary session of the Sixth WPK  Central Committee, recently announced party documents regarding  the party's economic strategies, and the decisions made at the  recent SPA meeting, so that they can master the basic ideology  of the party's economic strategies, the strategic tasks, and the  means to implement them.    Along with this, they must brilliantly fulfill without fail  the tasks for the adjustment period for their sector and their  unit to all the more firmly consolidate the determination and  will of magnificently fulfilling the revolutionary intention of  the party and the leader. In particular, the state economy  leadership organ and responsible functionaries in the related  sectors and units must fully entrust their fate to the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and have the firm determination to  be able to die while on duty defending the revolutionary post.  With this, they must be the standard bearer and hands and feet  in upholding the party and the leader to honorably fulfill their  responsible role as the commanding staff to fulfill the task for  the adjustment period.    Organizing the economic organization work and economic  management work are a firm guarantee in successfully carrying  out the task for the adjustment period.    Functionaries of each class of the economy leadership organ  must carefully organize the economic operation and organization  work to implement a new economic strategy and party policy.  They must also solve problems in the economic work at the  appointed time and in a revolutionary way.    All sectors and all units including the committees,  ministries, and administrative and economic committees of the  provinces must establish strong rules and order that thoroughly  execute the Administration Council's decisions and instructions  to realize the party's unitary leadership in the economic work.  Also, the creativity of each unit must be highly manifested by  the functionaries under the state's unitary leadership to carry  out reliably the task for the adjustment period in a  revolutionary way.    From the principle of subordinating everything in  implementing the party's new economic strategy, the economic  guiding functionaries must establish the people's economy plan  from a practical point of view, make it so that it can be  carried out by the day, by the month, by the quarter, and by the  indicators without fail, and always command the fight skillfully  and with aspiration in front of the ranks and set practical  examples. Along with this, in accordance with the demand of the  party's economic strategy, the work to supply materials to the  agricultural, light industry, and foreign trade sectors must be  unconditionally carried out first, and the rest must be supplied  to the other sectors. This must be carried out under the  principle of thoroughly supplying necessary things to the  leading sectors of the people's economy and the metal industry  sector.    According to the demand of the Taean work system, all the  economy leadership organs, plants, and enterprises must manage  and operate the economy scientifically and rationally under the  collective guidance of the party committee. Also, labor  management, facility management, materials management, and  financial management must be improved to all the more highly  manifest the true superiority of the collective economic  management operation method.    The production and conservation struggle must be vigorously  carried out in all sectors and all units of the people's economy.    With the attitude of a master, the functionaries and workers  must manage the nation's economic life tenaciously and  methodically, protect and manage the state's social assets, and  effectively use idle materials, waste materials, and byproducts.  Also, the struggle to all the more produce and effectively use  the existing labor, facilities, and materials must be carried  out with energy.    The functionaries must bear in mind that an important  reserve  to produce more and conserve lies in the technological  innovation. Therefore, they must go deeply into the producers to  actively bring out their wisdom and creativity, motivate the  patriotic enthusiasm and abilities of the scientists and  technicians, and strengthen their creative cooperation with the  producer masses so that many valuable scientific and technical  inventions and technological innovations can be put forth. Such  inventions and innovations must be made to be effectively used  in production.    All sectors of the people's economy must regard the sectors  of agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade as if it were  their own work, actively help in these sectors, and vigorously  carry out an all-people's support movement for these sectors.    The slogan of self-reliance and fortitude must be all the  more highly upheld and thoroughly embodied in fulfilling the  task for the adjustment period.    The party's new economic strategy is no other than the  strategy of self-reliance and fortitude, and where we carry out  the work of self-reliance and fortitude lies the road to  successfully fulfill the task for the adjustment period.    All functionaries and working people in all sectors and  units of the national economy should implement the economic task  for the adjustment period while overcoming difficulties and  obstacles, creating necessary things they do not have, and  finding out what they lack, by displaying the same spirit and  vigor as demonstrated during the period of anti-Japanese  revolutionary struggle, the severe days of war, and the great  Chollima upswing period, upholding the party's militant slogan,  "Let us vigorously accelerate the general onward march of  socialism with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  fortitude."    The single-hearted unity is the banner of our eternal  victory  in both the revolutionary struggle and economic construction.    To strengthen the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary  ranks in every way is the basic guarantee for the successful  implementation of the task for the adjustment period in  socialist economic construction under the grave situation, in  which the maneuver of imperialists and reactionaries to crush  our Republic becomes all the more unscrupulous as days go by.    Our single-hearted unity means all people's unity around the  party and the leader in ideological will and moral sense of  duty. It is a firm, vital, and invincible unity that no force  can break. Limitless is the might of our people, who are firmly  united as a strong social and political living body with the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center, upholding the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. We can occupy any fortress  and overcome any obstacle when we extremely strengthen the might  of this unity.    All the people should arm themselves with the chuche-based  revolutionary view of leader, firmly bear in mind the greatness  of the party and the leader as an absolute faith, and thoroughly  prepare themselves to become genuine, loyal, and filial sons and  daughters who death-defyingly protect and defend the party and  the leader politically and ideologically in any stormy  circumstances and faithfully uphold the party's leadership. We  should fully demonstrate our faithfulness to the leader  [yongdoja] and more vigorously display the might of our  revolutionary ranks' single-hearted unity in the course of the  practice struggle to implement the task for the adjustment  period in socialist economic construction, upholding the slogan  of loyalty that we will do what the party decides.    The economic task for the adjustment period is heavy and  immense, and we may be faced with stumbling blocks and trials in  the course of implementing it.    All our people, however, bear deep in their hearts the  strong  will and faith that we are not afraid of any obstacle or any  strong enemy as long as the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is  with us. We also have the great potential coming from the  powerful socialist independent economic ground with the  chuche-oriented industry as the pivot.    There is no force in the world that can impair the might of  our people who are stoutly advancing, filled with faith in  certain victory and revolutionary optimism, upholding the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song and under the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il's wise leadership.    Let us all keep on advancing and struggling in the spirit of  Chollima, plus the speed of the nineties, firmly united around  the party and the leader, upholding the banner of the three  revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- and  brilliantly implement the task for the adjustment period in  socialist economic construction to occupy higher uplands of  socialist construction.</p>

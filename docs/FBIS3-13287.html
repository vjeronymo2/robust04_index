The Russian foreign  minister is scheduled to arrive in Tunis today within the  framework of a mission that will also take him to Israel, with  the objective of reactivating the peace process which has been  suspended following the heinous Hebron massacre.    It seems that the Russian move is based on an initiative  that  is independent from the U.S. moves in the region. It also seems  that this move goes beyond the U.S. stand which in full harmony  with the Israeli stand. This Russian move is aimed at  reassessing the current situation in the Middle East  approximately 28 months after the outset of the current peace  process at the Madrid conference.    Perhaps the focal point in the declared Russian initiative  is  based on reconvening the Madrid conference in light of a host of  changes that have occurred in the Middle East in these long  months, and based on a series of facts which were revealed by  the peace negotiations, and which were not assessed objectively  prior to the convening of the Madrid conference in October 1991.    Since these changes and the series of facts, revealed by the  peace talks over the past months, were not fully in harmony with  the Israeli stand and with the objectives of the peace process  placed by the Americans, the initial Israeli reaction opposed  this initiative. Also, the initial U.S. reactions did not  welcome this independent Russian initiative, the first since the  end of the cold war.    In light of all this, we welcome this timely Russian move  aimed to launch the deadlocked peace process. We also support a  process to reassess the peace process by one of the cosponsors  who has been far away from the political arena in this region  for a long time.    We believe that the Russian foreign minister's mission is  evidence that the involved parties have not accepted the  unilateral sponsorship of the deadlocked peace process,  particularly since the American sponsor has shown a lack of  fairness and objectivity, if not complete bias toward the  Israeli view.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Quango appointment attacked Labour yesterday launched a fierce attack on the decision by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to appoint a chairman for the new teacher-training quango when the bill which would create it has yet to pass the Commons. Mrs Ann Taylor, who speaks for Labour on education, described this as an 'abuse of parliament'. She said: 'Parliament hasn't even agreed to set up the Teacher Training Agency, and yet they have already made the appointment. 'Having a democratic process in this country means the opposition is entitled to argue its case. It is conceivable, given the government's defeat in the Lords, that we could vote down the proposals.' The Department for Education was confident, however, that the decision would not cause any problems for the bill when it continued in the committee stage after parliament reconvened. It said that Mr Geoffrey Parker, the new chairman, was officially only the 'chairman-designate' and that his appointment was subject to the education bill receiving royal assent. If the bill is successful the new body must start work in September. The department believed it 'essential' to appoint a chairman as soon as possible. There are precedents for the move. The department pointed to Sir Christopher Benson, who was appointed chairman of the Funding Agency for Schools before the agency started business in April this year, and to Sir Ron Dearing, the chairman of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority.

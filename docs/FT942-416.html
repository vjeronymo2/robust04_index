			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Stability in a storm-tossed world: Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, tells FT writers how a steady course can be pursued flexibly Waves of global financial turmoil and economic stress have rocked the Bundesbank boat relentlessly since Mr Hans Tietmeyer became president nine months ago. But his faith in the German central bank's traditional long-distance navigational techniques - a steady hand on the rudder and a reliable compass - remains undented. His eye remains fixed on horizons, however distant, where stability rules. The internationalisation of money markets has inevitably drawn Germany into rough water. Having swung from being a net capital exporter to an importer, the country was now 'more integrated, more part of the worldwide bond market than before', Mr Tietmeyer told the FT yesterday. 'We are now seeing a growing professionalism . . . all the normal investors who used to do their business on their own behalf are now to a great extent being replaced by professional investors who base their decisions on their own judgments . . . and are much more oriented to the short-term.' Despite the Bundesbank's well-known distaste for short-termism in any form, Mr Tietmeyer remains phlegmatic. 'We cannot live outside this world. This is a new situation we have to live with,' he said. Naturally, central bankers could not control the course of capital markets. 'But what is important is that monetary policy should not give the markets specific incentives to become highly volatile. That means it should maintain a steady course.' First, monetary policy targets should be clearly defined and explained. Policy should then be steered without disruptive changes. It should aim to be predictable . . . but not, of course, in the short-term. 'If a central bank policy were to depend on the short-term expectations of the market, then in the first instance it would be predictable, and in the second it would become a prisoner of market expectations, unable to go its own way,' Mr Tietmeyer warned. He defined a target for the US currency, focus of the latest money markets turmoil: 'Everybody has an interest in a strong and stable dollar,' he stated. And he saw no justification in the fundamentals for the current weakness. In his eyes the recent crunch stemmed from over-reaction to over-stated fears of inflation. Bond markets have also fallen victim to over-correction of earlier trends. 'To some extent I feel a correction was appropriate,' Mr Tietmeyer admitted. 'It started with the US decision to increase short-term interest rates and to move from a stimulative to a more neutral stance in monetary policy.' But he still did not believe that perceptions of longer-term prospects for inflation provided a viable basis for subsequent events. As for central bankers' powers over such events, he repeated his well-known scepticism about the effectiveness of supporting embattled currencies. 'Exchange markets cannot be controlled fully by intervention,' he said. Mr Tietmeyer was unwilling to indicate how central banks might divine the right time to step in, but there was certainly no secret formula. 'No, it's a feeling,' he said. Nor did the Bundesbank have any new means of countering turbulence: 'In the end I am pretty sure the markets will realise the benefit of a steady policy,' he added. He was even modestly confident that markets would soon learn to appreciate the benefits of the bank's favoured but much-maligned stability indicator: targeted money supply growth based on the broad M3 measure. There were already some signs that monetary capital formation - the removal of funds from short-term investments included in the M3 formulation into long-term instruments outside the measure's scope - was improving. 'If we had a normal degree of capital formation we would be much closer to our (M3 growth) target,' Mr Tietmeyer claimed. Recent aberrations in M3's performance were already being reviewed in preparation for the bank council's mid-year progress report due at its regular fortnightly meeting on July 21. 'I cannot predict the outcome. The central council is not controlled by one or two people. It is like a small parliament, I would say. But if I understand the discussion among members, there is clearly a general feeling that we should stick to monetary targeting,' Mr Tietmeyer said. The council needed to assess the special factors bloating money supply growth and assess the chances of their disappearance, and the extent to which elements such as strong credit growth for housing suggested a build-up of inflationary potential. As for interest rates, Mr Tietmeyer again stressed the need for a steady course. Fundamental change now, while the M3 situation remained unclear, would not be appropriate. Interest rate policy has to be aimed at further reducing inflation and avoiding the creation of new inflationary expectations. That would be bad for the impending wage round and bad for bonds, he added. M3 was an important guide, but its importance lay in its value as a medium and long-term indicator. Recent distortions, Mr Tietmeyer maintained, were to be blamed on specific, temporary effects. The bank had never followed a rigid M3 policy, and he himself had always pursued an 'enlightened' line. 'Everyone who has known me for a long time knows I have very strong convictions and a strong general line. But around that general line I am a little bit flexible,' he added. Some of this flexibility has emerged recently in a more favourable tone in the bank's views on the German government's efforts to respond to its relentless urgings towards public spending restraint. But Mr Tietmeyer was yesterday as strict as ever on the need to shrink the deficit but avoid tax increases. 'It can only be done by holding down spending on the consumption side. That includes wages and social spending,' he said. The challenge now was to proceed for the rest of the decade from the first steps already taken by the federal, regional and local governments. Clearly concerned that expectations - 'the most important element in the whole question of recovery' - should remain in balance with reality, Mr Tietmeyer acknowledged that the economy was in the first stages of recovery. Industry had restructured and was regaining its competitiveness. But the process of restructuring had to continue if an accumulation of 'wrong developments' was to be untangled. Up until the early 1990s, Germany had an undervalued currency. 'This gave people the impression they were competitive when they were not,' he said. The public debate on social costs was just beginnning. Two years ago there was no question: everyone thought everything could go on (expanding) indefinitely. While Mr Tietmeyer felt unified Germany was now starting to build the foundations for durable growth and stability, he made plain that he felt the Maastricht treaty was still only a blueprint. It was a positive factor, but monetary union needed firm foundations, both economic and political, he said. Economic conditions were one aspect. 'In my view there must also be political conditions. That means a clear will to move in political solidarity . . . because monetary union is a risk-sharing union,' he said. 'In a monetary union we have to take all the risks and consequences of failures and mistakes; share all the advantages and disadvantages.' It was not a purely technical matter. Mr Tietmeyer, although aware of the dangers of being accused of political meddling, has persistently aired his concern that the technicalities of union were being allowed to overshadow the political necessities. He repeated that he could not see for 'the foreseeable future' a situation where all member and candidate countries could simultaneously meet all the conditions of the treaty for monetary union. There were cultural and institutional hindrances, too. He was 'not happy' that independence for all EU central banks had not been made a condition for the start of stage two of the proposed union this year. 'Independent central banking has to be learnt,' he said, and the merits and disadvantages appreciated in both the political and public sphere. 'In France there is an interesting example to be watched,' he noted. As for Britain, he gleefully quoted the concluding remarks from a recent lecture by Mr Stanley Fischer, recently named as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund: 'On her 300th birthday it is time for the Old Lady to be allowed to take on the responsibilities of independence.' Preparation for union and the necessary European Central Bank required more than technical progress. It could not be done from one day to another. For success a tradition had to be established and developed to some extent. 'In the long run, monetary union cannot and will not survive without being embedded in a broad political, common environment,' he said. Mr Tietmeyer, the man who might be the last president of a German Bundesbank, stressed he wanted it to work. But he could not hide his fears. 'If we create a monetary union and this proves to be a failure, this will be a very, very sad result for Europe,' he said. 'A breakdown of such a union would be more dangerous than not to have it in the first place.'</p>

For the second time in two days, the attorney general's office  announced the arrest on drug trafficking charges of a relative of Caro  Quintero, sentenced for the 1985 murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  agent Enrique Camarena. Police arrested Victor Elevier Caro Fonseca, Caro  Quintero's nephew, for possession of nine pounds of cocaine in a small town  near Guadalajara, an office spokesman said.  </P></p>

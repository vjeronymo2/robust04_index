			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / Sumitomo plant gunman opens fire A gunman walked into a Japanese-owned fibre optics plant in the US yesterday and opened fire, killing one person and wounding two others, AP reports from Research Triangle park, North Carolina. Authorities evacuated the Sumitomo Electric Fiber Optics plant and combed buildings for a man identified by witnesses as a recently dismissed employee. Police in Durham said they had surrounded the unidentified suspect's home. The 490-employee Sumitomo plant, which makes optical fibre cable and fiber optics components, is among the cluster of research, manufacturing and technical plants in the research park 10 miles west of Raleigh. The company is a subsidiary of Sumitomo Electric of Japan. 'We looked out over the plant floor - we saw people just running at random. And it was just a pop, pop, pop. We never did see the guy,' Mr Sid Gregory, a Sumitomo employee, told a local television station. Employees were evacuated from the plant but not allowed into the car park to recover their vehicles, so shuttle buses took some to a nearby cafeteria and relatives picked up others. Medical staff confirmed that one person was dead. A man and woman underwent surgery for multiple gunshot wounds and both were reported to be in serious condition. The shooting was reported shortly before 8am at the plant, the local sheriff's department said.</p>

Today, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria made a technical  stopover at the National Air Service terminal in Tocumen, during  which he met with his Panamanian counterpart Guillermo Endara.  Cesar Gaviria declared his meeting with Endara at the airport  had nothing to do with his possible participation in the bid for  the post of OAS secretary general, nor was it intended to  pressure the Endara government to support him.    [Begin Gaviria recording] We are working on all fronts. We  want to have better control of our borders, but we are also  working on commercial aspects. The Grancolombiana Merchant Fleet  is working on an interesting project to begin ferry  transportation on a daily basis between Cartagena, Colon, and  Panama City. This is a very interesting project that for the  time being will resolve the Darien gap problem and will allow us  to have permanent transit not only between Panama and Colombia,  but also between Central and South America. [end recording]    Gaviria stressed he came to strengthen bilateral ties. He  then left the National Air Service terminal in Tocumen to attend  the inauguration of new Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina.    Meanwhile, Panamanian President Guillermo Endara called his  brief meeting with Gaviria as positive. He also explained that  his decision to not attend the inauguration of the new president  of Honduras was because he prefers to stay in the country to  think about possible changes he will make in his government  cabinet.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: New operations and franchises help lift Ramsden's to Pounds 0.6m HARRY Ramsden's, the USM-quoted fish and chip restaurant operator, achieved an 8 per cent profits improvement to Pounds 607,812 pre-tax for the year to September 29. The shares responded with a 5p rise to 140p. Joint venture and franchise operations helped bolster turnover from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 2.87m. The pre-tax figure was held back by a fall in interest income to Pounds 15,388 (Pounds 115,960), reflecting investment of cash balances into new operations. The company operates six restaurants in the UK and has plans for further openings in Edinburgh, Birmingham and Bristol this year. In addition it has agreed commitments from joint venture partners in Cardiff, Belfast, Dublin and Aberdeen where site searches are under way. Directors said the company's first international operation, opened in Hong Kong in August, was achieving 'sales levels equal to our UK restaurant average sales'. Strong interest was being shown in the Pacific Rim from new prospective partners. Site searches were also under way in Jeddah following the completion of a franchise agreement with a substantial Saudi operator. The results to date of Merryweathers, the chain of fish and chip takeaways acquired for Pounds 600,000 last March, were in line with expectations. The annual dividend is maintained at 4.5p via a same-again final of 3.5p. Earnings emerged at 7.2p (6.8p) per share. Consolidated net debt at the year-end totalled Pounds 237,379.</p>

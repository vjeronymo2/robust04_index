			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICK SIX WINNER COLLECTS $231,875  </P> <P> One fan collected $231,875.40 with the only ticket with all six winners Friday  in the Pick Six at Santa Anita, and as a result he may be enjoying retirement  in the near future.  </P> <P> The 67-year-old building maintenance man who declined to reveal his name,  employed by an insurance company, selected the winning half-dozen horses by  name and jockeys, and after purchasing two separate $2 Pick Six tickets he had  just 50 cents of the money he brought to the track left in his pocket.  </P> <P> 'I might give one week's notice at my job,' said the man. 'This is better than  the $64 I make working for a day.'  </P></p>

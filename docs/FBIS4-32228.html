			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and  the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] have met in Mostar. They  agreed to allow up to 200 people cross from the Muslim to the  Croat bank of the Neretva. Each side will try to locate the  bodies of dead and missing persons, and reports will be drawn up  to this effect at places where prisons and unmarked graves are  still believed to exist.</p>

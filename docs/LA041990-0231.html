			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS SLASH NATURAL GAS TO LITHUANIA;  </P> <P> INDEPENDENCE: CUTOFF LEAVES THE COUNTRY WITH ONLY 16% OF THE FUEL IT NEEDS. THE  REDUCTION IS SEEN AS PUNISHMENT FOR ASSERTING ITS SOVEREIGNTY.  </P> <P> The Kremlin sharply curtailed supplies of natural gas to Lithuania today, hours  after it halted the flow of crude oil to the republic for refusing to scrap  laws promoting independence, Lithuanian officials said.  </P> <P> Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said Moscow's economic embargo is  tantamount to it recognizing his Baltic republic's independence.  </P> <P> A Soviet energy official, however, said the Lithuanians got what they deserved  for defying President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who on Friday threatened to cut off  supplies unless they rescinded their independence-oriented laws.  </P> <P> A Lithuanian government spokesman appealed over Vilnius Radio today for fuel  conservation, "and maybe we will not be intimidated by these sanctions."  </P> <P> The flow of natural gas to Lithuania was shut off in three pipelines -- two  from Latvia and one from Minsk in Byelorussia -- reducing supplies to Lithuania  by more than 80%, Lithuanian lawmakers said.  </P> <P> A fourth pipeline from Slonim in Byelorussia that supplies Lithuania continued  to provide 3.5 million cubic meters of gas to the republic, guaranteeing "a  normal supply of gas for residents and communal domestic use," parliamentary  officials quoted the Byelorussian gas concern's telegram as saying.  </P> <P> That leaves Lithuania with only 16% of the gas it needs per day.  </P> <P> Juozas Martusevicius, a Lithuanian electrical official, said Moscow officials  guaranteed that enough natural gas would be supplied to keep Lithuania's  Elektrenai power plant functioning. The plant also serves customers in the  neighboring Russian republic territory of Kaliningrad.  </P> <P> As the events in Lithuania unfolded, Gorbachev met in the Kremlin today with  leaders of Latvia and Estonia and offered concessions and made threats in an  effort to keep them in the Soviet Union, participants said.  </P> <P> Gorbachev offered both republics "special status" in the Soviet Union if they  drop their attempts to follow Lithuania into independence, said Raymond  Lochmelis of the Latvian Popular Front and other officials present.  </P></p>

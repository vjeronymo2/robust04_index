			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "HB": "Economy in Western Germany on the Way </F> to Recovery"]    [Text] Duesseldorf, 4 Jan -- Even at the beginning of the  year, HANDELSBLATT's early indicator continued its four-month  upward trend. It improved from minus 0.8 percent in December  1993 to minus 0.5 percent in January 1994, and was thus 0.7  percentage points above last year's January value. Despite the  recently differing developments of the individual values that  make up the early indicator, it looks as if the turn of the tide  has meanwhile been completed.    Although the demand in the manufacturing industry in October  only barely managed to maintain the value of the previous month,  for the first time in a longer period the corresponding value of  the previous year was not only attained but even exceeded by a  narrow margin. It is now more than six months ago that the  absolute low in the developments was recorded in March. Since  then, demand has gradually picked up, all in all more than 5  percent.    The demand in the main construction industry has been  relatively steady again. After the slump of the second quarter  of the year, which was mainly caused by public civil  engineering, order books have meanwhile consolidated again at a  higher level. In September another increase of almost 1 percent  was achieved over August. Last year's level was thus exceeded  by 2 percent.    The retail trade remains a problem child of the economy.  After sales in real terms managed to get out of the low of the  middle of the year with great difficulty during recent months,  October was anything but a golden month for retail trade  revenues. On the contrary, the sales adjusted for price changes  and seasonal variations were down 3.3 percent over the previous  month.    With 0.6 percent, the margin between short- and long-term  interests slightly improved in November; temporarily prevalent  expectations that the interest structure would normalize by the  end of 1993 have, however, proved too optimistic. Nevertheless,  one should not be dissatisfied with the developments in the  capital markets; long-term interest rates, which are so  important for long-term financing, fell by another two  percentage points in November, while the three-month Fibor rate  decreased even more strongly (0.3 percentage points).    Altogether, the economic situation at the beginning of the  year still appears to be in a precarious state, although it is  certainly on the way to recovery. The main positive aspect is  that the general mood has changed in favor of the optimists.  The Economic Research Institute index for the business climate  in the manufacturing industry managed to recover further in  November; with minus 27.6 points after minus 30.3 points in the  previous month, it is now clearly more favorable that one year  ago (minus 40.3 percent in November 1992).</p>

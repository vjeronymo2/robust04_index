			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: More regulation of world finance urged HIGH DEBTS and weak property prices in much of the developed world will hamper a return to strong global growth, Mr Bengt Dennis, chairman of the Bank for International Settlements, said yesterday. Speaking at the annual meeting in Basle of the central bankers' bank, he said governments had been too lax in easing credit restrictions in the 1980s and would have to step up efforts to regulate the wave of new financial activities triggered by liberalisation. Much of the tone of Mr Dennis's comments was backed up in the annual report of the BIS, also released yesterday, but it gave a somewhat brighter view of economic prospects in the industrial nations. 'Grounds for optimism' existed partly because of signs of revival in the US and strong growth in much of the developing world, including Latin America and east Asia. The report voices doubts, however, about whether the economies of European Community nations can move close enough to make economic and monetary union feasible, without unacceptably large fiscal transfers or high unemployment. Efforts to establish European economic and monetary union by the end of the century may run into technical difficulties, it says. Reflecting the views of BIS officials rather than those of the 32 central banks which own the organisation, the report sparked friction with some bank governors with a series of comments about prospects for Emu. The report, written before the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty, said many European governments 'were not unhappy about the lack of public debate in their countries prior to the Maastricht summit and did little or nothing to stimulate it'. It added: 'Having managed to spring the programme on a largely unprepared public they are now faced with debate and dissention very late in the day.' The BIS report also spelt out some of the difficulties for the banking sector due to bad debts and weak economies in much of the developed world. It said international banking assets, as measured by cross-border and local foreign currency claims, fell last year by Dollars 102bn - thought to be the first decline since the 1940s.

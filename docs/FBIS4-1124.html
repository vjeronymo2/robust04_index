			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Freedom Front leader General Constand </F> Viljoen by Chris Whitfield and John Soderlund; place and date  not given]    [Text]  <H5>  On the Freedom Front's [FF] late entry into the </H5> election.    [Viljoen] Yes, we came in very late and it will certainly  affect the final result. But we have been surprised by the  positive reaction we have seen countrywide. People countrywide  are very reluctant to vote for the NP [National Party] -- just  about everybody, even the coloureds. Everybody is very  uncertain about what the ANC is going to do. Somehow they think  the Freedom Front will be that party which will be able to give  guidance which might be of better quality than what they've had  in the World Trade Centre between the NP and the ANC. I think  everybody opposes the idea that we must give full autonomy to  those two players.    They've worked together in the World Trade Centre, no doubt.  They are going to work together again and they need a strong  opposition.  <H5>  On his party's support. </H5>   [Viljoen] We were so late in registration that it is  virtually impossible to make an estimation (but) we have had, so  far, a very good attendance at our meetings. We attract full  halls. People are very interested. What is also of great value  to me is the fact that (when) many Afrikaners who resisted the  idea of voting attend meetings and hear the explanation we give  on why we are going for the vote, they accept.  <H5>  On whether the FF will get 35 percent of the Afrikaner vote. </H5>   [Viljoen] Sure.  <H5>  On whether he would take a Cabinet seat if support exceeded </H5> the required 5 percent.    [Viljoen] The FF is more constitutionally oriented than  governability oriented. I haven't even thought of such a  possibility. The major contribution we can make it to apply the  principle of self-determination in order to find a real solution  for the big problem of South Africa. We have come to the  conclusion that SA has always had the wrong constitution, the  only reason why it worked is because of the laws we had which  put the white people in a position where they could suppress and  where they could govern with all the means available.    We repeated the mistake in 1961 when we had the Republic  established. We made a mistake with our policy of separate  development in that. There was nothing wrong in creating a  separate area for the Tswanas or the Zulus. But we made the  mistake of forcing these people out of the system, totally on  their own, without caring for a proper economy. This is the  danger about the future too. Even in the (new) provincial  system in SA, you will find that the different provinces will  not be able to go for independent economies for each province.  You will have to go for a united SA. And I think this is the  problem with many of the volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] people  too -- those people that think you can take the volkstaat out of  SA and put a wall around it -- this is not on. So, when you  think about a volkstaat, you should think about it as an area --  say a 10th area -- where you have, based on the principle of  asymetry, special powers, in order to satisfy the principle of  self-determination.    Economically, there will have to be negotiated agreements on  how the total economy of SA will be a unitary economy. Not only  of SA but we favour the idea of southern Africa. So, what do we  want. We want political stability and satisfaction by  accommodating the people according to their wishes. Let me  quote you an example. You know the Zulus as well as I do.  There's no way that the Zulu people will accept being subjected  to Mr (Nelson) Mandela, who is regarded by them as a Xhosa. And  its not good to say we are past that stage and this is racism  again and ethnicity again.    It is a fact, it is a reality in SA, and we have to bear  that  in mind. Same thing with the Afrikaner people. Same thing with  the other people too. Funny, you know, we are now the big  propagandists for the idea of self-determination. When I  arrived at the Cape we got this idea about the Cape Republic  Movement. They approached me and said please, we are also  looking for self-determination for the Cape, between the  coloureds and the whites. Because they reckon they have built  the Cape up to now. And they are being flooded by people being  bussed in in order to manipulate the voting. Now they say the  solution is to have self-determination. Even some of the other  black states are catching on to this idea.    The point I am making is we have always had a basically  wrong  constitution in South Africa because it never really gave space  to the accommodation of all people. And we believe, by applying  the principle of self-determination for political autonomy  within a territorial base.  <H5>  On comments by Nelson Mandela that there will be no </H5> volkstaat.    [Viljoen] He is electioneering. (Viljoen shows a  hand-written letter from Mandela dated December 18 apparently  giving in-principle support for the concept of  self-determination). He and his whole national executive find  acceptable that accord (on a volkstaat) that we never signed.  That accord did say the concerns of self-determination must be  addressed and it did say we must have joint teams that will work  on this. What Mr Mandela is saying in the public is not really  in line with what happens on a negotiations' level and I  therefore think Mr Mandela has the wrong idea of a volkstaat.    The negotiation is done at the level of Mr (Thabo) Mbeki.  Maybe he (Mandela) thinks this idea amounts to taking out the  volkstaat, having its own economy, divorcing the rest of South  Africa from the assistance that the Afrikaner can give, which is  not what we have in mind.  <H5>  On the constitutional principle making provision for a </H5> volkstaat council.    [Viljoen] We negotiated the 34th principal. We are  negotiating at the moment the accords that will reinforce the  legislation and I would therefore not say we are not putting our  faith in the Volkstaat Council, but this is the constitutional  instrument created for this purpose.  <H5>  On differences in strategy with other right-wingers. </H5>   [Viljoen] If they can produce a volkstaat before April 27  then I will consider leaving the voting. But if there is no  volkstaat, then I would call on those people to vote for us. I  have full respect for their views of the emotion of not voting  in the election. But strategically, there is no other option.  If we want to get...self-determination as soon as possible  after April 27, if we want to work with the kwaZulu people in  regard to the establishment of such an idea of  self-determination, the best way for us to do it is to climb  into the system. Because if you are in now you can always get  out, but if you are out now you can never get in.  <H5>  On whether IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] participation will </H5> help the FF cause.    [Viljoen] There is one major difference between the Zulu  people and the Afrikaner people: they have an area, a  territory, we don't have a territory. The moment we have proved  substantial support and the moment we have more or less  identified the most suitable core area for the volkstaat, then  the whole idea will run parallel and great advantage will exist  between us.  <H5>  On how long it may take to establish a volkstaat. </H5>   [Viljoen] Within a month we will have a volkstaat council,  (and) there is a constitutional provision for the fact that the  whole of the provincial boundaries must be completed within 12  months.  <H5>  On forms of self-determination not based on territory. </H5>   [Viljoen] No, we want to have a territory for the Afrikaner.  We believe that is very important. What we also hope to do is  supplement the idea of self-determination within the volkstaat  with that of self-determination outside a volkstaat, not coupled  to a specific area.    The way that we wish to do this is, if we can succeed in  establishing community councils -- and we have gone a long way  in the negotiations to get this accepted -- then, let us say  from the provinces of the country, they can have five delegates  per province, elected from the community councils and they can  then be part of an advisory body to the volksraad [Afrikaner  national council]. The other idea is the idea of cantons. Let  us say we have a concentration of Afrikaners in the northern  Cape that would like to be linked to the volkstaat, then maybe  we can have a conton of them. They can, through a referendum,  prove their desire for self-determination as a community, and  they would be allowed to link up constitutionally with the  volkstaat. So those are the three ideas: self-determination  within the volkstaat, self-determination outside the volkstaat  not coupled to the specific area but linked to the volkstaat,  and then the idea of cantons.  <H5>  On his future in government. </H5>   [Viljoen] My main concern is a constitutional solution to  South Africa. I have always been involved in security, I have  always been involved with peacemaking.  <H5>  On being a military man in the political field. </H5>   [Viljoen] A completely different culture. The one thing that  is common about this, though, is that if in battle you are given  an objective, you get totally devoted to capturing that  objective. The approach is that no matter what the sacrifices,  you have to achieve your objective. I think the same with  politics. Having decided on your objective, you get the same  obsession. I think organisationally, the demands of what we are  doing at the moment are as big. When you speak to me, you don't  speak just on the political side.  <H5>  On whether he believes a military option is still viable. </H5>   [Viljoen] Of course, yes. Its always an option. I believe  that strength is important in South Africa and I believe (in)  self-defence ability, especially if you consider the  vulnerability of our people within isolated farming areas, and  so on. Remember the commando system, self-defence has been part  of our culture ever since we faced the dangers of a new land.    I have never back-pedalled on the military option. I have  always said that I will use all peaceful means available, and I  have often said that I will have to satisfy my own integrity in  this regard. I will have to be able to stand before God and say  that I have tried all the other options. I don't believe that  our solution can come from war.  <H5>  On the effect of the toppling of Mangope in Bophuthatswana </H5> on the Right.    [Viljoen] The AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] made a  terrible mistake. It's such a pity because what happened to  them is only discrediting. If you consider the rest of the  undertaking it would have been a perfect success. As a matter  of fact Mr (Lucas) Mangope might still today have been in power  had the mess of the AWB not caused the revolt or the uprising  (by Bophuthatswana troops). We were not going to make use of the  AWB, we were specifically requested not to bring the AWB because  it was mentioned to me that the presence of the AWB might bring  resistance from inside.  <H5>  On his present relationship with the AWB. </H5>   [Viljoen] We have broken the relationship. I have often  found in the past that whenever we make use of the AWB, for some  or other reason we land up being discredited. I don't believe  that we ca have joint operations of great importance. And I am  referring to, if necessary, military operations. It is very  important in military operations that we should exercise  discipline and restraint.</p>

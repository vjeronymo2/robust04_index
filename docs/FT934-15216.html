			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Prisons inquiry chief attacks Howard proposals GOVERNMENT proposals to get tough on crime are 'short-sighted and irresponsible' says Lord Woolf, who conducted the official inquiry into the 1990 riots at Strangeways and other prisons. Last night he told an audience of prison service chiefs, politicians, senior police officers and churchmen that policies of imprisoning greater numbers of people had a 'miserable record of failure'. Cramming more people into a prison system already under acute pressure could lead to further riots. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, last week announced wide-ranging proposals to crack-down on crime and acknowledged that his plans were likely to increase the prison population. Lord Woolf said: 'The cost of prisons to the public is heavy and only justified when there really is no alternative.' The new prisons would cost hundreds of millions of pounds to build and more than Pounds 66m a year to run and yet the system would still be overcrowded. He called for more resources for community punishments and crime prevention. He proposed legalising some drugs in controlled circumstances so addicts would no longer need to commit crime to feed their addiction. He also called for fines on people who did not take steps to protect their property.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 250 ARRESTED AT ABORTION CLINIC  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department really showed its stuff in putting down the  anti-abortion protesters on June 10. Yes, the police really showed that they  can hand it out to those men, women and children by breaking an arm here and  stepping on a head there. I'm not sure that it demonstrated the "right stuff,"  but it proved that LAPD can make the streets of Los Angeles safe from those who  pose such a threat to society by peacefully protesting abortion. Too bad LAPD  can't make our streets safe from drug dealers and gangs.  </P> <P> ROBERT WALTON  </P> <P> Sylmar  </P></p>

This statement was made in Moscow on Tuesday by  President Boris Yeltsin after signing a number of  British-Russian documents.    In answer to a question from Interfax's correspondent the  Russian leader said that his partner in the talks -- Prime  Minister John Major -- shares Moscow's view that it's essential  "to transfer the military hardware surrounding Sarajevo to the  U.N. forces, and compel the warring Bosnian sides "to settle  their conflict peacefully" by means of talks.    Yeltsin confirmed however that the organizers of the  possible  attacks on the contingent of U.N. peace-keepers should be  "punished."    Earlier on Tuesday the president's press secretary,  Vyacheslav Kostikov, said that the possible "NATO air strikes on  Serb positions would be inevitably associated in the eyes of  international and Russian public opinion with the USA and with  the recently proclaimed "Partnership for Peace" program.    "In my view this may do psychological damage to that  diplomatic initiative," he stressed in an interview with  Interfax.    "The world has not fully grasped the concept of that program  yet," Kostikov said. "Many people may consider the bombing of  Serb positions by NATO forces, in which the USA plays the  leading role, as reflecting the ideology of "Partnership for  Peace" in concrete terms. Since such turn of events is quite  possible, the proposed operation may be viewed as a false start  of the American initiative."    In his view, the president's press secretary pointed out, to  resolve the Bosnian conflict politically would be in the  interests of both the USA and Russia.    In the meantime the State Duma's committee on geopolitics  conducted hearings on Tuesday and decided that the international  public must not interfere in the affairs of former Yugoslav  republics.    Deputies issued a resolution which calls for restoring "a  unified democratic state" in the territory of former Yugoslavia.  According to them, this is the only way to stop the bloodshed.    According to the resolution, the practical implementation of  NATO's decision to bomb Serb positions around Sarajevo "should  be viewed as an act of international terrorism". The document  suggests that the Russian president should "use the right to  veto in the U.N. security Council in regard to air strikes in  former Yugoslavia, and resolve the issue of lifting by Russia  economic sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia".    These decisions were not affected when a spokesman for  Russia's Foreign Ministry, Vladimir Ivanovsky, addressed those  present. He tried to explain that the U.N. resolution  concerning former Yugoslavia lays responsibility for breaking  the siege of Sarajevo on the U.N. secretary-general, and that in  fact there is no need to convene the U.N. security Council for  taking a decision on the use of aircraft. Under the  circumstances the possibility of Russia's using the right to  veto is purely "hypothetical", the diplomat said.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Dennis Milton's split decision victory over Michael Olajide Dec. 1 at Albany,  N.Y., was upheld by the New York State Athletic Commission. But Olajide's  attorney indicated his client will take the matter to court.  </P> <P> "We're reviewing it (the commission ruling), but there's no doubt in our minds  that we will take appropriate legal action to seek a reversal of the decision  in the court," attorney Michael DiRaimondo said.  </P> <P> Olajide thought he had stopped Milton late in the final round of the 10-round  middleweight bout when referee Ken Zimmer pulled him away from the obviously  hurt Milton.  </P> <P> Zimmer said that he had stepped in because he thought the bell had sounded  ending the fight. Two of the three judges had Milton ahead, and he got a split  decision.  </P></p>

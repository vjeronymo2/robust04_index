			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Arts: Marching to a different drummer - Royal Ballet It is difficult to know what to make of the programme with that the Royal Ballet opened its Opera House season on Saturday night. Advertised as 'White-hot and different' - a catch-penny phrase which makes no sense - it offers new works by apprentice choreographers Matthew Hart and William Tuckett, a third-hand exercise in kick-boxing by William Forsythe, and a revival of Kenneth MacMillan's Different Drummer. Were this ill-formed bill the precursor of a season of novelties, of fresh thinking, it might be seen as an artistic card boldly played. Not so. The Royal Ballet promises the return of last season's turkeys: the leaden Don Quixote; Glen Tetley's turgid La Ronde; the traducing of Ashton's film choreography for Beatrix Potter - and such rarities as Cinderella, The Nutcracker, Romeo and Juliet. Our national ballet has a duty to find its choreographers, and the evening acknowledges that fact. I doubt if the grand arena of Covent Garden is the place in which they should first seek to prove themselves. Matthew Hart, while still a student, made dances of promise. He is young - only two years in the company - and he has created one professional work, with Birmingham Royal Ballet. For Fanfare, his Opera House debut, he has been given a new score by Brian Elias and design by Yolanda Sonnabend. Wisely, he has opted for a small cast of three couples, and sought to expose something of their physical identities in a series of entries which have an ambiguous emotional air. Yet he has not really mastered his score, which is bold, clangorous with bells, richly varied in texture; nor his designs, which are opulently coloured gauzes and rather too exotic for the dance. That Hart has talent, I do not doubt. Invention is fluent, and he moves his cast easily about the stage, though inconclusive hints of drama are more a tease than a flavour. But he needs experience on smaller stages, under less tremendous circumstances. Had I a wish for him, it is that he join the Birmingham troupe, and make a succession of ballets there - learning, creating, over a period of years, just as MacMillan, Cranko, and Bintley got to grips with their craft. Hart is too valuable to be sacrificed to the exigencies and tensions of Covent Garden before he has proved his metier. William Tuckett's If This is Still a Problem is its own problem. Tuckett - as we have seen in ballets made for Birmingham and at Covent Garden - is concerned with dance as exploration of emotional states. His pieces are patently sincere, but they come burdened with too many private messages, and not enough technical mastery. It was less than wise to impose his danced anxieties on the perfections of Ravel's piano trio. Twelve dancers, looking confused and at less than their best, drifted and rushed through the knee-high 'angst', the girls in pallid long frocks and bathing caps, the men in basic tights. Andy Klunder's design appeared a bland variation on his Gloria setting. There were fraught moments when I feared we might be trapped in a 'buddy ballet' - chap to chap, as it were. Nothing happened. Tuckett can do better than this, and the Royal Ballet should concern itself with guiding him. About Herman Schmerman, the Forsythe acquisition, I report that it was first staged for New York City Ballet in 1992, then mounted in Frankfurt on Forsythe's troupe. The accompaniment is, unsurprisingly, more borborygms from Thom Willems' central heating system. The first part comprises exercises for three girls and two men; the second part is an apache duet for Sylvie Guillem and Adam Cooper. The opening is unenterprising. The cast build brief, awkward blocks of classical steps, then lope away like athletes after a race. The text is fragmented, with movement given the occasional vicious kick - something from 'Mugging for beginners'. It is dull, disjunct stuff, where quick, distorting shafts of energy do the work of dance invention. The lovely girls, bare-legged and lit from above, are turned into advertisements for cellulitis. The duet for Guillem and Cooper is more interesting. It proposes partnering as sparring, feeding upon Guillem's extraordinary looseness at the hip, so that steps rotate and reverse and turn in upon themselves. Cooper, dancing and projecting a character with fine assurance, is her match. It is unrelenting - albeit given savour by Guillem's extraordinary physique and Cooper's tough response to her - and arid, because mechanistic. With lesser artists it would be unbearable. The revival of Different Drummer makes the evening worthwhile. MacMillan's exposure of Woyzeck's soul was created a decade ago. Its return, in the version he revised for the Berlin Ballet, reasserts the piece's importance as a brave expressionistic study. With Irek Mukhamedov as Woyzeck, the title role receives ideal interpretation. Here is Buchner's dumb-ox hero, brutalised, exploited, maddened. And, as Mukhamedov shows us, almost holy in his innocence. It is a frighteningly true, heart-tearing (and technically staggering) portrayal by a great dance artist. The other players - David Drew as the Captain, Adam Cooper as the Drum Major, Luke Heydon as Andres, Iain Webb as the doctor - are very fine. I thought Vivana Durante's Marie something too conscious - even too intelligent - though the role is excellently danced. The ballet is searing. Mukhamedov must be seen in it.

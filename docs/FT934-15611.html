			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A question mark over gains expected from a Gatt agreement Sir, I wish to question Samuel Brittan's presentation of the gains to be expected from a successful conclusion to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations ('Where Gatt's Dollars 200bn really comes from', October 4). First, the reference to net world annual gains of Dollars 213bn a year by 1992 is in itself no more than a rhetorically stunning device. Its real significance is indeed best shown as 0.75 per cent of world income at that time, plus or minus an uncertainty factor which probably exceeds that figure, and which should be seen in the context of uncertainties in the income itself in 2002, which can hardly be less than plus or minus Dollars 1,300bn. Nor may it be assessed, as he suggests, as a third of a normal year's growth because it is not a renewable extra element each year, but, if it arises, a once for all increase to a first order of approximation. It may also be compared with inherent errors in the estimations of past actual incomes which themselves are likely to exceed that 0.75 per cent. In other words, the eventual effect will be so small as to be untraceable. Second, one cannot confine oneself to a purely technical economic analysis - there are factors to be considered of probably far greater importance to the man in the street than a financial effect of 0.75 per cent, even if economists prefer to neglect them because they are outside their frame of reference, or because it has become politically incorrect in recent years to question whether wholly free markets are always a good thing. The experience of quasi-free global financial markets in which aleatory surges of Gadarene financial opinion often swamp longer-term aspects would suggest that the erection of partially autarkic zones, acting like dams on a great river, may save millions of people from sacrificial drowning on the altar of abstract three-quarter per cent trade theory without reducing the availability of water. While the Soviet extremity of the economic spectrum has been spectacularly discredited, one should also note that the opposite end, perhaps best represented by the US, has equally clearly demonstrated its own limitations in recent decades. Variety in societies is important. Nations should retain freedom to seek their own balance between financial and other indicators of a good life.

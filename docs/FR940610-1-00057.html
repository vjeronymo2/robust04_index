			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters recommended that certain kinds of foods_principally milk, meat and processed foods_be eliminated entirely from program meals. These recommendations were based on the assumption that some foods are good for people and some are intrinsically bad. However, the Department does not share this view. The Department continues to believe that it is important to obtain essential nutrients from a variety of foods. The Department also emphasizes that foods, particularly those high in fat, must be eaten in moderation, but there are no plans to prohibit any foods from school meals other than the foods of minimal nutritional value currently enumerated in appendix B of part 210 for the NSLP and &sect;220.12 for the SBP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum Professional Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters suggested that the Department establish minimum professional standards for local food service workers. The Department is aware that efforts are being made to address this issue. For example, the American School Food Service Association has developed a program to certify food service workers. However, given the wide range of variances in needs and resources among the 20,000 school food authorities and 92,000 schools operating under the NSLP, as well as varying State requirements, the Department does not believe it is feasible to propose uniform national standards. Nevertheless, the Department does intend to continue to provide technical assistance and guidance to both State agencies and local school food authorities on ways to improve food service operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cash in Lieu of Commodities/Commodity Letter of Credit <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 18(b) of the NSLA, 42 U.S.C. 1769(b), Congress established the Cash in Lieu of Commodities (CASH) and Commodity Letter of Credit (CLOC) demonstration projects as a means of examining alternatives to the current commodity distribution system for schools. Under CASH, schools receive their per-meal commodity support entitlement (currently $.14) in the form of a direct cash payment. CLOC provides commodity support through a Letter of Credit which must be used to purchase specific commodities that mirror the Department's commodity purchases. Fifty-nine school districts participate in the CASH/CLOC demonstration. The current project authorization expires at the end of Fiscal Year 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters supported CASH/CLOC, while a small number opposed it. Others implicitly favored the current commodity distribution system if more healthful commodities can be provided. These commenters would support alternatives only in the event that the current commodity system cannot be strengthened and improved. The Department intends to continue and expand efforts already underway to improve the commodity program. Moreover, the Department does not have the statutory authority to address the CASH/CLOC issue through the rulemaking process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Guiding Principles and Framework for Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Improving the nutritional standards of school meals is our national health responsibility. There is no question that diet is linked to health and that chronic disease often begins in childhood. Since eating habits are firmly established by age 12, it is essential that dietary patterns be formed early. What children eat helps determine not only how healthy they are as children, but how healthy they will be as adults. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Updating our nutrition standards and streamlining the administration of school meals programs reinforces President Clinton's priorities for health care reform and government reinvention. Five principles are at the core of our vision and grow out of our analysis of public comments and the participation of those who hold a stake in a healthy future for our children. These principles are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Healthy children: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Our goal is to provide our nation's children with access to school meal programs that promote their health, prevent disease, and meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Customer appeal: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We understand that if food doesn't look good or taste good, children will not eat it. We must involve students, parents, teachers, and the food and agriculture community in any change through a national nutrition education campaign, using the media that children and parents understand and speaking in the language that they speak. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

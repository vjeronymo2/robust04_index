			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the Mexican </F> Institutional Revolutionary Party National Executive Committee,  at the party's national headquarters in Mexico City; broadcast  in progress -- live]    [Text] ...a document that contains a decision by the  president of the National Executive Committee [CEN], of which I  have already given an account to the CEN itself. As a member  and especially as a leader of the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] my ethical responsibility and personal  convictions have forced me to make the following statement:    It is the fundamental responsibility of the president of the  PRI-CEN to maintain the PRI's unity and guide its forces in  accordance with the fundamental principles and values that we  have always maintained. Under such circumstances, any conduct  motivated by personal ambitions could cause divisions within the  party. To allow this would be very serious and irresponsible, to  encourage it would betray the party's traditional order.    The death of our friend and comrade, Luis Donaldo Colosio,  has generated unprecedented conditions for the party. Luis  Donaldo was an exemplary member of the PRI; his pledges will  continue to be ours. His proposals of change with security and  responsibility will continue to be our political undertaking.  Nothing better than this undertaking to keep his democratic  example and his guiding presence alive. Thus, I consider it my  unavoidable duty to say that as the PRI national leader I do not  aspire to be nominated as a candidate to the presidency of the  Republic. To aspire to such a nomination from the position I  hold within the party would be disloyal to the political  institution to which I owe unwavering adherence and fidelity. To  do that would be to take advantage of a situation and it would  thus be unacceptable. Such an aspiration would also violate my  personal convictions and the pledge I made when I took the oath  as president of the party's CEN.    No action is minor in the effort to strengthen and fortify  our party. The PRI's traditional roots and basic elements  demand that each of its members and leaders zealously fulfill  their duty to keep the party solid and strong. Any dispersion of  the PRI's forces will constitute a serious risk to the party's  unity and stability, especially now, when it is absolutely  necessary for us to close ranks around our principles,  loyalties, institutions, laws, and President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari. Nothing is more important for a member of the PRI --  and more so for the president of the PRI -- than to preserve and  strengthen the value that the party's unity has always held for  us. The president of the PRI must not lean in anyone's favor,  let alone in his own favor. That is all, gentlemen. Thank you  very much.</p>

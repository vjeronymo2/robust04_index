			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sharp bucks the gloomy trend in electronics Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics group, yesterday broke the gloomy trend of its domestic competitors and reported an earnings recovery for last year. It cited cost cuts across the board and a rise in sales of electronic components - where Sharp is the industry's leading maker of liquid crystal displays - as reasons for its 1.8 per cent rise in parent company pre-tax profits. Taxable profits rose to Y45.3bn (Dollars 431.4m) in the year to March, from Y44.5bn in 1992, when they had fallen 37 per cent. Turnover last year rose by 1.5 per cent to Y1,170bn, due to a 20 per cent increase in sales of components, which represented 30.5 per cent of Sharp's total sales, its biggest business area. It forecasts a 26 per cent rise in taxable profits this year, on sales up 5 per cent to Y1,230bn, on the strength of new products and stronger marketing. Sharp expects no help from the Japanese economy, where it believes political instability is delaying measures to combat the recession and providing a drag on private sector investment. It is tentatively planning on 0.4 per cent growth in Japanese gross national product this year, but company officials warn this could prove over-optimistic. Last year's turnover declined in all divisions except for components, reflecting the continued sluggishness in Japanese consumer spending and the impact of the yen's strength on export revenues, nearly half the total. Sharp, meanwhile, is ploughing cash into strengthening its liquid crystal display production. A smaller electronics industry recovery appeared yesterday in the shape of a turnround from Oki Electric Industry, the leading communications equipment producer. Oki made a pre-tax profit of Y3.88bn last year, after a Y38.33bn loss in 1992, on turnover up by 0.4 per cent over the same period, to Y565.5bn.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Management: When honesty pays off in the boardroom - How executives can avoid criticism when their salaries rise Big boardroom pay rises in Britain nearly always provoke public criticism and sometimes anger among shareholders. But companies often have only themselves to blame when the large salary rises of their senior executives hit the headlines, according to Monks Partnership, the company remuneration advisers. Monks' latest publication* details good and bad practice in company annual reports, and points out that getting the section on directors' remuneration right plainly causes some companies difficulty. Simon Rodwell, Monks' associate director, argues that much of the media criticism over the past year has arisen from misunderstandings by commentators armed with insufficient information about the components of a chairman's or highest paid director's pay. The common misconception that an increase results from a rise in base salary - rather than, say, a maturing performance-related bonus - is a case in point. 'Those companies which make full and informative disclosure of their directors' earnings generally receive a better hearing, for the simple reason that they are taking the trouble to explain actions which, in most cases, are reasonable and defensible,' says Rodwell. But he warns that 'those who choose to withhold information and surprise public and shareholders alike with a sudden, unexplained increase in their chairman's earnings, should not feel aggrieved if they get a rough ride at the AGM or in the financial columns'. Based on a survey of about 1,100 annual reports, Monks says that a growing number of companies, particularly the largest, are beginning to disclose more than the legally required minimum about boardroom pay. Full disclosure in itself is no guarantee of escaping the headlines, witness the outcry over this week's Pounds 750,000 pay-off for Laurence Cooklin, the head of Burton. Indeed, Burton is among the 40 companies whose annual reports are used by Monks as examples of good practice in the way they handle aspects of boardroom pay. The others include Boots, W H Smith, Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco, BOC, Courtaulds, Glaxo, British Gas and Welsh Water. However many companies are still failing to provide more than 'minimal disclosure' - sufficient only to meet company law, stock exchange and other requirements. Based on its survey, Monks says that while more than 80 per cent of directors are entitled to bonuses, only about one in 10 company annual reports makes even scant mention of bonus earnings. Companies like BET, British Steel and Lucas Industries provide more than the minimum legal requirement and 'are ahead of practice in the overwhelming majority of accounts,' says Monks, but are criticised for not conforming to best practice and for falling short of the recommendations of the Institutional Shareholders' Committee. The Monks report does not single out individual companies for criticism, but does contain several examples of bad practice, based on company annual reports but with altered figures to show how misunderstandings occur. Monks' report suggests guidelines for good disclosure practice designed to give shareholders and other annual report readers a clear picture of how and why directors' emoluments have changed. Total board emoluments should be divided under five headings: fees, fixed remuneration, annual bonus, longer-term bonus where applicable and pension contributions, the report says. The emoluments of the chairman or the highest paid director should also be subdivided between fixed and variable amounts and footnotes to the emoluments tables should include details of changes in board composition and explanations of performance measures used to determine bonuses. Each tranche of share options should be shown separately. *Disclosing Board Earnings in Company Annual Reports, Pounds 115 from Monks Partnership, Debden Green, Saffron Walden, Essex CB11 3LX.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / No 10 admits to row with Clinton THE British government acknowledged yesterday the strains placed on its relationship with the US by the transatlantic dispute over the west's handling of the Bosnian crisis. The admission from Downing Street, which followed US President Bill Clinton's public criticism of Britain and France, came amid fears that the row over the embargo on arms sales to the former Yugoslav province will sour the forthcoming Nato summit. President Clinton's comments, in an interview with the Washington Post, also brought a call from Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, for both sides to patch up the relationship to ensure the stability of the western alliance. The Anglo-American relationship had done more for the defence of freedom than any other alliance in the world, she said. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, echoed Lady Thatcher's words, saying 'finger pointing' between the allies served no purpose. Despite obvious irritation at President Clinton's criticism of Mr John Major, the prime minister's office sought to play down suggestions that the dispute had damaged irreparably the so-called special relationship. Officials said that Mr Major's warning to President Clinton that he could not 'sustain' his government if the US insisted on lifting the arms embargo on the former Yugoslav province was a statement of the obvious. A large majority of ministers and MPs from all parties opposed any action which would intensify the military conflict in Bosnia. In his interview President Clinton said the United Nations had erred in applying an arms embargo to Bosnia, as it gave the Serbs a major advantage. Downing Street did nothing to disguise the fundamental nature of the disagreement, even though Britain has technically not ruled out acceding eventually to removal of the arms embargo. But amid clear embarrassment at the president's decision to revive publicly the differences, British officials sought to emphasise that Bosnia was the exception rather than the rule in transatlantic relations. Mr Major's aides said that on a whole range of other issues - ranging from the Gatt world trade talks to the west's approach to Iraq and British backing for US policy in Haiti - there was clear agreement between London and Washington.</p>

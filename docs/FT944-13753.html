			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: McKechnie rises 44% and seeks acquisitions McKechnie yesterday main-tained its dividend at the same level for the sixth consecutive year despite announcing a 44 per cent annual profits increase. The plastics and metals components group announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 35.3m for the year to end-July, compared with Pounds 24.5m, and declared its intention of making acquisitions in the Pacific area, Europe and North America. 'The business needs to be developed globally,' said Mr Michael Ost, chief executive. Sharp increases in domestic sales have meant that 48 per cent of turnover comes from the UK. Profits were swollen by Pounds 3.07m of exceptional items, the net gain from the acquisition of five companies, the disposal of three and the accounting treatment of goodwill. But the underlying Pounds 32.2m was at the top end of City expectations. Earnings per share were 27.1p on headline profits and 24.7p on an underlying basis, against 21.4p. The final dividend is 9.75p, maintaining the total at 14.75p. McKechnie intends to secure dividend cover of 2 before increasing payments. Cover provided by underlying earnings is 1.7. Turnover rose to Pounds 420m (Pounds 314.4m), producing operating profits of Pounds 31.6m, against Pounds 21.7m. It was, said McKechnie, 'a good year'. This was especially the case in the second six months, when profits before interest were 44 per cent higher than in the first half. That trend appears to be continuing. 'The new financial year has shown a very satisfactory and encouraging trading situation,' the company said. The profits increase came from a combination of factors: the successful integration into its consumer products division of Savage, which produced Pounds 6.5m of operating profits, the strength of the Australian market and the elimination of plastics losses in the US during the second half. COMMENT The wind is now behind McKechnie. With the exception of the UK housing products market, it is finding trading conditions more congenial across the globe. There is the expectation of further recovery in continental Europe, plus a full year's contribution from Linread, its latest significant buy. It is also obtaining the benefits of productivity drives. So the short term outlook is bright enough to contemplate pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 42m for the current year. That would produce earnings of 30p, opening the way for patient shareholders to have a modest dividend rise. The shares are on a prospective multiple of 14.4 at yesterday's closing price of 433p. This is not particularly demanding if, in the longer term, McKechnie can build the muscle to make itself a global supplier in such sectors as automotive, aerospace and telecoms.</p>

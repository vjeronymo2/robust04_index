			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GOODEN NO PROBLEM FOR EXPOS IN 6-5 VICTORY  </P> <P> After being hammered for the second start in succession Saturday at Montreal,  it was only natural to wonder if his right shoulder was still bothering Dwight  Gooden.  </P> <P> The shoulder problem forced the New York Met pitcher to miss much of last  season.  </P> <P> Nelson Santovenia's bases-loaded double highlighted a five-run second inning  against Gooden, and the Expos went on to edge the Mets, 6-5.  </P> <P> Gooden gave up five runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings in a loss to  Pittsburgh on opening day and the same in three innings Saturday. He is 0-2,  with an earned-run average of 11.75.  </P> <P> "There is no pain in the shoulder," Gooden said after the opener. "I am  pitching freely. I just needed a longer spring, especially after missing so  much of last season."  </P> <P> Gooden was not available for comment after his second pounding. He left for  Florida, where his daughter was born Friday.  </P> <P> Manager Davey Johnson said he didn't think there was a problem with the  shoulder. "One of his problems is he's throwing too many pitches in the middle  of the plate," Johnson said. "He also may be tipping his pitches. He had that  problem last spring."  </P> <P> The Expos batted nine men in the second inning. Tim Wallach, Andres Galarraga  and Larry Walker singled before Santovenia cleared the bases with a bloop  double down the third-base line.  </P> <P> Manager Bob Rodgers of the Expos wouldn't say whether Gooden was tipping his  pitches. "All I know," he said, "is that we were hitting shots. He was throwing  hard, but his ball wasn't moving."  </P> <P> Tim Raines of the Expos stole his 586th base in the fifth inning, tying Maury  Wills for 10th on the all-time list.  </P> <P> Winning pitcher Dennis Martinez (1-0) wasn't much sharper than Gooden. In his  second start, Martinez gave up eight hits and four runs in six innings.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Mike Harkey knows he will be in the Cubs' pitching  rotation only until injured Rick Sutcliffe returns. The rookie from San Diego  intends to make the most of it.  </P> <P> Harkey, a 23-year-old right-hander in his first start since late in 1988, gave  up five hits and a run in six innings at Pittsburgh to earn his first major  league victory.  </P> <P> First baseman Sid Bream made an error that contributed to the three-run third  inning that made Harkey a winner. Harkey was 0-3 in 1988.  </P> <P> Harkey, who starred at Cal State Fullerton and was a first-round choice (fourth  player chosen) in the 1987 draft, spent most of last season on the disabled  list.  </P> <P> The Cubs are 4-1. Mitch Williams has four saves. He pitched a scoreless ninth.  </P> <P> San Diego 5, San Francisco 3 -- The Padre bullpen, after the loss of Mark  Davis, was supposed to be suspect. But in the last two games, the Giant  relievers have faltered.  </P> <P> After Eric Gunderson pitched six impressive innings and Kevin Mitchell hit his  first home run of the season, the Giants had a 3-1 lead going into the eighth.  </P> <P> The Padres got a run in the eighth inning, then tied the score on Garry  Templeton's two-out single in the ninth. They won it in the 10th on Mike  Pagliarulo's sacrifice fly off Jeff Brantley.  </P> <P> Friday night the Padres came from behind to tie on Jack Clark's home run, then  won it with five runs in the ninth inning.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 6, St. Louis 2 -- Tommy Herr, who had hit only 22 home runs in 10  seasons, hit a two-run home run in the seventh inning at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Winner Bruce Ruffin gave up six hits and two runs in 7 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Cincinnati-Atlanta -- The unbeaten Reds took a 9-4 lead in the fourth inning at  Atlanta, but the game was called because of rain.

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African gold profits 'lowest since 1960s' THE PRICE of gold has fallen by 33 per cent in real terms since 1988, taking real profits in the South African gold mining industry to the lowest level since the 1960s, Mr Naas Steenkamp, the outgoing president of the Chamber of Mines, told members yesterday. The nominal rand gold price had been virtually flat since 1988 at about R990 (Dollars 350) a troy ounce, he said. Production last year, at 601 tonnes, was only 4 tonnes lower than in 1990. But output had only been maintained by increasing the average grade mined to 5.2 grams a tonne from 5.05 grams in 1990. Mr Steenkamp praised the industry's 'quite remarkable performance' in cost containment, with the average working cost per kilogram of gold produced, at R26,136, only 1.6 per cent up from 1990. He compared this to five years previously when the comparable increase was 25 per cent. The downside of the picture was the 36,000 people who lost their jobs in the industry last year, with a further 15,000 already in 1992. Also of concern, said Mr Steenkamp, was the fact that capital expenditure and dividend payments declined by 16.9 per cent and 10.4 per cent respectively. All South Africa's other large mineral exports - coal, platinum, diamonds, zinc, copper, nickel and lead - also faced difficult markets. Despite these problems, Mr Steenkamp said he had no reason to believe that the mining industry 'will have anything but an exciting and productive future'. He is succeeded as president by Mr Bobby Godsell of Anglo American.</p>

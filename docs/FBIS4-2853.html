			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Kuo Hung-chih (6753 1347 3112): </F> "Academic Circles Challenge China's System of Party Leading the  Government"]    [Text] Mainland China's political system is characterized  by party leadership over the government, and by the blurred  boundary between the party and the government. This idea that  the party is above the state has begun to be challenged by legal  studies circles.    Mainland scholar Guo Daohui [6753 6670 2547] published an  article in the latest issue of FAXUE YANJIU [Legal Research],  entitled "Authority, Power, or Right -- Pondering Relations  Between the Party and People's Congress From a Legal  Perspective," in which he criticized the idea of the party  exercising leadership over the government. He stressed that in  a socialist country, the ruling power of the communist party is  not granted by heaven, and that the communist party is not a  leading organ above the people's congress.    Guo Daohui pointed out that the communist party's power to  lead is a kind of political rallying force, a persuasive and  influencing force, and that this kind of power to lead in terms  of political ideology is different from state power and is not a  kind of compulsory political force, nor a general restraining  force on society. He also stressed that the party's leadership  over society does not equal one-party dictatorship, and that the  party's power to lead cannot be higher than people's  sovereignty. The communist party is not the main body of state  sovereignty, and cannot directly enjoy the right to rule the  country.    Talking about the relations between the communist party and  the system of people's congresses, Guo Daohui thought that the  people's congress system has been established and has been  operating under party leadership, but this kind of leadership  cannot be understood as the party directly enjoying the state  power of the people's congress, or that the party is the supreme  organ of state power.    He also cited the amendments to the mainland's Constitution  in 1978 and 1982 as examples. In both constitutional  amendments, the words "under CPC leadership" in the sentence  "the National People's Congress is the supreme power organ under  CPC leadership" were omitted, and this indicated that the party  could not surpass the people's congress.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew at Pounds 82m but US clouds outlook SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the healthcare and consumer group, yesterday reported a 27 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 82.3m on turnover 17 per cent higher at Pounds 483m. Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said the group had achieved underlying sales growth of 8 per cent, after adjusting for currency movements and a Pounds 6m gain on the disposal of an Australian plastics business. Margins held steady at 15.8 per cent. Although many analysts said the profits for the half year to July 3 had come in at the lower end of expectations, with healthcare growth less than forecast at 9 per cent, Mr Robinson said he was pleased with the results. 'Sales and profits growth are the same as last year,' he said, 'despite worsening market conditions.' The group had also managed to reduce gearing from 25 per cent to 18 per cent, leaving the way open for substantial acquisitions within the next two years. Growth in the healthcare division during the first half had been slowed by uncertainty over health reforms in the US, where Smith &amp; Nephew makes 46 per cent of turnover. Sales of surgically related products had fallen as patients put off surgery until the government published the reforms. Mr Robinson said the number of operations in the US had fallen by as much as 10 per cent. He stressed, however, that the uncertainty was not expected to have a long-term effect on sales. 'We are confident that it will come back, but it may be a month or two before that happens,' he said. On a brighter note, northern Europe - including the UK - had performed as expected. Asia was also proving to be a high growth market. The interim dividend is lifted from 1.8p to 1.89p, payable from earnings per share of 5.1p (4.2p). COMMENT Forecasts for Smith &amp; Nephew have been downgraded from Pounds 170m to Pounds 162m pre-tax, leaving a prospective p/e of 14, as the uncertainty over its largest market seems set to cloud the short-term. Turmoil over currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism are not likely to help the group. Longer term, Smith &amp; Nephew is well placed in markets with strong growth potential - cost-effective healthcare. Most encouraging is Mr Robinson's reassurance that Smith &amp; Nephew will maintain underlying growth of about 8 per cent. Taking those factors into consideration, there might be a better time buy in the near future, but there is certainly no reason to sell.</p>

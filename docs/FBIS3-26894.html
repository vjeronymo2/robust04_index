			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Mary Binks, Political Editor] </F>   [Text] Britain and China are to return to the negotiating  table in a week to attempt to resolve differences on the  sensitive question of military sites in Hong Kong after 1997 --  an impasse which has already spanned more than seven years.    While both sides have been close to an agreement for some  months, the obstacle remains China's demand for a much bigger  naval base for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) than the one  being built on Stonecutters Island.    Joint Liaison Group (JLG) experts from the two sides will  meet for three of the four days scheduled from 22 to 25 February  in Hong Kong to resolve differences over the disposal of  military sites -- an issue which China believes goes to the  heart of its sovereignty.    The discussions will also involve military site inspections  of as yet undisclosed locations. There are up to 30 military  sites in Hong Kong. Alan Paul, who will be heading the British  team, yesterday expressed optimism over the forthcoming  discussions, saying China's agreement to three days of talks  rather than the usual two days augured well for a satisfactory  outcome.    The last bilateral meeting of defence experts, held from 21  to 23 December, made only limited progress towards an agreement  on details of future defence arrangements. China's insistence  on a bigger naval base on Stonecutters Island is based on its  argument that its size must be comparable with HMS Tamar on the  Central waterfront.    But in the last round of talks the British side stood firm  on  demands for a bigger base. It is concerned that legislators  will baulk at approving more funds to expand the site. Moving  the naval facilities from Central has already cost more than  $358 million.    JLG discussions will also focus on Britain's demand for a  guarantee from China to return to the post-1997 Special  Administrative Region (SAR) government any military sites unused  by the PLA. Another area of contention is the Chinese side's  desire to keep the married quarters currently used by British  troops as quarters for PLA officers.    The prospect of next week's meeting has raised hopes that  strained relations over the political row will not impede  co-operation on other crucial handover issues.    Sources on both sides yesterday expressed the hope that the  pace of work by the JLG might now pick up, averting the need by  Britain to take unilateral action. However, concerns remain  that talks on funding for Chek Lap Kok airport and Container  Terminal No 9 have been hindered by the political reform row.    The Chinese side is expected next week to propose a meeting  of the JLG's airport committee to discuss Britain's latest  financing proposal.</p>

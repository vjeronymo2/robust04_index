For this reason Israel must sometimes implement moves  which are aimed at having long-term effects.    Our correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i says that Brig. Gen.  Schiff  was referring to the government's decision to release security  prisoners. The military judge advocate emphasized that Israel's  present policy is not to release prisoners with blood on their  hands. Brig. Gen. Schiff spoke at a Criminology Association  conference at Bar Ilan University.</p>

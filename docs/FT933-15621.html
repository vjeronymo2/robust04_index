			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Technology: The television answers back Imagine that you could talk to your television set. If you felt like seeing an old Humphrey Bogart movie, it might suggest the Maltese Falcon or Casablanca; tell it you were in the mood for romance and Love Story would come on the air. This is the ultimate goal of a new set of interactive cable systems being introduced around the US. 'Eventually, we'll have a voice-activated device on the television that will truly make it a Captain Kirk computer,' says David Herrah, a spokesman for IBM. 'Your television will allow you to play a game with someone you've never seen before, shop for almost anything, and play movies on demand.' The arrival of multimedia may soon turn such dreams into reality. In an attempt to provide more viewer options, Tele-Communications, a Denver-based cable group, is investing Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in fibre-optic cable over the next four years. Fibre optic wires can handle 100 times the amount of information dealt with by traditional coaxial cables today. Digital compression will allow information to be compressed into tiny signals, so that the number of channels available to a Tele-Communications cable customer is set to jump from 54 to 500 over the next few years. Time Warner is also moving into a new cable television realm, aided by the regional telephone group US West's recent Dollars 2.5bn purchase of a 25 per cent stake in the company's movie studio and cable television assets. Time Warner will take advantage of digital compression to maximise the number of options offered. Unlike Tele-Communications, Time Warner will rely on traditional coaxial wires to deliver its cable products. Instead of investing in fibre-optics, the company is betting its money on a digital movie 'library' large enough to store 500, two-hour motion pictures. This service will move cable television closer to its goal of 'video on demand', a service allowing each customer to access through a cable menu any number of entertainment sources and have the ability to pause, rewind and fast-forward the tape. Time Warner's new service should also allow customers to play video games with other subscribers, engage in home shopping from a menu of catalogues, use video-conferencing services, connect to a long-distance telephone service and receive educational instruction at home. 'Our system will be the first truly multimedia service,' says Michael Luftman, head of corporate communications for Time Warner Cable. Once an interactive cable system is up and running, the services should quickly become more sophisticated. Video games, for instance, may soon be played in full-motion video and with three-dimensional graphics. Home shopping services could widen their scope to include aeroplane tickets and investment plans. 'In the not too distant future, you'll be able to view a hologram of yourself on screen, wearing the clothing item you're interested in purchasing,' claims IBM's Herrah. 'And you may not be surprised to hear the television telling you that you'd look better in another colour.'</p>

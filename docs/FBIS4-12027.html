			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 Apr (MENA)--Sources from the Palestinian  and Israeli delegations have agreed that substantial differences  are impeding the current negotiations in Cairo to implement the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    The sources said that these negotiations are going through  "a  crisis," despite some positive statements.    The Palestinian sources told MENA that the Israeli side  continues to refuse to draw up a definite timetable for the  withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.  They added that the Israeli side is also refusing to draw up a  timetable for the entry of the Palestinian police and  specifications for the type of weapons to be used by this force.    The Palestinian sources went on to say that the Israeli  side,  which has mainly used civilian negotiators with the exception of  Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, wants to ignore the  Palestinian military commanders' view of the security and  military situation in Gaza and Jericho. They added that these  commanders are demanding a definite timetable for the entry of  their main forces into the Palestinian self-rule area in the  Gaza Strip and Jericho area. They are also demanding an  agreement on the type of weapons needed for these forces to  achieve security in the areas from which Israel will withdraw.</p>

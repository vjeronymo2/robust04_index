			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yi Chong-yon, editorial director of SEOUL </F> SINMUN]    [Text] We could hear, in the early stage, sporadic reports  on Washington's quite strong countermeasures to North Korea's  irritating nuclear game [haek norum] of stalling for time by  going in and out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]  for almost the past year.    The United States has made a strategic conclusion  [chollyakchogin mamurirul chikko] by deciding to overlook the  past, whether or not North Korea currently possesses nuclear  weapons, and not to allow its additional production of nuclear  weapons from now on. At the same time, it decided to deploy  Patriot missiles to the U.S. forces stationed in the ROK. This  seems to be the first-step countermeasure mapped out by  Washington with no other particular idea.    I do not know whether the ROK's invariable principle on and  concrete countermeasures to the North Korean nuclear game are  what have already been tuned by the ROK and the United States,  but I know from reports that Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has  successfully persuaded Washington to attempt a peaceful approach  to the issue. North Korea, however, is a group that believes in  a logic based on strength, and it only forces its negotiation  partner not supported by strength to make endless concessions.  We know this well through experience.    I am concerned about our easy-going attitude just like  adjusting our neckties without recognizing that our trouser legs  are getting wet in the rain dropping from the "imitation nuclear  umbrella [yusa haek usan]" carried by North Korea as we are  accustomed to the comfort of the protection under the large U.S.  nuclear umbrella.    Regarding our government's position, Minister Han Sung-chu  said in New York: "Our government does not care even if North  Korea possesses nuclear weapons now. The nuclear weapons it  possesses can be abolished [pyegi] or dismantled [haeche], like  those of South Africa. Our government's negotiations with North  Korea are not aimed at inquiring into the past, but will focus  on North Korea's future intent." If North Korea had already  been acquitted for its possession of nuclear weapons only by  going in and out of the NPT over the issue regarding the method  of inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],  without mentioning whether it possesses nuclear weapons or not,  it would be needless to even predict if it is possible to  abolish or dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons in the future.    Minister Han's remarks that our government does not care  about the past seem to be an iteration of the U.S. policy, not  our government's own idea or countermeasure. The U.S.  countermeasure is considered a strategic arrangement linked to  its far-reaching scheme to pave the way for the 21st century,  foreseeing the future of Northeast Asia. The United States  never wants its influence upon the Korean peninsula, including  North Korea, to be weakened, nor will it allow China, Russia, or  Japan to hold sway over Northeast Asia. I think we need to  seriously study [koryo] if it is the best strategy in the  reality we face now to accept and follow this countermeasure  based on the U.S. strategy.    Although it seems that the United States has put forward  such countermeasures against North Korea on the assumption that  either special inspection or simultaneous inspection of the  North and South would not be easily carried out, it is possible  for us -- who are the party concerned to separately hold  negotiations with North Korea -- to be placed in a difficult  position when we agree upon the proposal.    What is important here is, I think, that we need to  carefully  watch out the IAEA's attitude toward North Korea. The IAEA led  by Director-General Hans Blix, who served as Swedish foreign  minister, has adhered to its strong position that it would not  make an exception of the nuclear inspections of North Korea in  accordance with the basic principle that contributes to  maintaining global peace, as well as to ensuring nuclear  nonproliferation throughout the world. Also, it has raised an  objection to the United States' attitude to be flexible in  dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue in order to maintain  its continual influence against North Korea and to keep the  continuity of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which will be  terminated in 1995. North European member-countries -- such as  Norway and Sweden, including Director-General Hans Blix himself  -- have said that although the socialist ruling parties were in  sympathy with North Korea at one time when they were in power,  there were some points upon which they had doubts about North  Korea because of its power system character, continuous tricks,  and stickiness on the nuclear weapon program. They have also  continued their consistent demands that North Korea abide by the  IAEA's basic principles. France's L'ARMEMENT has carried an  editorial saying that "we must not be optimistic about the  future of the North Korean nuclear issue mainly because North  Korea has accepted nuclear inspections, but rather be aware that  the only resolute and consistent attitude is the very effective  factor in maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula." Despite  such editorials by the French paper, South Korea, which is  directly threatened by North Korea, has been hesitant to resolve  the nuclear issue. We wonder if the government has really a  firm policy or consistent and basic principle to cope with the  North Korean nuclear issue.    Considering the fact that North Korea's nuclear threat may  be  continuously offensive against us, we must take our action and,  with it, make North Korea become aware that their nuclear weapon  development will be an intolerable burden to them. Judging from  the ongoing contacts between the ROK and the United States to  deal with the North Korean nuclear issue or the ROK people's  feeling against it, however, I don't think it is possible for  the government to take any action against North Korea.    Under this reality, the ROK's dependency upon the United  States cannot but be continuously deepened. The government must  know, however, that there are some people who regard the United  States as an unwelcome friendly country. We must pay attention  to it.    Also, we must keep in our mind the fact that we can avoid  making repeated mistakes only if we fully learn something from  our history. We must not develop our demands into the senseless  stickiness to the nuclear issue, but instead remember the fact  that the agreements reached between the North and South have  been so far kept in dead storage. Therefore, we can say that  "there are only broken agreements between the North and South at  present."</p>

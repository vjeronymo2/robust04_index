			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Arts: The Palace that Nash built - The architectural delights awaiting visitors to Buckingham Palace As the doors of Buckingham Palace open to the general public for the first time, it is a good moment to look at the architectural quality of London's royal quarter. Visitors who stand in the inevitable queue for their admission tickets in The Mall will find themselves on the very spot which was, until the early years of this century, the centre of an architectural debate about the appropriate metropolitan setting for the British monarchy. Looking westwards down The Mall today towards the familiar balcony front of the palace what we see is the solid, unsmiling imperial world of 1913. King Edward VII's wish to commemorate his mother's reign led to a national competition and public appeal in 1901 for the Queen Victoria Memorial. This was won by Sir Aston Webb and there were sufficient funds left over for the refronting of Buckingham Palace - a cover-up in Portland stone of the crumbling facade that Edward Blore had designed for Queen Victoria. This heavyweight axial arrangement at palace end of The Mall is matched by the re-ordering carried out at the Trafalgar Square end where Sir Aston Webb built the Admiralty Arch in 1910. The joyous revelation that has been made possible by the opening of the palace to the public will be the rediscovery of the world of King George IV and his architect John Nash that still lies behind the somewhat rigid and reserved public face of the palace. King George V appreciated Sir Aston Webb's efforts to make the palace appear shipshape, and knighted Sir Thomas Brock on the spot for his 13-foot high solid marble figure of Queen Victoria, but it was the earlier King George who was responsible for supporting the artistic and architectural achievement of Nash which can now be shared by the public. When the Prince Regent became King George IV at the age of 58 in 1820, there was a sense manifested at his coronation that he represented a victorious and thriving nation. It was felt that the effectiveness of the monarchy as a symbol of national pride would be conveyed with more conviction if it could be associated with a metropolitan palace of distinction. St. James's had long been considered poverty-stricken, Kensington Place too modest, Hampton Court and Greenwich too far away, and Carlton House too close to the street and not grand enough for a monarch. The nearest thing to a palace was undoubtedly Buckingham House, which King George III had purchased in 1762 and settled upon his consort. It occupied large grounds and had important family associations, as all George IV's brothers and sisters had been born there. This was the house the king decided to expand and virtually rebuild with Nash's help. There is no doubt that King George IV and John Nash shared a vision of London as an important and beautiful European capital. The construction of Regent Street, the laying out of Regent's Park, and the replacement of Carlton House by the great stucco Carlton House Terraces, are all part of this vision. The picturesque arrangement of St. James's Park is largely the design of Nash and it brought a particular relaxed Englishness to the palatial formality he was to build on the site of Buckingham House. Summer visitors to the palace will enter by a side door but will soon find themselves in Nash's quadrangle which they will cross to enter the state apartments through Nash's grand entrance portico. The original Nash palace was a three-sided building open to The Mall, and roughly where the gates are today stood the Marble Arch as a triumphal entry to the royal domain. It is worth remembering that the architect had the restraining bones of old Buckingham House to deal with, which had been added to but was never really seen as a palace. Also, he was always under financial scrutiny and his client had the reputation of letting money slip through his fingers with remarkable ease. Despite all this Nash achieved a suite of state rooms that is one of the architectural secrets of Europe. Although some of their decoration has been modified the major rooms (with the exception of the Picture Gallery) can be seen as largely Nash's creation. The rooms with their furniture represent the final flowering of the king's Francophile taste and reflect also the influence of Charles Long, Lord Farnborough, who was the eminence grise behind all George IV's building projects. What visitors will enjoy is the very high standard of craftsmanship and sculpture in all the rooms. Nash rightly brought to the palace the best carvers, sculptors and craftsmen he could find. Each room is both dignified and rich: the Green Drawing Room and the Throne Room on the courtyard side have a ceremonial distinction that sets them apart from some of the more relaxed but equally rich rooms on the garden side. Nash was good at smaller rooms, too, and at arranging for a sense of theatre as visitors progress from the low-ceilinged ground floor rooms to the grand staircase and the remarkable mirrored enfilade of the state rooms. Originally George IV had intended Buckingham Palace to be his private London residence while he used the refurbished state rooms of St James's Palace for his Court functions and ceremonials. It was his buoyant enthusiasm for Nash's new palace that brought about the decision to use it as a state palace. It was this decision that was responsible for the immense enrichment of the state rooms, especially the elaboration of their gilded ceilings. It is important to remember that it is the Edwardian redecoration of Buckingham Palace that gives it that overall air of red, white and gold. When Nash had completed his work there was more colour, more silk on the walls and a less institutional feel to much of the palace. To see the state rooms today is still an immense thrill because they represent one of the most original architectural achievements in any European palace; they retain to a degree that particular sense of English splendour that is both low-key and sumptuous.</p>

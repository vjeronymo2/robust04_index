			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURT HEARS APPEAL OF EX-ACLU OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Two-thirds of the way through a prepared talk, speaker Linda Valentino broke  from remarks on the abuses of police surveillance and abruptly asked a man in  the audience: "Would you care to comment on that, Officer Long?"  </P> <P> Stunned, participants at the 1980 public conference turned toward the subject  target of her gibe: Sgt. Richard T. Long, a Newport Beach police community  relations officer who would later be branded a "spy" by organizers of the  American Civil Liberties Union event.  </P> <P> Valentino's query eventually led to the police officer's departure from the  conference -- after what he described as the humiliation and intimidation of  having been singled out and being the target of verbal abuse.  </P> <P> And on Friday, state appellate justices in Santa Ana were asked to decide  whether that confrontation was a protected expression of free speech by angered  ACLU members or a clear case of discrimination in excluding a police officer  from a public meeting.  </P> <P> In oral arguments before the 4th District Court of Appeal, attorneys for  Valentino, a former board member in the Southern California chapter of the  organization, and former ACLU staff attorney Rees Lloyd, who also was at the  1980 meeting, implored the court to overturn the award made in Orange County  Superior Court in 1987 in favor of Long. The appellate court did not rule on  the matter. Long won a $20,000 judgment in the Superior Court trial, and the  court had later ordered the ACLU of Southern California to pay Long about  $72,000 in legal expenses. Last year, the group paid Long $35,000 to settle its  portion of the claim, marking the first time that the champion of civil  liberties had ever paid damages to settle a violation of rights claim against  it. But Valentino and Lloyd, who as individuals were co-defendants in the suit,  broke ranks with the ACLU and decided to appeal.  </P> <P> In court Friday, their attorneys painted the case as nothing less than a  critical test of citizens' right to stand up to Big Brother and express  themselves.  </P> <P> "The fact that it happens to be a public meeting doesn't mean that the  government can sit there among us and record what we say and do," argued Hugh  Manes, the attorney for Lloyd. Manes maintained that Long "tried to sneak into"  the publicly advertised meeting, perhaps in an attempt to "distort"  participants' comments in a report back to Newport Beach police. Manes also  argued that the presence of unannounced police officers or other government  officials at meetings, even public ones, amounts to government surveillance and  could have a "chilling effect" on open discussion.  </P> <P> But his argument drew open skepticism from Associate Justice Thomas F. Crosby  Jr. Crosby suggested that by Manes' reasoning, police officers could be barred  from a host of public places or meetings. "How's a policeman supposed to know  what public meetings he can go to?" Crosby said.  </P> <P> In response to the claim that the defendants were merely exercising their  rights to free speech, Crosby said later: "You didn't say" to Long that "  'you're a lousy scumbag policeman and I hate all of you'; you said, 'Get out of  the meeting.' "  </P> <P> Long has acknowledged that he was acting in an official capacity, on  instructions from the police chief and with approval for overtime pay, when he  attended the ACLU Legislative Conference on Oct. 11, 1980, in Newport Beach. He  paid a fee, but he did not sign the conference register.  </P> <P> Long, who was wearing street clothes, took about 10 pages of notes and  tape-recorded portions of the discussions throughout the day, according to  testimony at the trial. He said that the reason he attended and was recording  the sessions was that he was trying to get a better idea of the community's  concerns about law enforcement.  </P> <P> The conference, which came shortly after a public outcry over police spying in  Los Angeles and elsewhere, became heated after Valentino made Long's presence  known to the group. Several participants demanded to know what the officer was  doing at the conference. After a verbal confrontation with Lloyd, Long left.  </P> <P> ACLU officials maintain that although they loudly voiced their displeasure  about the officer's presence, he was never explicitly ordered to leave or  forcibly removed the meeting.  </P> <P> But Long testified at the Superior Court trial: "It was just awful. These  people are shouting things at you. You got people sticking their finger in your  face. You got accusations. . . . I was incensed by what they'd done, and I  mean, I had this vision of my career crashing and burning.  </P> <P> "I was embarrassed. I was humiliated by these people. You got all these people  sitting there looking at you like you done something wrong. . . . I wanted out  of there. I wanted to go home."  </P> <P> Long's attorney, Jeffrey M. Epstein, argued in court Friday that the ACLU  members at the conference were in effect engaged in "a conspiracy . . . to try  and embarrass and drive Richard Long from there."  </P> <P> In the 1987 trial verdict, Lloyd was held liable for about $46,000 in damages  to Long, and Valentino for $4,100. Valentino said that if the verdict is  upheld, the ACLU will pay her share of the damages. But the money is not the  issue, Valentino said.  </P> <P> "It's the principle," she said after Friday's arguments were heard. "If the  court upholds this verdict, it's the first time someone has been held liable  for civil damages for exercising protected speech to a government official."  </P></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Edinburgh award takes on business THE Duke of Edinburgh award scheme, which operates in more than 50 countries, is branching out into the business world and getting a facelift in the process. The London design company Basten Greenhill Andrews (BGA) has designed a new logo and a new element in the award - the Charter for Business  - was launched yesterday. It is a response to companies which are increasingly calling for business-oriented skills from young school leavers. The original scheme started in 1956 and so far about 1.25m participants have been awarded badges and certificates. Participants undertake voluntary activities for the completion of which they may win bronze, silver or gold awards - as well as a claim to personal achievement. The scheme is almost entirely funded by business contributions, including membership fees to an exclusive golf club. Last year Pounds 4m all told was raised. Ten companies - Mars, Rover, Glaxo, Kwik-Fit, Bernard Matthews, Halina, Compaq, Littlewoods, Philips and TNT - have joined the new Charter for Business to promote it in the workplace. For the past 18 months Mr Jim Andrews, BGA's managing director, has worked with Mr Robin Wight, chairman of the advertising agency WCRS, Mr Bob Clarke, chairman of the business film production company Visage, and the scheme's small staff to attract business support. The companies have undertaken to recruit 100,000 new young people from business as members of the award scheme over the next five years. They have committed themselves to promoting, supporting and developing the scheme. Mr Andrews hopes that more companies will join. According to Mr Eric Worrell, deputy chairman of the scheme, the companies did not wish to disclose what cash they were putting into the new charter. 'But they have all been very supportive,' he said. The companies had various reasons for joining the scheme. Some were 'genuinely philanthropic' and others worried about their own young employees. All were keen to employ people who could demonstrate personal initiative and tenacity. 'The gold award means giving up two hours a week for two years, and the great thing about it is that it is something young people do in their own time,' Mr Worrell said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Teodora Encheva] </F>   [Text] On 13 March an expanded plenum of the BSP  [Bulgarian Socialist Party] discussed the party's program for  the 41st BSP Congress. The OSD [Alliance for Social Democracy],  ASO [Alternative Socialist Association], "Marxist Alternative,"  and "Road to Europe" groups expressed their views on the draft  political document prepared by the Center for Strategic Analyses  and Studies. Only the OSD presented its own program in written  form. It will be disseminated in the same way as the draft  document proposed by the "strategist Lilov." Lilov reprimanded  those who unthinkingly reject the "Chinese model" of socialism.  The BSP is a party of the poor, not of the destitute, he said.  We are also defenders of the emerging "middle class," he added  at the end of his speech. According to him, the transition in  Bulgaria should take 20 years. First, he said, the country has  to emerge from the grave economic and social crisis; second, it  must adapt to the new "postindustrial" trends in the world.    Today we are discussing a party document, not state  policies,  his opponent [OSD leader] Chavdar Kyuranov pointed out.  According to the OSD social democrats, the BSP center's program  rediscovered the ideas of Khrushchev, Ataturk, and Mao, and the  document's philosophy ignored the problem of property ownership.  According to them, Lilov deliberately used the word "failure"  instead of "collapse" with reference to the fate of the  societies of real socialism. An OSD expert told STANDART NEWS  that he predicts that the BSP will tolerate the postcommunist  thinking of its present strategist for another five years at the  very most, adding that time alone will turn the Socialists into  Social Democrats.    The next plenum is to appoint a commission to work on all  the  draft versions of the party program and will also fix the date  of the 41st BSP Congress.</p>

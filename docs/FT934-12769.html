			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Dutch insurer suffers as claims soar RECESSION in Europe has bitten deep into the activities of NCM Holdings, the Dutch-controlled export credit insurance group, according to interim figures, writes David Dodwell. As claims soared by 56 per cent during the first nine months of this year, from Fl 189.9bn to Fl 310.7bn (Dollars 164bn), premium income rose by a modest 5 per cent, from FL 415.8bn to Fl 437.7bn. This boosted the company's 'claims ratio' from 42 per cent of premium income in 1992 to 69 per cent in the first nine months of this year.</p>

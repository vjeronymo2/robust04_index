			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 19 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin today sent greetings to the organizers of the  All-Russia Days of Protection Against Ecological Danger. The  text of the message has been issued by the president's press  service:    "To the organizers of, and participants in, the All-Russia  Days of Protection against Ecological Danger;    The All-Russia Days of Protection Against Ecological Danger  are taking place in our country for the first time, from 15  April to 5 June 1994. I wholeheartedly welcome the initiative  to stage them.    I regard the action as timely and necessary.    Protection of the natural environment is one of the Russian  state's priority tasks. To ensure ecological safety, the  government is drawing up a long-term state strategy that  envisages widespread use of the vast potential of Russia's  military-industrial complex. I think it will also be useful to  have special ecological subunits within the Russian Army that  will be able not only to eliminate the serious ecological  consequences of their activities, but also to clean up  industrially polluted areas, especially in ecological disaster  zones.    It is our common duty to combine our efforts and do  everything possible to see that our towns and villages are  green, and that the air, land, and water at our places of work,  in our enterprises, around our own homes and throughout our  motherland are pure. Russia needs a program of ecological  regeneration. Such a program can only be drawn up by the whole  of society--the government, parliament, entrepreneurs, parties,  scientists, and public ecological organizations. I support the  idea of convening an all-Russia congress on ecology and  environmental protection to adopt such a program.    Having inherited our native natural conditions from our  ancestors, we, the people of Russia, are obliged to bequeath  them to our children and grandchildren in all their original  beauty. I sincerely hope that the All-Russia Days of Protection  Against Ecological Danger will help us all to recognize the  importance and responsibility of this task.    I wish you success, dear friends, in the noble cause of  preserving Russia's natural environment.    [signed] B. Yeltsin."</p>

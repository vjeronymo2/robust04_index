			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Boost to Japan's economy delayed Yesterday's Japanese political fiasco further delays government plans for an urgently needed Y13,000bn (Pounds 78bn) spending and tax reduction package, which was expected early next week. Securities houses are accordingly bracing themselves for a fall in share prices when the Tokyo market, closed by the time the vote came through, opens on Monday. It was unclear last night when the government would be able to table the package, and whether parliament would find time to legislate on the draft proposals. 'It just means more delay and uncertainty,' said Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, will meanwhile be bracing himself for an awkward meeting tomorrow with Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, who has decided to add Japan to a round-the-world tour, to urge Tokyo to make progress in stimulating the economy. The vote also casts a shadow over next week's two-day meeting between US and Japanese officials in Washington on how to reduce Tokyo's stubbornly high trade surplus. Japan's political confusion will encourage a stronger yen, because continued weakness of domestic demand will contribute to a wide trade surplus, said Tokyo economists. That will provide an extra drag on Japan's export-oriented economy. The delay of the economic package will encourage bonds to strengthen, since it puts pressure on the Bank of Japan to trim official interest rates in the absence of other measures to stimulate the economy, economists said. In London yesterday the dollar fell sharply against the yen in response to the vote, falling from a London close of Y111.510 on Thursday to under Y110 before recovering to close at Y111.210. Analysts said the late recovery was probably the result of traders selling off profitable yen positions. By late yesterday in London, the Japanese government bond future on Liffe was up a  1/2 -point from Thursday's close at 115.98. The markets had until yesterday bargained on a package said by government officials to be potentially worth more than Y13,000bn. That would be the fourth economic stimulus since August 1992, worth just over Y30,000bn so far. The Y13,200bn plan was expected to include tax cuts worth Y6,000bn-Y7,000bn, plus Y5,000bn of public works spending and government land purchases.</p>

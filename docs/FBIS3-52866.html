The team held talks in Damascus yesterday with Syrian  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'.    Meanwhile, Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im  Qasim has denied that Hizballah officials met with the U.S.  Congressional team in Damascus to discuss the issue of the  Israeli soldiers. Shaykh Qasim said that Hizballah is against  meeting with any U.S. team because the Americans are a party to  the problem, like Israel, and therefore are not qualified [to  mediate].</p>

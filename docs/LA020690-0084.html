			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX REPORT SAYS RICH GAINED, POOR LOST DURING '80S  </P> <P> In a finding that could undermine President Bush's plan to cut capital gains  taxes, a House committee report said Monday that during the 1980s, the rich  paid lower taxes on more income, while the poor felt a sharper tax bite.  </P> <P> The report, based on Congressional Budget Office and other agency studies, is  to be released today by the House Ways and Means Committee at a hearing where  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Budget Director Richard G. Darman are  scheduled to testify.  </P> <P> The report shows that the effective tax rate for the poorest 20% of American  families rose 16.1% during the 1980s while real income rose 3.2%.  </P> <P> During the same period, it says, the effective tax rate for the richest 20% of  families dropped by 5.5% while their real income rose 31.7%.  </P> <P> That statistic and others in the report could add fuel to Democratic claims  that wealthier Americans, who would benefit most from a capital gains tax cut,  do not need or deserve another tax break.  </P> <P> Some Democrats opposed to capital gains tax cuts have proposed tax breaks they  say would benefit more middle-income families instead, such as a reduction in  the Social Security payroll tax.  </P> <P> For those Americans in the top 5% of earners, the report says their income rose  from more than 15 times the poverty level in 1980 to an estimated 22.5 times  the poverty level in 1990 -- a 46.1% increase.  </P> <P> "The story of the '80s is that the rich did well and that the poor lost  ground," said one Ways and Means Committee staff member who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> Last year, in a bitter partisan battle that stalled vital budget-related  legislation for months, Senate Democrats defeated Bush's plan to lower the tax  rate on capital gains, which had passed the tax-writing Ways and Means  Committee and the full House.  </P></p>

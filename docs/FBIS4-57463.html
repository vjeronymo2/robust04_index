			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News"] </F>   [Text] The finance minister explained that he hopes the IMF  mission, which will begin a two-week visit on Tuesday to discuss  with Venezuelan experts the behavior of the economy in the first  100 days of the current administration, will issue a  satisfactory appraisal of the measures taken. He admitted that  differences of opinion might arise over the nonapplication of  the VAT [value-added tax] and the increase in gasoline prices,  which, he reiterated, might take place at the beginning of 1995  following a study on subsidies for mass transportation. Sosa  Rodriguez said that if the IMF concludes that the international  reserves have been handled correctly, it would have a very  positive psychological effect on the country's economy.    [Begin Sosa recording] Our reserves are at quite a  satisfactory level. It is true that operational reserves have  dropped this year, but they are at a satisfactory level for any  country. Now then, because we have a type of psychosis coupled  with a destabilization process involving rumors, telephone  calls, and so forth, there is speculation in the market.  Obviously, if we had the IMF backing us, those speculators or  rumormongers would have a more difficult time. [end recording]    [Briceno] The minister also said the slight upsurge in  petroleum prices, which will bring approximately 100 billion  bolivares in revenue, will have a favorable effect next year and  in 1996 to balance the fiscal deficit. The finance minister also  said the World Bank has recommended that some of its experts  advise FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund]  and the Banking Superintendency in resolving the management  problems of the banks that are being assisted and that are now  owned by the state.</p>

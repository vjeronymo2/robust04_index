			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Peru to sell off state airline PERUVIAN state airline Aeroperu will be sold to the private sector within the next 60 days, according to an announcement on Sunday by Copri, the privatisation commission. A further 13 wholly or partially state-owned companies will also be privatised in the same period. These include the chain of filling stations owned by Petroperu, liquid gas company Solgas, the Conchan oil refinery, Petrolera Transoceanica and the El Pacifico chemical company. The state will also sell its entire holdings in the local Bayer chemical company and in Cementos Lima. Companies are to be sold either through the Lima stock exchange or by public auction. Copri emphasises that the procedure will be public, transparent and honest. The government also announced the forthcoming privatisation of Petroleos del Mar (Petromar). Petromar was formed to exploit the oilfields formerly belonging to US-owned Belco after its 1986 expropriation. The government of President Alberto Fujimori recently reached a settlement with Belco's insurers, American Insurance Group, over a long-standing claim. Revenue from the Petromar privatisation will be used in part compensation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Platkovskiy report: "Clinton the Businessman at </F> Loggerheads With Clinton the Democrat. Most-Favored-Nation  Status Given to China, But Not Russia"]    [Text] After agonizing reflection, President Clinton has  adopted a decision to extend China's most-favored-nation [MFN]  status in trade. He also intends to give up the policy of  linking trade with the state of human rights in China altogether.    The president was subjected to powerful pressure from both  sides. Human rights lobbyists demanded that Beijing be taught  about civilized norms of behavior. The financial-industrial  lobby warned of increased unemployment in the United States if  multibillion Chinese orders were lost. Overcoming an inner  divide, Bill Clinton nevertheless came to the conclusion that  economic interests are more important than democratic principles.    Most-favored-nation status releases trade between two  countries from barriers in the form of duties and tariffs. In  the Americans' estimation, refusal to extend the status  (following the events on Tiananmen Square, a procedure for  renewing this status is conducted every year) would entail  irreparable damage to American companies' positions in the  Chinese market. U.S.-PRC trade turnover last year was over 27  billion. Boeing, for example, obtained fantastic profits by  selling China the most airplanes. American manufacturers are  counting on being able to secure very major deals with China,  whose import demand in the next five years is estimated at $400  billion.    A year ago Bill Clinton made a commitment to secure progress  from Beijing in terms of the observance of human rights. In the  past few months the Chinese authorities have released a number  of dissidents. But at the same time, as our Beijing  correspondent Vladimir Skosyrev reports, new arrests have been  made. The fate of Wei Jingsheng, the civil rights activist who  is the most popular in the West, and who disappeared from  Beijing two months ago, is unknown.    American human rights activists are angry at the President's  unprincipled attitude, pointing out that the Beijing leadership  is doing nothing to initiate democratization. This subject is  not fashionable in the major Washington offices at the moment.  They are more concerned about how to use partnership with China  to strengthen the U.S. position in Asia and worldwide. American  diplomats are also counting on the hope that Beijing will help  them cope with the unruly Kim Il-song, who is developing his own  nuclear weapons.    Meanwhile all the indications are that the developing  cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is causing a certain  amount of concern in Washington. Russian business is obviously  no competition against American business in the Chinese market.  However, the weapons trade and stepped-up contacts between the  Chinese and Russian military are making the Americans nervous.    Moscow is denied privileges that China has in trade with the  United States. Russia has still not been granted  most-favored-nation status.</p>

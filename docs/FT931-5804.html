			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / People: Taylor to combine Textiles roles Sir Christopher Hogg, an adviser to the Cadbury committee on corporate governance which recommended that the roles of chairman and chief executive be split, is handing the chairmanship of Courtaulds Textiles to current chief executive Martin Taylor. 'Cadbury is not doctrinaire on the subject,' Hogg argues. 'Actually, I'm not in favour of combining the offices. I did it myself for ten years at Courtaulds; for the first half of that period the argument for it was very strong, in the second half, much less so.' The decision to make 40-year-old Taylor chairman appears largely to have been dictated by the fact that the obvious candidate, non-executive director Antony Hichens, who becomes deputy chairman instead, had made clear he was unavailable. 'First, he has an enormous amount on his plate,' says Hogg, 'and moreover, whereas he felt very comfortable making sure there was no abuse of power, he thought that after three years on the board he did not know enough about the industry to be able to supply the strategic vision required of a chairman.' Hichens is chairman of MB-Caradon and Y J Lovell Holdings, and has some ten other non-executive directorships. Of Taylor, a Courtaulds highflyer and former Financial Times journalist, Hogg adds: 'Martin is less of a potential power-abuser than anyone I can think of.' Taylor, for his part, contends Hichens is one of the most forceful non-executives he has met - 'marvellous and terrifying'. The sudden death of 53-year-old Ian Rae has prompted further boardroom changes, with Andrew Harrison, 35, presently finance director, moving to take charge of home furnishings and the UK branded clothing business, Rae's domain. 'It was perfectly clear to me he would either become the finance director of a much larger company or run a business,' says Taylor, who acknowledges that Rae's death forced his hand, and that he had been planning initially to give Harrison a slightly smaller 'line' job than the current assignment. Harrison is replaced by Pippa Wicks, 30, who joined from Bain &amp; Company, also Harrison's training ground, two years ago as business development manager. As if he were not busy enough, Taylor meanwhile signals that he will shortly pick up his first outside directorship - of an FT-SE 100 company in an unrelated business.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Correspondent L. Panova] Before leaving for Sofia  today, in an exclusive interview given to Vesti, Vladimir  Shumeyko, head of the Russian parliament's upper chamber and  chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, said that  everything necessary should be done in order to ensure that  former Union republics that are now independent CIS countries  could integrate together again as soon as possible.    [Begin Shumeyko recording] Many people can say here:  Interesting, first the Union was destroyed, and now it is being  pieced together. The thing is that the Soviet Union was a  monolithic state supported by a single axis of authority--the  CPSU. The party that used to make decisions on everything and  for everybody does not exist today. Bulgaria and Poland were  regarded as being so close to us that it was sufficient for the  CPSU to make a decision on giving aid, sending a delegation,  starting to build a factory or something else, and all this was  implemented. [end recording]    [Panova] Bulgaria's and Poland's historical closeness still  exists, Vladimir Shumeyko believes, but legislative decisions  are needed in relations with that Far Abroad in order to unite  states again as closely as possible in economic and political  integration.    [Begin Shumeyko recording] Our parliamentary delegation  which  is going at insistent requests from the Polish and Bulgarian  parliaments is of a state nature. During these few days we will  try once again to identify all our points of contact. For  instance, 10 Russian regions have direct links with Bulgaria.  They should be backed at a state and legislative level in order  to integrate together again. [end recording]</p>

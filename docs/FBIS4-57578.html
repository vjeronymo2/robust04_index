			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Montevideo, 19 May (EFE) -- Agriculture and  commerce ministers from 14 countries with efficient agricultural  production began a two-day meeting in Montevideo today to review  the Uruguay Round of GATT talks after the signing of the  protocols in Marrakech on 15 April.    The meeting was opened at the Latin American Integration  Association (ALADI) headquarters. In their initial speeches,  the Cairns Group ministers confirmed their countries'  willingness to play a significant role in the agricultural  reform required by the international trade system.    The ministers also confirmed the task of monitoring  compliance with the GATT agreements reached during the Uruguay  Round, which recently ended, marked by controversy over the  issue of agriculture, as countries of efficient production were  pitted against the developed nations, which subsidize the  production of agricultural commodities. [passage omitted]    The opening session was inaugurated by Pedro Saravia, the  Uruguayan livestock, agriculture, and fishing minister;  Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan; and ALADI Secretary  General Antonio Antunes, a Brazilian citizen.    Antunes welcomed the participating delegations. He  acknowledged the significance of the Uruguay Round of the GATT  talks in achieving fairer and more stable trade standards. The  ALADI secretary said: "The Latin American integration process is  based on the fact that this region must competitively and  dynamically join the world. To this effect, the multilateral  trade system must be more honest."    Antunes noted that the subregional systems "are playing a  leading role in the current Latin American integration process  and, with their own profiles and programs, are also contributing  to a freer and more credible multilateral trade system." Antunes  emphasized: "The implementation and extent of the modest and  difficult process of agricultural reform agreed upon in the  Uruguay Round will only become apparent at the beginning of the  21st century." In conclusion, Antunes said: "The Cairns Group's  role and joint negotiating actions will therefore be extremely  significant for our countries and for slowly and gradually  opening the gates to a market without barriers and without  discrimination." [passage omitted]    The Cairns Group understands that its intermediary role in  the agricultural negotiations to reconcile the U.S. and European  Union positions has not been fully completed.</p>

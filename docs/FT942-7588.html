			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / MPs to step up attack on PIA Pressure on Mr Joe Palmer, chairman of the planned watchdog to protect the private investor, is set to increase today with the publication of a report from the cross-party Commons Treasury committee. The MPs' report on the Personal Investment Authority, which is due to become operational in mid July, contains highly critical comments. However, the government's continued backing for the PIA was underlined yesterday by Mr Anthony Nelson, a junior Treasury minister. He said that it was time for independent financial advisers to press ahead with their applications to join the new regulator. The strength of the criticisms was signalled by one MP who had not taken part in the questioning of the PIA chairman by the committee. 'I think Mr Palmer will be forced to resign after he reads our criticism of the PIA,' he said. It appears that the risk that the committee might split along party lines, undermining the force of its recommendations, led Tory members to agree to toughen the report's criticism of the PIA after what was described as an 'acrimonious' meeting on Monday. Mr Palmer and Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, appeared twice before the committee during its inquiry into financial regulation. Mr Palmer came under fire from Labour members for the regulatory record of Legal &amp; General of which he was formerly chief executive.</p>

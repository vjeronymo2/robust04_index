			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatia is satisfied with the development of  relations with the Russian Federation and wants to have friendly  relations in all areas, President of the Republic of Croatia  Franjo Tudjman said in an interview with reporters of leading  Russian media in Zagreb today.    Answering questions by reporters from Russian state  television, ITAR-TASS, and the newspaper MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI,  President Tudjman stressed that relations which existed before  the formation of the sovereign, independent, and democratic  Croatia only continued following the establishment of diplomatic  ties between the two countries. He said that Russia had so far  played a positive role in the search for a political solution to  the crisis in the region. He particularly stressed the role of  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the Russian president's  special envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, at the Geneva conference. They  tried to exert influence on Serbia and the Serbs in Croatia to  honor Croatia's internationally recognized borders.    President Tudjman also spoke in favorable terms about the  economic relations between the two countries and said that great  successes had been made in that sphere.</p>

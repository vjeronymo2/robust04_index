			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING INTO PAST OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD  </P> <P> The president of the board of directors of Planned Parenthood, Jeanette Reese,  offers in her article ("Office of Family Planning," June 25) reasons why the  people of California should be happy to spend $34.6 million of their money in  order to help them keep their "clinic" doors open. One reason is that it "will  save at least $400 million in future costs."  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood sells itself as a caring, professional family planning  organization, when in fact it is the largest abortion provider and advocate in  the United States. Under the guise of "reproductive rights," "unwanted  children," "poor mothers," and other popular masks, Planned Parenthood  continues to deceive the American taxpayer in supporting their immoral deeds.  </P> <P> To truly understand the goals of Planned Parenthood, it is necessary to go back  and discover the organization's roots. Margaret Sanger (1883-1966) was the  founder of Planned Parenthood. She believed in the ideology of a superior breed  ruling over the impure masses. Sanger considered the poor, immigrants,  non-whites and certain religious groups as "reckless breeders," saying they  would eventually bring "biological destruction" upon the world. She coined such  phrases as "More children from the fit, less from the unfit," and "Birth  Control: to create a race of thoroughbreds." Hitler had the same plan. The  league's name was changed (from American Birth Control League) to Planned  Parenthood in 1942 because of the negative public reaction to the eugenics  program in Germany during the '30s and '40s.  </P> <P> Appalling as these statements are, no major leader of Planned Parenthood has  yet repudiated Sanger's comments or beliefs. On the contrary, she is upheld as  a shining example.  </P> <P> In 1986 Planned Parenthood made over $21 million by performing abortions.  Government funding, Planned Parenthood's largest source of revenue, provides up  to $91 million of taxpayer funds each year. There's more and more and more.  </P> <P> THE REV.

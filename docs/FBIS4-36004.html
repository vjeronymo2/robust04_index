			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maher Chmaytelli] </F>   [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 3 (AFP) -- Rival Yemeni army units  fought an artillery battle near the southern stronghold of Aden  on Friday [3 June], despite both sides' acceptance of a UN  Security Council call for a ceasefire.    The duel took place around the village of Lahij, around 30  kilometres (18 miles) north of Aden, a day after troops loyal to  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih edged closer to this port city, a  correspondent said.    Southern anti-aircraft guns in Aden also went into action  but  no missile or bomb explosion was heard.    Salih's northern forces have mounted "fierce offensives on  all fronts, destroying villages and killing civilians," charged  the southern command of the president's rival, 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    "We are resisting with all our strength to protect our land  and our honour," it said.    The south also renewed a charge that Iraqi soldiers were  fighting alongside the northerners. Five Iraqis were captured  in the oil region of Shabwah, 300 kilometres (180 miles)  northeast of Aden, it said.    Al-Bid's self-declared Yemen Democratic Republic also  renewed  its acceptance of Security Council Resolution 924 calling for a  ceasefire in the month-long civil war.    The north on Thursday also said it was prepared to halt the  fighting and implement the resolution, as several dozen people  were killed in battles on all the frontlines around Aden.    On the political front, a northern spokesman in Sanaa  condemned the south's formation of a separate government and  warned that it could only lead to further bloodshed.    "This separatist act aims only to torpedo the efforts  underway to restore security and security in our nation in line  with Security Council 924," the spokesman said.    "This band of secessionists has shown once more that it is  determined to pursue the bloodshed to impose secession by  force," he charged.    The south on Thursday formed a cabinet headed by Haydar  Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, appointed prime minister of the breakaway  state, a day after the Security Council resolution.    A senior northern official, meanwhile, welcomed the  appointment of Lakhdar Brahimi as UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's special envoy to Yemen.    Brahimi is a "respected Arab figure and capable of carrying  out this mission," 'Abd-'al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, a member of the  presidential council, said in an interview with the Qatari news  agency QNA.    Under the ceasefire mission, the former Algerian foreign  minister is in charge of a UN fact-finding mission to Yemen.    Egyptian President Husni Mubarak telephoned both Salih and  al-Bid asking them to call a halt to the fighting, Cairo Radio  reported Friday.    He called them late Thursday and urged them to withdraw  their  forces from the combat zones as a first step towards resolving  the crisis.    Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad also called the Yemeni rivals  on Thursday urging them to settle their differences.</p>

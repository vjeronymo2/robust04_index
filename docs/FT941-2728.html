			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Sinn Fein stresses US peace role in N Ireland The United States could play an instrumental role in helping achieve peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said in Belfast yesterday. In reasonably upbeat remarks, Mr Adams told a St Patrick's Day rally that the US administration was displaying a readiness to take a fresh approach to the conflict in spite of sustained British pressure. He was speaking ahead of yesterday's meeting between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and US president Bill Clinton . The Sinn Fein leader said republicans wanted to live in peace and without coercion among their unionist neighbours. He added Sinn Fein neither condoned nor encouraged armed actions and stressed that all parties had to be involved in the current peace process. Mr Adams's statement received a guarded welcome in Washington, with Mr Clinton saying he was 'quite encouraged'. Mr Adams's words came 'at a good time and I hope it has a good effect', the US president said, standing with Mr Reynolds at the White House. But he added it was 'premature' to discuss the question of issuing another US visa to the Sinn Fein leader. 'The issue now, is what is going to be the role of Sinn Fein in the ongoing peace effort. Will they join? I hope they will,' Mr Clinton said. Speaking later at a special St Patrick's day dinner hosted by the president, Mr Reynolds said that US support for the Northern Ireland peace process would have 'an important influence' on its outcome.' In London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was urged strongly by Tory backbenchers to step up pressure on the Irish government to improve security co-operation.</p>

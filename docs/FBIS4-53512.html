			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 May Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] A government source on the morning of 18 May  commented on a report in the 17 May WASHINGTON POST that Laura  Tyson, chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers (CEA),  said the United States would stop exerting pressure on Japan  over trade. The source welcomed the report, saying: "That is  good news. They (the United States) have so far made so many  unreasonable demands of us. Things must have changed a lot."    But the source added: "As far as Japan is concerned, even if  the United States eases (pressure on Japan), Japan should  continue to push for domestic demand expansion, tax reform and  deregulation." The source thus indicated the government would  continue to make efforts to alleviate U.S. pressure on Japan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Today's Comment" column by Thlang Ambal: "To Achieve </F> Peace War Must Be Waged"]    [Text] Not all of the world's wars have been brought to an  end through negotiations alone. Some countries have concluded  wars through talks, while others have terminated them through  war. Vietnam, after 30 years of fighting, finished its war  through war. In Cambodia, Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan have also  ended a war through war.    The Khmer Rouge [KR] still nurtures the obsolete idea of  terminating war through war, by which it has previously  succeeded. This being the case, it does not want to hold talks  to end the war.    Ignorant individuals-cum-politicians that a party picked up  from a "rubbish bin" claim that peace can only be achieved if  the Khmer Rouge is included in the Royal Government.    We are still optimistic, however, that "if the war is to be  terminated," the war must be fought. Negotiations should not be  held at any rate, because holding negotiations is tantamount to  handing over a sword to the Khmer Rouge.    The policy of "negotiating" with the Khmer Rouge could once  again become a "policy of fleeing the country."    Those siding with the Khmer Rouge must go and stay with  them.  The Kingdom of Cambodia will not surrender to the Khmer Rouge,  come hell or high water.</p>

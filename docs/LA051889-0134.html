			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEMPLE CITY COUNCIL APPROVES SALARY  </P> <P> City Council members have tentatively agreed to pay themselves a salary for the  first time.  </P> <P> The $300 per month each member would receive is recommended by state guidelines  for cities with a population comparable to Temple City's 32,000. The ordinance  also would allow council members to receive reimbursement for work-related  expenses. A final vote is scheduled for June 6.  </P> <P> Council members in the city incorporated in 1960 have never been paid.  </P> <P> Keith Durham, assistant to the city manager, said he knows of no other cities  other than La Canada-Flintridge and San Marino where council members receive no  pay.  </P> <P> Councilman Kenneth Gillanders said he introduced the ordinance after realizing  that members are ineligible for benefits, such as low-cost health insurance  plans and pension plans, that are available to paid city employees. Once  council members receive a salary, they will be eligible for such benefits.  </P></p>

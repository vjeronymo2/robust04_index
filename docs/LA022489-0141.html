			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOPES OF AEGEAN HILLS FOR ANNEXATION DOUSED;  </P> <P> LAFCO CHIEF OPPOSES REQUEST TO JOIN DISTRICT WITH MISSION VIEJO; PANEL TO  CONFER WEDNESDAY  </P> <P> A senior official for the county Local Agency Formation Commission has  recommended rejecting the proposed annexation of unincorporated Aegean Hills to  the adjoining city of Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> The five-member LAFCO panel is scheduled to consider the request at its meeting  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Residents of Aegean Hills had petitioned for annexation last year. Initially,  at least, Mission Viejo indicated a willingness to accept, but after an updated  feasibility report -- showing that the annexation would put more of a financial  strain on Mission Viejo than at first thought -- the City Council voted Jan. 23  to rescind support.  </P> <P> The new report said the city would collect just $435,000 in surplus revenues  from an annexation, not the $1 million that was previously estimated would be  available to cover municipal services for the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reason for Rejection  </P> <P> LAFCO Executive Officer James J. Colangelo said in a report released this week  that the city's reversal on annexation is a major reason for his opposition to  the request.  </P> <P> Another reason is that Mission Viejo has been incorporated only since March 31,  so the city is not comfortable with expansion yet, he said, citing the City  Council's 3-2 vote withdrawing support for annexation.  </P> <P> "The City Council believes additional time is necessary to fully staff city  departments and functions before taking on the additional responsibility of the  Aegean Hills area," Colangelo wrote in his report to the commission.  </P> <P> Two City Council members, however, continue to actively support annexation.  </P> <P> Many Aegean Hills residents support annexation because of close cultural and  social ties to Mission Viejo and because they already have a Mission Viejo  mailing address.  </P> <P> Aegean Hills, a 593-acre planned community, has about 7,000 residents. Mission  Viejo, a separate, 10,500-acre planned community, has about 70,000 residents.  </P> <P> Many Aegean Hills residents say they also fear annexation by another city. Last  year, the district was included in a proposed Saddleback Valley city. That  plan, fiercely opposed by many Aegean Hills residents, was killed at the polls  Nov. 8.  </P> <P> LAFCO can accept or reject Colangelo's recommendation. If it chooses  annexation, the commission would first have to expand Mission Viejo's sphere of  influence. Even though the city has withdrawn its proposal to expand its sphere  to include Aegean Hills, the commission can still vote on the original request.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Annexation Question  </P> <P> If Mission Viejo's sphere is expanded to include Aegean Hills, the commission  at the same meeting could also approve annexation.  </P> <P> If so, the annexation question would be sent to the City Council for a special  hearing. At such a hearing, only residents of the area to be annexed would be  allowed a voice to protest or support the plan.  </P> <P> If the council is advised that less than 25% of the area's registered voters  object, the annexation would automatically become official. If 25% to 50% of  registered voters protest, the annexation question would have to be placed on  the ballot for Aegean Hills residents to decide.  </P> <P> If more than 50% protest, the annexation proposal would be killed  automatically.  </P></p>

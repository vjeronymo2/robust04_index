			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Approximately 200 Russian Army units have been  disbanded on Latvian territory over the last year. Some of the  discharged officers have left for Russia, but others have  remained in Latvia. The Command of the Northwestern Group of  Russian Forces does not provide the Latvian Bureau for  Monitoring the Withdrawal of the Russian Army with information  about officers who, after the disbandment of military units,  have remained in Latvia, Ilgonis Upmalis, the head of the  bureau, reports.    The Bureau for Monitoring the Withdrawal of the Russian Army  has instructed local governments to collect information about  officers of the disbanded military units, who were discharged in  Latvia. However, this is a very long and labor-consuming  process. This issue is not being considered at the  Latvian-Russian interstate talks on troop withdrawal either.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A New TES [steam electric power </F> plant] Will Be Built in St. Petersburg"]    [Text] Russia and Finland are conducting negotiations on  the construction of a gigantic electric power plant in  northwestern St. Petersburg.    The plant has been designed by a consortium of three Finnish  firms: Ematran Voima, Polar and Siemens. Pile driving work is  now going on at the site. The plant's first power bloc of 450  milliwatts will be ready at the end of 1996 and the second  should come on line two years later. Then the Russian side will  build two analagous blocs with its own resources. The Russians  will be able to pay for delivery of western equipment with  electric power which will be delivered to Finland for a sum of  two billion Finnmarks.    St. Petersburg's power system requires 30 percent repair in  the coming years. Two blocs of the Sosnovyy Bor nuclear power  plant will be shut down in the year 2000. St. Petersburg is  competely supplied with electric power but there is not enough  for heating. Construction of a steam electric power plant for  the expanding northwestern region of the city will be a rational  solution to this problem.</p>

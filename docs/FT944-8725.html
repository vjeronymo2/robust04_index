			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Budge's bold budget The story being told by RJB Mining as it trawls the City for Pounds 1.1bn to buy the bulk of British Coal looks starry-eyed. While its version has a fairy-tale ending, most other scenarios conclude in tears. For those asked to provide Pounds 528m of bank debt, there are few concerns. Once RJB has acquired the English coalfields, it will have about Pounds 315m worth of coal already out of the ground. Moreover, the contracts to supply power generators should provide sufficient cash to pay off the bulk of the debt by April 1998 when they expire. Whether RJB has net cash by then depends on the extent of cost cutting. But for equity investors, the venture looks fraught with risk. RJB's forecasts of pre-tax profits of Pounds 220m in 1999 depend on optimistic projections for sales volumes and prices - assumptions shared by few others in the industry. An unlikely combination of events will be required for its predictions to come true. These include a significant rise in international coal prices, which admittedly have begun to edge forward for the first time in a decade; and the willingness of UK power generators to use RJB's coal to the exclusion of virtually all others. The latter seems improbable, given their recent investments in importing facilities and stated policy of diversifying fuel sources. Given the group's low growth prospects post-1998, and an expected dividend yield of only 4.5 per cent - about the market average - equity investors will need considerable convincing that buying into RJB is a risk worth taking.</p>

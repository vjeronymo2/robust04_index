			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Speyhawk agrees debt restructure SPEYHAWK, the technically insolvent property developer, has reached agreement in principle with its 46 banks on the restructuring of more than Pounds 300m of debt. However, the complexity of the deal and the large number of banks involved means that the agreement is unlikely to be signed for a couple of months. The restructuring talks, which began 18 months ago, reached a conclusion on Christmas Eve. The talks involved seven syndicates, with Barclays acting as principal banker. The deal will involve the subordination of some of Speyhawk's debt and the release of guarantees. Speyhawk announced that it had reached agreement in principle with its lead banks to restructure its debts at the end of last March, when it announced a loss for the year of Pounds 217m. The large number of banks involved meant that restructuring talks dragged on through the year, although the structure of the package is largely unchanged.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Inoco cuts annual deficit to Pounds 4.31m Inoco, the USM-quoted property investor, reduced losses from Pounds 6.82m to Pounds 4.31m pre-tax over the 12 months to December 31. The outcome was struck after a profit on the sale of investments of Pounds 111,000 (losses of Pounds 3.1m) now treated as an exceptional rather than extraordinary item. Losses of Pounds 2.46m on sale of fixed assets, Pounds 96,000 on sale of trading stocks and a provision of Pounds 1.6m against carrying value of trading stocks were also taken above the line. Losses per share were 2.06p against a restated 3.29p.</p>

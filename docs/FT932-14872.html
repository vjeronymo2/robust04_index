			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: Ian McQueen's 'Fortunato' - Opera in Scandinavia Ian McQueen, though celebrated in Sweden, remains a relatively little known composer in his native Britain. Born in Glasgow in 1954, he studied at the Royal College of Music, then with Maxwell Davies and in Denmark, where his Scandinavian connections began, with Per Norgard. He wrote a one-act opera - Judit och Holofernes - for the season at Vadstena Castle, Sweden, in 1987. The success of this hard-hitting but lyrical piece led to a commission for a three-act opera in Swedish from Norrlandsoperan. Several years in gestation, Fortunato is now completing a triumphant run of (21) premiere performances at the converted fire-station in Umea which houses this most northerly of opera companies and one of the most enterprising. Umea is a medium-sized university and medical town (average age, 35) that culturally serves an area extending up to and beyond the Arctic Circle. That it has an opera company at all, never mind one that commissions new work from foreigners, is due firstly to a central government decision of 1974 to spread artistic goodness to the regions. But Umea's specific success is the boldly imaginative spirit of its successive chiefs, Arnold Ostman and, since 1988, Per-Erik Ohrn. Ohrn receives a total of Pounds 3.6m in central, regional and civic subsidies, with which he stages two major productions a year and undertakes a substantial amount of touring. An all-round man of the opera-theatre he has pursued enlightened creative aims, and no-one could be less provincial in attitude. British directors such as Clare Venables (Figaro) and Matthew Richardson (Midsummer Night's Dream) have worked at Umea. Richardson returns as Fortunato's director; its designer, Jon Morrell, is also British; its conductor, Gary Berkson, is American; and its librettist, Vanda Monaco-Westerhal, Italian. Ohrn's current ambition is to expand Norrlandsoperan into a four-town federation along the lines of Opera du Rhin in Alsace, thus engendering an annual total of eight new productions for the region, which would be swapped around. Meanwhile, activity is concentrated inside the metal-fronted, unpretty but versatile Umea building, with its shoebox auditorium seating 250 and its single admission price of Pounds 20. At the performance of Fortunato which I attended the house was full, the average age half that of the town, and the final acclamation was overwhelming. Foreigners though they be, McQueen with his music and Monaco-Westerhal with her story and text have evidently found a way of speaking to their Swedish audiences with vibrant directness. So much so that the critic of one national newspaper has pleaded for this work to be chosen to open the new opera house in Gothenberg. The story, with its Peer Gynt-like protagonist and his picaresque experiences in a medieval world of sleaze, violence and opportunism has a message no doubt for the Sweden of today; but it is a thoroughly archetypal brew, susceptible of any number of interpretations, religious, sexual, political. Both creators have been able to sustain their epic - their 'comedy beset with tragedy' - without narrowing its focus to specific issues but without ever losing our interest. Fortunato is, in short, a true work of art, at once ambiguous and inevitable-seeming. McQueen's musical language blossoms here as never before. He is a composer who has survived early exposure to ravaging post-war stylistic complexity and achieved a most personal and mettled directness of utterance. His manner is eclectic but not essentially allusive: he uses a great variety of means, from the tonal to the electronic, but only in order to say what he has to say, never in a spirit of irony or cultural tourism. Even when he writes for Handelian coloratura soprano, it is with the purpose of thus expressing the icy detachment of a mysterious 'Woman on the Mountain' (Monica Sjoholm,) not to provide a parodistic knees-up. This and most of the other solo lines are sensitively devised for the voice. His ensembles, of which there is a generous supply, are richly textured; the tutti finales of the first two acts have an astonishing sureness of touch, a genuinely cumulative power. His choral writing is zestful and catchy. But it is his orchestral writing that marks out the opera's high points: the extraordinary declamation for unison high violins which accompanies conscience-stricken Fortunato (confined by Richardson in a coffin-sized box) at the outset of Act 2; the wordless love duet for the semi-supernatural couple Voland and Mariella, which has the frankness of a pop-song and the lyrical afflatus of later Tippett. If the creative team was foreign, the singing strength was powerfully Swedish. The remarkable Mikael Bellini in the title role had an easy vigour which intimated a whole new world of operatic naturalness for the counter-tenor voice. Mezzo Carina Strandberg gave us a sumptuously impassioned Mariella. Baritone Peter Mattei's Voland was simply bursting with vocal vitality and stage presence. Morrell's endlessly adaptable stony box-set was admirable and Richardson's direction signally assured. Berkson conducted a performance that was all fluidity, confidence, and glowing happiness. Fortunato simply has to be staged in Britain.</p>

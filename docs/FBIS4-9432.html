			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 22/4/1994 -- In the speech made  after the Friday plenum session of the Crans Montana Forum, at  the workshop devoted to Romania, its economic potential and  development perspectives, Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu expressed his  conviction that the Bucharest conference would contribute to  understanding the evolutions, the options for the present and  future, the efforts Romania is making in promoting the  democratic principles on the one hand and in consolidating the  market mechanisms on the other.    The Romanian prime minister expressed the view that in the  political and economic context of a South-Eastern Europe in full  integration in the European structures and opening to the  world's economic circuits, Romania is holding the privileged  place secured to it by its strategic position and its resources.  Romania is offering foreign investors a domestic market in full  development, a ready access to neighboring foreign markets, an  incentive juridical background permanently improved, a labor  force capable of complex workmanship.    The prime minister of Romania showed that with effect from  November 1992, the Romanian Government practically made  effective its ruling programme and the strategy for social and  economic reform covering the time interval up to 1996, and that  sectorial surveys plead for continuing the reform in close  correlation with the real situation of the Romanian economy, and  with the technological, material, financial, currency and social  constraints.    Premier Vacaroiu stressed that, although carried under the  impact of negative factors accumulated in the years previous to  1989 and in extremely unfavorable international conditions, the  reforms went on in several planes: the reform of prices, the  introduction of the value-added tax, the enhancement of the  financial autonomy at local administration level, the initiation  of the restructuring process, the development of the small and  medium business sector, the further liberalization of foreign  trade, the making of the laws apt to support the reform.    "The official report of the United Nations Economic  Commission assessed that, among all countries in transition,  Romania is the surprise of the year 1993, because it managed  economic growth (a positive 1 per cent on the gross domestic  product, plus 1.3 per cent on industrial production, plus 12.4  per cent on farm production), thus contradicting all Romanian  and foreign prognoses estimating that economic decline was to go  deeper by another 7-10 percentage points."    Concluding, the prime minister of Romania named among his  government's actions for an ever greater opening of Romania in  1994 to the world business spheres those regarding the alignment  of export/import trade policies proper to market rules,  attracting direct foreign capital investments by markedly  liberal regulations and encouraging fiscal policies, improving  leasing conditions and activating the free trade zones,  intensifying the relations with the international bodies (IMF,  EBRD, G-24), as well as actions directed at making progress  towards Romania's association with the European Union.</p>

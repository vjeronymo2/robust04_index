			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will  visit Vietnam this week. Our radio editor reviews Vietnam-South  Korea relations.    The visit to Vietnam by South Korean Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu will further promote cooperative ties between Vietnam  and the Republic of Korea. The event takes place nearly a year  after the official visit to Seoul by Vietnamese Prime Minister  Vo Van Kiet. It further proves that since the establishment of  diplomatic relations in December 1992, ties between the two  countries have significantly developed. Last year, the two-way  trade turnover between Vietnam and South Korea was $800 million,  an increase of 60 percent over 1992.    Vietnam has exported to South Korea coal, farm produce,  textile, and sea foods; and imported from Korea electronic  products, transport equipment and machinery. The two countries  last year signed important agreements on investment  encouragement and protection and trade, and aviation  cooperation. They also initialed an agreement on avoidance of  double taxation.    South Korea's investment in Vietnam has reached $530 million  with 53 projects, an increase of 200 percent over 1992. Many  large South Korean corporations such as Daewoo, Samsung, and  Lucky Goldstar are undertaking major projects in Vietnam. South  Korean investment in Vietnam diversified in area and territorial  locations and in forms. South Korea has also granted Vietnam $50  million in development aid to help build infrastructures. It  has also given grant of two million U.S. dollars to Vietnam.    South Korea is considered the country with dynamic economic  development in Asia and the Pacific and Vietnam is also quickly  developing. Therefore, both countries are becoming important  partners in the Asia-Pacific era.    The coming visit by the South Korean foreign minister will  contribute to taking the bilateral relations to a higher level.</p>

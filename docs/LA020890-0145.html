			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIMMY VAN HEUSEN, PROLIFIC SONGSMITH, OSCAR WINNER, DIES  </P> <P> Jimmy Van Heusen, who took his name from a shirt label and his melodies from a  mirthful mind and gentle heart, has died at his home in Rancho Mirage.  </P> <P> The tunesmith whose "Swinging on a Star," "All the Way," "High Hopes" and "Call  Me Irresponsible" not only won four Oscars but became national monuments, had  celebrated his 77th birthday last month.  </P> <P> He died Tuesday, a spokesman for the Riverside County coroner's office said  Wednesday. His death was attributed to a stroke, and the coroner's spokesman  said he had suffered from cerebral vascular disease for about two years.  </P> <P> Born Edward Chester Babcock in Syracuse, N.Y., he was a mischievous boy who was  expelled from high school for singing a mildly salacious song "My Canary Has  Rings Under His Eyes" at a school assembly.  </P> <P> It probably was the only song he was ever identified with that he didn't  compose himself.  </P> <P> He grew to become a fun-loving adult who once told an interviewer "I dig  chicks, booze, music and Sinatra -- in that order."  </P> <P> It was Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby who made famous his songs -- "Aren't You  Glad You're You" from Crosby's film "The Bells of St. Mary's"; "Moonlight  Becomes You" from Crosby's "The Road to Morocco"; "(Love Is) The Tender Trap,"  from Sinatra's "The Tender Trap" and "All the Way" from Sinatra's "The Joker Is  Wild."  </P> <P> He was nominated for eight additional Academy Awards for such musical  masterpieces as "The Second Time Around" from "High Time"; "Pocketful of  Miracles" from the 1961 film of the same name; "My Kind of Town," a Sinatra  signature song from "Robin and the 7 Hoods" and more.  </P> <P> He won an Emmy for "Love and Marriage" from the 1955 production of "Our Town."  It since has become a leitmotif for the current generation of TV watchers who  now hear it as the theme of the ribald "Married . . . With Children."  </P> <P> If he helped make stars of Crosby (both as a priest and with Bob Hope in the  legendary "Road" series of comedies) and Sinatra, he also helped make household  words and friends of his many collaborators -- Johnny Mercer, Johnny Burke,  Eddie DeLange and most notably and recently, Sammy Cahn.  </P> <P> The son of a building contractor who played the cornet, young Edward Babcock  was encouraged to seek a conventional education, even though he was more  interested in music.  </P> <P> After leaving high school under circumstances his parents didn't consider  amusing, he enrolled briefly at a boarding school near Syracuse but left there  when teachers found him more often in poolrooms than classrooms.  </P> <P> While still a student, Babcock (who never changed his name legally) landed a  job on a local radio station for $15 a week. The station manager insisted that  he change his name, and he appropriated Van Heusen from the shirt manufacturer  and James because he said he just liked it.  </P> <P> He did attend Syracuse University from 1930 to 1932, studying piano and  composition, and while there formed a partnership with Jerry Arlen, Harold  Arlen's younger brother.  </P> <P> His next-door neighbor in Syracuse had been composer Arlen, and when the man  who was to write the music for "The Wizard of Oz" went to Hollywood in 1933, he  asked his brother and Van Heusen to take over his composing duties at Harlem's  famed Cotton Club.  </P> <P> Van Heusen wrote "Harlem Hospitality." The tune and the show it was written for  flopped, but Van Heusen hung on in New York, operating a freight elevator at  Park Central Hotel and plugging tunes.  </P> <P> One of his first compositions, "There's a House in Harlem for Sale" was  performed by the hotel orchestra and got him out of the elevator and into a job  with a music publishing firm.  </P> <P> He met orchestra leader Jimmy Dorsey in 1938 and offered him his latest song,  "It's the Dreamer in Me." The resultant recording became a hit and also sold  100,000 copies of sheet music.  </P> <P> Crosby also recorded it and, by 1940, Van Heusen had become one of Tin Pan  Alley's most successful composers, with 60 songs published in just one season.  Next came Hollywood, and he joined with Burke for a songwriting team that  became known as the Gold Dust Twins.  </P> <P> He composed his first film score with Burke for "Love Thy Neighbor" in 1940,  which was widely recorded.  </P> <P> In a single week that year, Van Heusen had three songs on the Hit Parade,  including "Shake Down the Stars," "All This and Heaven Too" and "Polka Dots and  Moonbeams."  </P> <P> During the wartime summer of 1942, Van Heusen toured West Coast Army camps with  Crosby, sometimes serving as the crooner's pilot. He had amassed enough flying  time to qualify as a test pilot for Lockheed Corp., taking war planes up for  their maiden voyages between 1942 and 1944.  </P> <P> He owned aircraft and a helicopter during the 1960s, and his Yucca Valley ranch  was equipped with a landing pad.  </P> <P> At one point Van Heusen and Burke were under contract to Crosby, 20th Century  Fox, MGM, Columbia and International studios.  </P> <P> In 1955 Van Heusen teamed with Cahn and produced a string of motion picture  scores that became hits. Their Academy Award-winning "High Hopes" was chosen as  the official song for John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign.  </P> <P> The composer also donated the song "California" to the inaugural gala held for  former California Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown.  </P> <P> Although he had tremendous success with popular tunes (seven Grammy  nominations) and movie music, Broadway was one venue whose success eluded Van  Heusen. The productions of "Swingin' the Dream," "Nellie Bly" and "Carnival in  Flanders" were all acknowledged by the composer as flops.  </P> <P> (The durable jazz ballad "Darn That Dream" was one of the few bright spots from  the 1939 "Swingin' the Dream," which starred Louis Armstrong and Benny  Goodman.)  </P> <P> "It's a big, big gamble," he said in 1965 before the stage production of  "Skyscraper," for which he was nominated for a Tony award. "You spend two years  putting it together, and if six critics don't like it, you're out of business  overnight. It's that simple."  </P> <P> He had shaved his head for years and cut a dashing figure with exquisite but  casual clothes. He loved entertaining, parties, and, until 1969 when he married  singer Bobbe Brock, being single. Friends said he was able to write songs with  a party going on around him or while lounging by his swimming pool.  </P> <P> He also wrote songs for those same friends, including two for Sinatra's  daughters -- "Nancy (With the Laughing Face)" and "Tina."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, lyricist Cahn said by telephone from New York that when people  ask him who is the most fascinating character he ever met, he always answers  "Jimmy Van Heusen."  </P> <P> "Then they say, 'what about Sinatra?'  </P> <P> "I tell them Sinatra thought he was Van Heusen, but he couldn't pass the  physical."  </P> <P> Services will be private.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VAN HEUSEN'S SONGS  </P> <P> These are the compositions of Jimmy Van Heusen.  </P> <P> It's the Dreamer in Me  </P> <P> So Help Me  </P> <P> Deep in a Dream  </P> <P> Heaven Can Wait  </P> <P> Oh, You Crazy Moon  </P> <P> Blue Rain  </P> <P> I Thought About You  </P> <P> All This and Heaven, Too  </P> <P> Darn That Dream  </P> <P> Imagination  </P> <P> Dearest, Darest I?  </P> <P> Isn't That Just Like Love?  </P> <P> It's Always You  </P> <P> Birds of a Feather  </P> <P> Constantly  </P> <P> Road to Morocco  </P> <P> Ain't Got a Dime to My Name  </P> <P> Moonlight Becomes You  </P> <P> Sunday, Monday or Always  </P> <P> If You Please  </P> <P> Suddenly, It's Spring  </P> <P> A Friend of Yours  </P> <P> Polka Dots and Moonbeams  </P> <P> Going My Way  </P> <P> Swinging on a Star  </P> <P> The Day After Forever  </P> <P> It Could Happen to You  </P> <P> And His Rocking Horse Ran Away  </P> <P> Like Someone in Love  </P> <P> Sleigh Ride in July  </P> <P> Yah-Ta-Ta Yah-Ta-Ta  </P> <P> Put It There, Pal  </P> <P> Welcome to My Dream  </P> <P> It's Anybody's Spring  </P> <P> Personality  </P> <P> Nancy  </P> <P> Just My Luck  </P> <P> Aren't You Glad You're You?  </P> <P> My Heart Is a Hobo  </P> <P> Country Style  </P> <P> Smile Right Back at the Sun  </P> <P> Apalachicola, Florida  </P> <P> But Beautiful  </P> <P> You Don't Have to Know the Language  </P> <P> If You Stub Your Toe on the Moon  </P> <P> Once and for Always  </P> <P> You're in Love With Someone  </P> <P> Someplace on Anywhere Road  </P> <P> Sunshine Cake  </P> <P> High on the List  </P> <P> And You'll Be Home  </P> <P> Life Is So Peculiar  </P> <P> Early American  </P> <P> Here's That Rainy Day  </P> <P> Ring the Bell  </P> <P> The Magic Window  </P> <P> Moonflowers  </P> <P> To See You  </P> <P> The 86th!

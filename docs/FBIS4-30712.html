			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 29 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The United  States looks favourably at the prospect of forging a new defence  partnership with Malaysia based on access to sophisticated  technology, technology transfer, exchange of information and  joint military exercises rather than maintaining its physical  presence in the region.    Malaysian Defence Minister Najib Tun Abdul Razak said here  Tuesday after a meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Defence  Secretary William Perry, that he believed of a very good scope  for U.S.-Malaysia defence relationship and expected it to grow  stronger in the years to come based on the new realities of the  region, particularly in Southeast Asia.    ...A stronger Malaysia and a stronger ASEAN means that we'll  be in a better position to guarantee the security of not only  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries but the  region as a whole.    As far as the Asia-Pacific region is concerned, America is  still looking towards maintaining a strong presence in Japan and  Korea. But as far as our region is concerned they're happy with  the present arrangement...bearing in mind the U.S. budgetary  constraints, he said on wrapping up his nine-day visit to the  U.S. which has taken him to New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis  and Washington.    Earlier, Najib was given a ceremonial welcome by American  military service men at the Pentagon with a 19-gun salute, and a  moving rendition of the Malaysian national anthem Negara Ku [My  country] as well as the U.S' national anthem, The Star Spangled  Banner by a U.S. army band.</p>

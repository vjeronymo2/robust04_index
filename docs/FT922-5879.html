			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (6): The dustbin holds a cocktail - Don't only blame the packaging PACKAGING is usually seen as the biggest generator of waste. Yet used packaging accounts for only a quarter by weight of household waste, and a similar amount by volume of waste that is landfilled. Even if all packaging were removed from the waste stream, therefore, there would still be a waste problem. The contents of a typical UK household consists of: packaging (24 per cent), other paper (29), food and garden waste (25) and other materials (22). The real problem with waste is the need to handle it in an environmentally acceptable way, whether it is recycled, incinerated or landfilled. UK local authorities have generally provided outstanding services, and UK and EC legislation now coming into force will improve standards still further. Even so, legislators charged with improving waste management services often reveal a myopic approach that places a disproportionate emphasis on packaging because of its high visibility. For example, the European Commission's draft packaging and packaging waste directive appears to assume, wrongly, that packaging waste contributes to the increase in the volume of wastes and the saturation of landfills. This is not supported by the available evidence. A report by Dr Harvey Alter, of the resources and policy department of the US Chamber of Commerce, shows that in the US the per capita generation of household waste has been statistically constant for many years, and that the amount of packaging waste disposed of has levelled off and is showing a slight decline. A similar pattern is likely to be true for northern Europe. In 1980, the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment (Incpen) and Merseyside county council carried out a detailed analysis that identified the packaging component of household waste; and, over the past three years, Incpen and the departments of Environment and Trade and Industry have been funding a similar analysis of household waste in Sheffield. Although these studies are local and may not be representative of national compositions, they do show a small decrease in the total weight of packaging in household waste in the past 10 years. The same decade has seen the number of goods and the range of foods available increase dramatically, higher health and safety standards, and greater versatility of packaging with the use of more resources. This is the result of better technology, which has allowed glass, paper, plastics and metals to be used more sparingly to do the same job better, or to do jobs that previously could not be done at all. There is, of course, potential for re-using some packaging, but the emphasis should be placed on recycling the materials for which end-use markets are most easily available and those that contribute the greatest quantities to waste. It is possible to imagine an ideal system for handling used packaging. It would look something like this, with the figures in brackets showing the percentage of each in household waste: bottle banks for collecting glass (6-8 per cent); magnets for extracting the steel cans from the waste in the dustbin (5-6); financial incentives to collect aluminium cans (less than 1); some sort of collection system for plastic bottles (2), if a market for them existed. Paper packaging (5 per cent of domestic waste) and plastics films (3 per cent) are usually too contaminated by food to be recycled as materials. They do, however, have a significant calorific value. So, in areas where there is an incinerator, their intrinsic energy value can be recovered. The waste-handling systems at incinerators also allow the easy magnetic extraction of steel cans, either before or after burning. The government's scheme to make greater use of non-fossil fuel sources of energy is providing economic incentives that should increase the amount of waste incinerated. Though many environmental groups claim that incineration is dangerous, because of emissions, the evidence suggests that these fears are unfounded, provided incinerators are operated to the standards laid down by the EC. The ideal system, therefore, makes use of a number of different waste-handling options. But none is better than another, because each is more or less appropriate according to the type of waste, waste management infrastructure and geographical circumstances. In particular, in environmental terms, landfill should not always be seen as 'the last resort'. It can have positive benefits. For example, the House of Commons select committee on the environment, in its report on the draft EC directive on the landfill of waste, published in July 1991, states: 'We are firmly of the view that landfill, when based on good science and operated and controlled to the highest technological standards, constitutes a safe and cost-effective means of waste disposal, and in some cases is the best practicable environmental option.' Packaging can also provide a market for some recycled materiaIs. About 90 per cent of UK-produced paper and board packaging is made from waste paper and board. Used glass and metals can go back to make new packaging. Used plastics and paper packaging cannot easily be used again as packaging, because over two-thirds of these materials are used in contact with food, and hygiene requirements cannot be assured. However, there are some uses in non-food packaging and other goods. The fact is that some types of packaging are more suitable for recycling than others. But that does not mean both types cannot have equal environmental benefits. Glass bottles, for example, are relatively cheap to manufacture, use plentiful raw materials and can be re-used and recycled; but they are expensive and resource intensive in the distribution chain. Plastics, on the other hand, are difficult to recycle, but use a small amount of resources and are cheap to transport because of their light weight. The present obsession with solid waste should not be allowed to dictate how packaging is designed. Rather than have targets for recycling, a more useful - and environmentally more rewarding - target would be to reduce the overall use of resources in packaged goods distribution systems. If specific targets within that overall aim were required, then a reduction in the number of lorries on the roads, by using the optimum amount of material per pack, would have a clear environmental benefit. The environmental challenge for industry is not primarily to devise entirely recyclable packaging, but to produce packaging and associated distribution systems that prevent the waste of food and goods and protect human health.

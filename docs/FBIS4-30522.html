			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nuke Development is Impermissible" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  authorities' nuclear arms development can never be allowed,  stresses MINJU CHOSON today.    Describing the June 23 memorandum of the Committee for the  Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland as an indictment of  their development of nuclear weapons, the news analyst says:    The South Korean authorities have long since promoted the  development of nuclear weapons, laying stress on the development  of reprocessing facilities.    The post-irradiation test facility in the Taedok complex is  a  reprocessing facility under the veil of "test." The facility was  completed in 1985 and put into full operation in 1987. With an  investment of tens of billions of won, it has been expanded  into a large one today.    The post-irradiation test facility, closely linked with the  multi-purpose research reactor, forms a plutonium production  system. Its danger is increasing still further.    In South Korea, insufficiently spent nuclear fuel discharged  from the heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose research  reactor is systematically reprocessed at the post-irradiation  test facility to extract plutonium. A total of 50 kg of  plutonium has so far been extracted.    The South Korean authorities also scheme to import a large  quantity of plutonium lawfully. The purpose of the development  of a fast heavy water reactor they have promoted is the  production and import of a large quantity of plutonium. When  their development of a fast heavy water reactor faced strong  opposition at home and abroad, they recently chose a remodeled  light water reactor as the next-generation reactor. But this  was intended to mislead public opinion.    Their development of nuclear weapons has got more  undisguised  these days.    The South Korean authorities must immediately give up the  nuclear arms development and open to the public the truth of  their nuclear arms development and apologize for it, as  demanded by the Korean people and the world peaceloving people.    If they continue to proceed with nuclear weapons  development,  they will encounter stronger opposition from the home and  foreign public and meet their doom.</p>

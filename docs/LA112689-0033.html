			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KUSC'S REVISED FORMAT HAS GIVEN A REVISED FORM TO AT LEAST ONE LISTENER  </P> <P> Re "Classical Music Radio: What's Not Too Stuffy and Yet Not Too Hip?" by  Claudia Puig, Nov. 19: I wish all those people sending hate mail to Wallace  Smith, KUSC-FM general manager, would stop. The new format is absolutely  terrific.  </P> <P> Every time a KUSC radio personality starts bumbling through some "imponderable"  or a traffic report or programs only a single movement from some work, I simply  turn off the radio and go for a walk. It's wonderful! In the last two months  I've lost 23 pounds.  </P> <P> Keep up the good work, Dr. Smith. By this time next year I should be ready for  a marathon!  </P> <P> STANLEY K. STRAUSS  </P> <P> La Verne  </P></p>

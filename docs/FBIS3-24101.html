Yesterday the results of an international  tender for the modernization of the Kazan airport were  announced. The winner has proven to be the BOUYGES firm  (France). The modification of the airport may involve the  reorientation of the network of air communications between  Europe and Asia, since the path by way of Kazan saves more than  an hour of flight time as compared with flights by way of  Sheremetyevo-2.    As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already reported, it was proposed to  the winners in the first stage of the tender that was held in  June-August of last year -- the companies BOUYGES (France); Spie  Batignolles (France, Turkey); Kodest (Italy); and Jugodrvo  (Yugoslavia) -- that they modify the plans in conformity with  the terms of the technical assignment. Yesterday the tender  committee announced that the winner is the BOUYGES firm, which  developed a plan with a total cost of $198,360,000, and which  guarantees the complete handing over of the project in three  years.    [Editorial note] The French BOUYGES construction  company was created in 1954. It has branches in 84 countries  throughout the world. Its annual turnover is $13 billion and it  has 150,000 employees. It is the owner of French television  Channel 1.    [Editorial note] The Kazan airport provides for the  acceptance of 8000 passengers and 113,840 tons of freight a  year. In 1992 it was accepted into the Association of  International Airports. It has regular air communication with  Turkey.    The modernization of the Kazan airport stipulates the  construction of a runway that can accommodate the operation of  aircraft of all types (including the Boeing-747-400 and the  IL-96-300), the air terminal building, and a hangar for the  technical servicing of aircraft. Subsequently a technical  service center, freight terminals, and a hotel will be built.    According to BOUYGES commercial director Pierre Boiche, the  modernization will make it possible to increase the airport's  handling capacity to 1000 passengers an hour. The project  stipulates the creation of a joint enterprise in which 51  percent of the shares will belong to Tatarstan, and 49 percent  to an association of foreign firms that is headed by BOUYGES.  Tatarstan's share, as viewed by the project initiators, is in  the form of offering the French side the right to use the Kazan  airport, including the ground on which it is located, for a  period of no less than 25 years. France's investment includes  monetary funds, technologies, and participation in the  construction. It is planned to finance the project along two  credit lines: from the French government and the YeBRR [European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development] at 7 percent annual  interest. M. Boiche also mentioned as possible investors the  French companies Thomson, Alcatel, and Total. In order to obtain  credit, Tatarstan government guarantees will be required.  According to Valeriy Stekolshchikov, vice-premier of Tatarstan  and chairman of the tender commission, it is planned to begin  implementing the project during the current year.    Plans for constructing new air-transportation centers in the  CIS have arisen not only in Tatarstan. People in St. Petersburg  are considering the possibility of expanding the Pulkovo airport  in order to convert it into a center for air shipments in the  northwest region of Russia. This may also exert an influence on  reducing the status of Sheremetyevo-2 as the main international  airport in the CIS.    [Note, signed "Business Department"] The remodeling of the  Kazan airport, which does not yet meet the requirements that are  made for a major world-class air-transportation center,  presupposes the future competition between the Kazan airport and  Sheremetyevo-2, which in the CIS today is the basic point where  international air lines intersect. One cannot fail to mention  the scheme that was proposed for the first time in projects of  this type -- the scheme for "backup" insuring of the risk taken  by the foreign partner, when, in addition to the granting of  governmental guarantees, what is practically the taking of the  airport under pledge is proposed. Tatarstan's agreement to this  attests to the intention to construct the airport at any price.  In general, similar airports are constructed abroad only after  the confirmation of the intentions to use it on the part of the  leading air companies. However, the representations of British  Airways, Air France, and Lufthansa have not yet commented on  their actions in this instance, although the possibility that  Kazan can accept Boeing-747 liners, which are the basic aircraft  for the long-distance lines of the leading air carriers in the  world, cannot fail to attract the attention of those carriers.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / No sympathy for Eurosceptics For Americans, the glass is always half full, never half empty. Having imbibed something of this spirit, I find the negative attitudes of British Eurosceptics a trifle hard to stomach. To stand sullenly on the sidelines, rather than fight for the kind of union that will expand individual liberty and prosperity, would strike the typical American as the worst kind of defeatism: the Dunkirk spirit in reverse. I realise that many Eurosceptics are keen supporters of free markets. But this means they should have little respect for the nation state, which often acts as an obstacle to the free movement of goods, not to mention people. Two centuries ago, American states managed to pool sovereignty in a federal union that expanded economic opportunities, preserved personal freedoms and deterred aggression from neighbours. Why oppose a similar strategy in Europe? The record of Brazil and India reminds us that bigness is not in itself a virtue. American prosperity is a product of the specific political philosophy adopted by the US founding fathers. And despite the constraints they so wisely built into the constitution, Washington eventually seized far too much power. The centre's dominance explains many of today's frictions: President Bill Clinton is facing violent opposition to his social reforms partly because such decisions should be taken by lower levels of government. There is no reason why the same healthcare rules should be imposed on states as diverse as Vermont, Louisiana and Oregon. But European nations have the US example. If they are intelligent, they will copy the best aspects of US federalism while avoiding the mistakes. The fact that European countries are long-established nation states (unlike the original components of the US union) should act as a natural brake on aggrandisement by the centre. So should the increasing number and diversity of members as the union prepares to absorb the Nordic countries and, eventually, eastern European states. The political landscape is also changing. In the late 1980s the likely destination for Europe seemed to be an interventionist, monolithic superstate run by a clone of Jacques Delors. That dark future now looks a little less plausible. Many countries - not just Britain - are fearful of a loss of national identity. Germany, at last, is showing signs of impatience with the bureaucracy endemic to Brussels. And European politicians cannot ignore entirely a global tide of ideas that strongly favours free markets and personal liberty. Who would have guessed that Italy, of all countries, would appoint Antonio Martino as foreign minister, a libertarian fan of Margaret Thatcher? Since there is now considerable room to influence debate in continental Europe, British Eurosceptics should stop being so negative. They could start by reconsidering their blind opposition to a single European currency. Nearly all economists agree that this would considerably enhance the commercial attractions of a single European market. I can understand that an old-fashioned Keynesian might fear that loss of the pound sterling would prevent a UK government creating jobs at will by printing wads of money. But most Eurosceptics are surely sophisticated enough to realise that an independent monetary policy offers only an illusionary form of sovereignty. It gives you the freedom to create more inflation than your neighbours, but not more jobs or a higher standard of living, because these depend on economic fundamentals such as work effort and productivity growth. It is odd, to say the least, that many fierce opponents of a single currency are sympathetic to rule-based global monetary systems such as the 19th-century gold standard. Yet provided a European central bank were responsibly run (which seems likely if Germany is to abandon the D-Mark), the effect on Britain would be much the same as a gold standard - protection from destabilising changes in the value of money. There is one crucial caveat. A single currency would be disastrous if, in the name of social justice, Brussels remained wedded to laws preventing the flexible adjustment of wages and social benefits in member countries. The US should serve as a warning here. Some regions will always face special economic problems: for different reasons Texas, New England and California have all recently suffered severe local recessions. The hardship is tolerable only because depressed regions can reduce costs and regain market shares by allowing their wages and social benefits to fall relative to the national average. But rather than opposing a single currency out of fear that regional recessions would turn into depressions, Eurosceptics should direct their fire at the root problem. This is the dotty desire in Brussels to harmonise everything, and thus prevent member countries exploiting comparative advantages such as low wages and flexible working conditions. The terms for federal union demanded by Britain's partners could eventually prove unacceptable, for example if they threatened important liberties of UK citizens. I am not in the camp that regards Britain's future in Europe as a metaphysical necessity. Geography is less important than in the past as Japan showed after the second world war, when it formed its main commercial (and military) ties with the US rather than its Asian neighbours. The UK could withdraw and prosper commercially, say by negotiating entry to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But such a costly upheaval should be avoidable - especially if Eurosceptics stop sulking and start working for the right kind of liberal Europe.</p>

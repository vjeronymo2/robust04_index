			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): London pay blow for civil servants A CAMPAIGN by Civil Service unions for higher London weighting allowances received a setback yesterday when the National Audit Office backed a government move to replace the rises with a different form of payment. The NAO, the government's watchdog on the use of public funds, said 'local pay additions' were a more economical means of addressing local recruitment and retention problems. Such additions, already paid to many civil servants, were an effective, cheap and flexible response to recruitment difficulties, said the NAO. Last month the two largest Civil Service unions called out their London members on a one-day strike in a campaign to persuade the government to increase London weighting for the first time since 1988. The top London allowance for civil servants is Pounds 1,750 a year compared with more than Pounds 4,000 paid to some staff by financial services companies. The Treasury argues that local additions and other methods of targeting pay are a more cost-effective way of tackling staff turnover because they need be paid only where recruitment and retention difficulties require them. Local additions were introduced in 1988 and are paid to 65,000 civil servants - more than 10 per cent of the total - at an annual cost of Pounds 32m, of which Pounds 23m goes to London workers. A survey by the NAO of Department of Trade and Industry clerical grades in six areas showed that local additions had helped improve recruitment and the department's relative pay position. It found a weaker link between local additions and staff retention, however. 'It was clear that many other factors beyond pay influenced people's decision whether to stay or leave,' the NAO explained. Factors included good management, job satisfaction and good career prospects. Unions argue that the system of local additions is under-resourced and is divisive because it can lead to staff doing the same job in the same area for different salaries. The CPSA Civil Service union said yesterday that problems would grow when the recession ended and competition by employers for workers increased. Local Pay Additions. National Audit Office.

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Personal View: Citizen's Charter  - half-way there The FT's audit of the Citizen's Charter on Monday damned it with faint praise. 'Not all objectives achieved.' The glass half empty. Three years into a 10-year programme it would have been as easy  - and fairer  - to argue the other way. 'Real, measurable progress made.' Glass half full. Yes, the Citizen's Charter programme is ambitious. That is why it is being studied by governments across the world. The prime minister's aim is to change the face of the public service; to give those who provide it new pride; to give those who pay for it quality performance; to give those who use it the satisfaction that comes from services that offer what they want, when they want and how they want. Your article made the common mistake of equating the charter with the charter documents themselves. It is far wider than that. The documents are only part of the story, one means to the common end of wider choice, higher standards and new ideas. This wider programme is about competition and choice. It covers privatisation and contracting out  - putting private sector skills and ideas at the service of the public  - just as much as devising mechanisms to improve performance where the service remains in the public sector. Before the charter, the FT could not have published an article listing the published objectives of, and seeking to measure performance in, the public sector. There simply was no published information about service standards by which to judge. Now all that is changing. Publication of league tables for schools gives parents the knowledge to use their power to choose. Railtrack results are in the stations. Waiting lists are visibly down. Hospital performance indicators are on the way. This is truly a revolution. The main charters explained to users what the public is entitled to expect. But others act as 'models' which will guide those writing local charters of service for colleges and council departments and many many others. The local charters will be expected in every case to contain testable performance measures. On independent audit, the FT article is just plain wrong. There is independent audit of schools by the new Ofsted. For the first time ever every school in the country will be regularly inspected and challenged to improve, and reports will go to every parent. In the health service and local authorities we have given the Audit Commission powers to publish performance tables of results for other local services, not just schools. Increasingly, charters are being used to measure organisations' performance. The parliamentary ombudsman has said that he finds charter standards a useful guide and in one major case used it to get improved redress for a class of victims of maladministration. As for independent review of complaints, three years ago it would have been thought extraordinary for organisations such as the Inland Revenue, the Home Office's immigration and nationality department or the prison service to provide this. Now those organisations are setting the trend and other  - less well known  - public service organisations are appointing independent adjudicators to whom people can take their complaints. Have Charters raised standards? There is real evidence that they have. The charts (left)  - just examples  - tell their own story. Of course, with a reform programme that affects the whole of the public service  - employing 5m people and with every one of us a customer  - there is plenty more to do. That is why the Citizen's Charter second report, published yesterday, contains a full agenda of further improvements. And why we have also published a widely available booklet, 'Report Back 94', which sets out commitments and future plans in key services. We have always said that this is a 10-year programme. But it is clear that in less than three years the charter has begun to change the attitudes and culture of public service organisations. I believe the glass is half full, and filling rapidly.

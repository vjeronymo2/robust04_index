			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH ARE HIS BUSINESS  </P> <P> In the private and mysterious world of high-powered jewelry dealing, Arthur  Groom stands out like a diamond in the rough.  </P> <P> Groom, 39, whose firm sold $12 million worth of diamonds and other gems last  year, frequently travels to jungles, cavernous mines and other remote spots in  Asia and Africa in a constant search for the world's rarest rocks.  </P> <P> Like the sailing merchants of centuries past, Groom will barter and trade for  many of his stones. He recently swapped a shipload of cement for $1 million  worth of diamond "roughs" from the African nation of Sierra Leone.  </P> <P> Groom seeks stones in dangerous, strife-ridden nations, such as Myanmar  (formerly called Burma), where he says he is only the third American since 1962  to gain the rights to deal in rubies. Most recently, Groom closed a deal to  become the sole distributor of American soft drinks in that Southeast Asian  nation. He plans to repatriate the profits in gems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modern Indiana Jones  </P> <P> And while most diamond dealers prefer to keep their actions cloaked in secrecy,  Groom, who is outspoken and friendly, seeks the spotlight. He employs a  publicist who pitches Groom as a modern-day Indiana Jones.  </P> <P> "There have been very few dealers who are so public," said Abe Michael  Shainberg, executive director of New York's exclusive Diamond Dealers Club,  considered the world's most important diamond exchange. "The average diamond  dealer, for security reasons, does not want such publicity."  </P> <P> He described Groom as "an honest and honorable man. His publicity is good for  his business, and good for the rest of us, too."  </P> <P> Seated in a small office at his fashionable store in the New York suburb of  Ridgewood, Groom proudly showed off stones with $100,000 price tags. The  shirt-sleeved man, who wore no jewelry, smiled and insisted he is "not Indiana  Jones."  </P> <P> "No intrigue," he said. "But I do have a message."  </P> <P> Groom says American business can exert a positive influence throughout the  world. He is convinced that the world respects the American system but that  Americans must also understand and respect other cultures.  </P> <P> "In many cultures, the American way does not hold up," he said. "How dare we  have that attitude that ours is the only way."  </P> <P> Groom's story, however, is the stuff of the American dream. He left a  successful job as a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 15 years ago after  a friend's father urged him to take a gem course that left him "absolutely  fascinated" with precious stones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Flier  </P> <P> Groom said he struggled at first, working 15-hour days in a one-room enterprise  as his friends climbed their respective corporate ladders. Arthur Groom &amp;  Co. in Ridgewood and his American Trading Co. in New York slowly grew into a  multimillion-dollar-a-year business with offices around the globe.  </P> <P> Unlike some dealers who only work the phones, Groom goes directly to faraway  mines to pick out his own stones and diamond roughs. One of the few dealers who  sells both diamonds and other gems, Groom is the consummate frequent flier,  logging more than 150,000 miles each year.  </P> <P> Groom said he draws energy from his work.  </P> <P> "There's a science to picking stones in the jungle," he said. "Then you go to  the Diamond Dealers Club and pull up your shirt sleeves and wheel and deal.  Some Saturdays, I'll simply work the floor of this store, helping an old lady  who needs a $10 soldering job on a broken chain."  </P> <P> His ruby deal with Myanmarbrought Groom face-to-face with military leaders of a  nation that was virtually shut off to American businessmen since its 1962 coup.  The Myanmar rubies, Groom said, are the rarest and most desirable stones in the  world, retailing for about $10,000 a carat.  </P> <P> When asked if dealing with Myanmar's harsh government tugged at his conscience,  Groom nodded.  </P> <P> "But I'll be putting 1,200 people to work in the soft-drink bottling plant. I  really believe we should be there to have a presence."  </P> <P> Groom said he was moved by the poverty in many African nations. He said he  believes that trading cement, food and clothing for gems will make a difference  there.  </P> <P> "It's easy to pay cash," Groom said. "But what good does it do for those  countries? Who gets the money? These people need so much."  </P></p>

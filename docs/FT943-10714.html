			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Investors switch on to star of Chinese TV - Television Broadcasts is more than just a popular network Television Broadcasts (TVB) is viewed as not only an excellent portfolio investment - with earnings per share forecast to grow by 15 per cent for the next three years and a balance sheet clean of debt - but also the best vehicle for a foreign media company to ride the expected growth in Asian media during the coming decades. This explains why Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Time Warner, the US media group, have both looked at taking an equity interest in the Hong Kong broadcaster. Mr Murdoch opted instead for control of Star Television, the Hong Kong based satellite-TV network, rather than partnership with TVB, while Time Warner seems likely to seek an alliance with TVB in its satellite operations, according to industry executives. They say Time Warner could not afford the entry price for an equity stake. This week it was revealed that Pearson, the UK media and entertainments group whose interests include the Financial Times, has been in discussions with TVB shareholders - Malaysian financier Mr Robert Kuok owns 24.5 per cent of the company - for some months. Talks about the possible Pounds 150m (Dollars 98m) purchase of up to 10 per cent of TVB have reached an advanced stage, although Pearson has declined to comment beyond confirming that talks have taken place. If Pearson can clinch the deal it will be in a position where, through its joint venture with the British Broadcasting Corporation and its stake in TVB, it partners the world's largest producers of English-language and Chinese-language television programmes. The key difference with the BBC venture, however, is that TVB is an investment that pays dividends from day one. TVB's strength rests on its stranglehold of Hong Kong's television market, where it enjoys a 72 per cent share of the audience. The station maintains this enviable position by producing original television drama, soap operas and comedy with home-grown 'stars' who are tied to its studio. Its penetration into southern China has become a particular attraction to advertisers in both Hong Kong and China. Products are often advertised on TVB which are available only to consumers on the mainland. The audience in southern China - from Shenzhen to Guangzhou - is estimated at some 3m. But it has the potential to grow, given that the population of the Pearl River Delta is more than 25m. Revenues from Hong Kong accounted for 80 to 85 per cent of pre-tax profits of HKDollars 591m (USDollars 76.5m) in 1993 and are expected to underpin the company's financial performance for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax and operating margins are strong, at around 30 per cent last year. Analysts believe that TVB's position in Hong Kong is secure, even with the increased competition that has come from cable-TV, through Wharf Cable, and Mr Murdoch's Star TV. Wharf Cable delivers 11 channels in Cantonese, the predominant dialect in Hong Kong, but suffers from poor programming. Star TV is not permitted to broadcast in Cantonese until 1996. TVB's strength in programming - it produces about 5,000 hours of television drama, soap operas and comedy a year - is also one of its most important assets and the secret to its future. It is the region's largest and most efficient producer of Chinese-language television. In a region where TV capacity is being added by new, high-powered satellites almost daily, it is the programming, or software, provider that stands to win the most. Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, estimates that TVB has a library of useable material of between 25,000 and 35,000 hours. Industry executives say the figure is nearer 40,000 hours from the company's library of 70,000 hours of programmes. 'Excess demand for programming is becoming chronic,' said Ms Helena Coles, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson. 'TVB is the most obvious beneficiary.' The company dubs its Cantonese programmes into Cambodian, Mandarin, Thai, Vietnamese, Korean and Malay. It may soon go into Indonesia as well, where it has a promising venture with the Salim group, Indonesia's largest Chinese-owned group, in a local television station. The company's main strategy, however, is to exploit its dominance in Chinese-language programming. In Taiwan, it has 62 per cent of a joint venture with Fu Long, that country's leading production house, which makes several hundred hours of talk shows and comedies for broadcast on its Mandarin satellite channel. TVB also has satellite ambitions. Since September last year it has broadcast via satellite to most of Taiwan's cable-TV providers. The company is keen, however, to develop its Galaxy satellite-TV network. It is expected to announce soon the launch of Galaxy, which will bring together the Mandarin channel now seen in Taiwan, a TVB movie channel, western films through Home Box Office, a children's TV channel from Time Warner and possibly others. While Galaxy plans to use the Apstar 1 satellite, it is unclear whether the problems with its position in space will affect the network unduly. In any event, it has a back-up on PanamSat which is due for launch next year.</p>

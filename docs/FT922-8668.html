			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Orissa to move up Indian sugar league THE SETTING up of a modern sugar factory at the Kalahandi district of Orissa by Western India Sugar and Chemical Industries will mark the beginning of the development of the eastern Indian state as an important producer of sugar. Orissa's sugar production has so far has remained insignificant in spite of its having large tracts of well drained land with good humus and high phosphate and potassium levels. It has only about 50,000 hectares under sugar-cane and produces just 20,000 tonnes of sugar a year out of India's 12m-tonne total. According to soil scientists, however, Kalahandi and some other parts of Orissa could grow sugar-cane of the quality found in Maharashtra, the country's largest sugar producing state. Encouraged by this prospect, a number of established sugar producers from the west and the south have taken over the few existing factories in Orissa for modernisation and expansion or acquired licences to set up new units. The Western India sugar plant, with a capacity to crush 2,500 tonnes of cane a day, will start commercial production in October 1993, coinciding with the beginning of the sugar season, according to Mr BB Nagpal. The crushing capacity of the unit will be raised to 5,000 tonnes a day in two phases by 1995. The company will use the by-product molasses to produce industrial alcohol and downstream chemicals. Promotion of sugar-cane cultivation and creation of sugar manufacturing capacity in non-traditional areas are called for if India is to remain a regular sugar exporter. According to an official report domestic consumption of sugar by 1994-95 will be 13.27m tonnes, when production is expected to be 13.41m tonnes. New capacity has to be created if significant export levels are to be maintained.</p>

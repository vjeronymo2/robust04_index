			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 17 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- On Thursday,  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio stressed that the  strengthening of the Central American bloc was the most  significant achievement of this week's Fourth Ibero-American  Summit in Colombia.    When he returned to Guatemala, De Leon told the press that  the six countries agreed that in the future there will be no  bilateral negotiations, except in very special cases, because  from now on everything will be done as a single bloc. In  discussing specific achievements, he mentioned the  capitalization of the Central American Bank of Economic  Integration (BCIE) with the support of Argentina (which will  contribute $70 million), while Colombia and Venezuela are  awaiting final approval of contributions of $70 million and $122  million, respectively.    The Central American presidents also met with the leaders of  Chile, Spain, and Mexico, but they had to cancel their meeting  with Brazilian counterpart Itamar Franco, who had to leave  early. Mexico is already an extra-regional partner which has  contributed $122 million to the region.    De Leon said the Central American bloc was looking for $700  million to strengthen "our financial arm" and to carry out the  region's Alliance for Sustainable Development project.</p>

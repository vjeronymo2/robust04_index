			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The old school lie How do independent schools improve their market position, as recession continues to make inroads into pupil numbers? The answer seems to be: by moving up the league tables. Parents place increasing weight on exam results with the consequence that those schools which perform well cite their league position in their advertising. At face value, this is a welcome development. If schools are forced to improve academic results, they are boosting the fundamental quality of their product. But the suspicion is harboured in some quarters that certain schools have worked out how to doctor the results. After the FT's school survey was published last month, a humorous missive arrived from Uppingham, a Leicestershire boarding school. The Uppingham Newsletter, tongue in cheek, provided heads with ways to massage their figures: Challenge the results with the examiners. 'Obviously you won't want to include the results in your statistical submission, because they are not really results at all, are they?' 'Weed out' pupils who do badly in the mock exams. 'Obviously Nigel should not be allowed to take the A-level. It wouldn't be fair on him.' Establish a 'private examination entrance centre-St Custard's', and enter your 20 per cent weakest candidates there: 'St Custard's won't do very well, but you will]' Recruit pupils from Germany, for example, and enter them for A-level German. Omit results for those who have been at the school 'just for a year's experience - they can't be expected to do terribly well'. Start at the very beginning and refuse to permit students to take 'hard' subjects, even if they want to. The newsletter notes mischievously: 'Nobody would even think of such things, would they? You'd be surprised]'</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS SIGN GOALIE NOGUEIRA FOR 1990-91  </P> <P> Goalkeeper Victor Nogueira has signed with the San Diego Sockers, becoming the  secondplayer the Sockers have signed for the 1990-91 Major Soccer League  season. Branko Segota is in the last year of a multi-year contract.  </P> <P> Nogueira, a 10-year veteran of the indoor game and in his second year with the  Sockers, was fifth last season among MISL goalkeepers with a 3.61 average and  an 11-13 record. In 1988-89, he was Goalkeeper of the Year and the MISL  Championship Series MVP.  </P> <P> "Victor is a good base to begin building another championship team around,"  Sockers Coach Ron Newman said. "In his two years with the Sockers, he  established himself as one of the premier goalkeepers in the league, and I'm  very happy to have him back in the fold."  </P> <P> The Nogueira announcement brings to four the number of players who will  definitely be back for 1990-1991. The Sockers last week matched an offer by  Tacoma to free agent forward Rod Castro and defender Kevin Crow said at a press  conference last week that he had agreed to a lower salary with the Sockers,  though neither man has signed a contract yet.  </P> <P> Defender Ralph Black is still talking to the Sockers, according to Newman,  despite rumors that he is heading to Tacoma.  </P> <P> BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Guard Chris McKinney has signed a national letter of intent to play at San  Diego State, according to SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg. McKinney, 6-foot-2,  averaged 20.9 points and seven rebounds a game in his senior year at Lincoln  High School in East St. Louis, Ill.  </P> <P> McKinney led his team to a 29-4 record and third in the state tournament, where  he was an All-Tournament selection. He joins other Aztecs who have signed: Joe  McNaull, Keith Balzer, Mike Ferguson and James Lewis.  </P></p>

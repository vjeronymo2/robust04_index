			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cap Gemini Sogeti slides 20% FRESH evidence of the deepening gloom in the computer industry came yesterday with a 20 per cent decline in first-half profits from Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS), Europe's leading computer services supplier. The French group, which saw a 10 per cent profits decline last year, warned that earnings would be down sharply for 1992 as a whole and that it saw no end to the crisis before the end of next year or early 1994. Net profits fell to FFr142.5m (Dollars 28.3m) in the first six months, from FFr179.2m in the same period of last year on turnover up by 18 per cent from FFr5bn to FFr5.89bn. The rise in turnover was entirely due to two acquisitions, of Volmac and Programmator, the Dutch and Swedish computer services groups. Profits for the full year would be well below the 6 per cent net return on turnover achieved in recent years, said CGS. CGS did not announce any job losses from among its 22,000 staff, but warned that it would 'lighten its structures' and staff in line with clients' needs.</p>

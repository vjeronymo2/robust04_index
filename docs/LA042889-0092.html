			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CARDINALS' TERRY A HIT AT PLATE, A WINNER ON MOUND  </P> <P> Pitcher Scott Terry of the St. Louis Cardinals, a former minor league  outfielder, showed Thursday at St. Louis that he still feels comfortable at the  plate.  </P> <P> While winning his third consecutive decision, the 29-year-old right-hander went  three for three, hitting a three-run homer, a double and a single as the  Cardinals defeated the San Francisco Giants, 10-1.  </P> <P> "I've always enjoyed hitting," said Terry, who was an everyday player in the  Cincinnati Reds' organization for 3 1/2 seasons.  </P> <P> Terry lowered his earned-run average to 1.80, giving up eight hits in eight  innings while striking out two and walking one, and raised his batting average  to .231.  </P> <P> Terry, who hit 12 home runs for Class-A Cedar Rapids in 1982, hit his first  major league home run in the sixth inning off reliever Joe Price, clearing the  414-foot mark in center field. Jose Oquendo and Tony Pena were on base at the  time and gave the Cardinals a 7-0 lead.  </P> <P> It caught Terry unprepared.  </P> <P> "It really didn't dawn on me that I had homered until everyone in the dugout  was calling, 'Curtain call! Curtain call!' " he said.  </P> <P> Terry emerged from the dugout to acknowledge the cheers of a crowd of 30,825.  </P> <P> "It felt real funny and I didn't want to do it," he said. "It's the first time  I've ever done it, and it'll probably be the last."  </P> <P> Terry lost a shutout in the eighth when Will Clark singled with two out and  scored on a double by Kevin Mitchell, who had three extra-base hits.  </P> <P> San Diego 8, Pittsburgh 1 -- Carmelo Martinez hit a grand slam and Ed Whitson  allowed six hits over eight innings as the Padres completed a three-game sweep  at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> The last time the Padres swept a three-game series at Pittsburgh was in August,  1980.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [PRENSA LATINA at 1934 GMT on 11 May transmits a service </F> message asking that the following item be "killed"]    [Text] Havana, 11 May (PL) -- Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice  president of the Council of Ministers, said in Havana today at a  meeting with U.S. professors and students that economic changes  are being made in Cuba to adapt and strengthen socialism.    Fernandez spoke for over two hours about the country's  economic and social situation with a group of four professors  and 18 students from New York City's Columbia University.    The visitors, most of whom are economics and finance majors,  have been in the country since last week gathering information  on the mixed partnership system and on foreign investment  legislation.    The ranking official said the measures taken in the farming  sector -- the creation of the basic cooperative production units  system, the self-employment law, and the foreign investments law  -- will not change the socialist nature of the Cuban political  system.    Fernandez added that in the 35 years since the revolutionary  victory on 1 January 1959, the country has made noteworthy  success in public health, including a life expectancy of 75  years and an infant mortality rate that is comparable to those  of highly developed countries.    The Cuban people are resisting the U.S. policy of hostility,  not surrendering to it because they want to safeguard those  achievements, Fernandez said.    He emphasized that joint ventures have been established with  Canadian, French, and Swedish firms on the island to exploit  oil, and with other countries to exploit citrus, nickel, and  mining with good results.    Fernandez told the university students, who are U.S.,  Japanese, Canadian, and Latin American citizens, that the last  eight U.S. Administrations have been at odds with Cuba, but Cuba  does not profess enmity toward the people of the United States.    The visitors asked Fernandez about the possibility of Cuban  authorities considering investments that are 100 percent foreign  capital as well as quicker changes in the economic sphere.    Fernandez said the Cuban authorities are willing to discuss  any issue to achieve communication and peace based on respect  for the right to self-determination, sovereignty, and their  political system.</p>

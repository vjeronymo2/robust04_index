			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Former LIG directors get compensation London International Group has made compensation payments to its former chairman and group managing director. The group, which manufactures Durex condoms and Marigold gloves, paid Dollars 151,216 (Pounds 98,429) to Mr Alan Woltz, who retired as chairman in April. Mr Robert Hall, the former group managing director, received Pounds 151,600. The two executives retired before LIG announced net losses of Pounds 173.7m for the year to March 31 and a Pounds 115m rescue rights issue to restore the group's balance sheet. The company said Mr Hall was being compensated for 'termination of contract', while Mr Woltz's payment related to an outstanding consultancy fee. Analysts, however, said the two men had been blamed for LIG's ambitious diversification during the 1980s, which led to sizeable trading losses.</p>

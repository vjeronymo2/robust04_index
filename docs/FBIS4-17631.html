			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Yerkanyan: "The Reservist Call-Up Was </F> Successful"]    [Text] Yet another three-month call-up of reserve officers  and reserve personnel which has outraged the advocates of human  rights and delighted the military has ended. There are clearly  more men on the streets. Functionaries of law enforcement organs  have clearly become more restrained.    Pacifists and militarists continue to argue about the  justification of the use of coercive measures with regard to  those evading service. At the same time, enemy designs are being  manifested as plainly as the unhappiness of the world community  with the militarization of the region. Therefore, which is more  proper under the existing conditions--to enhance combat  readiness in order to confirm for the enemy that the designs do  not make sense, or refrain from unpopular measures that upset  the world in order to demonstrate our lack of involvement in  combat actions to the east of our borders? In answering this  question, we should still take into account the fact that the  Azerbaijan-Karabakh conflict long ago entered the stage at which  it could easily spread to the territory of interested states.    The latter circumstance is the main argument of the leaders  of the defense department.    As far as the call-up itself is concerned, it was quite  successful, as was to be expected. The activities held were  evaluated as excellent by the organizational and mobilization  directorate. Chief of the Directorate General Artur Arutyunyan  stated that "everything went even better than could have been  expected. The plan has been fulfilled 100 percent." Likewise  according to him, "the martial spirit of the draftees is at the  appropriate level" and "an overwhelming majority of them set out  to serve with song and dance and in a wonderful mood."</p>

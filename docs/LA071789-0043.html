			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> OZONE DEPLETION IN ARCTIC  </P> <P> Scientists have detected new evidence that ozone concentrations decline  periodically over the Arctic, as in the annual depletion that forms the "ozone  hole" over Antarctica. The researchers found a high-altitude ozone deficit that  resembles an early step in formation of the Antarctic ozone hole, said study  co-author D. J. Hofmann.  </P> <P> Previous research has also suggested ozone depletions over the Arctic.  </P> <P> The Antarctic hole is an area in which up to 50% of atmospheric ozone  disappears for a limited time. In the Arctic, perhaps 25% could disappear under  highly unusual, worst-case circumstances, Hofmann said.  </P> <P> The new study is reported in the British journal Nature by Hofmann, who is a  physics professor at the University of Wyoming, and scientists from France,  Japan, New Zealand and the University of Houston.  </P></p>

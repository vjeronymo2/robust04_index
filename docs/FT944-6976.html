			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The worries of organic growth - Nicholas Lander meets a woman who gave up commuting to sell meat from her spare bedroom In August 1991, after 10 successful years in sales and marketing, Diane Glass decided she needed a change. At the end of a working week she went out and spent Pounds 4,500 on a customer mailing list and a large fridge / freezer. These, she said, were her passport out of commuting. These were the assets of Meat Matters a company that had been founded the year before by two of Glass's neighbours, mothers concerned about the quality of the British meat they could buy for their children. BES, 'mad cow disease', was rife. It seemed to them that the most practical and obvious solution was to establish a link between producers of safe, organic meat and interested, concerned customers such as their families and friends. Meat Matters initially did not develop beyond a hobby and when one of the founders decided to move out of London the business was put up for sale. Glass, who had worked for Burton Group, as manageress of Top Shop in London's Oxford Street and as account director with design company Fitch, heard about the sale on a Friday night, visited the owners and bought it the next day. By the week before Christmas 1993, Glass realised that she had built up a substantial business. That week accounts for 14 per cent of the company's annual turnover. To meet all of her customers' orders, Glass, four months pregnant with her third child, seconded Mel, her husband, from his computer business. They spent three days and two nights without sleep packing and delivering orders. Glass hopes that, with better planning, she can avoid a repetition of such 'organised chaos' this year when she will be delivering at least 250 organic white, bronze and Norfolk black turkeys. On the Monday after she bought the company, Glass sat down and started calling round her mailing list. 'My previous experience in sales and marketing came in useful. Running a shop instilled in me a respect for customers. Working later in direct sales ensured that I didn't become despondent even after making 50 calls without making a sale.' Gradually, the business grew and Glass's week fell into a pattern. Most of Saturday and Sunday were spent on the phone, pursuing orders: Mondays were spent assembling the orders, and Tuesdays collating and passing them on to the five organic farms (all approved by the Soil Association) which are her suppliers. On Wednesday the meat arrived at her house and was repackaged. On Thursday night and Friday, Glass delivered the orders around London. On Friday night, 'I slumped down with a large glass of wine'. The financial side was straightforward. There were no borrowings and few overheads. All the meat - organic or free-range beef, pork, lamb, venison and game - is bought on monthly credit from the farms but Glass is paid on delivery by her customers. The difficult task is convincing the customer to buy, particularly for the first time. 'Putting out price lists simply doesn't work because organic meat bred without additives is necessarily more expensive than meat bred on intensive factory farming methods. 'Also most people are used to buying meat over the counter where they can see it. I have to vary my sales pitch each week, build up a relationship over the phone with all my customers, which I enjoy enormously.' In 1992 a competitor, Natural Foods, collapsed and Glass was able to buy its mailing list for Pounds 500 which immediately doubled her turnover. Over the past three years turnover has risen steadily from Pounds 58,000 to Pounds 86,000 to its current Pounds 122,000 maintaining an 18 per cent gross profit margin. At first, Meat Matters was based in the Glass's bedroom on a spare table with a separate phone line and answering machine. By the beginning of 1994 it had outgrown the Glass household and Glass struck up a working relationship with a local butcher. He takes all the deliveries into his shop and prepares the orders to Meat Matters' specifications. This allows Glass to buy larger cuts of meat which means some savings. In turn, Glass pays the butcher Pounds 200 per week if weekly sales are more than Pounds 2,000 or 8 per cent of sales if they are less than Pounds 2,000. This means large refrigerated lorries no longer arrive in Glass's street. 'My neighbours have been very supportive. Only one complained, quite understandably, when a delivery arrived at 5.30am just before Christmas,' she said. Customers' orders are delivered by four part-time drivers - two actors, a nanny and a student - which leaves Glass free to make the phone calls and plan the company's future and her family's weekends. 'We tried to broaden our customer base last year by taking on two agents in Oxford and Twickenham but this proved a costly mistake. 'I'm against advertising because it isn't effective for what we sell. London has the right number of well-informed customers but delivering to them all on time is a major problem.' The success of Meat Matters has changed the way the family lives. 'Weekends are a nightmare as I find it difficult to switch off and this is when I must call my customers. But I do get to spend half terms and holidays with the children which I didn't before. And I love selling meat that is safe and good for my customers and, above all, I love being my own boss.'

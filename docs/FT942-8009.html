			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Orly offers optionof convenience - Why UK travellers might want to fly to the newly accessible airport The ceasefire in the so-called Battle for Orly, brokered last weekend after tough negotiations between the British and French governments, means that UK airlines will be able to fly from London to the southern Paris airport by the end of June. For potential passengers the question is: why should they want to do so? There are several reasons. At the top of the list is convenience for those travelling on to other French destinations. British Airways estimates that about 80 per cent of domestic French airline traffic flies in and out of Orly. The opening of the airport will avoid the need to trek across Paris from Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport to make a domestic connection. For many travellers, Orly will also represent a more convenient port of access to Paris. A shuttle from the airport links with the RER, the high-speed underground railway, which whisks passengers into central Paris. The total journey takes about 35 minutes from Les Halles or St Michel in the heart of the city, slightly less than the journey from Charles de Gaulle airport. The more southern the destination in Paris, the more attractive Orly is. To start with, the services will be limited to three carriers: British Airways, its French affiliate TAT European Airlines, and Air UK. BA plans to operate four return flights daily from London Heathrow to Orly, in partnership with TAT. Air UK is planning to operate six return flights daily between London Stansted and Orly, in place of its five daily flights to Charles de Gaulle airport. 'We believe that Orly will prove more popular than Charles de Gaulle because of its proximity to the principal commercial and residential areas of Paris and because of its better domestic con-nections,' says Mr Andrew Gray, Air UK's managing director. Other airlines are also planning services. Virgin, British Midland and Lufthansa have expressed interest in operating the London-Orly route, although they have not yet announced any concrete plans. Despite the potential advantages of Orly, however, there are some caveats for passengers to bear in mind. A one-day strike last week by Air Inter, the French airline that has a monopoly on most domestic routes, caused the cancellation of virtually all of its flights resulting in disruption at Orly airport. Unions at Air Inter say they plan further industrial action in protest against the liberalisation of the internal French airline market.</p>

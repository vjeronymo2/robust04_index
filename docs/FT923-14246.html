			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Mitterrand basks in the Bosnia afterglow IN SPITE of the combined efforts of the 'Anglo-Saxon' press to blame France for the failure to achieve a breakthrough on Gatt, President Francois Mitterrand was looking particularly relaxed at the end of the summit. Gatt aside, he has had a good conference. The international prestige he gained by his recent walkabout in Sarajevo placed him at the centre of the debate on Yugoslavia. His views on dealing with the situation there were listened to with respect and were fully reflected in the leaders' special statement on the subject. It was Mr Mitterrand who proposed that the European Community peace conference on Yugoslavia, chaired by Lord Carrington, should be expanded into a wider international conference under United Nations aegis, a suggestion not entirely to Britain's taste. At his final news conference, Mr Mitterrand went out of his way to reject the conventional wisdom in the conference centre, which the US delegation did nothing to dispel, that France's relations with the US had reached rock bottom. Not at all, he proclaimed. His personal relationship with President George Bush was excellent. They agreed on many more issues than they disagreed over. If their views on Gatt, though closer than before, were still some way apart, that was normal for two leaders representing different national interests. Nor was the French president ready to accept, somewhat less convincingly, that he could make no more concessions on Gatt agricultural problems before the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty in September. France, after all, had agreed to the recent reforms of the EC's common agricultural policy regardless of the unfavourable domestic reactions these were bound to cause. France was as anxious as anyone to reach an equitable Gatt agreement, he said, but this required concessions by all sides. The ball was now in the US court. He was fully prepared to examine any new proposals from Washington before the French referendum. Normally rendered comatose by technical economic discussions, Mr Mitterrand found the predictable economic platitudes dispensed by his colleagues on this occasion rather more comprehensible and to his liking. Even he found no difficulty in subscribing to concepts such as 'world growth is the prerequisite for solving a variety of challenges we face in the post-cold war world' (the words of the final communique) and to joint action to assure that the sluggish global economic recovery gathers strength. Basking in the Bosnian after-glow, Mr Mitterrand found no reason to share the widely-held view that G7 summits had become an expensive waste of time. The debate on Yugoslavia gave him a good opportunity to hold forth on a subject with which he feels comfortable and on which he has well-defined views. And the park around the Residenz palace where the conference was held allowed him to take walks among the trees he loves so much as a relief from growth and interest rates.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Nadir pledges to fight disposal of Polly Peck assets MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, said from his refuge in northern Cyprus yesterday that he planned to move back into the com-pany's headquarters on the island in the next few days and fight attempts in Turkey to dispose of the assets of his former company, Polly Peck International. Mr Nadir, who jumped Pounds 3.5m bail last week, said in an interview with the Financial Times that he would go to Turkey very soon to pursue 'vigorously and totally' the assets of both Polly Peck and his personal businesses. 'I do intend to challenge the sales of Polly Peck assets everywhere,' he said. Mr Nadir, who fled to northern Cyprus from Britain last week, claimed he had a plan to recover the assets of Polly Peck and recompense the shareholders, who, he said, 'have not got a chance at all in the hands of the administrators'. Asked what he would do about those who had to surrender the bail put up for him in the UK, Mr Nadir said his 'supporters will be able to handle any situation and nobody will be hardshipped'. Dressed in a linen jacket and smoking constantly, Mr Nadir spoke in the vaulted drawing room of his family house in Lapta. He played down the urgency of his next moves. 'I will first visit my father's grave,' he said while being served coffee on a Japanese lacquer table by a waiter in a maroon waistcoat. Mr Nadir's fightback plan was confirmed in London yesterday when it emerged that he had begun to reclaim his personal assets in Turkey from the hands of his UK court-appointed trustee. Mr Nadir has successfully applied to the Turkish courts in the last two days to revoke the power of attorney granted to his trustee in bankruptcy. This has blocked action by the trustee to appoint new directors and take control of AN Graphics, a printing company with assets worth several million pounds. Turkish and Cypriot businesses of Polly Peck contributed about two-thirds of the group's Pounds 161m pre-tax profit in 1989, the last full year before it was forced into administration. Mr Ismet Sezgin, Turkish interior minister, said last week that Mr Nadir would be free to travel to Turkey. Mr Neil Cooper, a partner at accountants Robson Rhodes, who is the trustee in bankruptcy, confirmed that he was seeking legal advice on ways to fight Mr Nadir's action. 'I feel disappointed because we were making some progress in the recovery of assets,' he said. 'This goes against what Mr Nadir implied in his statements (when he said) that he would be helping his shareholders.' Although replaced by the administrators as director of the Turkish companies, Mr Nadir is still director of the Cypriot companies, Sunzest, the fruit export business, the Unipac packaging company in the Famagusta freeport and three hotels.

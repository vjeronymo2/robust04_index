			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pillar Property flotation value likely to top Pounds 175m - New Issues Pillar Property Investments yesterday became the ninth property company to come to the market this year. Pillar, formed in 1991 by Arlington Securities, the British Aerospace subsidiary, will be valued at more than Pounds 175m. The company has built up a portfolio of 25 properties valued at Pounds 330.4m, having been set up with Pounds 70m cash to capitalise on collapsing property valuations. Its initial shareholders were British Aerospace, Electra and General Electric. A year ago, British Aerospace sold its stake to its partners, and Arlington's founders, Mr Raymond Mould and Mr Patrick Vaughan, were brought in as minority investors. Mr Humphrey Price, finance director, said Electra and General Electric had not decided whether they would sell part of their holding in the share offer, but the management will retain its interest of about 10 per cent. Analysts said that like Capital Shopping Centres - the Pounds 209m retail property flotation earlier this year - Pillar offered sound management and quality assets, but the success of the offer would hinge upon pricing. It is being issued in a competitive market, following the publication last week of the pathfinder prospectus for Argent, another relatively high quality property group. Pillar has a geographically spread portfolio, comprising 35 per cent office space, 20 per cent office park, and the remainder in retail and distribution. Its current annualised rent roll is Pounds 23.7m, substantially higher than financing costs, and 67 per cent of its rent is derived from FT-SE 100 companies or government bodies. The portfolio was put together by Mr Robert Maxted, a former director of Speyhawk. He will be property director of the listed company, but Mr Mould and Mr Vaughan will be taking on a more active management role, as chairman and chief executive respectively. As founders of Arlington they developed an expertise in business parks, and made an astute call on the property market, selling to British Aerospace at close to the peak. It is unclear what impact their return to Pillar will have on its investment strategy, although it suggests the group will be looking at property development opportunities. Barclays de Zoete Wedd is financial adviser, while Kleinwort Benson is broker to the issue, which is set to be launched within the next two months.</p>

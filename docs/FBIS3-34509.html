As the Jordanian Government denounces the brutal aggression  against innocent Muslims in Sarajevo and strongly condemns this  fierce barbarism, which ignores all values, ideals, and human  rights, it calls on the international community to move  immediately to shoulder its responsibility to save the innocent  Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina from the continuing aggression and  to work toward ending the siege on the Bosnian capital.    The Jordanian Government appeals to the UN Security Council,  the United Nations, and human rights organization to work  earnestly to stop the bloodshed and achieve security,  tranquility, and peace for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina who  are being exposed, day and night, to human rights violations  before the eyes of the world.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Confined space work on ships is extremely hazardous, and accidents and fatalities still occur when the procedures of subpart B are not adhered to. OSHA has recorded 20 deaths in the shipyard and boat-building industries from 1983 to 1992 from confined space accidents. The Agency has concluded that the new elements in final subpart B will address non-compliance and lack of discipline in applying subpart B and will reduce significant risk in confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmosphere work. These new elements include training, duty to employers (contractors), and rescue. In addition, the Agency concludes that other additions in the final will reduce risk in confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres work, including: specifying the order of testing of atmospheres, increasing the required oxygen content from 16.5 percent to 19.5 percent by volume, restricting oxygen content of spaces for hot work to 22 percent by volume, and posting notification if spaces contain or are adjacent to spaces that contain, concentration of flammable gases or vapors at or above 10 percent of there LEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule consists of two parts_a revision of the previous shipyard competent person requirements found in subpart A and a revision of the requirements for explosive and other dangerous atmospheres found in subpart B. In this section of the preamble, OSHA is providing a brief explanation of these two revisions to help explain the final rule, together with a brief overview and explanation of the revised standards. A later section will provide a full summary and explanation of individual provisions, with complete details and discussion of the rulemaking record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA is revising &sect;1915.7, which sets out requirements for the designation and qualification of competent persons. Under this section, employers must designate one or more competent persons. The employer must provide a roster of competent persons, which must contain the names of these persons and the dates of their training. Competent persons are required to know and understand the requirements of subpart B (confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres), C (surface preparation and preservation), D (welding, cutting, and heating), and H (tools and related equipment); to know the locations and designations of spaces where work is to be performed; to have the ability to calibrate and use test equipment and perform the tests required by subparts B, C, D, and H; to be able to evaluate whether spaces need to be tested further by a Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person; to have the ability to understand and carry out instructions and other information provided by Marine Chemists, Certified Industrial Hygienists, or U.S. Coast Guard authorized persons; and to have the ability to maintain the records required by &sect;1915.7. The final rule eliminates the requirement for the employer to complete OSHA Forms 73  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Designation of Competent Persons) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and 74  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Log of Inspection and Tests by Competent Person); <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  however, the employer must continue to keep records of all testing performed under subparts B, C, D, and H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA is also revising subpart B of part 1915. This subpart sets out requirements for safe entry into and work in shipyard confined spaces, enclosed spaces, and other dangerous atmospheres. The provisions of this subpart apply to spaces that might contain oxygen-deficient, oxygen-enriched, flammable, or toxic atmospheres. Examples of such spaces include spaces that have been sealed, spaces that contain or have contained materials that are flammable, toxic, corrosive, or irritant, and spaces that are adjacent to these spaces. These spaces must be tested by a competent person to determine whether or not it is safe for an employee to enter into and work within or on the space.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised subpart B uses a two-tiered approach for evaluating the hazards posed by confined and enclosed spaces and dangerous atmospheres. The initial evaluation of all spaces is performed by a shipyard competent person. When this evaluation discovers hazards greater than those that a competent person is capable of handling, the services of a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist are necessary. The shipyard competent person and these other qualified individuals work in tandem to ensure the safe entry into and work in confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

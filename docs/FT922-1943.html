			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Sydney exchange may join Globex THE Sydney Futures Exchange is in advanced talks to link it with the Globex after-hours electronic futures and options exchange, Reuter reports. Mr Gary Ginter, managing director of Globex, said: 'It's down to the final strokes of a draft (letter of intent).' However, the Sydney exchange is unlikely to play an active role in Globex trading until around mid-1994, because the optic fibre line used for transmissions is not due to be laid across the Pacific until then. Globex - a joint venture between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, developed with Reuters - is in advanced talks with three different sets of potential member-exchanges, including Sydney and four exchanges in New York, Mr Ginter said. The four exchanges are the New York Futures Exchange, the Cotton Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, and the Commodity Exchange. Fairly advanced talks are taking place with an exchange in Europe, which he declined to name. The Marche a Terme International de France (Matif) has signed as a member and will go live in early 1993.</p>

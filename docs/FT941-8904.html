			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: BMW/Rover It must be heartening for Rover to hear that BMW intends to invest more in the business than BAe had intended to. While BAe pointed to its investment in Rover at the time of the sale, in truth most of that money had come from Rover's own cash flow. That limited the need for external finance, but did not provide a long-term solution to Rover's capital needs. Much now turns on Honda's attitude to BMW and Rover. If it withdraws co-operation at an early stage, BMW will have to fund some early conversion of Rover's models. Against that, many of Honda's supply contracts are highly profitable, so a deal may well be struck. It is still possible that Honda will join a tripartite alliance. Assuming that BMW had to go it alone, however, Land Rover will require substantial investment. Much of its cash has been diverted over the years to fund the improvement in Rover cars. Land Rover's engines and gear boxes are ageing, and need to be updated to take on Far Eastern competition. Capacity at the Solihull plant must also be significantly expanded if BMW intends to push Discovery and an updated Range Rover in the US. If Land Rover is allowed to keep its cash, it can fund much of the need. Rover, however, will require funds from BMW if its models are to be developed. The Rover 600 and 800 ranges may be rationalised or could borrow from BMW's 5-series. So the largest investment decision will be on the small car. BMW will have to find a large amount of money to replace the Metro and guarantee the Longbridge plant a long-term future.</p>

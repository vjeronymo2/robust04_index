			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Major predicts recovery in second half MR JOHN MAJOR threw his weight behind predictions of economic recovery in the second half of this year in spite of new evidence yesterday that his election victory had failed to spur growth. Answering Mr Neil Kinnock on his last appearance as Labour leader at prime minister's question time, Mr Major told MPs that both the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the independent London Business School had forecast recovery from the second quarter of this year. 'We share that view', the prime minister said. However, official industrial production figures for May and the latest quarterly business confidence survey from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, painted a bleak picture of the economy. Dun &amp; Bradstreet said weak retail and construction activity and the burden of bad debts on companies had dashed the hopes of full recovery this year. 'There is now no certainty of the recovery getting fully under way before 1993,' said Mr Philip Mellor, D&amp;B's marketing manager. The Central Statistical Office reported a 0.6 per cent drop in manufacturing output in May, and a 0.4 per cent decline in overall industrial production in the March to May period compared with the three months to the end of February. Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist with Warburg Securities in London, said the figures suggested that the UK economy was stuck in recession for the eighth successive quarter. 'The UK will be hard pressed to record unchanged output in the second quarter', he said. Amid sharp exchanges in the House of Commons over the recession, the prime minister rejected opposition charges that the economy was at risk of sliding into a 1930s-style slump. He said the ingredients for recovery - rising exports, increasing car sales and falling producer price inflation - were already in place. 'It will be a recovery based on a rate of inflation that's far lower than anyone in this House predicted it would be 18 months ago and it's from that basis that we will get the growth we would all wish to see,' Mr Major added. The prime minister's comments came as Downing Street made clear that the government's commitment to sterling's parity in the European exchange rate mechanism was '100 per cent'. Senior officials said it remained far from certain that the German Bundesbank would increase the strains in the exchange rate mechanism by raising interest rates tomorrow. Mr Major was ready to order an increase in UK borrowing costs if that was needed to support the pound, officials added. The government's repeated support for the ERM and the UK central rate of DM2.95 appeared to bear some fruit yesterday. Although the pound closed lower in London against a generally stronger dollar - finishing at Dollars 1.913 against Dollars 1.9295 - it lost only   1/4 pfennig against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.85 after at one point hitting a low of DM2.8464. In late New York trading it was quoted at DM2.8502. Support for Bonn Page 2 Decline in output Page 10 Lex Page 26</p>

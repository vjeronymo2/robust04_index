			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Stockholm The market has little in the way of results to provide focus this week. Friday, however, will bring the listing of a SKr3bn tranche of Stadshypotek, the country's leading provider of housing finance. Unibank Securities says that concern over the determination of the country's new government to implement austerity plans raises questions over the near-term pressure on margins of the banking system as a whole. In the longer term, the markets will focus on Stadshypotek's ability to fund its own liabilities without state backing from January 1 1995.</p>

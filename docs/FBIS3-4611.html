			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 26 (YONHAP) -- The Ministry of  Information on Saturday finalized its reorganization plan  featuring the creation of a "New Media Bureau" to promote cable  television, satellite broadcasting and multi-media. The  ministry announced that under the revamp, a general information  office will replace the existing public information policy  office to better handle informative programs on state affairs.  The general information office will also sample public opinion  for speedy reflection in government policies.    Moreover, the existing Press Administration Bureau and  Broadcasting Administration Bureau will be merged into one Press  and Broadcasting Bureau tasked with supportive administration  instead of regulation-oriented programs.    Under the plan, the Advertisement Promotion Bureau will be  renamed as the Media Industries Bureau, and the Public Relations  Bureau as the Public Opinions Bureau. The reorganization  further envisages turning the Korean Overseas Information  Service [KOIS] into a sort of national image center. As offices  charged with collecting, analyzing and distributing various  information at home and abroad, an information material division  will be set up under the public opinions bureau for domestic  data.    For data from abroad, an overseas information division will  be established at the KOIS.    In addition, the national film production center will be  reorganized into the national video production center, focusing  on production of cable television and video programs instead of  solely making motion pictures.    "Under the reorganization, our ministry's  administration-oriented programs have been slashed sharply and  instead we will have new duties to effectively support the  development of new media and to help the nation better cope with  market opening," a ministry official said.</p>

On the eve of his meeting  with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, EL PAIS has learned the  contents of the first document drafted by the generalitat  premier's office to raise Catalonia's autonomy ceiling, to which  contributions are already being made by the two coalition  parties -- CDC and Democratic Union of Catalonia -- and which  will be debated at a specific meeting of their liaison  committee. Catalan government councillors such as Macia  Alavedra (Economy), Josep Maria Cullell (Territorial Policy),  Joan Maria Pujals (Education), and Ignasi Farreras (Labor) are  acquainted with it, as is Joaquim Pujol, secretary general of  the Prime Minister's Office.    The document, which Jordi Pujol has given to various  colleagues to seek their suggestions, proceeds from the  assumption that the Generalitat is the state's ordinary  representative in Catalonia, in accordance with the Constitution  and the autonomy statute, although subsequent legislation has  been diluting this role to the extent of making the autonomous  community's political significance subsidiary. In fact, the  document partially develops a brief extemporaneous remark by  Pujol at his last investiture in April 1992, when he cited the  pre-1714 model, under the Habsburg rule, as the reference point  for refounding the Spanish state. The throne would remain as a  symbolic link -- albeit not the only link -- between the various  peoples of Spain.    The document proceeds from the premise of not reforming the  Constitution or the statute but making a reinterpretation. Its  plan is based on the almost total assumption of the functions  resting with the state's executive power by the Generalitat  government, thus developing the single administration idea;  respect for the Cortes' legislative power; respect for the  judiciary as an independent power (albeit with the autonomous  government assuming many of the [central] government's powers in  its relations with it), and respect for the throne in its  symbolic and moderating roles.    The document will be handed over at the anticipated meeting  between Felipe Gonzalez and Jordi Pujol that is to lay the  foundations of the so-called "turnabout in autonomy" demanded by  the Catalan nationalists in order to continue their support for  the Socialist government.    Almost 15 years after the approval of the statute, the  assessment the document presents is that, in many respects, the  government has a restrictive view of autonomy and an incorrect  approach from the legal viewpoint. In order to put into effect  the state of the autonomies, "there must be a radical change in  the state's structures," the document states.  <H5>  Protocol </H5>   In order to restore what the nationalists believe to be the  legislators' intention in granting the Generalitat premier the  highest representation of the Generalitat and the ordinary  representation of the state in Catalonia (Chapter II, Article  36, paragraph 2 of the statute), the document proposes preparing  a number of legal measures concerning, for example, the prime  minister's role and his place in protocol when he is in  Catalonia, and the need for all authorities operating in the  principality, irrespective of the administrations to which they  belong, to accept its primacy and cooperate with the Generalitat.    Ramon Maria Llevadot, director of the Generalitat's central  legal department, was the technical coordinator of the document,  which was drawn up on the basis of the contributions of Jordi  Pujol and, to a lesser extent, other members of his government.  The document maintains that the current protocol decree is not  in keeping with the Constitution and the statute. The  Generalitat's interpretation is that, after the head of state,  the first place in protocol governing ceremonies taking place in  Catalonia should belong to the Generalitat premier, not the  Spanish prime minister. Since he [the premier] represents the  state, the document argues, his importance is greater than that  of Felipe Gonzalez, since the latter, in his capacity as prime  minister, is just the representative of one of the state powers  -- the executive -- and not even of all of it, since the  autonomous and municipal administrations are excluded.    In order to strengthen the Catalan premier's political role,  the Generalitat proposes a direct relationship -- without  intermediaries -- with the head of state. In this new  framework, Pujol would be the regular vehicle of communication  with the king for all the Catalan public institutions. An  initial result would be the disappearance of the figure of the  minister of the royal visit [ministro de jornada] during visits  by King Juan Carlos.    In line with this is the demand that the Generalitat  premier's appointment after his election by the Catalan  parliament be endorsed by the speaker of the house and by the  king, without the signature of the prime minister, who is  described as an "extraneous" element.    Wherever the Constitution and the statute allow it, the  nationalists propose using in the most extensive way possible  the transfer by organic law of powers corresponding to matters  within the purview of the state which by their very nature are  capable of transfer or delegation. Article 150, paragraph 2 of  the Constitution already takes note of this eventuality and, as  a safeguard for the state, states that "the law will provide in  each case for the corresponding transfer of financial means, as  well as the forms of oversight which the state reserves for  itself."    The central administration should adjust to the gradual  reduction of its powers by cutting its personnel. The  Generalitat believes that in many cases elements of the state  peripheral administration will disappear, albeit partially.  While the corresponding laws on the delegation of powers are  being approved, it proposes using the method of agreements which  will enable the Generalitat to extend its powers now.    The specific areas in which the Generalitat wishes to assume  more powers and which it intends to place in the front line of  its political demands include those affecting territorial  policy, language, culture -- where it proposes including  representatives of the Generalitat in the international bodies  which have functions concerning culture and language -- security  and public order, justice, the news media, and education.</p>

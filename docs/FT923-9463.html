			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Akzo gains 14.6% in quarter AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, reported a 14.6 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit, double the 7 per cent rate of growth recorded in the first quarter. The company said that economic uncertainties and the weaker dollar would make it more difficult to post a profit rise in the second half, but it predicted that full-year profit before extraordinary items would be higher than in 1991. An improved performance in chemical products, the biggest of the group's four divisions, was the main factor behind the rise in second-quarter net profit to Fl 218.3m (Dollars 130.7m) from Fl 190.5m a year earlier. The increase brought first-half group net profit to Fl 424.1m, a gain of 10.8 per cent from the first six months of 1991. Turnover in the first half was up 3.3 per cent at Fl 8.82bn. The chemical products division saw second-quarter operating profit nearly double to Fl 94m from Fl 49m in the same quarter of 1991, when results had been weighed down by maintenance work at some facilities. Pharmaceuticals, the smallest division by turnover but the biggest in terms of profits, posted operating results of Fl 140m, up only slightly from Fl 139m a year earlier. Akzo said growth in results had been held back by the cost of setting up a US marketing force for the company's Marvelon contraceptive pill, for which it hoped to win US regulatory approval by the end of the year. Elsewhere, operating results in coatings rose to Fl 113m from Fl 99m, while profits in fibres showed a small increase to Fl 40m from Fl 38m.</p>

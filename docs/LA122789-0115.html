			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> HANOI REASSERTS PRESS CONTROL  </P> <P> Vietnam, staunchly resisting Eastern European-style reforms that could threaten  Communist Party rule, adopted a law today reasserting strict control of the  press.  </P> <P> Hanoi radio, monitored in Bangkok, said the National Assembly unanimously  decided that "it is not necessary to let the private sector operate newspapers,  especially in our nation's present conditions."  </P> <P> Under the law the government must approve new newspapers and the appointment or  dismissal of editors-in-chief.  </P> <P> Vietnamese people, particularly in the south, have criticized the draft press  law and advocated privately run media with more freedom.  </P> <P> Article 5 of the draft bill forbids the media to "promulgate against party  policy and rules, state law, against socialism, destroy the solidarity of the  people, cause suspicions, (or) make people lose their convictions."  </P></p>

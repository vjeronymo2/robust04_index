			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Factory output up 1% over quarter THE 0.3 per cent rise in manufacturing output in April continued an upward trend that began in February and was broadly based across manufacturing's seven sectors. The monthly increase meant that growth in the three months to April was 1 per cent up compared with the previous three-month period, although compared with a year ago it was 1 per cent lower. The Central Statistical Office said the highest growth was in metals and the sector known as 'other manufacturing', which includes plastics, paper and publishing. Every component of the consumer goods industries experienced growth, with the sector overall growing by 1.6 per cent in the quarter to April. The most marked improvement was in the production of cars, up 9 per cent on the previous quarter. Clothing and footwear grew by 2.6 per cent. Within engineering, which counts for over 40 per cent of manufacturing, output of motor vehicles rose by 7.3 per cent in the three months to April. Mechanical engineering fared less well, falling by 1 per cent, while aerospace and shipbuilding contracted by 2.9 per cent on the previous quarter. The chemicals and man-made fibres industry continued to thrive although the 0.2 per cent three month on three month growth was the lowest for a year. A buoyant pharmaceuticals industry meant that chemicals and artificial fibres had the strongest annual growth - almost 4 per cent. A sharp fall in North Sea oil and gas production in March meant that overall energy output to April was 2 per cent down on the previous quarter.</p>

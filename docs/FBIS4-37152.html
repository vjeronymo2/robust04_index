			<p>BFN     [Text] Another 80 Palestinian prisoners who are members of  the rejectionist organizations were released from prison today  and sent to their homes in the territories. Our correspondent  Moti Amir reports that these prisoners agreed to sign a  declaration vowing not to act against the peace agreement.  Another 570 prisoners who were scheduled to be released in  accordance with the Cairo agreement refused to sign the  declaration.    Sa'ib 'Urayqat accused Israel of violating the Cairo  agreement with regard to the Palestinian prisoners. In a news  conference in Jericho, 'Urayqat said that according to the  agreement all the political prisoners, as he put it, must be  released unconditionally. He noted that Israel's demand that the  prisoners sign any document constitutes blackmail. In his  opinion, the fact that the prisoners are taken to Jericho also  represents a violation of the agreement because Israel must  allow them to return to their homes.    'Urayqat also criticized the roadblocks erected by Israel on  the highways leading to the autonomous area, saying they prevent  tourists from entering the self-rule areas.</p>

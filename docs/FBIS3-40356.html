After five years in the building,  close to the German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) in  Cologne-Porz, the wind tunnel has now been officially opened by  Federal Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger and will be fully at  the disposal of the aviation industry and aerospace research for  aerodynamic tests on future aircraft configurations from  mid-1994 onwards.    The wind tunnel represents a decided breakthrough in  aviation  test engineering in Europe, as it explores new ground in  operational and test technology. The operating concept is based  on what is known as the cryogenic principle, whereby the high  Reynolds numbers typical of the transonic range are achieved not  by using large aircraft models, as was previously the case, but  by injecting liquid nitrogen to obtain a drastic reduction in  the temperature of the flow medium, to as low as minus 180  degrees Celsius.    This entails a number of advantages: The wind tunnel itself  can be significantly smaller, and this in turn makes for  considerably lower plant costs. Operating costs are also  substantially lower than those of comparable conventional plants.    Present-generation passenger aircraft and those of the  coming  decades mostly fly at just under the speed of sound. This gives  rise to locally occurring supersonic fields with vibrating  compression shocks on the upper sides of airfoils. This can  lead to flutter phenomena on the airfoils and result in flight  characterized by irregular shuddering. In the near-supersonic  range, design and fluidic measures that prevent or attenuate  these compression shocks also achieve a marked reduction in  aerodynamic drag and, consequently, make for considerable fuel  savings.    With the ETW, engineers are acquiring an ultramodern tool  that will enable them to determine the final configuration of a  new aircraft from model measurements much more accurately then  before, thus obviating the need for expensive modifications in  the light of subsequent flight testing.    The four states involved are sharing the 660-million German  mark building costs as follows: United Kingdom and France 28  percent each, the Netherlands 6 percent, the BMFT [Federal  Ministry of Research and Technology] 27 percent, the Land of  North Rhine-Westphalia 10 percent, and the German aviation  industry one percent -- a further step in the direction of  European integration in aeronautical research and development.</p>

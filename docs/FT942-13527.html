			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Moscow's external needs this year put at Dollars 34bn Russia will need Dollars 34bn in external finance this year in addition to the Dollars 1.5bn loan approved last week by the International Monetary Fund, according to confidential IMF estimates. The estimates, prepared in the course of negotiating the IMF loan, anticipate that debt relief from all Russia's creditors would provide some Dollars 26bn, by far the biggest share of the total financing requirement. However, the Fund envisages Russia will also obtain additional loans totalling Dollars 5bn from bilateral creditors and grants of more than Dollars 2bn. Russia can also look forward to credits from the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The IMF expects Russia will be able to increase its foreign currency reserves this year after boosting them by more than Dollars 3bn last year. However, success would be dependent on preventing large scale capital flight from Russia. At a meeting with journalists yesterday, Mr John Odling Smee, the IMF director in charge of Russia and the other former Soviet republics, said capital flight was reversed in the middle of last year after the Russian authorities tightened their monetary policy. The IMF tentatively estimates that capital flight last year may have declined to Dollars 8bn last year from Dollars 13bn in 1992, although officials stressed that the statistical basis for such estimates was far from perfect. The Dollars 1.5bn loan approved last week is conditional on a stringent economic policy programme agreed between the IMF and the Russian government. The programme, the third such pact, was preceded by two other programmes. Yesterday Mr Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, Mr Odling-Smee's deputy, admitted that Russia's performance in both previous programmes was 'not impeccable'. However progress had been made and this, together with assurances from the present Russian government, helped the IMF to make the latest agreement. Mr Hernandez-Cata, who played a leading role in negotiating the IMF loan, said Russia had been able to cut its budget deficit to 8 per cent last year from 18 per cent in 1992. Credit growth had also be curtailed to 350 per cent last year from 550 per cent the previous year. The monthly rate of inflation had also come down from 20 per cent last year to a single digit level. It was 'too early to declare victory' in Russia, Mr Hernandez-Cata said. However, the Russian economy had reached the point of no return in its transition from communism to a market-based system. The latest IMF programme would achieve a good result if it was implemented. 'It is now up to the Russians to see that that happens.'</p>

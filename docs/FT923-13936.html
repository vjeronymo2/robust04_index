			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Slowdown for South Korean car groups SOUTH Korea's five leading carmakers saw a slowing in their sales growth for the first half of this year, reflecting the stagnant domestic market on which they rely for some 80 per cent of sales, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. According to the five makers, Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, Daewoo Motor, Asia Motors and Ssangyong Motor, their preliminary sales were worth a combined Won5,970bn (Dollars 7.6bn) in the first six months of this year, up 12.8 per cent from Won5,290bn in the same period of the previous year. This represents a slowdown from a growth rate of 13.5 per cent for the whole of last year and 31.8 per cent in 1990. The six-month sales fell short of the carmakers' goals for the whole of this year, accounting for a mere 39 per cent of the Won15,210bn goal.</p>

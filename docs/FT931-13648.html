			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GPA to send debt proposals to banks FORMAL proposals to reschedule Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600,000) of GPA's Dollars 5bn debt are expected to be sent today to the aircraft leasing company's 100 bank creditors. The proposals, drafted by the company with the help of its lead bank, Citicorp of the US, contain details of plans to raise Dollars 200m of new equity for GPA. The document will also say that agreement has been reached with aircraft manufacturers, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie, to defer or cancel orders worth more than Dollars 5bn placed by GPA. When it began negotiating with banks in the late autumn, GPA had hoped to agree the rescheduling by the middle of January. The group's leading bankers said yesterday that they were now hoping for agreement by the end of February. 'The process is very much on the rails,' said a banker. There had been no serious hitches, but agreement had to be reached with so many different institutions that the process had taken longer than expected. He added that GPA hoped to raise the new equity from existing shareholders and other investors within 90 days of the banks reaching agreement on the debt rescheduling. Nomura, the Japanese securities house, would be asked to play a leading role in raising the equity, the banker said, despite the failure of last year's attempts led by Nomura to raise equity for GPA. Bankers would have been unwilling to reschedule GPA's debt, without a reduction in its commitments to aircraft manufacturers. The company faced a cash flow crisis because of its commitments to buy aeroplanes at a time when it is difficult to persuade airlines to lease them, due to the worldwide recession. Bankers said GPA faced the greatest difficulties persuading McDonnell Douglas to agree to change its contracts.</p>

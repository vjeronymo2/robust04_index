			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORD ON 'TALK RADIO';  </P> <P> ARE THE AIRWAVES TURNING INTO A LETHAL WEAPON?  </P> <P> The foul, nasty brilliance of semi-fictional Barry Champlain. The snarling,  yelling, ranting, posturing vapidity of Morton Downey Jr. The anything-goes  opportunism of Geraldo Rivera.  </P> <P> They all beg the question: At what point do the airwaves become a lethal  weapon?  </P> <P> At this point:  </P> <P>  -- When Champlain, the obsessed, seething, self-destructive protagonist of  Oliver Stone's new movie, "Talk Radio," answers a right-wing zealot's death  threats with his own taunts, or snaps at another caller: "I like you blacks. I  think everyone should own one!"  </P> <P>  -- When Downey, with his studio transformed into a Roman forum turning thumbs  down on a gladiator, screams at a guest: "Even Satan wouldn't puke on you!"  </P> <P>  -- When a taping of "Geraldo," pitting white supremacists against a black  civil rights figure before a combustible studio audience, erupts in violence.  </P> <P> There are times when we gain more insight into television from going to movies  -- "Network," "Broadcast News" -- than from watching television. Although the  setting for "Talk Radio" is a Dallas AM station whose outrageous star is  modeled after radio talkers Howard Stern of New York and the late Alan Berg of  Denver, Stone's movie also directly pertains to "The Morton Downey Jr. Show,"  "Geraldo" and any other program whose frequent aim is confrontation.  </P> <P> These shows draw energy from wrath, seeking to turn rage into ratings. They  play a game of "chicken," hoping to go as far as they can go before swerving at  the last second and avoiding a head-on collision.  </P> <P> The great peril -- a la that explosive "Geraldo" episode that resembled a  hockey brawl -- is that they'll swerve  </P> <P> too late.  </P> <P> Playing the gallant wounded warrior after his nose was smashed by a flying  chair, Rivera ejected the white supremacists -- who had served their purpose --  and continued the taping, earning huge ratings when the heavily promoted  episode aired later.  </P> <P> Next time, someone may be killed. But -- given our spiraling lust for TV  aggression through constant exposure to these shows -- will anyone care?  </P> <P> Barry Champlain also works on the edge in "Talk Radio," which is far closer to  broadcasting's anger mania than is "Midnight Caller," the derivative NBC series  (9 p.m. Tuesdays) whose do-gooding hero, Steve Killian, is a sort of Batman of  the airwaves, using his radio talk show to further the cause of morality and  justice.  </P> <P> Whereas Killian (Gary Cole) runs around San Francisco serving humanity, when  he's not doing the same thing via radio, Champlain (Eric Bogosian) is Morton  Downey Jr. with wit and brains, finally admitting to his listeners: "I don't  give a damn about you or your world!"  </P> <P> Champlain appears ready to go up in flames. He's neurotic, exposed nerve  endings, an open, oozing wound -- an unpredictable abrasion who insults and  verbally mugs his callers, frequently to mask his own self-hatred: "It's  gutless, mindless people like you who make me puke!" Many of the bricks who  call him are fringies from both the left and the right -- bigots and racists  who get slapped down in mid-sentence: "You pinheaded, red-necked moron!"  </P> <P> Through Bogosian's mesmerizing performance (Richard Libertini was also a  compelling Alan Berg type in "Betrayed"), we see the ugly dangers of combat  broadcasting, what could happen with radio and video amok with Champlains,  Downeys, Riveras and other self-serving commandos of the airwaves.  </P> <P> Like Berg, the radio talk-show host who was murdered by members of a neo-Nazi  group in 1984, and the late Joe Pyne, who pioneered insult radio many years  earlier, Champlain is a human match, an explosion waiting to happen.  </P> <P> Whereas Champlain truly exists only inside the booth, however -- where his show  assumes a claustrophobic life of its own, physically isolated from out-of-doors  reality -- NBC's Killian truly lives only outside the booth.  </P> <P> "You shoot from the hip, and this is not a subject for that," Killian's boss,  Devon King (Wendy Kilbourne), warned him when he did a show on AIDS without her  approval. "The last thing is for someone to come along and feed the hysteria."  </P> <P> That San Francisco, of all places, needed lecturing on any aspect of AIDS from  Killian, strained credibility. The irony, however, was that King's admonition  -- although well-taken in a generic sense -- was more applicable to someone  like Champlain than Killian, who, despite his relative bluntness and rough  edges, is a wimp compared to his "Talk Radio" counterpart.  </P> <P> Broadcasting is not what ex-cop Killian is really about anyway, for "Midnight  Caller" is essentially a stock adventure series with private-eye shadings and  radio trimmings. In Lt. Carl Zymack (Arthur Taxier), moreover, Killian even has  the formulaic weary police buddy who goes out on a limb for Jack and gets him  inside info.  </P> <P> Killian can use it. In that recent, controversial episode on AIDS, he hit the  streets and also used his show to foil a bisexual AIDS victim who was knowingly  endangering others with a spree of one-night stands. In another episode --  featuring a bitter paraplegic stereotype, supported by an Amos 'n' Andy black  reporter stereotype, Killian stopped a suicide/murder.  </P> <P> And last Tuesday, Killian got involved in a bank  robbery/hostage-taking/shootout, briefly going on the air inside the bank to  allow one of the robbers -- a deranged Vietnam vet stereotype -- to "tell your  side of the story."  </P> <P> The episode began with a former anchorman who operated a TV station offering to  "buy" Killian and his engineer for the station's news. "Does it bother you that  I'm not a journalist?" Killian wondered. "TV news isn't journalism any more,"  the man replied. "It's about numbers, drama."  </P> <P> The words may have been true, but they would have had far more juice from the  mouth of a less ludicrous character.  </P> <P> Later, hearing about the bank robbery/hostage crisis, the station owner began  barking orders to his staff:  </P> <P> "Get two minicam units with microwave transmitters in place. . . . Get the guys  in the studio to use slo mos, stop actions and instant replay for the killings.  And listen, set up a Telestrator from sports and outline it, the way Merlin  Olsen does it on Sunday." As a bonus, he decided to report from the scene  himself, "live and in stereo." Yes, and don't forget the marching band.  </P> <P> If not for Cole's controlled work as Killian and the stylized look of "Midnight  Caller," the series would be almost comic. By each week framing Killian as a  flawless, problem-solving, zooming-to-the-rescue super hero, it squanders an  opportunity to make an important statement about the unique connection between  radio talk-show hosts of all stripes and their listeners.  </P> <P> Devon King briefly makes a pass at it, saying: "Jack gives people a sense of  community. With Jack, there's a shared experience."  </P> <P> But Barry Champlain says it far better with his hostile give-and-take on the  air and by stealing Alan Berg's line about talk radio being "the last  neighborhood in town."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, some neighborhoods have a way of blowing up.  </P></p>

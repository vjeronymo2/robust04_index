			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Fujimori divorce proceedings Peru's deposed First Lady Susana Higuchi says she has begun divorce and annulment proceedings to end her 20-year marriage with President Alberto Fujimori. 'I've begun the procedure. I have the lawyer and he is attending to the papers,' she said during a visit on Wednesday to a school in Lima. Ms Higuchi, a civil engineer, has been estranged from the president since August, when she publicly protested at a law which banned her from running for public office. She has accused Mr Fujimori, who is standing for a second term in next April's elections, of allowing corruption to spread in his government although she has produced little proof. Mr Fujimori responded by stripping her of her official duties. She now says she intends to run for Congress.</p>

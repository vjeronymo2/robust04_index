The rules, worked out by a special group of the Securities  and Exchange Council, require corporations to regularly disclose  quarterly trading of their own shares, the officials said. They  said firms acquiring their own shares will be barred from making  buy orders at prices higher than the previous day's closing  price.    The regulations are designed to prevent insider trading and  stock price manipulation which are banned under the Securities  and Exchange Law.    A company will be barred from buying its own shares for a  certain period of time preceding the closing of daily trading in  order to avoid stock manipulation, the officials said.    The officials said the report will be submitted to Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii after it is approved at the council's  plenary session February 21.</p>

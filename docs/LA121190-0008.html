			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> When kids learn the foreign lyrics of a song by sound, the results can be very  inventive, Joann Latuf of La Crescenta discovered. She heard some preschoolers  at a Christmas rehearsal warble this famous holiday lyric:  </P> <P> "Felice naughty dog . . ."  </P> <P> Doctors had told Vera Moran of Redondo Beach in recent years that she had only  a 1% chance of becoming pregnant. But she and husband, Luis, who married in  1974, still dreamed of conceiving a child. Their dream came true over the  weekend at Long Beach Memorial Hospital when Vera gave birth to 5-pound,  4-ounce Matthew. Vera also became the oldest new mom in the 84-year history of  the hospital, spokesman Ron Yukelson said. She's 50.  </P> <P> Yolando Bianco of L.A. figures that rather than use the coupon offered by one  taco shop (see photo), she'll save by paying the regular rates.  </P> <P> Nothing seemed more wasteful to the workers at the Azusa Land Reclamation  landfill than to see stuffed toys thrown away -- especially at holiday time. So  they've now set out barrels where people can deposit old teddy bears. The toys  are then rehabilitated by volunteers at the Azusa Senior Citizens Center and  given to needy kids. The Azusa seniors call themselves the Bear Repair Crew.  </P> <P> Lawyer John Welch's jogging track is the stairway of the 73-floor First  Interstate Tower. A mountain climber, he stays in shape by making a daily run  from his 6th floor office to the 72nd floor in under 10 minutes -- an  impressive time for a 21-year-old, let alone a 70-year-old such as Welch.  </P> <P> To honor the ritual, his firm -- Latham &amp; Watkins -- inaugurated the first  annual John Welch Memorial Stairwell Ascent, a mere 39-floor dash. Seventy  runners, including Welch, his daughter and two grandchildren, competed the  other night in T-shirts bearing the event's logo.  </P> <P> The winner was attorney / jogger Alan Chabot, 28, who got so caught up in the  spirit of the thing that he climbed all 73 floors in 13:30. The biggest  problem, he said, was avoiding head-on collisions with employees using the  stairways to exit the building.  </P> <P> No ransom note yet:  </P> <P> The faculty bulletin at Narbonne High in Harbor City recently pleaded: "Reward  offered for the return of the wastebasket from the faculty dining room."  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> L.A. County's first monorail, a cigar-shaped car suspended from an iron rail  and powered by an airplane propeller, made its debut in Burbank in 1911.  Inventor Joseph Fawkes built his Aerial Swallow to travel 60 m.p.h., but it  fell apart on its second run after achieving a maximum speed of 3 m.p.h. The  Aerial Swallow was quickly dubbed Fawkes Folly.  </P></p>

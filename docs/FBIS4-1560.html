			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PICC's Plans To Cover the Nation"] </F>   [Text] The People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) will  this year introduce new schedules concerning both their  administrative management and economic control in order to  continue the sound development of the insurance industry in the  country.    The new schedules will focus on four areas.    Firstly, branch companies of PICC throughout the country  will  be more independent both in management and finance, forming a  mechanism which combines responsibility, right and benefit,  tying the risk and advantage of the insurance business together.    Within the branch companies themselves, there will also  exist  three kinds of responsibility system.    Firstly, general managers, business departments and  employees  of the branches will all be involved in the system.    Secondly, the branch companies will direct 20 per cent of  their domestic business to the PICC, thus allowing the central  company to share part of the insurance premium of the non-risk  and the non-life business.    Thirdly, the central company is to separate the management  of  policy insurance business from the commercial insurance  business. The former is a favoured status business that the  insurance company makes available to projects which are part of  the development plan of the country, such as agricultural  projects. Part of these premiums are supported by the Ministry  of Finance. The latter commercial insurance business includes  life and property insurance .    Finally, the company is establishing the management practice  of tying the responsibility, salary and bonus payments together.    Insurance companies expect that in 1994, the expanding  sectors of their business will be in domestic property,  enterprises' property, freight, travel/flight, agricultural and  commercial agricultural insurance.    Endowment insurance and cover against malpractice are  amongst  current development projects.    By the end of 1993, the total income of the PICC was 49.8  billion ($5.72 billion), a 36 per cent increase on the previous  year. The popularity of their product range varied  considerably. Some 700,000 enterprises had their properties  covered by the company, while more than 100 million families had  taken out domestic property insurance.    Parties compensated by the PICC in 1993 were largely  satisfied. Total compensation amounted to some 27.13 billion  ($3.12 billion).    Among these sums, the domestic kinds were 16.32 billion  ($1.9  billion), and the life insurance 8.67 billion ($1 billion),  overseas business, 2.16 billion ($248.2 million ).    In 1994, PICC will fortify its management, strengthen its  macroscopic control on planning, and begin to establish a  standard system to define the insurance business for the next  century.</p>

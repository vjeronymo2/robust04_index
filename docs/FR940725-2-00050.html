			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In its administration of the MCH Services Block Grant, the MCHB places special emphasis on improving service delivery to women and children from culturally identifiable populations who have been disproportionately affected by barriers to care. This means that FY 1994 MCH CISS/HVAF projects are expected to involve members of ethno-culturally distinct groups in planning activities, unless there are compelling programmatic or other justifications for not doing so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects funded under the MCH CISS Set-Aside Program are selected and administered under the same procedures and practices as are currently in effect for the MCH Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) set-aside activities. The regulation implementing the MCH SPRANS Set-Aside Program was published in the March 5, 1986, issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 51 FR 7726 (42 CFR Part 51a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> $2.5 million is available under the MCH CISS Set-Aside Program to support approximately 50 HVAF projects, not exceeding $50,000 per award for a one year budget period. Awards will be made for project periods of one year. Applicants are advised that support for implementation of planning components developed under this program will not be available through the MCH CISS Set-Aside Program after FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility for funding is limited to a single application from each State. State Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Child Welfare (CW) agencies must either act as co-applicants or collaborate in the identification of the applicant. Each CISS/HVAF grant award in FY 1994 is contingent upon a funded Family Preservation and Support Services program. Well defined roles for the State MCH and Title IV&hyph;B agencies are essential to ensure maximum collaboration and coordination across the MCH&hyph;CW service systems. Projects must promote community/State partnerships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Project Review and Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will review applications as competing applications and will fund those which, in the Department's view, are consistent with the statutory purpose of the CISS set aside program; focus on coordination and collaboration across the MCH&hyph;CW service systems; pay particular attention to involvement of women and persons from culturally distinct populations; and, address the achievement of applicable Healthy People 2000 objectives in communities with demonstrated need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final funding decisions for CISS/HVAF grants are the responsibility of the Director, MCHB, and will be carried out in consultation with the Commissioner, ACYF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

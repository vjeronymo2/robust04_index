Fujian has now  become one of the most advanced provinces and regions in the  whole country in terms of reform scale, scope, and policy  coverage. By the end of last year, Fujian had approved the  establishment of nearly 13,000 foreign-funded enterprises,  absorbed more than $5.98 billion of foreign capital, and put  into operation more than 5,700 enterprises run with three types  of capital [foreign, Overseas Chinese, and both Chinese and  foreign capital].

Moreover,  Fujian's financial revenue topped 100 million yuan for the first  time. Thanks to the fast growing export-oriented economy,  Fujian witnessed benign economic growth in 1993.    Jia Qinglin noted: This year, despite the introduction of  new tax and unified exchange rate systems, Fujian's  export-oriented economy has displayed an incessantly strong  momentum and vitality. The contracted amount of foreign  investment and actual amount of foreign investment in the  province's newly approved enterprises run with three types of  capital in the January-February period totalled more than $1.33  billion and $380 million respectively, representing a 11.2  percent increase and a 49.5 percent increase over the same  period of last year.

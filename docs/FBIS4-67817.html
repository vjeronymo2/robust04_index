Thus, they went so far as to consider the  Elipton a sonic weapon, a biological weapon, and even a  microwave weapon, while the true nature of this  military-technical system was lost in the general cacophony.    Elipton is a weapon system based on gravitational  interference. After the last catastrophic earthquake that shook  Yerevan, U.S. military analysts revealed two strange things:  The catastrophe, which seemed to be a natural one, occurred at  a ``providential'' moment to halt Armenia's autonomist  tendencies and it also offered the Soviet political-military  authorities a good pretext to liquidate the Armenian nuclear  power industry, and thus impose an acute energy dependence on  that central republic; the second element refers to the fact  that early-warning satellites recorded an orbital ``double  lightning,'' which preceded, by a very short time, the  earthquake. That was an unmistakable sign of the detonation of  a small-size nuclear load, contravening all currently valid  international treaties. It was easy to draw conclusions: The  Soviets have discovered a way to trigger earthquakes. Ten  months later, using a rocket launched from an F-15  fighter-bomber (ASAT system), the United States managed to  intercept, for the first time, a low-orbit satellite. The  system was allegedly designed to destroy Soviet spy satellites,  but actually it was the sole efficient defense to counter the  use of the Elipton over U.S. territory. However, certain rumors  had already reached the ears of the mass media -- it was the  time when many people believed in an imminent and catastrophic  reactivation of the San Andreas fault, some sources even held it  possible that ``half of California would sink into the ocean,''  as a consequence of a devastating earthquake.    The advantages of the Elipton are obvious: It is a discreet  weapon, and any accusations can be brushed off by saying it is a  ``phantasm,'' provided that it is used by daylight, so that its  lightning could be camouflaged by the sun's natural light.    It is quite significant, that merely three days after  Zhirinovskiy's extremely allusive statement regarding the  Elipton, the Geophysical Institute of the Russian Academy  organized a news conference on the issue of seismic weapons,  although no one had explicitly talked about such a thing. That  news conference seems to be rather the result of panic. The  Russians did not know precisely to what extent Zhirinovskiy, the  former GRU [Soviet Military Intelligence] agent, had divulged  about the Elipton, and they assumed that Western journalists  were at least aware of the exact nature of that weapons system  and the name of the person coordinating the program, which, as  it later turned out, was not the case at all. During this news  conference they claimed that in fact the Elipton does not exist  at all: ``Earthquakes cannot be triggered except in the places  where nature has already prepared them,'' said the official  statement, which, as a matter of fact, was quite precise. The  statement actually confirmed previous information about the  existence of the Elipton-type weapon systems and about their  nature, and it also offered an exact description of the way in  which they work. The Hammer [as published] triggers earthquakes  wherever there is accumulated tension in the ground, which can  be unleashed by a minimal variation of the gravitational  acceleration. Thus, they can trigger earthquakes -- the  magnitude of which, it is true, is very difficult to predict --  in areas in which over the past 1,000 years there has not been  any seismic activity at all.    The Romanian state is directly vulnerable to weapons such as  the Hammer or the Hole [as published] that are part of the  Elipton program. Important industrial centers of our country  and vital establishments of our defense industry are situated in  valley areas such as Tara Barsei [central Romania, where the  Carpathian Mountains turn], in which the triggering of  catastrophic tornadoes could cause enormous damage to our  industrial infrastructure. Moreover, owing to the existence of  the seismic area in Vrancea [north-eastern Romania], the  possible use of Hammer-type weapons there would cause a  catastrophe in Bucharest, considering the current precarious  state of the buildings in our capital city.    Such weapons might be used in the near future if a  geopolitical conflict breaks out as a consequence of the  unification of the Republic of Moldova with Romania or of our  country's active integration within NATO. No methods are known  to counter such weapons. However, one could count on warning  signs offered by attempts to use them, which fail owing to  insufficient precision.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / People: New editor for Investors Chronicle Ceri Jones, 35, has taken over as editor of the Investors Chronicle, a weekly magazine owned by the Financial Times. She replaces Gillian O'Connor, one of the longest serving editors of the Investors Chronicle, who became the FT's personal finance editor earlier this year. Jones, who read English at Liverpool University, started her career as a graduate trainee with Midland Bank but a year later switched to financial journalism. After stints with Planned Savings and Pensions Management, she has edited Financial Adviser, another FT weekly magazine, for 5 1/2 years. The magazine, which has a free circulation of 44,000, claims that it is the most widely read title among financial intermediaries, and Jones has been given the task of substantially increasing the IC's circulation. Last year it rose by 24 per cent to 56,000 and by more than doubling the promotional spend, sales have increased to around 65,000 copies a week. Mark Van de Weyer, publisher of Financial Times Magazines, says that with additional investment an ultimate target of 100,000 copies per week 'should not be regarded as over-ambitious'.</p>

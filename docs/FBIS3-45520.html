			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Xining, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The number of  foreign-funded enterprises in China had come to 150,000 by the  end of 1993, with the total contract foreign investment topping  200 billion U.S. dollars.    This was revealed during a recent visit to Xining by Liu  Zhicheng, vice-president of the China Association of Enterprises  Using Foreign Investment.    China's foreign-funded enterprises already in operation have  reached 50,000 nationwide and created an export trade volume of  16 billion U.S. dollars-worth from January to September last  year, accounting for 26 percent of the country's total.    Liu said a marked increase occurred in the number of  investing countries and regions.    Among the investors from 117 countries and regions, those  from Hong Kong and Macao are still holding the first place in  number and the amount of investment.    Investment in China from Taiwan, the United States, Japan  and  Singapore have also seen a rapid growth last year.    In 1993, more foreign investment was poured into the  interior  areas than the coastal regions of the country for the first  time, mainly due to the operation of the Eurasian Continental  Bridge which can greatly reduce transport distance, time and  costs from Asia to Europe, compared with marine transport.    The range of overseas investment has also been expanded from  the solely manufacturing industry to such fields as real  estate, finance, insurance, accounting and infrastructure  constructions.    Along with the booming of enterprises with foreign  investment, associations of these enterprises have been  established in most provinces and regions in China, with the aim  of providing services to and protect the interests of the  foreign-funded firms and to play the role of a bridge between  them and local governments.</p>

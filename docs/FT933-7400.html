			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Equities cash in The rallying cry of every market top is 'this time things are different'. It was being shouted once more this week as investors scratched around for props to justify market valuations which have not been seen for a generation. With cash returns miserly and gilts yields plummeting, a grab for yield is the central pillar of the argument. The gilt/equity yield ratio is hardly stretched, and with some utility shares offering income higher than building society deposits, any capital gain is viewed as a bonus. Low inflation is essential to maintain this argument, since it makes real yields on gilts appear attractive. Thus far there is little sign of renewed price pressures, and with commodity prices weak, unit wage costs low, monetary growth sluggish and a large output gap, inflation may not pick up for some time. Whether the UK has moved into an era of low inflation and things really are different is a more open question. Signs that price pressures are building up would quickly undermine the current enthusiasm. One thing which appears not to be different this time is the extent to which recovery is dependent on consumer demand. Personal balance sheets seem not to be badly stretched and the savings ratio may fall as consumer confidence grows. That should also help the kind of consumer stocks which have recently looked attractive for their solid dividend yield. However, that final support for equities - rumour of the Japanese wall of money - will surely have those who remember 1987 reaching for their sell notes.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pace of flotations continues as United Carriers seeks listing The frantic pace of the new issues market seemed barely to have skipped a beat over the holidays as a parcels and freight distribution company yesterday publicly announced its intention to float - just one week into the new year. United Carriers Group, which owns one of the main operators in the heavy parcels and light freight sector within the UK's transport and distribution industry, intends to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange by way of a placing likely to value the company at a maximum Pounds 50m. The placing will raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m of new money. 'We will use the cash raised from the listing to finance depots,' said Mr Allan Binks, chairman, who with his three fellow board members expects to become a millionaire as a result of the flotation. It is not yet clear what stake the board will have after the flotation. Mr Binks said the move would provide an exit for the 35 per cent stake held by venture capitalists, led by Phildrew Ventures. They backed the management in a Pounds 55m buy-out from Bunzl, now a paper and packing company but then a conglomerate. Bunzl had acquired the business, which then included an engineering arm, in 1985 for Pounds 95m. By 1988 the parcels side was incurring losses as fierce price competition reigned in its overcrowded market. Following the buy-out, the management team reorganised the parcels and freight distribution business, adding further services in the same sector and selling non-core operations. Today, United Carriers operates from 34 depots nationwide with a staff of more than 3,000. As well as business-to-business deliveries of larger parcels, it provides several specialist distribution services. The company offers Europe-wide distribution through the General Parcel network, under which operators within 18 countries combine to form a cross-border service. Operating profits on continuing activities, before exceptional items, were Pounds 4.5m in the year to December 1992. Turnover was Pounds 93m. Cash inflow was Pounds 6m and borrowings were about Pounds 10m, against Pounds 24m of shareholders' funds.</p>

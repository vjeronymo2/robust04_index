The late Odinga, who was the official leader of the  opposition in Kenya, died peacefully at the His Highness Aga  Khan hospital in Kisumu on Thursday, January 20.    Addressing the mourners, President Moi described the late  chief of opposition politics in Kenya as a great son of the  country who never wavered in his love for the country. He added  that even during his many trips abroad in his capacity as the  leader of opposition, he never criticized his motherland. The  president pointed out that when the late Odinga chose to  cooperate with the Kenya African National Union [KANU]  government it was for the sake of development in Nyanza Province  and for the benefit of the Luo community in particular.    Saying that the differences in opinions did not erode  friendship, the president recalled 1957, when both he and the  late Odinga were in the Legislative Council, and the many  valuable contributions they made towards the attainence [as  received] of atmosphere for true democracy to thrive and enhance  development. To this end the president stressed on the need for  national unity, cautioning that Kenya was not a special country  and could easily be torn apart unless that unity was upheld.    Speaking on behalf of the Odinga family, Odinga's elder  brother, Mzee Tobias Ajuma Odinga, hailed his late brother as a  peaceful man who loved all people. He disclosed that after the  last general elections, the late Odinga approached him and told  him that it was well that KANU had won and that FORD-Kenya was  going to cooperate with the government. He therefore urged the  Luo community and FORD- Kenya party to continue with that  cooperation as per the wishes of the late Odinga. He added that  in many occasions the late Odinga had referred to President Moi  as his brother. [passage omitted]</p>

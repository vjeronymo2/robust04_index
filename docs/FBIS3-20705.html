			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francesco Gerardi: "As Was Expected, the PUNR </F> Swallowed Its Pride"]    [Text] Anyone who did not believe in the monolithic unity  of the PDSR [Party of Social Democracy of Romania], and believed  that it would yield and agree to share its "democratically  adjudicated" power, has deceived himself. Anyone who believed in  the "ramming" force of the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party]  has also deceived himself. On the Romanian political scene,  things will continue to remain as they have been. At least this  is the outcome of the much awaited and much trumpeted "summit"  meeting on Monday night between the PDSR and PUNR staffs.  Although the "provincial party" of Mr. Funar said that it was  "disappointed because of the postponement of the discussions"  and morally offended by the insulting remark that its entry into  the government had "an unpleasant effect abroad," finally, it  had to swallow its pride once again (after the retraction in  regard to the "Caritas" pyramid scheme in exchange for the  promise that it would have a role in the governing process) and  stop threatening to withdraw parliamentary support for the  present government. However, this decision was made by Caesarean  section and seems to have left some traces. Since, at the time  of the nocturnal summit, two factions seemed to be clearly  outlined: that of Mr. Funar (who persisted in the idea of  withdrawing parliamentary support) and that of Deputy Chairman  Ioan Gavra (who lowered the flag, agreeing to five-party  negotiations for a possible reorganization, only to become poor  PUNR members with something like the "bone of discord".) At  breakfast, Oliviu Gherman, chairman of the governing party, was  finally able to calm down Funar and his people, promising them  that the PDSR would accept the protocol for governing adopted in  Cluj, a protocol which would be the object of negotiations among  the five parties (the PDSR, PUNR, PSM [Socialist Labor Party],  PRM [Greater Romania Party], and PDAR [Romanian Democratic  Agrarian Party]), which will conclude on 1 March. Although, in  accordance with the psychological warfare of parallel  statements, nothing should be taken seriously: "It is fortunate  that this provision (that is, the five-party structure -- our  note) will not be final, probably. I hope that our colleagues  will have good sense and will not get into such things" (PUNR  deputy Horea Pop); "We have gained two weeks; the PUNR has given  up the idea of a two-color government and has accepted, in  principle, the idea of a government that includes  representatives of the Opposition. The deadline can be extended  since it is not final" (Dumitru Pislaru -- PDSR spokesman). In  conclusion, here are the words of a much quoted and disputed  Dambovitan politician: In politics (and, especially, in  present-day Romanian politics) there is always a subterfuge,  therefore, nothing sensational!</p>

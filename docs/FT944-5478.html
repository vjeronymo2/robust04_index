			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G members can vote on March 31 The 1m-plus members of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the UK's sixth largest society, will be able to vote on the proposed cash bid for the society by Lloyds Bank on Friday March 31, C&amp;G said yesterday. The special meeting will be held at the London Arena, which holds about 12,000. A transfer statement, giving details of the plans, will be sent out to members in the last week of February. It will include the 1994 results for both C&amp;G and Lloyds, which are likely to have been announced that month. The transfer has to be agreed by separate votes of investors and of borrowers. Under building societies' legislation, not all of them are eligible for a share of the Pounds 1.8bn cash bid by Lloyds. A simple majority of borrowers taking part in the vote is enough to pass their resolution, but the investors' resolution must be passed by both 75 per cent of those voting and 50 per cent of those eligible to vote in the case of the investors' resolution. If members approve the deal, then C&amp;G will become part of the Lloyds Bank group on August 1. Cash payments to eligible investors and depositors are expected to be made soon after that. C&amp;G estimates that the average total payment to an individual will be about Pounds 2,000.</p>

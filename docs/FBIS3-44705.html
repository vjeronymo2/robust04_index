			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 0805 GMT on 29 December broadcasts the  12th in a series of 13 lectures on "Deng Xiaoping's Theory of  Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics."    The 12th lecture, entitled: "Strategic Steps for China's  Socialist Modernization Construction," is given by Wang Mengkui,  deputy director of the State Council Research Office.    Wang's lecture begins with a brief explanation of the  three-step strategy for China's modernization drive, which  constitutes an important component of Deng's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. According to Wang, this  strategy aims, as the first step, to double the 1980 Gross  National Product (GNP] to provide the people with enough to eat  and wear; second, to quadruple the GNP before the end of this  century to enable the people to lead a comparatively well-off  life; and finally, to basically accomplish the modernization  drive by the mid-21st century.    Then, Wang reviews how this strategy, adopted and  implemented  since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, has effectively guided the Chinese economy, enabling  it to grow at an annual rate of 9 percent throughout the  eighties. After citing statistics showing fruitful achievements  in various economic sectors, he stresses that as China continues  to face great opportunities in the nineties, it is necessary to  continue to exert every muscle to push the economy forward.  Turning to the ongoing economic structural reform, he notes  that the smooth progress in lifting price control and  instituting a new distribution system has enhanced the role of  market and promoted the development of diverse economic sectors.    Discussing the tasks of economic development, Wang points  out: Last year's 12.8 percent growth rate was higher than the  originally planned 6 percent. In view of the constraints of raw  materials, energy, and transportation, it will be rather  difficult to keep up with last year's growth rate. In  developing the economy from now on, it is necessary to  concentrate efforts on efficiency, not speed. Efforts should be  made to optimize structure and extensively apply advanced  science and technology in agricultural and industrial  production. The lecture ends at 0830 GMT.</p>

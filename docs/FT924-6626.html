			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory Euro-sceptics prepare for new battle CLASHES between Tory Euro-sceptics and the government will resume in the next two weeks against the backdrop of a Commons' committee report yesterday warning of difficulties ahead in ratifying the Maastricht treaty. MPs will debate developments in the European Community and its financing on Tuesday. The following week they will start the committee stage of the Maastricht treaty bill. About 300 amendments have already been proposed to the Maastricht bill. Little headway is expected in the two or three days to be set aside before Christmas. Mr John Major begins a tour of European capitals on Monday, starting in Brussels. He hopes to make progress towards agreement at next month's Edinburgh EC summit on how Danish objections to Maastricht can be overcome and on defining subsidiarity - making decisions at the lowest possible level. Downing Street indicated yesterday that the prime minister may concede a discussion at Edinburgh on joint action to end recession - possibly including European Commission proposals based on monetary co-operation and public works. Officials said the summit would 'certainly' discuss economic growth. Any fresh proposals, however, would have to take into account the EC's past commitment to 'sound public finance' and reduction of government deficits. Downing Street continues to emphasise the importance of a deal on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In its report, the cross-party Commons foreign affairs select committee says that EC leaders' hope of agreeing at Edinburgh on how subsidiarity can be applied in principle 'will be difficult to achieve'. It argues that challenges in the European Court of Justice against community action under the subsidiarity articles in the Maastricht treaty are unlikely to succeed and that without a new institutional mechanism for enforcing subsidiarity, they will not be effective. 'Subsidiarity is best understood as a political or constitutional convention, rather than a legal mechanism,' the report says. The MPs also say it is 'unclear' how the changes to Maastricht needed before a second Danish referendum can be made legally binding, while upholding the agreement of other EC countries not to renegotiate the treaty. The MPs say it is 'not known' how changes for Denmark will affect ratification in the UK. The British government, in its capacity as president of the European Community, bore a special responsibility in the failure to find a solution to the Yugoslav crisis, Dr John Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary said yesterday. Dr Cunningham was particularly critical of the Community's and Britain's 'failure of will' in enforcing sanctions against Serbia and other former Yugoslav regions.</p>

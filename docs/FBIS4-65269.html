			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. and British elements, in cooperation with UN  circles in New York, are making efforts to delay further the UN  secretary general's report. According to ELEVTHEROTIPIA  information from reliable sources, the efforts are aimed at  finding a "middle solution" by promoting a new formula and a new  timetable for the confidence-building measures.    Two foreign diplomats in Cyprus recently expressed the view  that no effort to promote a solution to the Cyprus issue will  bear fruit before the occupied pseudostate is recognized in some  form. Political observers who are aware of these disturbing  views have personally protested.    In any case, it is becoming clearer that mistaken or  insufficient international understanding of the Cyprus issue in  recent years has prompted international views and beliefs that  are very disturbing for our case. For example, the  parliamentary spokesman of a neighboring country asked his  foreign minister who their ambassador to the occupied part of  Cyprus is.    According to reliable information, Moscow has two schools of  thought on how to approach the Cyprus issue. One is almost  identical to the U.S. policy on the Cyprus issue. The other is  based on the former Soviet Union's policy on Cyprus--that is, to  faithfully support Cyprus' independence and territorial  integrity.    According to our source's evaluation, Russian Ambassador to  Cyprus Boris Zenkov--whose thoughts seem to have affected one of  the two Russian Foreign Ministry envoys who visited Cyprus  recently-- belongs to the first school of thought.</p>

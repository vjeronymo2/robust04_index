			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Renault sale waits on Volvo: Government to remain majority shareholder, says Balladur The French government will press ahead with the partial privatisation of the Renault motor group as soon as Volvo agrees, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, said yesterday. The Swedish car-maker owns 20 per cent of Renault. Full-scale negotiations with Volvo will begin as soon as the French authorities have completed a valuation of Renault, which is estimated to be worth around FFr40bn (Pounds 4.8bn). Mr Balladur, speaking on French radio, sketched a scenario in which Volvo would sell all or part of its 20 per cent holding at the same time as the government sold a portion of its 80 per cent stake. However, he stressed that the state would remain the majority shareholder' of Renault 'at least for the present', thereby quashing speculation that it might be tempted to reduce its holding to a blocking minority of 38 per cent. 'Have you ever heard me say that I intended to privatise 100 per cent, or even 60 per cent, of Renault? Never, never,' he said. Mr Balladur emphasised that he saw the partial privatisation and the reduction of Volvo's stake as a precursor of the formation of new international alliances for Renault within the motor industry. Renault and Volvo were originally intended to forge such an alliance until the Swedish company's shareholders torpedoed the scheme last December. The two groups have since been searching for ways of unravelling their cross-shareholding agreement. Volvo is reported to be willing to reduce its 20 per cent stake to 8 per cent, in return for the French company's 45 per cent holding in its truck business. Analysts yesterday speculated that the French government may be aiming to complete Renault's partial privatisation before the end of November, when the present 'divorce' agreement with Volvo is due to expire. Meanwhile, Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the French insurance group which is another contender for privatisation, will today publish its results for the first half of 1994. AGF was originally expected to unveil its interim figures later in the autumn, but is believed by analysts to have accelerated the announcement in the hope of enhancing its privatisation prospects. It is expected to announce a fall in net profits to between FFr1bn and FFr1.2bn from FFr1.4bn in the first half last year. Volvo results, Second section front page</p>

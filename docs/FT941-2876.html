			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dublin broker fined over Greencore placing The London Stock Exchange has reprimanded and imposed a IPounds 150,000 (Pounds 144,000) fine on J&amp;E Davy Stockbrokers, Dublin's largest firm of brokers. The moves followed a protracted enquiry into the placing last April of the Irish government's 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the sugar, milling and malting group. In a brief statement the London Stock Exchange said Davy's conduct in the placing 'was, in some respects, detrimental to the interests of the Stock Exchange'. It gave no further details of which rules it judged had been infringed by the Dublin firm. The IPounds 68m placing came close to being a debacle when it transpired that Davy had entered into a profit or loss sharing agreement with SG Warburg in London as a buyer of last resort for 10m of the shares. On the day of the placing, however, Davy unwound this arrangement and instead sold 7m of the shares to firms connected with Davy without informing the market. Several large institutional investors then pulled out of the placing, and it was only rescued when the Bank of Ireland, which owns 90 per cent of Davy, stepped in to buy 9.6m shares at a cost of IPounds 26m. Trading in Greencore shares had to be suspended for several days following a ruling from the Irish stock exchange that the market was trading 'on misleading information'.</p>

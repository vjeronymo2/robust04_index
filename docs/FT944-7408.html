			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP sweeteners proposed for central Europeans The European Commission yesterday proposed short-term action to redress the imbalance in agricultural trade between the European Union and the former socialist countries of central and eastern Europe. The proposals are intended as sweeteners to the central Europeans ahead of the difficult debate on reform of the common agricultural policy. Without further CAP reform, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, the front-runners, have little chance of realising their goal of EU membership by the turn of the century. The commission plans to adapt the EU association agreements with the central Europeans to take account of the Gatt Uruguay Round, which will substantially cut the volume of subsidised food exports. The proposals - which must be approved by ministers from the member states - include: Reduction of all customs duties by 80 per cent where preferential access to the EU market has been provided by tariff quotas. Acceleration of concessions already granted in the association agreements, so they can begin in July 1, 1995. An increase in tariff quotas by 10 per cent per year for five years. More flexibility for the central Europeans to take advantage of tariff quotas. This would mean regrouping individual tariff quotas for a sector into one global quota. The commission is also promising to conclude agreements with the associated EU members - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania - on sanitary and plant health matters. The aim is to prevent a recurrence of the row over selective import controls on animal exports last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romuald Szeremietiew, chairman of the </F> Movement for the Republic political group, by correspondent  Krzysztof Stecki; place and date not given]    [Text] [Stecki] Does Poland need right-wing parties today?    [Szeremietiew] It most certainly does. People need to have  this option open to them. This is attested to by the more than  2 million votes cast in favor of the right-wing and center  parties in the latest parliamentary election. Over the past 50  years, Poland engaged in a left-wing rule experiment, and now we  must move away from that. All over the world, the left-wing  orientation is being exposed as a false direction these days. I  believe that what Poland needs today is not only a right-wing  party but also a sorting out of the entire political scene.  This process has already begun. Before long, only a few large,  significant parties will be left in our country. These will  most probably be the Union of Labor, the Freedom Union, a  peasant party, a center-right movement, and an extreme  right-wing party. I am an optimist but the kind of optimist who  always considers coolly all of the pros and cons of any given  situation. I believe Poland will win.    [Stecki] What was the chief reason for the split within the  Movement for the Republic [RdR] group?    [Szeremietiew] Before the latest parliamentary election, I  was largely viewed as a defeatist and a panicmonger by my RdR  colleagues. I maintained that we should either put all of our  money on one horse and devote our election campaign exclusively  to high-power promotion of the RdR or, if we plan to form a  coalition, do it decisively and unconditionally, even if it  means deciding not to put up RdR candidates to run side by side  with the other partners' candidates on the joint election lists.  However, as it turned out, the RdR aimed its campaign moves in  all directions, and it ended in disaster. When it came to  electing new RdR authorities, it turned out that my concept was  the correct one.    [Stecki] To what extent has the RdR changed since you became  its chairman?    [Szeremietiew] Its leadership functions differently now, and  we cooperate with the media better than before. Jan Olszewski  was against all unification moves, whereas today the RdR  conducts unification negotiations, and we are already close to  finalizing them and calling into being a center-right  confederation. The character of the party has changed, too.  Today we focus first of all on promoting the economy and the  younger cadres, who are needed by Poland today.    [Stecki] You have mentioned a planned unification of the  center and right groups. On what plane do you envisage it?    [Szeremietiew] On the program-formulating and organizational  plane. We have analyzed the programs of our prospective  partners and found that there are no points there that could not  be coordinated. Whenever, during our talks, we arrive at a  point at which differences in details could spoil everything, we  interrupt the course of the negotiations. In other words,  details must not be allowed to overshadow the more basic  concepts. As far as organizational matters are concerned, we  believe that party structures should cooperate among themselves,  first in selecting and nominating joint candidates to the Sejm  and then in selecting and nominating the right-wing group's  candidate to the office of president.    [Stecki] Is there room for Olszewski's adherents in the  future confederation?    [Szeremietiew] Of course. The entire problem is caused by  the unfortunate fact that people do not understand that there  are certain rules to be observed in such situations and that  people who have lost an election do not necessarily have to take  umbrage. I do not feel personally insulted by my opponents when  they accuse me of usurping my present position, but I am  surprised that, in their defeat, they were unable to resort to  democratic procedures and thereby improve their positions. Once  they regain their composure, they will realize that there are no  objections to their joining us in the confederation.    [Stecki] Is the proposal submitted by Professor Rafal  Krawczyk, your plenipotentiary for the economic program, that  stipulates that you attack Polish bureaucracy through the  universal privatization scheme intended also as yet another tool  in the decommunization campaign? Or does the RdR have some  other plans in this sphere?    [Szeremietiew] Of course we do. However, the principal  objectives of privatization are quite different: to enhance the  numerical strength of the middle layer of society--that is, the  group of private owners. I personally do not like the word  "decommunization" because its meaning has become too diluted by  propaganda. I prefer the term "de-Sovietization." It is  de-Sovietization that should be carried out in our armed forces  so that they cease to resemble the Soviet Army in its structure  and its philosophy. However, de-Sovietization implies  predominantly a return to national values and a deliberate  scattering of cliques and exclusive interest groups. To this we  should add revised tax and criminal legislation.    [Stecki] Prof. Krawczyk talks about the significance of a  national identity in both our economy and politics. How does  that relate to Poland's plans to join European structures?    [Szeremietiew] As I said earlier, we should foster a return  to national values in Poland. Indeed, these values should be a  matter of priority to politicians. This actually ties in with  the concept of our joining Europe. Here we have two options to  consider. The first is the Gaullist option, which envisages a  Europe of fatherlands, or national communities preserving their  individual national identities. The second is the attempt to  create a European union of supranational institutions--and that  is unacceptable to us. In many countries, people protest  against it already because they understand only too well that  such a leftist concept carries with it a distinct whiff of  large-scale bureaucracy. We believe that Poles will be the more  European the more they are allowed to remain Polish.    [Stecki] Can you list for us the mistakes the RdR has made  to date?    [Szeremietiew] First of all, we must appreciate that all of  the movements that fought for Poland's independence stopped the  struggle and rested on their laurels far too early after 1989.  They all believed that because communism was no more everything  else would take care of itself automatically. As regards the  RdR, I must admit that we did not make optimal use of the  opportunity to create a mass-membership party, when, following  the collapse of our government, so many people came to RdR  headquarters. We did not seize the chance to use the RdR  parliamentary party as a perfect propaganda tool--which the  Union of Real Politics did so brilliantly with its own  parliamentary caucus. Finally, there is the question of the  latest parliamentary election. We failed to form a coalition  then, despite having a perfect opportunity to do just that.    [Stecki] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

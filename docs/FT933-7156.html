			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Bitter fight under way to succeed Mahathir: The contest to be No 2 DR Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, is an apparently fit and very active 68-year-old who shows no sign of retiring. But to judge by the bubbling cauldron that is Malaysian politics these days, it is as if Dr Mahathir, prime minister for the past 12 years, is already preparing to go. A bitter battle is developing over who will succeed Dr Mahathir. In November the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the country's dominant political party and main grouping within the ruling Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition government, holds elections for party posts. No one is likely to challenge Dr Mahathir's party leadership. But the contenders are out for the post of party No 2. The theory is that whoever emerges as deputy will one day inherit the Mahathir mantle and with it power and influence over almost every sector of the nation's life. There are two main candidates for the post, representing very different strands in modern Malaysia. The present incumbent and deputy prime minister, Mr Ghafar Babar, is the same age as Dr Mahathir, and is a long-time Umno stalwart, renowned for his contacts with the rural voters. Mr Ghafar describes himself as 'just a kampong (village) boy', lays no claim to great intellectualism but feels that he has earned, through hard work and loyalty to his leader, the right to succeed Dr Mahathir when the prime minister eventually retires. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister and Mr Ghafar's opponent in the contest, is a very different kind of politician. Still only in his mid-40s, Mr Anwar has had a meteoric rise through party ranks. Suave and urbane, his conversation peppered with literary and scholastic references, Mr Anwar is said to represent the Malay baru or new Malay, modern in outlook, a man capable of carrying through the ambitious Mahathir vision of making Malaysia a fully industrialised nation by the year 2020. Mr Anwar, declaring his candidacy yesterday, said he wanted to help make Umno a party of the 21st century. But to an outsider Malaysian politics seems very traditional. Politics is segregated along strictly racial lines: the Malays, who make up just over 50 per cent of the population, join Umno while other races, mainly Chinese and Indians, have their own parties. While the Chinese still control a large slice of Malaysia's economic activity, the Malays, through Umno, are the political masters of the country. Umno leaders deny the party is involved in business. But commerce and politics are closely related in Malaysia. Umno in particular has built itself up into a considerable business - as well as political - force. The financial community talks openly of Umno-connected companies and business people. Analysts of Kuala Lumpur's thriving stock market look as much at who is in or out of political favour as they do at company balance sheets in assessing market performance. Mr Anwar's opponents say the finance minister has raised a vast monetary war chest to further his cause: his supporters are widely credited with having engineered a MDollars 800m (Pounds 210m) management buy-out earlier this year of the country's biggest newspaper group and TV station. Opponents say national news is now increasingly favourable to Mr Anwar. Mr Anwar's supporters are also believed to be linked to a company that has gained control of a MDollars 3.5bn private power project, the biggest such scheme in the country. The finance minister has strongly denied the talk about political fund-raising and has accused his rivals of spreading malicious gossip. Dr Mahathir has chosen the role of elder statesman. He has insisted he is strictly neutral in the contest. But the prime minister has spoken out against money politics. 'It is the thin end of the wedge,' he said. 'Give a person 10 dollars and they will want more.' Dr Mahathir is also concerned about the damage a bruising contest between Mr Ghafar and Mr Anwar will do to Umno unity. In 1987-88 a party split almost caused Dr Mahathir to lose power. Political analysts say a general election is likely early next year, both to renew Dr Mahathir's mandate and also to heal the political wounds that might be inflicted in the coming contest. Malaysia is seen as one of south-east Asia's most politically stable countries - a key factor in attracting millions of dollars of foreign investment. Dr Mahathir insists stability will be maintained. 'We (in Umno) are quite rational people. . . we don't have that kind of very violent antagonism towards each other or total inability to work with each other' said the prime minister in a recent interview. That view will be put to the test over the next two months.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- The office of Radovan  Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, announced today  that "the Serbian side has declared peace in Gorazde  unilaterally, thus ending the crisis surrounding this town,"  SRNA has reported. "Under an agreement between the republic of  Srpska authorities and the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], a  cease-fire on the Gorazde front comes into force immediately and  UN troops will be able to enter Gorazde today. This will help  the international humanitarian organizations to resume their  work in the town," the statement says.    It is noted in the statement that the Serbian side's  unilateral move is a republic of Srpska response to yesterday's  declaration by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the position  of U.S. President Bill Clinton on the crisis in Gorazde. "We  appeal to the international community to put pressure on the  Muslim side to make possible a resumption of the peace  negotiations," the statement says, adding that the time has come  for the Muslims to state clearly if they favor war or peace.    "The Muslim strategy of maintaining a state of neither war  nor peace is a crime," the statement stresses and reminds the  international community that the Serbs did not start the  conflict in Gorazde, that they want a just agreement, but will  not allow themselves to be dictated to.</p>

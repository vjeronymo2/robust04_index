			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> BARGAIN HUNTERS HELP STOCKS REVIVE; DOW CLOSES UP 25  </P> <P> The stock market staged an impressive turnaround Friday after an initial plunge  in prices lured investors from the sidelines as they hunted for bargains.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 25.00 at 2,452.48, having worked  back from a near 50-point deficit earlier in the day. For the week, the index  lost 59.90, or 2.4%. The index hit a 16-month low on Thursday.  </P> <P> In the broader market Friday, gaining issues outpaced losers, with 877 up, 693  down and 408 unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume was a  hefty 201.01 million shares, up from 182.69 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> Blue chips tumbled sharply at the opening, falling nearly 50 in the first  half-hour as investors dumped stocks after steep drops in foreign markets.  </P> <P> Traders got another dose of bad news early in the day when the Commerce  Department reported a steep decline in its main gauge of future economic  growth. The index of leading indicators dropped 1.2% in August from July. It  was the steepest drop in three years in the index, designed to forecast  economic activity six to nine months in advance. "The level of nervousness  about the economy was intense this morning," said Hugh Johnson, chief  investment officer at First Albany Corp.  </P> <P> Analysts said the figure provided yet another signal that the economy was  headed for a recession, as oil prices remained near their highest levels in 10  years.  </P> <P> Oil for November delivery fell 3 cents to $39.51 a barrel on the New York  Mercantile Exchange after rising steadily through the week.  </P> <P> Stocks were whipped into a late rally as cheap prices lured buyers. "People are  really seeing cheap stocks and they're willing to take a bit of a risk," said  James Schroeder, an analyst with MMS International in Chicago.  </P> <P> Blue chip issues led the advance, and the broader market joined in shortly  before the close. "We seem to have gone from capitulation to jubilation all in  one session," said Eugene Peroni, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Among the market highlights:  </P> <P> * Bank stocks, which had been badly bruised since Chase Manhattan announced a  restructuring, layoffs and a dividend cut last week, helped bolster the market  as they regained some ground. Citicorp was up 1/2 at 14 1/4, Chase Manhattan  gained 3/4 to 11 3/4, Bank of Boston was up 3/4 at 7 7/8, BankAmerica was up 1  at 20 1/4, J.P. Morgan jumped 2 1/8 to 32 7/8 and Chemical Bank was up 1 3/8 at  15 1/2. Wells Fargo rose 3 to 45 3/4, Security Pacific added 2 7/8 to 22 1/2  and First Interstate gained 2 5/8 to 22 3/8.  </P> <P> * UAL, parent of United Airlines, also moved higher, gaining 6 3/4 to 97 3/8 on  news that investor Marvin Davis offered to join the employee buyout of the  carrier.  </P> <P> * Ralston Purina, which announced a share buyback plan of up to 2 million of  its approximately 56 million common shares, rose 3 3/8 to 99 1/8.  </P> <P> * Computer company Sun Microsystems fell 3 7/8 to 21 7/8. Goldman Sachs cut its  earnings estimates and downgraded the stock, traders said.  </P> <P> * Among other actively traded Big Board issues, Unisys, which is eliminating  its dividend, lost 3/8 to 5; General Electric rose 2 7/8 to 54 1/2; Philip  Morris rose 1 1/4 to 45 1/4; Wal Mart was up 7/8 at 27 1/4, and the Limited  rose 7/8 to 13 3/4.  </P> <P> In foreign trading, British shares dropped but picked up from the day's lows in  late trading. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 18.9 at 1,990.2.  </P> <P> The badly battered Tokyo stock market fell sharply overnight, with the  benchmark Nikkei index ending down 788.41 points, or 3.62%, at 20,983.50.  </P> <P> Shares also fell in Frankfurt in nervous trading, still vulnerable to any news  from the Gulf pointing to a rise in tension. The DAX index of 30 leading shares  fell 19.19 to 1,334.89, a loss of 111.68 this week, or 7.7%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> </P> <P> Budget Optimism Boosts Bond Prices  </P> <P> Treasury bond prices climbed as the market anticipated an imminent agreement on  the federal budget and traders saw another sign of increasing economic  weakness.  </P> <P> The widely watched 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32 point, or $7.19 for every  $1,000 in face amount. Its yield dropped to 8.94% from 9.02% late Thursday.  </P> <P> Bond traders believed congressional negotiators would reach a budget agreement  by the deadline Sunday night, the end of the 1990 fiscal year, said Terrence  Doyle, a trader with Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.  </P> <P> For weeks, the bond market has anticipated that a federal budget agreement  could lead the Federal Reserve to allow interest rates to fall. Lower rates  benefit fixed-return investments such as bonds.  </P> <P> Bond prices also were supported by the release of the index of leading  indicators. The signs of economic weakness raised hopes that the Fed will ease  interest rates.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight  loans, was quoted at 8%, down from 8.063% late Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dollar Makes Gains in Slow Trading  </P> <P> The dollar gained against all major currencies except its Canadian counterpart  in unusually slow U.S. trading Friday after moving mostly lower overseas.  </P> <P> The dollar traded within a narrow band on domestic and foreign markets.  </P> <P> The typically light volume that ordinarily occurs on Fridays was curtailed even  further by the approaching end to the month, calendar year quarter and half of  Japan's fiscal year. All three occur Sunday.  </P> <P> The start of the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday, which began at sundown Friday, also  lightened liquidity because some dealers left work early.  </P> <P> The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen in New York, rising to 138.50 yen in  late trading, from 137.98 late Thursday.  </P> <P> The British pound lost ground and was quoted late in the day at $1.8760, down  from $1.8780 late Thursday.  </P> <P> The dollar finished at 1.5665 German marks, up from Thursday's close of 1.5610.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gold Prices Decline After Early Run-Up  </P> <P> Gold futures prices followed energy prices in an upward spiral but slipped late  in the day amid signs the government is trying to halt runaway speculation that  produced a volatile week on the commodity and stock markets.  </P> <P> Gold settled $2.50 to $3.30 on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract  for delivery in September at $402.50 an ounce.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, silver and platinum extended their losses; soybean  futures prices slipped; grains were mixed; livestock futures were mixed and  pork futures were higher.  </P> <P> Platinum rallied from an opening low on the New York Mercantile Exchange and  settled $3.70 to $4.20 lower, with October at $433.10 an ounce. Silver settled  2.5 cents to 1 cent lower on the Commodity Exchange, with October at $4.761 an  ounce.  </P> <P> Soybean futures fell and grains were mixed during a day of thin, quiet trading  on the Chicago Board of Trade.  </P> <P> Market Roundup, D6  </P></p>

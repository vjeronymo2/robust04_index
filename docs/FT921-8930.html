			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Gap grows between US and Israel over loan guarantees A WIDE gap has opened between Israel and the US over Washington's terms for granting Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in loan guarantees to fund immigration absorption. This has deflated government optimism that it could win the assistance without compromising its commitment to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Tough positions taken by Washington on the issue in recent days have led officials in Mr Yitzhak Shamir's government to suspect that the US is deliberately holding back to undermine the ruling Likud party in the approach to the June 23 general election. The Likud badly wants to secure the loan guarantees to help it cope with the severe economic strains caused by mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. They are the key to securing more than Dollars 20bn in foreign borrowing over the next five years needed to cover the costs of immigration. Winning the guarantees would blunt damaging opposition attacks on the government's handling of the economy. But Mr Shamir is extremely reluctant to back down on the Likud's refusal to freeze settlement building as the US is demanding. The US is prepared to accept the completion of houses already under construction in the settlements. But in the last week it has dropped to 6,000 from 9,000 the number it believes to be under construction, less than half the number Israel has claimed. It intends in addition to deduct a sum from the loan guarantees equivalent to sums spent by Israel on the settlements and has also signalled that it will include in a freeze Jewish construction in Arab East Jerusalem which Israel treats as part of Israel proper. These conditions have forced Mr Shamir to restate publicly his rejection of a freeze, but it is clear he still wants to do a deal. His office said yesterday he still believed a compromise was possible. Israel's police minister, Mr Ronni Milo, said yesterday a police investigation had cleared interrogators of wrongdoing in the case of a Palestinian detainee whose death in custody last week was said by a US pathologist to have been brought on by maltreatment in jail. Mr Mustafa Abdullah Awaki died of a heart attack, but Dr Michael Baden, a New York police pathologist who attended the autopsy, said his death was triggered by beatings, sleep deprivation, being held hooded and shackled for long spells in freezing temperatures and inadequate medical attention.</p>

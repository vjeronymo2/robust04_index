			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / People: Keele professor wants to lessen 'the procedure in accountancy' Richard Wilson, the 45-year-old new professor of management and accounting at Keele University, likes waving his right arm in the air. 'It works very nicely, but it would not be much good if you chopped it off.' This is his way of emphasising the interdisciplinary approach he wants to build up in the new department of management - recently spun off from economics and management sciences - which he will also be running, in the first instance for three years. Training students to be financially literate rather than churning out accounting technicians is one aim of a professor who, although a qualified accountant, is much more interested in stopping gifted students going into the profession for the wrong reasons. Indeed, his current research is into the occupational psychology of financial careers. 'Accountancy is massively oversold. The big firms do not know what they are looking for, nor do the students.' Still in the middle of the research, he mentions one trait - tolerance of ambiguity  - that emerges as essential in a profession that he says is quite wrongly seen as heavily procedural. Starting off in industry and still retaining a string of consultancies, Wilson's own experience ranges from working on a World-Bank-sponsored project teaching managerial skills in the Egyptian public sector, to making MBA courses at Nairobi University relevant to east African businessmen. He also happens to have four degrees - in social research, economics, management and sociology/technology. Wilson arrives at Keele after a very short stay as professor of management control at Queen's University, Belfast - an appointment that, because of the terms and conditions, did not work out, after he had been head-hunted from the Nottingham Business School.</p>

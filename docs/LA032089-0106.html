			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LEBANON SHELLING SPREADS, ISRAELIS BOMB PALESTINIANS  </P> <P> Israeli jets bombed Palestinian positions in eastern Lebanon today and  Muslim-Christian artillery battles spread from Beirut to about 40 outlying  towns. At least 18 dead were reported nationwide.  </P> <P> In the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley, Israeli jets raided positions of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command and the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Palestinian sources and  witnesses said at least 15 guerrillas and civilians were killed.  </P> <P> The jets struck in retaliation for a series of guerrilla raids against Israel,  and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told reporters in Jerusalem, "I believe that  those who deserved to get it, got it."  </P> <P> The air raids in the Dalhamieh area, near the town of Rayak a few miles from  the Syrian border and 35 miles east of Beirut, hit the house of a Lebanese  family who were buried under the rubble, witnesses said.  </P> <P> The jets also hit two Popular Front buildings -- a military vehicle repair  workshop and a single-story administration compound -- and a building of the  Marxist Democratic Front.  </P> <P> It was Israel's fourth raid in Lebanon this year.  </P> <P> Security and hospital sources said at least three people were killed and 30  wounded by Muslim-Christian shelling which rocked mountain towns and coastal  neighborhoods, spreading panic among civilians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Dead Civilians  </P> <P> The shelling in and around Beirut between Muslim Druze fighters and mainly  Christian troops of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun was the most intense since last  Tuesday, when 43 people were killed and 150 wounded, most of them civilians.  </P> <P> Security sources and Red Cross workers said the ferocity of the shelling made  an accurate casualty figure impossible to obtain.  </P> <P> But they said two people were known to have been killed in Beirut and one in  the mountains, and predicted the casualty toll would rise.  </P> <P> As the barrage spread, it hit areas which had been spared civil war for more  than five years.  </P> <P> Shells hit the Khalde junction, south of Beirut, which is a main supply route  for Syrian troops deployed in West Beirut and thundered in mountain and coastal  areas over 90 square miles.  </P> <P> Druze security sources said the artillery barrages closed the main highway  linking Beirut to Damascus, but a road through the Shouf mountains to the south  was still open.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries  Eijiro Hata [now Minister of International Trade and Industry]  disclosed in an interview on 25 April that, as a result of  agreeing to minimum access for rice imports, the ministry will  accept applications for the registration of trading firms to  engage in importing rice. However, it is difficult to understand  the standards for approving the applications, because it is  stipulated that the approval will be based on "experience and  credibility" (as stated by a source at the Import Division of  the ministry's Food Agency). With an increase in the quantity  of rice imports, there is a great possibility that trade in rice  will become a big business operation. In this connection, it is  most likely that stronger requests will be made for revising the  ambiguous standards for approval.    Trading firms engaged in the rice or wheat business,  importation of which is under the government's control, are  designated by the Food Agency. At present, there are 20  registered trading firms engaged in rice trade, with 26 firms in  wheat trade. Due to the need for emergency imports of a large  quantity of rice, more than 10 trading firms applied for  registration in March. However, since all the designated  trading firms had already started the process of rice  importation, applications for new registrations have been  shelved.    Among the requirements set by the Food Agency for applying  for new registration are: the corporation must have capital of  over 100 million yen [Y] and it must have experience in the rice  trade in trilateral trade operations. Based on these  conditions, "the decision on approval for registration has been  made from the standpoint of experience and credibility" (as  stated by Import Division Chief Kyuzo Saito). And he added that  "no firms that have applied this time have met these  requirements."    Nevertheless, there is a strong complaint indicating that  "it  remains unclear as to how the examination was conducted and the  decision was made" (as stated by small and medium-sized trading  firms). Some of these trading firms did not even know that the  agency was accepting applications. It is most certain that due  to continuous imports of rice following the partial opening of  the rice market, there will be a major change in the rice  trading system. And to prepare for next year, the Food Agency  will probably be forced to disclose the requirements for  registration and also the process for making decisions on the  approval.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 2 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] said on Wednesday problems at the National  Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] barracks at De Brug Base outside  Bloemfontein were administrative. In a statement in Pretoria,  the council said senior administrative members had left for De  Brug to urge striking trainee peacekeepers to return to work.    NPKF members refused training on Tuesday when they  discovered  they were being paid at the lowest rate for their particular  rank, instead of at the highest rate which they had been  promised. The highest rates had been recommended by the NPKF  Command Council to the Transitional Executive Council  Sub-Council on Defence. However, the sub-council had only  approved the lowest rates.    A TEC management committee delegation would also visit the  base soon, the statement said.</p>

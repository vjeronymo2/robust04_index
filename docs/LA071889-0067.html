			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DRUG CLINIC: IF YOU DON'T DRINK, IS THAT HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH?  </P> <P> Is being a nondrinker hazardous to your health? That's what many recovering  alcoholics, along with those who are abstinent for other reasons, have asked me  over the years. Their concern continues to be fueled by articles that say that  moderate drinkers have a longer life expectancy than abstainers or heavy  drinkers.  </P> <P> This trouble started in the 1970s when scientific journals began to report that  moderate drinkers had fewer heart attacks than abstainers. This was thought to  be due to the fact that moderate drinkers have higher levels of HDL cholesterol  than do nondrinkers. HDL became known as "good" cholesterol because it was  thought to protect the blood vessels.  </P> <P> The media version of the scientific rationale went like this: Alcohol in the  bloodstream causes an increase in HDL. Serving as a coating agent, HDL protects  the coronary artery walls of drinkers against atherosclerosis. From this it  followed that moderate drinkers lived longer because they had less  atherosclerosis and fewer heart attacks.  </P> <P> Recovering alcoholics and other nondrinkers drew no comfort from the fact that  heavy drinkers, those who exceed a safe limit of about two drinks a day, seem  to lose this alcohol-related HDL benefit. Plotted on a graph, the scientific  findings suggested that the relationship between mortality and drinking was a  U-shaped curve. Abstainers and heavy drinkers alike were dying at the tips of  the U, while moderate drinkers safely snuggled at the bottom.  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, several studies revealed that these arguments were not  conclusive. It was true that moderate drinking increased HDL. But the increase  was in the HDL-3 fraction, a subtype of HDL which, it turned out, does not  protect blood vessels. HDL-2, another subtype, is what protects arteries, we  were told. One study reported in the December, 1988, issue of Lancet shed still  more light on the subject. In a follow-up study of almost 8,000 men over a  period of 7 1/2 years it became clear that many of the nondrinkers on the  U-shaped curve were actually patients who "already had heart disease" when they  entered the study.  </P> <P> The implication was that these abstainers were actually patients who, in AA  vernacular, would be known as "white knucklers." They were people who had  "given up" alcohol either because they were worried about their health or  because they had proof that they had already developed heart disease.  </P> <P> The new thinking was that hard drinkers may die early because of alcohol-damage  to their health in general; and abstainers may die early because many of them  are "white-knuckling it," which means they are leading highly stressed lives.  </P> <P> But that's not all. Other similar studies suggested that a number of the deaths  occurring in the abstainer group had nothing to do with coronary artery  disease. Such deaths often occurred in recovering alcoholics who, during their  period of hard drinking, had caused irreparable damage to organs other than  their heart, and that damage ultimately caused their statistically early death.  Like high mileage automobiles, some of them wore out before their time.  </P> <P> Thus, welcome news that it would be to moderate drinkers, and fatal news that  it has been for recovering alcoholics and other abstainers, moderate drinking  appears not to be protective against coronary artery disease. HDL-2 is now the  good cholesterol. And HDL-2 is not produced by alcohol but rather by exercise.  But bending your elbow and tilting your head is not enough. It takes a more  vigorous type, such as jogging.  </P> <P>  Dr. Pursch cannot answer all mail personally, but he will use questions of  general interest in his column. Write to Joseph A.

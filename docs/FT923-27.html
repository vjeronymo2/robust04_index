			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar loses ground to DM THE DOLLAR lost nearly three pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as traders took an increasingly gloomy view of the US economy, writes James Blitz. As tensions continue to unwind in the European exchange rate mechanism, the dollar is losing its status as a safe haven currency and dealers have more time to focus on the fundamental weakness in the US economy. This switch of attention looks set to continue throughout this week, with Friday earmarked as a decisive day for currencies in both Europe and the US in the medium term. On Friday morning, the Bundesbank council will meet for the first time since the ERM crisis, with many dealers thinking that there will be another cut in short term rates. At lunchtime on Friday, the non-farm payroll figure for August will be released, giving dealers and the Federal Reserve the clearest indication yet of whether another cut in interest rates is needed. The view that a US rate cut was in the offing gathered momentum yesterday. The US leading indicators fell 0.2 per cent in August, some way adrift from market forecasts of a 0.1 per cent rise. The conference board measure of consumer confidence for September dropped to 56.6, the weakest reading in seven months. According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins, vice president at Bank of America in London, these figures suggest that the non-farm payroll figure will be poor. 'The dollar could well revisit the old lows on the assumption that there is every chance of a cut in rates, compounded by uncertainty over the US election,'he said. The dollar closed in London at DM1.4240, compared to a previous close of DM1.4510. How low the dollar goes depends on what the Bundesbank does this Friday. When it cut its Lombard rate by 0.25 of a percentage point on September 14, the Bundesbank gave the strong impression that this it could not relax monetary policy by any greater amount. That view was reinforced by the growth in gross currency reserves by DM44.3bn in the week to September 23 as a result of intervention to support ERM currencies. Fears that the German economy is weakening and that the ERM will not hold together may bring a rate cut. The Bundesbank is committed to avoiding a French franc devaluation, but yesterday the French currency lost some of the ground made on Monday, closing nearly a centime down against the D-Mark at FFr3.3810. That is nearly 5 centimes above the ERM floor against the D-Mark. But overnight rates in the French cash market remained at the 26 per cent to 28 per cent level yesterday, suggesting that the French money markets are taking a cautious view of the situation.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FINANCIAL PLANNER CAN BE A GOLD MINE  </P> <P> I feel that the article about financial planners ("Financial Planner, Broker  Offer Different Services," Dec. 3) in your special section deprecates financial  planners by showing a negative and distrustful attitude without giving any  mention of the many worthwhile benefits of utilizing such a professional.  </P> <P> As the owner of a retail showroom, I have found the complexity of coordinating  my attorney, accountant, investments, tax planning, personal health insurance  and group health benefits an almost impossible task without the guidance of my  financial planner.  </P> <P> My financial planner implements the various financial products he recommends  and sells insurance policies. My time is much more effective while utilizing a  financial planner.  </P> <P> Good financial planners should be well paid; they are literally worth their  weight in gold.  </P> <P> NICHOLAS PAUL HERTNECK  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

The conference relayed the guidelines of the national united  front work conference and made requirements for strengthening  the united front's role in reform and strengthening the party's  leadership over the united front work.    Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee,  made  a speech at the conference.    He said: The united front work department has the key  functions for promoting unity, carrying forward socialist  democracy, safeguarding social stability, narrowing the contacts  between the party and the masses, strengthening the construction  of the state political power, and promoting the peaceful  reunification of the motherland. So, the united front work  department is the key to building the socialist theory and  engaging in socialist practice. The united front work, which is  related to the overall situation, must merely be developed but  not be suspended. The party should only strengthen but not  weaken the leadership over the united front work.    Sun Weiben stressed: According to the situation and the  tasks ahead of the united front in the new historical age, we  know that strengthening and improving the leadership of the  party should mainly be reflected by ideological guidance,  organizational leadership, policy guidance, collective  consultation, and the attention of the whole party. That is, we  should persistently use Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide the united front  work and to provide the united front work with a favorable  organizational guarantee. We should be good at using policy  means to carry out the united front work, persist in and be good  at perfecting the political consultation and democratic  supervision system, and further rely on the forces of the whole  party and the whole society to achieve the united front work.    At the conference, Shan Rongfan, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee, delivered a report entitled "Clearly  Understand the New Situation And Blaze New Trails." [passage  omitted]    During the conference, group meetings were also held to  discuss the provincial party committee's several opinions on  strengthening the united front work in the new situation.    Present at the conference were some provincial leaders,  including Zhou Wenhua, Tian Fengshan, Chen Yunlin, An Zhendong,  Qi Guiyuan, Zhou Tienong, Huang Feng, Fu Shiying, Guo Shouchang,  Tan Fangzhi, (Zhao Shijie), (Chen Taiyuan), Wang Zhitian, and Wu  Dinghe.</p>

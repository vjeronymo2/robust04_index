			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand has asked Brunei to step up economic  cooperation by jointly investing in a fertiliser plant and  buying more rice, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said  yesterday.    Brunei's Foreign Minister Prince Mohamed Bolkiah said he  would consider the proposal to enter a joint venture to produce  fertiliser from Brunei, Squadron Leader Prasong said.    Brunei has limited investments overseas because it is a  small  country, Sqn. Ldr. Prasong quoted the prince as saying.    But there was no word on Thailand's proposal to buy more  rice.    "We asked Brunei to buy more Thai rice because Thailand  continues to suffer a deficit in bilateral trade," Sqn. Ldr.  Prasong said.    Prince Bolkiah heads home today at the end of a three-day  visit.    He paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister Chuan Likphai at  Government House yesterday.    Discussions over the past three days also covered  opportunities for Thai workers in Brunei.    According to Sqn Ldr Prasong, Brunei is satisfied with the  performance of Thai workers and prospects for them may broaden  as the oil-rich state puts more effort into development.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (10): Nation that is building the apparatus from scratch - Ukraine As yet, the privatisation process in the Ukraine has hardly begun and foreign investors are holding back until the authorities can show that they are able to run an independent currency The bitter dispute between Russia and the Ukraine over control of the Black Sea Fleet in recent months underlined, in an extreme way, the problems attached to establishing ownership rights in this part of the world. After several months of increasingly tense negotiations and stand-offs Mr Boris Yeltsin the Russian president and Mr Leonid Kravchuk his Ukrainian counterpart, agreed at their Black Sea resort meeting last month that the fleet would be divided between the two states. They discussed the basic ground rules for future trade and other relations following Ukraine's decision in principle to leave the rouble zone and issue its own currency. While weighty issues such as these were still pending it proved difficult for the Ukrainian authorities to move ahead with important economic reforms, such as implementing the privatisation process for which most of the legislation is in place. Ukraine, the largest of the new states to emerge from the break up of the Soviet empire with over 50m inhabitants and an area greater than France, has virtually had to build a state and government apparatus from scratch. Both the president and Mr Vitold Fokin, the prime minister, are former communist apparatchiks and there is a dangerous lack of experienced personnel to staff the new ministries and the institutions needed to transform an economy based on heavy industry, mining and large scale collective grain farming. All these problems particularly the shortage of competent staff, are common to the entire area, but in Ukraine with its ambitions to become a fully developed European state after centuries of subservience, the scale is bigger because the country is so big. For this reason, Ukraine is a good place to observe the inter-connectedness of the privatisation process with economic and financial reform in general. During a recent visit to London, Mr Volodymyr Lanovoi, the privatisation minister, sought to attract foreign investment by explaining the new foreign investment law, which has now approved by parliament, within the broader context of plans to privatise 65 per cent of its nearly 10,000 large and medium-sized enterprsies within five years. As yet, privatisation has hardly begun and foreign investors are holding back until the authorities can show that they are able to run an independent currency. Hambros Bank is advising the government on monetary and privatisation issues and Sir Michael Butler, who formerly headed the UK permanent mission in Brussels and is one of the leaders of the Hambros team, emphasises that Ukraine's top priority must be to establish its monetary and fiscal credibility and above all tackle the problem of fast mounting inter-enterprise debts. Without tight control of monetary policy and a serious effort to curb enterprise indebtedness Ukraine risks hyper-inflation which would destroy the credibility of its a planned new currency at the outset and make it virtually impossible to proceed with privatisation. Ukraine is getting similar warnings from the IMF and World Bank. On a recent visit to Kiev, Mr Larry Summers, the World Bank's chief economist warned that 'without more rapid reforms a new currency would be a very perilous undertaking'. What was needed he said was 'the familiar trinity of stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation'. But privatisation existed 'only on paper'. To underline the point Mr Lanovoi recently threatened to resign unless the present government, staffed largely by former communists, was re-organised and a new committment shown to putting privatisation and other reforms into practice. An example of the kind of problems which lie ahead as the economy moves to market methods came last month when Germany decided top withdraw from the Krivoi Rog iron ore project on which several hundred million dollars has already been spent by Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania as well as Ukraine. Designed to supply iron ore to the steel industries of all the partners, the application of western accounting methods demonstrated that the ore was too poor and production costs too high to compete with imports. On the same basis, a high proportion of Ukraine's coal, engineering and chemical production will also find it difficult to attract new investors and compete in world markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>   [Text] Defence chiefs will next week begin the  controversial decommissioning of the Royal Navy's brand new  1-billion-pound fleet of Upholder submarines, the Press  Association disclosed today.    The 2,400-ton HMS Unseen will officially leave naval service  at a sad ceremony at Devonport on April 6 after just a few  months of operational work. HMS Upholder will be  decommissioned shortly afterwards and the other two vessels --  Ursula and Unicorn -- will follow later in the year.    There is widespread dismay in the Navy that swingeing  defence  cuts has forced admirals to part with the conventionally powered  Upholders -- the most advanced submarines of their type in the  world. But the boats, which were originally designed for Cold  War operations in the Greenland/Iceland Gap, will be either  sold, leased or put into storage.    A significant number of countries have expressed a keen  interest in buying or leasing the submarines. They are  understood to include India, Pakistan and Malaysia, which  despite the current row over the arms for aid allegations still  has a military requirement for submarines.    Saudi Arabia is also very interested as it is anxious to  acquire underwater capability in the Gulf, because of Iran's  decision to buy three Russian Kilo submarines that could  threaten a third of the world's oil supplies. The Iranians are  also building mini-submarines that could be used for  terrorist-style attacks as part of a huge programme to rearm  their war machine. The Upholders would be ideal for  operations in the shallow waters of the Gulf, as naval experts  agree that nuclear submarines are more suited to deep water. As  the Upholders are highly sophisticated vessels, the Navy could  provide most, if not all, of the 44-strong crew if a leasing  plan is approved.    The move would be warmly welcomed by the Gulf states, such  as  Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. It would have the  knock-on benefit of releasing Royal Navy frigates and destroyers  tied up on the Armilla Patrol, which was set up in 1980. There  is already a precedent for British forces operating for a  foreign power. An infantry battalion of Army Gurkhas is based  in Brunei, with the costs paid for by the Sultan.</p>

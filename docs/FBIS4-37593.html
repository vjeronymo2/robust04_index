			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 23 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received Russian  Ambassador Vladimir Polyakov.    The ambassador said later that on the instructions of the  Russian leadership he had requested a meeting with the League's  secretary general to exchange views on the latest developments  in Yemen.    He pointed out that Russia and the League are cooperating  and  coordinating their stance on resolving the Yemeni crisis, noting  that this cooperation takes a diplomatic and political form.    The Russian ambassador explained that when the war broke  out,  his country appealed to the warring parties in Yemen to stop  fighting and initiate a dialogue to solve their problems.    Polyakov pointed out that Russia's recognition of south  Yemen  will depend on the findings included in UN envoy Lakhdar  Brahimi's report to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali  on the crisis. He denied reports claiming that Russia is  supplying south Yemen with weapons and assistance in view of the  close ties linking Moscow with south Yemen in the past.    He said Russia halted all weapons supplies to the Yemeni  parties when the Yemeni crisis began and before fighting broke  out.</p>

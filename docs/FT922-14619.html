			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / France and US fail to resolve air route row THE risk of disruption to flights between France and the US moved closer over the weekend, as the Saturday deadline set by Washington and Paris for the resolution of a row over route capacity passed without agreement. Paris has said that failing an accord, it will limit the rise in US transatlantic traffic to and from France to 15 per cent, well below the 40 per cent increase the US Department of Transport has demanded on behalf of the eight leading US carriers. Washington has warned it would probably retaliate. This is the latest round in the struggle by Air France and other European airlines against competition from larger US groups on the most attractive transatlantic routes. It also worsens US-French trade relations, already strained by disagreements over farm subsidies in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Air France yesterday repeated its determination to resist. 'In giving satisfaction to US demands, one would create overcapacity on airline routes between France and the US, which would seriously harm the profitability of all companies on these routes,' said Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France. The French national carrier derives 15 per cent of annual sales from transatlantic flights. The fact that two US airlines, TWA and Continental, were under Chapter 11 protection from creditors 'was not compatible with the principle of fair competition' set out in the Franco-US accord on air transport, he added. The US argues that coming from state-owned Air France, this argument is hard to accept. Air France had no information yesterday on how or when Paris planned to act, but civil aviation authority officials had earlier warned that they were not afraid to take 'authoritarian action'. France opposes Washington's demands on the grounds that it believes traffic between the two is set to rise by only 10 per cent this year. Thus a 40 per cent rise in the US allocation would further erode France's share of the transatlantic market. It has fallen steadily to 30 per cent since US airline deregulation, with the US carriers taking the remaining 70 per cent.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks pick up from recent lows Wall Street US stocks posted modest gains yesterday as the bond market rebounded and this week's flood of corporate results slowed to a trickle, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 10.36 firmer at 3,730.83, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.67 ahead at 454.24. Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 246m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite closed a slight 0.14 softer at 433.88, but the Nasdaq composite edged ahead 0.30 to 712.43. After a weak opening, equities made a decisive push into positive territory, in spite of the approach of a potential stumbling block this morning, when the government will release its preliminary estimate of second-quarter economic growth. The market was particularly vulnerable to a strong reading because of the threat of an imminent increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Investors received a further suggestion of economic strength yesterday when the Labor Department reported a sharper than expected decline in claims for unemployment benefit last week, but jitters triggered by the report were shortlived. The employment news, which came on the heels of a sharp rise in durable goods orders the previous session, depressed bond prices. However, economists later dismissed the significance of the reading as a technical aberration, allowing Treasuries to recover. The activity was closely mirrored by the stock market until the final hours of trading, when prices sagged a bit. With the quarterly reporting season drawing to a close, there were a few latecomers to pepper the morning with their results. General Motors, last of the Big Three car makers to report, seemed to benefit from its tardiness. GM's share price gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 50 1/4 after it revealed record second-quarter earnings, in contrast with Ford and Chrysler, whose strong performances had gone unrewarded. Yesterday, however, Ford appreciated Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 and Chrysler put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 47 5/8 . 3M advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 1/2 in a delayed reaction to its results, posted a day earlier. But Alcoa retreated Dollars 1 to Dollars 76 7/8 and United Technologies shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 3/8 . On the negative side, shares in Wellpoint Health Networks lost 18 per cent of their value after the company posted earnings of 50 cents a share, against expectations of 54 cents. The stock was down Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 25 in heavy volume. In an ironic twist, Wellpoint's disappointing performance fuelled speculation that it would launch a bid for Intergroup Healthcare, which rose 25 per cent, or Dollars 9 1/2 , to Dollars 47 1/2 . Acquisition news also buffeted the share price of Williams. The stock climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 on a report that it was close to accepting a sweetened Dollars 2.5bn offer from LDDS Communications for its long-distance telephone operation. On the Nasdaq, LDDS moved up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 19. IDB Communications, a second LDDS takeover target, slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 on reports that the completion of a deal was contingent on an audit of IDB finances. Canada Toronto ended mixed after a sluggish session, with more of the same expected today ahead of Canada's August Civic Holiday long weekend. Gains in conglomerates, real estate and financial services outpaced losses in gold shares, forestry and merchandising, but overall falls outscored rises by 373 to 343. The TSE 300 composite index gained 15.8 at 4,149.8 in turnover of 59.7m shares valued at CDollars 626.5m. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo rose as a new electoral poll showed market favourite Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso leading his leftist rival for the October 3 presidential election. The Bovespa index closed 1,053, or 2.5 per cent, higher at 42,553. The Datafolha poll, published yesterday, showed 47 per cent support for Mr Cardoso, a moderate, against 40 per cent for Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party, who had been the front-runner for months. Mr Cardoso, who as finance minister assembled the government's economic plan, is gaining support due to lowered inflation. Since Brazil's new currency, the real, was introduced on July 1, inflation has dropped to 6 per cent this month from 50 per cent in June.</p>

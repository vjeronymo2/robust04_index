			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Govett Oriental assets up 30% THE STRONG performance of Far Eastern stock markets helped Govett Oriental Investment Trust to increase net assets per share by 30 per cent over the six months to September 30. At 341.01p per share the net asset value was 83 per cent higher than the 186.3p of a year earlier. The result makes it the best performing investment trust in its sector of Far East, including Japan, over the year to October 1, based on mid-market to mid-market valuations with net income reinvested, according to Micropal. Mr Charles Fowler, who manages the trust, said the geographical split of assets at the end of September was Japan (25 per cent), Malaysia (13.3), Singapore (12.6), Hong Kong (12.5), Korea (9), Indonesia (5.7), Taiwan (4.6), Thailand (4.4), Australia (3.8), UK (3.3), Philippines (3.1), India (1.0) and others (3.5). The trust's performance during the year benefited from the high weightings in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, accordingly to Mr Fowler, although he has gradually reduced his holdings in those countries in the wake of the rapid rise in share prices. Total net assets at the end of September were Pounds 612.7m, making Govett Oriental one of the UK's largest investment trusts. Revenue attributable to shareholders in the six months to the end of September was Pounds 1.81m, against Pounds 1.77m, equivalent to earnings per share of 1p (0.98p). The interim dividend is maintained at 0.4p.</p>

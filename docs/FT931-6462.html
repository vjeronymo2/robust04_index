			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Scottish bank offers bonuses for charging customers more ROYAL Bank of Scotland was yesterday criticised by the Labour party for introducing an incentive scheme which offers bonuses to employees who increase the number of account charges levied on customers. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said the Performance Plus scheme was 'the last straw for many small businesses'. He said it undermined banks' claims to treat customers sensitively, and on an individual basis. The Royal Bank scheme, introduced on a trial basis from February to April, sets a target for each branch to raise its collection of ancillary charges such as those levied for returning 'bounced' personal and business cheques. Each branch has a second target to increase the number of customers opening savings accounts. Employees at a branch which meets one of the two targets will receive Pounds 40 a quarter, and those at a branch which meets both will get Pounds 100. All retail banks have been trying to raise income from account charges and other fees to compensate for high bad debts. Royal Bank raised its commission and fee income by 23 per cent to Pounds 391m in the year to last September. Mr Griffiths called on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to investigate banks' charges. The call followed an attack on banks' treatment of small businesses last month by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. Banks have figured heavily in Labour's recent attacks on the government for protecting the vested interests of big business. Using a parliamentary early day motion, Mr Griffiths urged Lord Younger, Royal Bank's chairman and a former cabinet minister, to end the scheme. He said many businesses and individuals were already unable to meet bank charges. Mr Tony Schofield, Royal Bank's managing director for branch banking, said the scheme was the first attempt by the bank to provide incentives to clerical staff to meet business targets similar to those already in place for managers. Mr Schofield said the bank was not curtailing managers' discretion. 'We want to curtail acts of omission by staff who fail to apply standard charges because of a busy daily schedule,' he said. The bank had identified a 'significant amount of leakage' due to staff failing to impose standard charges. Mr Schofield said some of these charges were levied by computer at other banks, and might also be at Royal Bank within two years. Mr Sandy Boyle, assistant secretary of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, said Performance Plus was 'an ill-conceived scheme' which would create tension between Royal Bank's 13,500 branch staff and its customers. Banks have placed more emphasis on collecting fees and charges on personal accounts because the fall in base rates has reduced earnings from such accounts. Royal Bank does not charge customers who remain less than Pounds 100 overdrawn.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Fears on US interest rates prompted the biggest one day retreat in stock index futures for more than six years as the March contract crashed through the 3,300 level in heavy trading, writes Joel Kibazo. At the official close, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 stood at 3,246 having traded as low as 3,241 earlier in the session, around 100 points below its previous close. The firm opening at 3,307 initially indicated a steady if poor day and a few buyers at the start of trading pushed March to 3,311. But the weakness in the bond markets sparked a sell off sending March sliding lower for most of the session. Mr Neil Treloar at NatWest Markets said: 'We had one eye on the gilts and the other on German bunds. It was hectic selling.' At the official close March was at a 22 point discount to cash, though further selling in after hours trading widened the discount. Volume was a hefty 30,817 contracts. The traded options also had one of its busiest day's in recent sessions as turnover rose to 74,821 contracts. Some 33,973 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 contract and 12,229 was traded in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. British Gas was the busiest option with a total of 11,264 lots. Volume in the mid FTSE futures traded on the OMLX was poor with a mere 131 lots dealt by the close.</p>

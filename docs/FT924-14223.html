			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: A million miles from Mammy - Crazy cocktails of sound are enlivening modern movies We all know what happened in 1927. Audiences were struck dumb by the sight of a grown man opening his lips and saying 'Mammy]' The film was The Jazz Singer, the man was Al Jolson. And the cultural milestone was the coming of talking pictures. 'Talking' pictures. It is a perversity of history that the phrase has stuck. For sound in cinema today means far more than human voices cluttering the soundtrack with phonemes; or than those same human voices struggling between dialogue scenes with the massed mayhem of a Hollywood score. Go to a modern action feature and you will hear 570 varieties of breaking glass, explosions and crunching cars; to a cartoon, and you'll be offered umpteen permutations on the squawk, the thud, the bang, the screech; to a horror film, and you'll experience an echo-chamber of subtle sonic scares devised by mad sound scientists deep in their labs. I met such a group on my last fact-finding visit to Tinseltown. Weddington Productions in North Hollywood are top people in their business. They had just finished working on Disney's Beauty And The Beast when I arrived (opening in Britain this week) and before that they put the sonic overdrive into films like Poltergeist, Raiders Of The Last Ark, Die Hard and Total Recall. At first I was given a verbal tour of the basics. How sound libraries grow with each technologically groundbreaking film. (Total Recall added 80 new tapes to a Weddington library now 3,800-strong.) How classic tapes are handed down from age to age like 'Castle Thunder' from the 1931 Frankenstein, still in frequent use. How synthesisers and computers have become part of the modern noise boffin's armoury. But then my host Steve Flick (actual name) threw out a little observation that I almost missed. 'We would mix animal noises into the breaking glass in Die Hard . . .' Wait - animal noises in breaking glass? 'Yes.' What kind of animal? 'Oh, Cougars, pumas, cat sounds. Just to give it that savage, threatening feel. 'Glass has as many textures as a Persian carpet has colours. You can mix in all sorts of things. Same with explosions. For Backdraft, which we didn't work on, I understand they used pig squeals in the fireball noises.' A new world began to unfold. Mixing sound effects into unlikely cocktails, it became clear, is now one of the cinema's most surreal subdivisions. 'What else do you put animal noises into?' 'Well, when we did Raiders Of The Lost Ark Steven Spielberg wanted a different sound for the scenes where Indiana Jones drives the truck: so that the audience will sense there's more power, more machismo, than when the villains drive it. So whenever Indy started up the engine, we put a lion's roar into the noise. You can hear it clearly, even on video. But the audience watching the film is so carried along by the story that it doesn't notice.' Animals are clearly worked hard at Weddington. Few of the company's most impactful sound effects could have been completed without raiding the nearest zoo or dogs' home. Take Gremlins, whose creature noises were created by a fellow Weddington wizard, Mike Mangini. 'First we auditioned a lot of human actors. And we found one guy who could make that high-pitched, squeaky, snarling sound we wanted. But we decided it wasn't strong enough. So we rented some pit bulls and brought them into the studio here. And we'd wrestle with them and tease them and tickle them under the armpits until they gave us the noise we wanted.' The mind boggles. But even this wins only a runner-up prize for eccentricity. The company's finest hour probably came - they played the original recording for me - when Steve Flick stepped into a bath of jello in the early 1980s to create, by splashing around, the ploppy, gloopy ectoplasmic effects for Poltergeist. The empire of the sound effect spreads far and wide. It ranges from Heath Robinson gewgaws that a child could build to state-of-the-art computer equipment: like the Solid State Quantel screen-sound system I was shown (British-made) where you 'touch in' effects on a soundtrack using a light-pencil on a diagram-screen. Meanwhile, the creative possibilities of the sound man's art include everything from giving banal noises a distinctive flavour - 'Doors are very important; we have over two hours of door sounds varied for the thickness of the wood or the texture of the walls' - to collecting obscure instruments from around the world. Flick proudly shook for me a 'Shinto noise-maker', whose loose slatted structure, like an invertebrate xylophone, could enhance any sound from a rattlesnake noise to the shudder of crockery during an earthquake. Mike Mangini has a DIY xylophone too. He invented it for Beauty And The Beast and its 'keys' are dining spoons. Listen for it in the Disney animation feature's big musical number, a Busby Berkeley dancing-dishware extravaganza called 'Be My Guest'. Explains Mangini: 'We had to make sure the sound effects didn't clash tonally with the music. So I made this instrument like a xylophone where the spoons could be pitched to the key of the music. And in the shot where you see the spoons diving into the washing-up bowl, I'd hit them one after the other to create a kind of spoon glissando.' Mangini and assistant Dave Stone also laboured over the right cocktail of technical and zoological effects for the Beast's voice. Actor Robby Benson's voice was 'pitched down 15 per cent electronically, then we'd mix in different growls from different animals. For 70mm prints we'd add in a subharmonic frequency in the boom channel to create that extra rumble, and on very strong words we even added explosion noise: for instance when the Beast says to Beauty: 'You'll stay in there and you'll S-T-A-R-V-E]' ' Sound effects today, it's clear, are not just the art of sonic showmanship: they create emotional underscorings often subtler than anything the image could provide. For a scene of menace in the snowbound woods in Beauty And The Beast, Mangini and Stone used slowed-down wolf howls to create the sound of the wind. This not only enriched the sonic texture for its own sake, it provided a portamento into the film's next narrative development, which was a wolf attack. At their best, sound effects, like film music, provide a whole new layer of meaning to a movie: reinforcing the pictorial image or giving it a surprise inflection or even, as here, creating an entire emotional ambience for it before it appears.</p>

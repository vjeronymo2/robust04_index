			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions in proposed &sect;550.52 on the drug abuse education course have been revised as new &sect;550.54. This section has been reorganized and revised for the sake of clarity. As revised, paragraph (a)(2) of this section now also specifies that, with respect to voluntary participants, the Bureau gives priority consideration to those inmates whose participation has been recommended by unit or treatment staff. This change is necessary to help ensure the efficient program allocation of Bureau resources. Paragraph (b) of the revised section now allows for inmates to receive work assignment promotions during their participation in or while on a ``waiting list'' for the drug abuse education course.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions in proposed &sect;550.53 on institution residential and nonresidential programs have been revised and separately stated in new &sect;&sect;550.55 through 550.57. New &sect;550.55 covers the voluntary institution residential drug abuse treatment program. As revised, this section no longer restricts application to those inmates who have been recommended by unit and/or drug treatment staff. As a consequence of this expansion of programming opportunity, paragraph (a) of new &sect;550.55 now contains eligibility criteria for program participation. The eligibility criteria is intended to allow the Bureau to allocate its resources in an efficient manner. The Bureau is adopting this provision on an interim basis, and will accept comments for the purpose of reissuance as a final regulation. New &sect;550.56 contains the provisions in proposed &sect;550.53(c) on the use of incentives. New &sect;550.57 covers the voluntary non-residential drug treatment program. As revised, programming opportunities appropriate for the drug abuse treatment needs of inmates who have more than thirty-six months left to serve have been expanded and consequent eligibility criteria in &sect;550.57(a) have been adopted on an interim basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions for transitional services in proposed &sect;550.54 have been adopted as final without change in new &sect;550.58.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conforming changes to the Bureau's provisions on inmate financial responsibility (28 CFR 545.11) have been adopted as final without change. Other proposed conforming changes to the provisions on institution work and performance pay (28 CFR 545.23) will be addressed in a separate final rule document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may participate in this rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments in writing to the Bureau of Prisons, 320 First Street, NW., HOLC Room 754, Washington, DC 20534. Comments received on the interim rule provisions during the comment period will be considered before final action is taken. Comments received on the final rule provisions will be considered but will receive no formal response in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . All comments received remain on file for public inspection at the above address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866, and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 28 CFR Parts 545 and 550  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prisoners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Kathleen M.

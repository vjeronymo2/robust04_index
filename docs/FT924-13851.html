			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Strong improvement at CPC CPC International, the US food company whose products range from Hellmann's mayonnaise to Knorr soups, saw after-tax profits rise from Dollars 75.5m to Dollars 117.4m in the three months to end-September. The strong improvement came on sales up by 7.7 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn, and translated into an increase in earnings per share from 48 cents to 76 cents. The figures take after-tax profits for the first nine months to Dollars 318.8m, compared with Dollars 262.6m at the same stage in 1991. Sales for Dollars 4.81bn, compared with Dollars 4.64bn. CPC said that the advance reflected 'a solid pick-up' in the North American consumer foods business, and that it expected a good performance in the final quarter. It admitted, however, that it was still feeling the 'effects of recession' in several European countries. Procter &amp; Gamble, the US household and personal care group, has formed a joint venture with Compania Manufacturera de Papeles y Cartones to market disposable diapers and feminine pads in Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, Reuter reports from Cincinnati. The company said the joint venture business in Chile would be conducted through Prosan, one of the companies in the Compania Manufacturera group, and each partner would have a 50 per cent stake.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNFAIR PROPERTY TAX BASE  </P> <P> So the grandchildren aren't living as well as the grandparents -- what's wrong  with that?  </P> <P> Today's "children" want it all, now. Mom and dad did not start out with what  they now have. They worked hard for it.  </P> <P> Their children want $300,000-$400,000 homes with a BMW in the driveway, not  what Ms. Goodman calls "affordable" housing.  </P> <P> Great, let's get rid of Proposition 13 and tax old mom and dad right out of  their home. After all, if the kids can't live in the manner in which they are  accustomed why should the old folks?  </P> <P> KATHLEEN STANLEY  </P> <P> Agoura Hills  </P></p>

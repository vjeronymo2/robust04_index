			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 OF 5 CHICKENS IN U.S. TEST FOUND TO HAVE SALMONELLA  </P> <P> Salmonella levels in raw chicken are much higher than previously believed,  according to a recent federal study in which almost three out of five birds  tested positive for the potentially harmful bacteria.  </P> <P> An independent laboratory test conducted for The Times also found the more than  50% of the locally purchased chicken showed evidence of salmonella.  </P> <P> The findings could be a setback for the poultry industry, which has spent the  past several years recovering from publication of 1985 federal estimates that  one in three birds were believed to carry the pathogen.  </P> <P> Salmonella is the leading cause of diagnosed food-borne illness in the United  States. There are an estimated 2 million to 4 million cases of Salmonellosis  each year. The disease also kills about 2,000 people annually, according to  federal health statistics.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Agriculture report found the incidence of salmonella  bacteria on fresh carcasses obtained from five processing plants in Georgia was  57.5%. Georgia was selected for the research project because it is a leading  poultry producing state.  </P> <P> Department of Agriculture officials downplayed the study results, saying the  salmonella levels discovered are minute and as such, the bacteria's presence  poses no health threat if the meat is properly stored, handled, cooked and  served.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, earlier this week the federal government approved irradiation, a  controversial food processing technique, for use on poultry as a means of  controlling salmonella and other bacteria.  </P> <P> USDA's critics argue that salmonella bacteria can multiply under the right  conditions, allowing just a few cells to reproduce rapidly. Illness could occur  if contaminated raw chicken comes into contact with other foods that are  consumed raw.  </P> <P> The sale of raw meats containing bacteria such as salmonella is not illegal.  Health officials reason that if the meat is properly refrigerated, handled and  cooked, any pathogen present will be destroyed.  </P> <P> California chicken producers have long maintained that the salmonella rate of  their chickens is lower than the national average due to the state's drier  growing conditions, among other factors. However, 52% of raw chickens purchased  by The Times from five Los Angeles County and six Orange County markets in  recent days tested positive for salmonella bacteria, with only Zacky Farms and  Randall Farms showing no contamination.  </P> <P> The sample was randomly selected from major California chicken suppliers, but  not necessarily representative of all poultry products available.  </P> <P> The 21 raw chicken products were tested for The Times by Michelson Laboratories  in Commerce using a procedure approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration. The procedure tests for the presence of, rather than the amount  of, salmonella.  </P> <P> Those brands that tested positive included 2 whole Rocky the Range Chickens  from Pine Ridge Ranch in Sebastopol; 1 whole Pride Roaster chicken from Pat  &amp; Sons Poultry in Los Angeles; 2 whole Tyson Chickens from Springdale,  Ark.; and 6 Foster Farms of Livingston products, including whole birds and  packaged parts.  </P> <P> Products without evidence of salmonella were 7 Zacky Farms products, including  whole birds and packaged parts, 2 Foster Farms whole birds and a package of  Randall Farms chicken breasts.  </P> <P> Former Foster Farms executive David M. Theno, who is now a consultant to the  firm, said that the incidence found in The Times test was much higher than  those being found in the Livingston plant. Nevertheless, he added that  consumers must keep in mind that raw chicken products are "to be cooked before  consumption, therefore any bacteria present should be killed by the heating  process."  </P> <P> "People think that if salmonella is in a product then you're going to  automatically get sick. That is not the case," he said. "Whether its 35% or 50%  of the chickens that contain salmonella there is nowhere near that many  illnesses (as a result)."  </P> <P> Bart Ehman, co-owner of Pine Ridge Ranch, which produces the antibiotic-free  Rocky The Range Chicken, said that all poultry producers battle a salmonella  problem.  </P> <P> "We've tested ourselves for salmonella and it does occur occasionally," he  said. "We're not worse off than anybody else and we do everything to avoid  salmonella, we really do. Sometimes, often times, when we test we do not find  salmonella. And sometimes we find some."  </P> <P> Corky Bennish, a principal owner of Pat &amp; Sons Poultry in Los Angeles, did  not have any comment on the lab results. However, he added that his firm did  "everything we can to keep the product wholesome according to USDA standards."  </P> <P> Bob Justice, executive vice president of Tyson, said that his firm's laboratory  analyses do not indicate problems with salmonella and that those Tyson chickens  purchased by The Times must have "picked up some (bacteria) along the line."  </P> <P> Zacky Farms declined to comment.  </P> <P> Industry officials, who saw a 5% decline in chicken sales after release of the  government's 1985 study, attribute the increase in salmonella levels in the  latest study to the use of more sensitive laboratory detection methods and not  to a rise in the contaminant's presence in the nation's broiler flock.  </P> <P> Even so, critics of the USDA say the findings indicate the agency is doing  little or nothing to reduce the incidence of salmonella in chicken.  </P> <P> "The USDA policy on controlling bacterial contamination (in chicken) is a  failure," said Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition  Institute, a Washington-based consumer group.  </P> <P> "They have been unable to get the industry to address the problems of  contamination and have given up," Leonard said. "The only thing USDA can do is  find something (irradiation) that can treat the chickens after they leave the  plant."  </P> <P> The recent study was done by Roy C. Blankenship, research leader of the poultry  microbiological safety unit at the USDA's Agriculture Research Service in  Athens, Ga. Blankenship said his data will appear in the August issue of  Poultry Science Journal.  </P> <P> Blankenship was studying a chlorine washing technique to rid birds of fecal  contamination. He studied 1,500 chickens from five Georgia processors and in  the course of the study determined that salmonella was present in 57.5% of the  birds.  </P> <P> "People should be aware that there is a hazard, but there are a lot of other  hazards in life and you do things to avoid them," he said. "The emphasis should  be on good food handling practices in the kitchen."  </P> <P> Bill Roenigk, spokesman for the National Broiler Council, which represents 90%  of the nation's chicken producers, said: "The methods (Blankenship) used were  more sensitive than previous ones. He could pick up several (microscopic) cells  of salmonella per carcass. While salmonella would be present, a few cells will  not make you ill."  </P> <P> Some industry observers questioned whether the five processing plants in the  Blankenship study were state-of-the-art facilities. However, Blankenship said  that the plants were well-managed, modern facilities operating within the  regulations established by the USDA and under the agency's supervision.  </P> <P> Even so, a top USDA official said Blankenship's results are not cause for  alarm.  </P> <P> "(Some critics) say that because 57% of the chickens had at least one  salmonella organism per carcass that this has public health consequences. It  does not," said Lester Crawford, director of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection  Service. "If we find just one organism, then (the entire bird) is classified as  positive for salmonella. But I don't want anyone to think you can get sick from  that. . . . Even if you ate raw chicken that contained one salmonella cell, it  wouldn't make you sick."  </P> <P> Crawford said health officials believe as many as 500,000 salmonella cells are  required to make a healthy person ill. However, the number needed to cause  Salmonellosis declines, sometimes dramatically, for those in the high-risk  groups including infants, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems  such as cancer or AIDS patients, for whom the disease can be fatal.  </P> <P> Salmonellosis can cause flu-like symptoms such as nausea, fever, abdominal  pains, headaches and vomiting.  </P> <P> Consumers can protect themselves from potential salmonella bacteria by cooking  chicken thoroughly, or to an internal temperature of between 175 degrees and  180 degrees. Raw chicken should be handled carefully so it does not come into  contact with other foods to be consumed uncooked, such as salad ingredients.  </P> <P> All surfaces -- cutting boards, knives, containers that come in contact with  raw chicken should be thoroughly cleansed with hot water and soap after use.  Packaged chicken stored in the refrigerator should be placed on a plate or  container so that none of the product's fluid drips onto other items creating a  phenomena known as cross-contamination.  </P></p>

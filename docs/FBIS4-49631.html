			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 6 (CNA) -- Vice Transportation and  Communications Minister Mao Chih-kuo was appointed acting  director- general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)  Friday [6 May].    The appointment came after Transportation and Communications  Minister Liu Chao-shuan approved the resignation of CAA  Director- General Sun Chao-liang.    Sun submitted his resignation in the wake of the April 26  China Airlines' Airbus crash at Nagoya, Japan. The crash, the  worst in China Airlines' history, killed 264 of the 271  passengers and crew aboard the plane.    Mao will assume his new post pending approval by Premier  Lien  Chan, Liu said. He will serve as acting CAA chief until the  ministry finds a suitable replacement for sun. Mao will also  keep his ministry post.    Mao said his first priority as director will be to reform  Taiwan's air safety practices. He also plans to renovate air  control systems, overhaul airport buildings and facilities and  increase the number and improve the quality of air transport  personnel, he added.</p>

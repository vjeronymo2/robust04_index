			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. de Querol] </F>   [Text] Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes stated  yesterday that "the payment of pensions in the future is fully  guaranteed," although he stressed that changes will be necessary  to "strengthen" the public system of Social Security.    In his remarks to the Congress of Deputies, the minister  thus  contested the controversy that has ensued from his previous  statements in which he warned that the pension system will be  threatened in 20 to 30 years.    Stating that his words on that occasion had not been well  understood, the minister emphasized that a public pension system  similar to the present one will continue to exist in the future.  He advocated the maintaining of the financial system of  distributions (in which the workers' current contributions  finance current pensions), although this system "can be  supplemented by elements of capitalization," thus guaranteeing,  in his opinion, "solidarity among people, groups, and  generations."    Solbes also promised that the Social Security benefits will  retain their purchasing power independently of the existence of  private systems that may provide pensioners with additional  income.    The minister of the economy dwelt on the need to begin  "addressing seriously and responsibly a problem that, if nothing  is done, could arise in 20 or 30 years."    The future reform of the Social Security System, he added,  will not bring into question the present system, but on the  contrary will strengthen it. In his remarks, Pedro Solbes  reproached the opposition groups with their "catastrophic views,  which alarm people here and now," and urged that pursuit of the  debate be "sober-minded." To this end, the Congress's Committee  for the Economy appointed an ad hoc subcommittee to initiate  studies on the future of the Social Security System.    The deputies of the PP [People's Party] and IU [United Left]  criticized Solbes harshly for "creating social alarm concerning  the future of pensions." Cristobal Montoro, PP spokesman,  accused the minister of "acting like a pyromaniac" for having  put in question the pensions of future retirees. In Montoro's  opinion, the problem is not a demographic one, but rather stems  from the low employment and high unemployment rates, which  reduce total contributions. Montoro pointed out that a sizable  number of pensions "amount to poverty levels."    Pedro Antonio Rius, of the IU, reproached the government  with  "intent to dismantle the welfare state's most important  package." According to Rius, the debate that has been opened  regarding pensions obeys the "strategy" of an executive branch  in which "accountants hold sway over the defenders of ideas."  The pension system is strong, he said, and continues to be  strong "if the government sees to it that there is employment."  Francesc Homs, of CiU [Convergence and Union] termed the economy  minister's initiative timely, because all of Europe has opened a  debate on social welfare.</p>

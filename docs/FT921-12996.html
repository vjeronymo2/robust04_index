			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 1.82m for London &amp; Clydesdale London &amp; Clydesdale Holdings, a housebuilder which operates throughout Scotland, finished the year to September 30 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.82m - much in line with market expectations. The profit was generated from turnover of Pounds 21.4m, and compared with Pounds 3.31m from sales of Pounds 20.8m in 1989-90. Interest charges more than doubled to Pounds 1.54m mainly reflecting the acquisition of sites and retention of an investment property which provided an additional rental of Pounds 200,000. Earnings per share fell to 14.9p (24.5p) and the total dividend is again 7p with a final of 5.2p. The tax charge benefited from certain expenses previously incurred now being allowed against tax. Mr Norman Chalmers, chairman, said current house sales were down on last year. 'We are present discounting to achieve sales and consequently do not anticipate a particularly good result for the first six months'. Commercial property should contribute again to the year's results.</p>

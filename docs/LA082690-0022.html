			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMITS ON FREE SPEECH  </P> <P> The letter below rebuts letter writer Steven Grant's Aug. 12 defense of the  free-speech rights of controversial public figures such as comedians Sam  Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay and members of the Guns N' Roses and Public Enemy  bands. Grant argued that "too many times in America's history, (the right of  free speech) was abrogated because whoever was speaking wasn't politically  correct enough for whoever was defining political correctness at the time."  </P> <P>  Grant may be unaware that the U.S. Supreme Court, which interprets our laws  and Constitution, has carved out exceptions to absolute free speech: "The most  stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting  fire in a theater and causing a panic" (1919).  </P> <P> And, like it or not, obscene material is not protected by free-speech rights  (1957).  </P> <P> Likewise, some forms of offensive speech, like "fighting words" are not beyond  restrictions. In upholding the "fighting words" doctrine, the court ruled in  1942 that words "which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite  an immediate breach of peace" may be purged from public dialogue.  </P> <P> To be called nigger, faggot, spic or kike might leave more enduring scars than  a physical assault.  </P> <P> How we draw the line in today's climate of increasing racial, sexual and ethnic  insults may not be easy, but no one can say that speech is absolutely "free."  </P> <P> MARSHAL ALAN PHILLIPS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

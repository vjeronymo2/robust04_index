			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar treads water The dollar traded steadily on foreign exchanges yesterday, with no fresh data to give the market direction, writes Philip Gawith. The US currency held on to its recent gains to finish in London at DM1.6695, after DM1.6692 on Monday. Against the yen it ended at Y105.235 from Y105.350. The dollar fell back later in US trading after Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the US would use trade laws if framework talks fail to open Japanese markets. The US currency finished New York trading at DM1.6667 and Y104.225. Traders said the recent pattern of foreign exchange markets playing second fiddle to the bond markets had persisted. Currency trade was directionless, with 'very little to go for', one dealer said. The pound also had a steady day, the sterling index closing at 80.5 from 80.6 on Monday. In Europe the D-Mark was slightly weaker ahead of the weekly repo announcement today, and the European elections tomorrow and later in the week. In European trading the dollar showed little reaction to earlier news that Germany's economy had grown by an annualised 2.1 per cent in the first quarter - above market expectations. It was also unmoved by comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, suggesting that the fall in US unemployment to 6 per cent in May, from 6.4 per cent in April, might be subject to revision. The strength of this figure was a key factor accounting for the rise in the dollar last Friday. Mr Kantor's comments, however, had more impact on the market. Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting in Paris of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, he said: 'Our goals and strategies have not changed. We will open the Japanese markets either through the framework or through US trade laws.' His observations served as a timely reminder of one of the factors that has depressed the dollar in recent months. Some commentators thought they had recently detected a change in US administration policy towards the dollar. Mr Paul Chertkow, for example, head of global currency research at UBS, spoke of the 'end of the policy of dollar debasement by the Clinton administration to exert pressure on the Japanese authorities to undertake measures to increase imports'. But Mr Kantor's comments suggest it may be business as usual. The flip side of recent dollar strength has been a softening of the D-Mark on the perception that the dollar enjoys investor support. The D-Mark finished in London at FFr3.317 against the French franc from FFr3.412 on Monday. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, likened the franc's recent strength to a 'snail running for the finishing line'. He said the franc might rise to FFr3.39, but said this could still take some time. One European currency that slipped against the D-Mark was the Swedish krona, which closed at SKr4.755 from SKr4.738. Analysts attributed this to the sale of bonds by foreigners, on fears of inflation, and worries that Austria might vote 'no' in Sunday's referendum about accession to the European Union. Sweden also wishes to join the EU. Another feature of an otherwise quiet day was a series of comments from European government figures and central bankers about possible falls in interest rates. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, said there was still room for European interest rates to fall. This message was echoed by Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank governor, and Mr Guenther Rexrodt, the German economics minister. As yet the European elections have impacted little on the market consciousness. Mr Cocker comments: 'The total apathy of the voting public will probably spill over into the markets.' The possible exceptions to this rule might be the UK, Spain and Germany, where bad results could result in political instability and currency weakness. There is also speculation that with the election past, the Greek government might relent in its defence of the drachma. Were the drachma to fall in value, this could spill over into other weak European currencies such as the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo. Markets are anticipating a 3 to 5 basis-point fall in the German repo rate when the result of the weekly auction is announced today. The rate is currently 5.15 per cent. German call money rates firmed slightly to about 5.10/5.20 per cent from Monday's 5.05/5.15 per cent. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 95m, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 300m. The overnight rate traded between 4 1/4 per cent and 6 3/8 per cent. In the futures markets, short sterling gave up some of its recent gains. The December contract saw 23,000 lots traded and finished at 93.78 from 93.86. The December Euromark contract traded nearly 44,000 lots and closed four basis points lower at 94.73.</p>

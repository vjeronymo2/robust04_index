			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY TO OPEN RESTAURANT IN SOUTHLAND MALL  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co. is branching out into the restaurant business with the planned  opening of the Disney Restaurant next month.  </P> <P> The company will open its first fast-food restaurant April 21 at the Montclair  Plaza, a regional shopping mall about 30 miles east of Los Angeles. Alongside  the restaurant, the company will open one of its Disney Stores, a highly  successful chain the company began three years ago.  </P> <P> "I think the idea of opening a restaurant along with the store is novel and  very creative," Sarah Stack, a retail analyst with the securities firm Bateman  Eichler, Hill Richards, said Friday.  </P> <P> "Since Disney has the experience of both selling merchandise at the stores and  parks and feeding people at the parks, this seems a logical off-site  extension," Stack said.  </P> <P> "My sense is that it will be difficult to come out of there without eating  something at the restaurant and buying something at the store."  </P> <P> The move comes on the heels of Disney's decision late last year to go into the  record business by starting its own label. The company has relied heavily in  recent years on using one area of business to promote another, what Disney  calls taking advantage of the "synergies" between its businesses.  </P> <P> The approach appears to be working, as Disney has posted record earnings  through major expansions of its filmmaking business, parks and consumer  products area. In the company's latest quarter ended Dec. 31, Disney earned  $174.4 million on sales of $1.3 billion, both records.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Burbank-based Disney had no comment on the plans for the Disney  Restaurant. However, at the Montclair Plaza, there are signs at the store site,  now under construction, seeking employees for the restaurant.  </P> <P> "We're seeking energetic, dependable people to work in the Disney Restaurant,"  one sign read. "The Disney Restaurant will be an exciting new concept in a fun  setting and will be opening in Montclair Plaza in April."  </P> <P> The store and restaurant will occupy about 11,000 square feet. The stores,  which sell a wide range of Disney items ranging from videos to talking Mickey  Mouse T-shirts, generally occupy 3,000 to 4,000 square feet.  </P> <P> A Disney source said the restaurant concept will be rolled out slowly, much  like the Disney Store concept was in 1987. Disney executives said at the annual  meeting earlier this year that they expected to open about 150 more stores  during the next two years.  </P> <P> Last year, Disney officers said the store chain was posting yearly sales of  $800 per square foot, better than double the national average for retailers.  The stores feature movie sets with Disney characters and employees costumed in  cardigan sweaters.  </P> <P> The stores also include strong promotion of other Disney products. A rear-wall  screen plays a continuous loop of excerpts from Disney movies, and there are  telephones for customers to subscribe to the Disney Channel or purchase tickets  for the Disney parks.  </P> <P> "There's an emotional attachment to Disney that goes much deeper than most  other retailers," Stack said. "Everyone has a history with Disney, so it's not  as if the company has to develop brand awareness."  </P> <P> One of Disney's theme-park competitors, Knott's Berry Farm in Brea, is also  moving into the business of operating restaurants. Knott's will begin  construction this summer of a Mrs. Knott's Restaurant &amp; Bakery in Irvine,  with a December opening scheduled, spokesman Stuart Zanville said.  </P> <P> The restaurant, however, will be a family-style operation seating about 225 and  patterned after the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant at the theme park,  which draws about 5 million visitors a year.  </P> <P> "We've been talking internally about opening an off-site restaurant for about  10 years," Zanville said. "We're not doing this to compete with the Disney  Restaurant."  </P> <P> Zanville said Knott's is exploring the possibility of opening other restaurants  in the Southern California area, but he said it would be doubtful that the  company will go beyond that region.  </P></p>

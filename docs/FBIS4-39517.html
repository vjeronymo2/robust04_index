			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Shulman] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg June 8 TASS -- "Peace is still too  fragile and demands for the maximum results in the settlement of  the six-year armed conflict are hardly acceptable," Russian  Ambassador at Large Vladimir Kazimirov, who has been acting as  the Russian president's special envoy to Karabakh, said at the  session of the CIS inter-parliamentary assembly. He was  speaking in the discussion of the Commonwealth's peace-keeping  missions.    Kazimirov spoke after chairman of Kyrgyzstan's parliament  Medetkan Sherimkulov reported on the work done by the CIS  interparliamentary group led by him to promote the peaceful  settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh.    Sherimkulov said in his report that since a cease-fire  protocol was signed in Bishkek, the warring parties have  observed its provisions in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri  conflict in the past four weeks.</p>

All three, like the 1986 standards, require the establishment of such an area where the employer believes that the PEL will be exceeded. Now, the construction and shipyard employment standards add that such area must be established also where Class I, II and III activities will take place, regardless of exposure levels. Also, the specific actions required of the employer to demarcate a regulated area are deleted from the definition, and are placed in the appropriate prescriptive paragraph, in this case paragraph (e)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Permissible Exposure Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (c) General Industry, Construction and Shipyard Standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In all three standards, the eight hour time-weighted average permissible exposure limit is changed from an eight hour time weighted average (TWA) of 0.2 f/cc to a TWA of 0.1 f/cc in the revised final rules. As noted in the 1990 proposal and in the preamble discussion above, OSHA's decision to reduce the PEL across the board responds to the Court's directive to consider whether to establish operation-specific exposure limits, since the Court noted that on the record of the 1986 standards, it appeared feasible to reduce the PEL to 0.1 f/cc limit in many industry sectors. OSHA has rejected ``operation-specific'' PELs for the wide variety of operations that expose employees to asbestos. OSHA proposed and these final standards adopt required operation-specific work practices, in addition to an across-the-board PEL reduction to 0.1 f/cc. OSHA expects that the risk reduction accomplished by this two-pronged approach will be at least as great as would operation-specific PELs. First, the required controls are found to be capable of achieving maximum exposure reduction on an operation-by-operation basis. Second, since OSHA has found that specific work practices are feasible, the Agency expects a higher compliance rate and thus, greater risk reduction than if practices were not specified. Third, in operations where particular controls are specified, the PEL is a backstop; alerting employers where additional controls are needed or closer surveillance is required; in all operations the PEL is a measurable and comparable value, which cannot be exceeded without further action by the employer to reduce exposures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of the proposal in 1990, the question of whether the proposed PEL reduction would reduce a still significant risk had already been given a tentative answer by the Court. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in remanding the issue of lowering the PEL to the Agency, noted that based on the 1984 risk assessment, the excess risk stemming from average exposures of 0.1 f/cc ``could well be found significant.'' BCTD v. Brock, 838 F.2nd at 1266.'' (55 FR at 29714).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposal, OSHA stated that it believes ``that compliance with proposed amendments to reduce the PEL to 0.1 f/cc as a time-weighted average measured over 8 hours would further reduce a significant health risk which exists after imposing a 0.2 f/cc PEL'' (55 FR 29714, July 20, 1990). OSHA's 1984 risk assessment showed that lowering the TWA PEL from 2 f/cc to 0.2 f/cc reduced the asbestos cancer mortality risk from lifetime exposure from 64 to 6.7 deaths per 1,000 workers. OSHA estimated that the incidence of asbestosis would be 5 cases per 1,000 workers exposed for a working lifetime under the TWA PEL of 0.2 f/cc. Counterpart risk figures for 20 years of exposure are excess cancer risks of 4.5 per 1,000 workers and an estimated asbestosis incidence of 2 cases per 1,000 workers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA's risk assessment also showed that reducing exposure to 0.1 f/cc would further reduce, but not eliminate, significant risk. The excess cancer risk at that level would be reduced to a lifetime risk of 3.4 per 1,000 workers and a 20 year exposure risk of 2.3 per 1,000 workers. Consequently significant risk would be reduced substantially. However, OSHA concluded therefore that continued exposure to asbestos at the TWA permitted level and action level would still present residual risks to employees which are significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Court did not ask and OSHA did not undertake to review its earlier risk assessment in the proposal. At the hearing in January, 1991, Mr. Martonik, spokesperson for OSHA was asked by Mr. Hardy, representing the Safe Building Alliance (SBA), if OSHA was planning to update the earlier risk assessment as part of this proceeding. Mr. Hardy stated that ``a number of parties have suggested to OSHA that its risk assessment from 1984, as relied on in the 1986 final rule, is outdated'' (Tr. 30). Mr. Martonik responded that ``we will have to consider all information we receive and determine relevance in this rulemaking after the record is closed. (Ibid).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other parties questioned OSHA's continuing reliance on the 1984 risk assessment. The Asbestos Information Association (AIANA) testified that ``OSHA's 1984 risk assessment fails to take into account the scientific community's consensus that chrysotile exposures hold lower risk than the Agency estimates *&blank;*&blank;* we do not believe that the risk assessment that is six years old relies on the best available evidence.'' AIANA requested OSHA to convene experts, as part of this hearing process ``to revise its asbestos risk assessment.'' (Tr. 530), this was the major objection to OSHA's earlier risk assessment. Some participants voiced similar objections. (Ex. 7&hyph;88, 7&hyph;110, 7&hyph;104, 7&hyph;120, Ex. 145, 151), while others were of the opinion that chrysotile had the same potency as other forms of asbestos (see Ex. 119 C, 1&hyph;136, 125, Att. 6, 143 Att C, 143 Att. D.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

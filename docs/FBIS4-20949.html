			<p>MIR   Leaders   <F P=102> PY2803173094 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish  1100 GMT 28 Mar 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY2803173094 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz Television Nacional Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] The Special Antinarcotics Force's [FELCN] report has  provoked a political storm. The report mercilessly tarnished the  image of former President Jaime Paz Zamora and important  Movement of the Revolutionary Left [MIR] leaders. As a result,  Jaime Paz Zamora announced his irrevocable withdrawal from  political life.    The population was surprised by the FELCN report's summary  of  conclusions. It obviously had the sharp advice of intelligent  experts and probably the DEA itself.    The document says drug trafficker and Army Captain Isaac Oso  Chavarria, who was trained as an intelligence officer by the  Army, used his personal relations with Jaime Paz Zamora and his  family to create a drug trafficking network within Paz Zamora's  administration. The MIR leaders involved tried to hide their  links with Chavarria when the real nature of Chavarria's  business became known, but Chavarria used that fear to blackmail  them, the document says.    These MIR leaders were involved in illegal activities to  protect Chavarria against FELCN efforts to uncover his  activities. Chavarria had legal immunity until the advent of the  new government.    The report says that Chavarria's links with MIR leaders were  financial as well as personal. Chavarria was a MIR follower and  had easy access to MIR leaders. We must point out that these  links were not established by the MIR as a party and most MIR  followers were unaware of them, the report says, adding that the  evidence does not incriminate the MIR as a party in Chavarria's  activities. The MIR cannot be accused of involvement in drug  trafficking activities. When the report mentions the MIR and its  links with Chavarria it only refers to the party leadership, the  document says.    When studying the chronology of events, it is clear that MIR  leaders were willing to accept Chavarria's hospitality,  financial infrastructure, and resources even before Paz Zamora  was elected president. Once in power this relationship  continued, although in a more discreet manner, because MIR  leaders realized they were politically dangerous, particularly  after then-Senator Juan Lucio's revelations.    During the MIR administration, Chavarria and other drug  traffickers continued paying bribe money to high-ranking MIR  leaders, the document says. The bribes were delivered through  middlemen such as Chavarria employees Edgar Fernandez and Luis  Capobianco. Paz Zamora's sisters presumably also acted as links  to carry messages and set up meetings between Chavarria and the  president, the report adds.    The report says that in October 1990, MIR leaders and  presidential personal secretary Susana Seleme, speaking on  behalf of the president, prevented a FELCN raid on a house owned  by Chavarria in Ilpavi and in November 1990 ordered FELCN to  free Edgar Fernandez, thus interrupting the investigation of  Chavarria's businesses.    In April 1991, acting MIR President Oscar Eid paid  Chavarria's hospital bills. At that time Chavarria had enough  money not only to pay his hospital bill but also to buy the  entire hospital, the report says.    In February 1994, MIR leaders threatened fugitive Edgar  Fernandez' family members to prevent him from revealing anything  about MIR leaders' links to Chavarria. The report says Chavarria  conspired to create a drug trafficking network within Paz  Zamora's administration. The most notable expression of  Chavarria's influence was the appointment of Colonel Faustino  Rico Toro to head FELCN. With that appointment Chavarria  intended to control and neutralize FELCN's struggle against drug  trafficking. The report says Chavarria considered Faustino Rico  Toro a drug trafficking partner by at least 1983.    The report says Chavarria allegedly pressured President Paz  Zamora into appointing Rico Toro to the very important and  delicate post in February 1991. The appointment completed the  narco-influence network established by Chavarria that included  presidential aides chief Colonel Jorge Coco Velazquez and Seized  Goods Director Choco Saucedo.    In 1983, Chavarria deposited $1.2 million in a Rico Toro  account. The two were partners at least as of that date. The  same year Chavarria purchased Rico Toro's condominium in  Florida, in the United States. Chavarria received a house that  belonged to Rico Toro in Ilpadi, La Paz, as payment for a drug  trafficking debt. Rico Toro tried to repurchase the house when  he was named FELCN chief, but Chavarria refused to sell it back  to him.    Rico Toro was one of [former military dictator] Luis Garcia  Meza's assistants. He received $200,000 for his loyalty to the  regime. The report says Chavarria tried to influence the  appointment of military officers to important positions through  presidential aides chief Col. Jorge Coco Velazquez.    The report concludes that Seized Goods Director Choco  Saucedo  was part of Chavarria's drug trafficking influence network.  Saucedo sold confidential information on investigations of the  activities of Colombian drug traffickers to Bolivian drug  traffickers.</p>

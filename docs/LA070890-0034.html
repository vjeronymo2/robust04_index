			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** CHRIS THOMAS, "CRY OF THE PROPHETS," SIRE/HIGHTONE: ALBUMS ARE  RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> On his major-label debut, the son of minor-league blues man Tabby Thomas  concocts a strange brew of deep soul, country blues, modern funk, Hendrix and  Marley that falls somewhere between a more rockin' Robert Cray and a Lenny  Kravitz without the Lennonisms. Despite a pro forma approach to songwriting and  a somewhat limited vocal palette, young Thomas gets by on the depth of his  emotional expression and a stinging, rootsy guitar style. An audience for this  amalgam awaits. DON WALLER  </P></p>

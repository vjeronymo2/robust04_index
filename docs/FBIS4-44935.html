			<p>CSO     [Text] India has informed the member States of the South  Asian Association for Regional Cooperation [SAARC] of its  inability to host the eighth SAARC summit in November. Instead,  Delhi has offered to host the summit in April 1995, senior  External Affairs Ministry sources told THE STATESMAN over the  phone.    The Prime Minister's preoccupation with elections in several  States--which are scheduled between November and March--was  cited as the cause for the postponement.    The SAARC charter stipulates that heads of States and  Governments of the member States meet once a year.    The postponement of the eighth SAARC summit will upset the  summit cycle. Officials point out that the ninth summit cannot  be organized in the winter of 1995, as there is no provision for  two meetings in one year.    However, India intends to get the decision ratified in the  July meeting of the SAARC Foreign Ministers in Dhaka.</p>

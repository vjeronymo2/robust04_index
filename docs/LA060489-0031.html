			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOULDN'T CONFUSE 'SOCIALIZED' MEDICINE WITH 'SOCIALISM' -- THEY ARE NOT THE  SAME THING  </P> <P> In his May 9 labor column, "After 40 years, Truman Is Proved Right on Health  Care," Harry Bernstein reports that not only Lee A. Iacocca but also "a  coalition of executives from many of the nation's largest corporations" have  concluded that the only viable solution to spiraling medical care costs in the  United States is the passage of a national health-care program.  </P> <P> As Bernstein notes, opponents of a national program in the past have "falsely  denounced it as 'socialized medicine.' " Evidently, the word "socialized" has  become to some people synonymous with the word "socialism," which it is not.  </P> <P> As defined by my dictionary, "socialized" means "to convert or adapt to the  needs of society."  </P> <P> Although generally not referred to as such, our police department is, in  reality, a socialized police department, serving the needs of our society. Our  socialized fire department also serves the needs of our society. No less  important, the needs of our society should also be served with socialized  medicine.  </P> <P> CARL M. LEVIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Embassy Does It Again"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Embassy has reverted to its old ways by  protecting a military attache accused of murdering his  Salvadoran bodyguard under circumstances that have not been  clarified. With the same arrogance it has always displayed in  total disregard for the Salvadoran authorities in other cases of  similar violations, the U.S. Embassy quickly took the major out  of the country virtually as a criminal would leave the country  -- by not filing the requisite immigration paperwork.    The incident showed the lack of organization characteristic  of the government. The Presidency accused the Embassy of  hindering the investigations conducted by the Nacional Civilian  Police [PNC] and the district attorney. The PNC and district  attorney supported the accusation made by the Presidency.  Attracted by a sense of nationalism, the president of the  Supreme Court of Justice also expressed interest in the problem.  The foreign minister, however, refuted everyone when he  declared that the Embassy was in constant contact with him, that  the major had diplomatic immunity, and that all Embassy  officials can enter and leave the country freely.    On the other hand, the Embassy praised the Salvadoran  authorities, as it had done very few times before, for its  investigation and cooperation. If the Embassy is offering  praise while government officials are protesting, then one of  the two is lying, and neither of them have enough credibility  for us to take their word at face value. Both have proven to be  capable of lying quite openly. The fact that the victim is  Salvadoran must not make us lose our perspective. The  Salvadoran officials crazed by the ruling party's false  nationalism have protested the Embassy's actions, thereby  demonstrating their ignorance regarding diplomatic immunity and  their provincialism. If they are so interested in justice, why  do they not investigate why the military attache left the  country.    The Embassy should have followed established immigration  procedures rather than pulling the major out of the country like  a criminal. The U.S. Government can also strip the major of his  immunity so that he can be tried by the Salvadoran courts, but  that would be asking too much. The Embassy is accustomed to  acting with this kind of arrogance and disregard. Therefore,  the Salvadoran authorities should not be surprised, because they  have allowed this to go on for many years. Likewise, we must  not overlook the friendly "agreements" reached over the  telephone by the foreign minister and the Embassy.    Still, we must also ask ourselves: Who, on his own accord,  would place himself in the hands of Salvadoran justice? The  Embassy knows better than anyone else how it operates; it knows  the vices that plague it, and the passionate nationalism of the  magistrates, judges, and lawyers. To allow a U.S. citizen to be  tried in El Salvador is to abandon him to the calvary the  Salvadorans, who must deal with the judicial system, must  endure. Despite all this, the United States has set a bad  precedent when it proved, once again, that he who is the  strongest can avoid the laws and justice.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Arts: Layers of Impressionism - Never mind the strategies, the pictures are fine Monet to Matisse is one of those curious but not unrewarding shows that adds up to a little less than the sum of its parts. The National Gallery of Scotland's 1970s extension is a poky warren of a place, but it does put a natural limit to any exhibition, forcing a disciplined choice upon its curator and keeping it to a blessedly digestible size. In this case the installation may be fussy and intrusive but, in the face of the works themselves, it is easy enough to ignore. The trawl made by Richard Thomson through public and private collections around the world, most especially through the provincial museums of France, has yielded an exceptionally rich haul of beautiful and often unfamiliar things. He has taken them to serve his theoretical purpose: we, for our part, may relish them for themselves, and we thank him for that. The main title is a shade misleading, for there is more to it than the narrow impressionist-to-post-impressionist line. Rather, in beginning around 1874, the year of the first Impressionist Exhibition and the coining of the eponymous epithet itself, and running on until the outbreak of the first world war, it takes landscape painting in its period in its broadest aspect, from Corot to Bonnard. Here are Salon painters such as Sege and Ponson, social realists such as Cazin and Martin, mystics and symbolists such as Puvis de Chavannes and Moreau, and many minor or neglected figures besides, such as Valloton, le Sidaner, Roussel and Guillemet, to set beside the great names from Monet to Picasso, Cezanne to Matisse. Furthermore, by taking certain themes or approaches turn by turn - the Suburbs of Paris; the Channel Coast; the Mediterranean; the Ideal; Vision and Metamorphosis; and so on - the conventional chronology is overthrown by the inevitable over-lappings and comparisons. Early and late, simultaneity is all, making the fundamental art-historical point that artists of all kinds go on producing serious and significant work long after another generation has come in, another ism taken over. Some of these groups are wonderfully strong - the paintings of Notre Dame by Matisse, Marquet and Segonzac, for example; haystacks by Gauguin, Monet and Van Gogh; two pastoral idylls - one by Roussel, of lovers beneath a tree, the other by Picasso, in his run-up to Cubism - of single figures similarly disposed. So it goes on, with painting after painting memorable for itself - Bonnard's railway train puffing one way, his barge the other; Valloton's terrified Pentheus fleeing the furies across the dark green hillside; Renoir's sunlit rocks and bushes at l'Estaque; le Sidaner's town square; Seurat's Gravelines; Monet's le Havre water-front, his ice breaking up at Vetheuil, his boatyard on the Seine . . . Only when we come to the rationale do we hit trouble. Having brought such lovely things together, Dr Thomson then seems to suggest that their physical and painterly qualities as works of art are not really the point at all. What fascinates him is their documentary interest in the social and economic context of the times. 'After 1870', he writes in his catalogue, 'pressing public debate about suburban expansion brought the issue into the artist's focus. The suburban motif was perhaps of all landscapes the one most quintessentially modern, and the painter had to confront (sic) and find forms for change.' Monet moved to Argenteuil in the 1870s and the paintings he made there, Dr Thomson continues, 'can be read as images of national reconstruction after the Franco-Prussian War . . . a picture of leisure along the suburban Seine could . . . be taken to imply prosperity and stability regained . . . In one painting of 1873, he adopted a distinctly layered composition . . . first a rank of saplings marking the end of the meadow . . . next a line of newly erected houses, then a bank of well-established trees, and finally the medieval spire . . . a visual classification in which is inherent the notion of past, present and future: the perfect pictorial structuring . . . of suburban flux. It was a strategy shared with other artists.' The snag with these distinct layers, classifications, inherent notions, pictorial structures and strategies is that they relate only to Dr Thomson's own interests and readings of the work. Social developments do, of course, affect artists directly, and it is certainly true that the recent development of the railways had made the Parisian hinterland, indeed the Mediterranean, more readily accessible to them. If a particular landscape appealed, it did so for incidental and formal reasons acknowledged more by intuition than any conscious analysis. And if a factory chimney was there instead of a church spire, or a railway rather than an old road, so be it. The mistake lies only in the ascription of motives or, as Dr Thomson would say, strategies, that were never there. The pictures are fine.

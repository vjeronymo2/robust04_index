			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Growth in imports supports recovery hopes THE UNDERLYING volume of imports grew by 3 per cent in the first quarter compared with the final three months of last year, supporting hopes that a slow economic recovery may be on the way. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that underlying export growth over the period was flat, underlining the world slowdown, which might brake any UK upturn. According to the CSO, underlying import volumes last month fell by 0.6 per cent compared with February, while export volumes were flat. The underlying level strips out trade in oil and high-price erratic items such as ships and gems, which distort the pattern. By value, imports - including oil and erratics  - fell 2 per cent in March to Pounds 9.8bn. On that basis, exports were 0.5 per cent lower at Pounds 8.9bn. That produced a deficit on all merchandise goods - the so-called visible deficit - of Pounds 875m. That compared with Pounds 1bn in February and met City expectations. Taking into account a projected March surplus on invisible trade - services and various financial transfers - of Pounds 300m, the deficit on the current account as a whole works out at Pounds 575m. In February it was Pounds 708m. These figures for both months are subject to revision when better estimates for invisibles become available. Without oil and erratics March's trade deficit was Pounds 1.1bn, the same as February's. The level of underlying import volumes in the first quarter was the second-highest on record. It was 5.5 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. Between the first quarter and the final quarter of last year, growth in import volumes was especially marked for intermediate materials - such as factory components - and other materials used in industry. That supported theories that companies may be increasing stocks, on the basis of recovery hopes. Underlying export volumes between January and March were at record levels, up 4.5 per cent compared with the equivalent period last year. However, volumes in the first three months were up by less than 1 per cent compared with the final quarter of last year - the previous record - probably reflecting export difficulties due to slow growth in other developed countries. Exports in value terms to the rest of the European Community - which accounts for about half of UK exports - were down 3 per cent in the first quarter compared with the period of October to December. However, exports to the US were up 5.5 per cent over the same period.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                   CURRENT ACCOUNT (Bn Pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                     Visible Trade Balance                             Less oil             Current           and                         Invisibles             Balance  Total  erratics  Exports   Imports   Balance 1990        -15.4    -18.6   -21.0    102.0     120.7      +3.2 1991         -4.4    -10.1   -13.4    103.7     113.8      +5.7 Qtr 2        -0.2     -2.2    -2.9     26.0      28.2      +2.0 Qtr 3        -1.2     -2.3    -3.5     26.4      28.8      +1.1 Qtr 4        -0.6     -2.6    -3.5     26.3      28.9      +1.9 Aug          -0.5     -0.8    -1.2      9.1       9.9      +0.4 Sept         -0.5     -0.9    -1.2      8.6       9.5      +0.4 Oct          -0.3     -0.9    -1.1      8.6       9.5      +0.6 Nov          -0.3     -1.0    -1.3      8.7       9.7      +0.6 Dec          -0.1     -0.7    -1.0      9.0       9.7      +0.6  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992 Qtr 1        -2.1     -3.0    -3.5     26.2      29.3      +0.9 Jan          -0.9     -1.2    -1.3      8.3       9.4      +0.3 Feb          -0.7     -1.0    -1.1      9.0      10.0      +0.3 Mar          -0.6     -0.9    -1.1      8.9       9.8      +0.3  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Invisibles for January to March 1992 are projections Figures are seasonally adjusted, and due to rounding may not add up  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CSO  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

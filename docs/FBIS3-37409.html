LDPR Leaders Claim the Renegades  Have Discredited Themselves"]    [Text] The languishing scandal that began as early as two  days ago has finally burst from within the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] faction into the open. Despite  contradictory statements of various liberal democrats, we  managed to find out the essence: Two deputies -- Viktor Kobelev  (No. 2 on the party's electoral list) and Aleksandr Pronin --  have left the LDPR faction. Kobelev himself says it was his  voluntary decision. His opponent, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy,  claims that "we have expelled them for actions that discredit  the title of deputy." According to Mr. Kobelev, his walkout,  which was prompted by personal relations, is a harbinger of a  serious split. In fact, another energetic LDPR deputy, Mr.  Marychev, said that he supported Viktor Kobelev's actions. "We  have the entire St. Petersburg LDPR organization on our side and  many other deputies," Mr. Marychev insisted.    In the rebels' view, however, they will be able to stay on  in  the party and even to counterpoise it to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.  "I have headed the LDPR staff; I know the party from "A" to  "Z," and I am a modest man in that regard," Mr. Kobelev said.  In his opinion, the mutiny will be supported by a majority of  Liberal Democrats, including by the deputies who "came to the  Duma to work, not to boost their social status." As for the  deputies, this threat does not appear to be ringing hollow. In  fact there are a number of deputy groups within the LDPR that  are made up of deputies who came to the State Duma in the hope  of making their own political career. Naturally, they have been  riled by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's contemptuous attitude to  parliamentary activity and his bent for presidential elections.  Mr. Zhirinovskiy himself does not make any bones about the fact  that deputies are only his transient companions and that few of  them will be trusted with accompanying him "along the path  leading up to power." A group of deputies close to the  communists under Mr. Kobelev was the first to have run out of  patience.    Viktor Kobelev hopes that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will "take  steps to meet them halfway," disavow his "personal statements  and return to the LDPR rules and program." For dwarfish parties  that are held together by one leader, splits are a common  phenomenon. The LDPR is effectively also a dwarfish party, the  only complication being the 59 deputy seats it holds. If  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy manages to find legal grounds for  replacing his ambitious colleagues in parliament with  trustworthy and devoted people, the "cleanliness of party ranks"  will be guaranteed. In principle, an electoral association,  such as the LDPR, may recall its defiant deputies. The snag is,  however, that the numbers of those disgruntled by Mr.  Zhirinovskiy's escapades may grow at the expense of other  internal "cliques." Then the LDPR leader will lose his  faction's support. Which will not come as a surprise given the  peculiarities of Russian electoral legislation, which puts on  the verge of a split all parties hastily set up according to God  knows what principles.</p>

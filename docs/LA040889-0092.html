			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAND VOLLEYBALL THRIVES AS A GAME FOR EXPERT AND BEGINNER ALIKE  </P> <P> Every Wednesday morning, a group of friends meets at the Sand and Sea Club on  Santa Monica Beach for the latest installment of a volleyball game that has  been going on for more than 50 years. The oldest participants started playing  before the breakwater was built, back when the tide would nip at the edges of  the private clubs lining the beach.  </P> <P> Others started during the Depression, and played for apples or, on good days,  quarters in the shadow of the Santa Monica Pier. The youngest date back to the  boom years of the late '40s, when the ex-GIs moved here, eager for a taste of  the good life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Watched the Sport Grow  </P> <P> They have played beach volleyball ever since, through the good times and the  bad, and have seen it grow from a neighborhood curiosity to a bona-fide sport.  Last year, more than 34 million people in this country participated in  sanctioned indoor or beach volleyball games. Millions more watched the men's or  women's professional tours, which are televised on cable television.  </P> <P> In the last five years, beach or, as they are sometimes called, sand volleyball  clubs have sprung up in unlikely places such as Columbus, Ohio, but virtually  every top professional player still lives in Los Angeles. In addition, Los  Angeles hosts perhaps the most fervent and most important grass-roots scene in  the country.  </P> <P> Although there are rumors of occasional games on the beaches of Hawaii in the  early 1920s, the first documented game of beach volleyball was in 1927 at the  Edgewater Beach Club, a private club near the Santa Monica Pier.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Caught on Fast'  </P> <P> After that, says Paul Johnson, one of the country's premier indoor volleyball  players in the '30s and '40s, "it caught on fast because it was the only game  that was well suited to the beach. You could jump into the ocean when you got  tired, eat a hot dog when you got hungry or just stretch out in the sun when  you were done. Best of all, you didn't have to wear shoes."  </P> <P> Initially, the beach game was no different from the indoor variety, with  six-person teams playing on a full court. If there weren't enough people, a  team would have four people or, if that's all there were, with two. These  two-person teams only used a quarter of the court, however, because that was  all anyone thought they could handle.  </P> <P> Then, one day in 1931, just for fun, Johnson and his three companions decided  to play on a bigger court. They started with half-court, but didn't like it.  "Since we were almost there, we decided to cover the whole court," Johnson  says.  </P> <P> "Within minutes," he says, "we were flying all over the court, developing  signals for our movements and working out new strategies. We had such a good  time that we never played quarter-court again."  </P> <P> By the late '50s, beach volleyball had become a cult sport statewide, and had  as its undisputed champion a man named Gene Selznick. He would hold court daily  at Will Rogers State Beach, at the intersection of Chautauqua Boulevard and  Pacific Coast Highway. As Al Scates, who eventually would guide UCLA's  volleyball team to 12 national championships in 18 years, remembers, he was  king of the beach.  </P> <P> "I had played football and basketball and wanted to learn how to play beach  volleyball," Scates says. "I was told to go down to State Beach for some basic  instruction, but was warned to get there early."  </P> <P> Although Scates showed up at 8:30 a.m., there was already a 3-hour wait for a  court. He and his partner patiently watched until finally, at 11 a.m., it was  their turn to play. But just as the other team was about to serve, three cars  pulled up to the beach.  </P> <P> Everything stopped while Gene Selznick and an entourage got out of the cars. As  Selznick surveyed the scene from the parking lot, Scates' opponents waved to  Selznick and asked if he wanted to take their place.  </P> <P> Scates was shocked because by relinquishing the court, they wouldn't get to  play until late afternoon. But Selznick graciously accepted their offer and  took his place against Scates, his due.  </P> <P> Without bothering to warm up, Selznick served a sky ball that "went up about 80  feet, spun and then came crashing down in front of me," Scates says. Then,  without breaking a sweat, he demolished Scates and his partner and sent them  back to the sidelines.  </P> <P> These days, with more than 300 beach courts between Zuma and Torrance, it is  much easier to get and stay on a court. However, at certain "volleyball  beaches," such as Santa Monica State Beach, Muscle Beach in Venice (south of  the Santa Monica Pier) and Marine Avenue beaches in Manhattan Beach, where many  of the professional players practice, "the scene can still get intense," says  Sinjin Smith, the six-time world champion who is the sport's most successful  player and author of "Kings of the Beach" (Power Books), a book chronicling its  history.  </P> <P> For the most part, he explains, beach volleyball is fairly informal. The courts  (not the nets or balls) are provided by the city or county on a first-come,  first-served basis.  </P> <P> Pickup games are the norm, especially among beginners.  </P> <P> But, Smith says, "one noticeably less-skilled player can destroy a game. Since  many of the people at the local beaches are professional players whose  livelihood depends upon the quality of their training, and others take the game  seriously, it is inconsiderate to ask to play in a game that is above your  ability level."  </P> <P> Instead of trying to play with them or with others who are equally serious  about the game, Smith recommends watching how they play. Then, after getting a  feel for what is going on, join a more casual game on one of the side courts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tips for the Novice  </P> <P> You will understand the action better if you already know the sport's basic  rules:  </P> <P>  -- As in indoor volleyball, each team can hit the ball three times before  putting it over the net. An individual, however, cannot hit the ball twice in a  row.  </P> <P>  -- Only the team that serves can score a point. If the other team wins the  volley, it wins the serve and the right to score but not the point.  </P> <P>  -- Games generally go to 15 points, and must be won by 2. So that the sun and  wind do not give one team an advantage, teams change sides every 5 points.  </P> <P> The court and net are the same height and size as an indoor court, but the  beach ball is made of leather (for suppleness), is heavier (to compensate for  the wind) and has more give (for control) than its indoor counterpart. Although  cheaper models are available, a good ball generally retails from $40 to $60.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Team Size Varies  </P> <P> Competitive beach games usually are two-person-team affairs, but recreational  games can have anywhere from two to six people on a side. Games with more  players on a team tend to keep the ball in play longer, but are less demanding  for the players.  </P> <P> Although the game is relatively easy to learn and enjoy, the best way to  establish good technique is by attending a beach volleyball clinic. The  Manhattan and Hermosa Beach Department of Parks and Recreation and experts such  as Smith and Scates all conduct clinics from time to time. For dates and  locations, call the appropriate park department or the California Beach  Volleyball Assn., (213) 635-6666, or consult Volleyball Monthly.  </P> <P> Clinic or no, beginners do not have to worry much about being injured on the  court. While 100-m.p.h. serves take their toll on the professionals' knees and  shoulders, the pace of the recreational game reduces the risk to the casual  player and explains why it can be played at all ages.  </P> <P> Virtually the biggest dangers, Smith reports, are bruised fingers and burned  feet. Although fingers can find their way into the path of a moving ball,  burned feet can be prevented by wearing shoes. Most people, however, take their  chances, because they move better if their toes grip the sand.  </P> <P> As with other sports, the best protection from injuries is an effective  warm-up. Move slowly, and gently hit the ball around at first. Gradually  intensify the activity for about five minutes. Then, after your muscles loosen  up, take your place in the sun and get ready to shine.  </P></p>

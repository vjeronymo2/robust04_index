			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NORTH COUNTY  </P> <P> North County's fast growth has generated so much mail volume that the U.S.  Postal Service has created additional ZIP codes for Oceanside and Escondido.  </P> <P> Postal Service spokesman Mike Cannone said Thursday that five ZIP codes will be  added in Oceanside and three in Escondido, beginning "a whole series of  changes" to keep pace with growth in San Diego County.  </P> <P> The new ZIP codes will go into effect July 1.  </P> <P> "Five new ZIP codes in one city is definitely the biggest change we've had  probably anywhere in Southern California," Cannone said.  </P> <P> He said the additional ZIP areas will help speed up automated mail sorting,  affecting about 19,000 deliveries in Oceanside and 13,500 in Escondido.  </P> <P> Residents of areas where the ZIP code will be changed began receiving notices  this week so they will have time to order new stationery.  </P> <P> Mail addressed to the old ZIP codes will be delivered after July 1, but the  Postal Service is asking residents to promptly use the new codes to avoid  delays.  </P> <P> Beside the new ZIP codes, some postal box prefixes will be changed in Oceanside  and Escondido.  </P></p>

Turns out they are marble figures from Greek mythology by sculptor Paolo  Borghi. . . . Purchased from a hotel in Dallas, they'll be unveiled this month,  says Mola Development Corp., builder of an office and commercial project on the  site. . . . When the project is completed, they'll be moved from the corner  into the complex. Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

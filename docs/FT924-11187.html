			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Berisford winds up its coffee trading associate BERISFORD International, the property and commodities group, announced an agreement that will result in the winding up of Rayner Coffee International (RCI), its 45 per cent-owned coffee trading associate. Berisford, which nearly went into receivership in 1990, is now little more than a shell, with its businesses reduced to a UK property portfolio and some small agribusinesses in California. Having dealt with RCI, the group wants to build a new core business through acquisitions in the services and manufacturing sectors. It is interested in the US, where it has considerable unused tax losses. Berisford said a programme of asset sales had reduced its obligation to RCI from Dollars 115m (Pounds 70.5m) in September last year to Dollars 45m. The group agreed to pay RCI's bankers Dollars 45m by March 31 next year. Berisford said its restructuring would cap its financial obligations to RCI and eliminate guarantees to RCI. Berisford is paying RCI Dollars 26m for assets where it expects some further limited recovery in the long term. The amount will be set against secured debt owed by RCI to Berisford. Having reached this agreement, RCI's directors have asked Berisford, as the only secured and largest unsecured creditor, to petition for the winding up of RCI. Berisford said the impact of these events was covered by provisions in its accounts. Berisford said it had realised Pounds 21m from asset sales since March this year and expected to generate sufficient funds from other agreed and planned disposals to achieve a positive net cash position during the current financial year, in spite of the repayment of the Dollars 45m by its year-end on March 31. Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford's chief executive officer, said that while he regretted the demise of the coffee business, this deal freed Berisford from the drain imposed on its resources by RCI. Berisford's shares closed unchanged at 16p, giving the group a market value of Pounds 79.4m.</p>

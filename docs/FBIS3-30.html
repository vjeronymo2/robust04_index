			<p>SUMMARY                                           In a move designed to realize high-level U.S.-DPRK talks,  Pyongyang used the 12 March meeting with Seoul to suggest a  willingness to withdraw the four demands it had previously  insisted Seoul must meet before presidential envoys could be  exchanged.  In signaling its willingness to move toward holding  an inter-Korean summit, the North also claimed that it is the  South that has repeatedly rejected North Korean summit offers,  including one heretofore unreported.  In keeping with its new  interest in exchanging envoys, Pyongyang media have so far  continued to temper personal attacks on ROK President Kim Yong-  sam, a circumspection first noted last week.                                     END SUMMARY      Pyongyang media treatment of the 12 March working-level talks  suggested that the North is poised to strike a deal with the  South on the exchange of special envoys.  Pyongyang radio on 12  March depicted the North Korean chief delegate--identified in  South Korean media as Pak Yong-su--as noting that of the 28  points raised in connection with procedural matters for the envoy  exchange, "all but four points" had been agreed upon "in  principle."  Furthermore, Pak was cited as making conciliatory  gestures for resolving the four North Korean demands:   + Pak said that two issues--the "large-scale nuclear war  exercises" and the "international cooperation system" (an  allusion to threats of UN sanctions)--could be discussed by the  envoys.  Further defusing these issues, he claimed that the South  had announced its decision "not to stage" Team Spirit this year.   + On the introduction of the Patriot missile to the South, he  seemed to agree with the South's alleged statement that "the  situation had changed" because Seoul "had already decided to  shelve the plan" to bring in the missiles.   + On ROK President Kim's earlier remarks that he "cannot shake  hands with a party that possesses nuclear weapons," Pak seemed to  suggest that the question is moot, since the "person in the  highest authority" in the South subsequently said that the North  has no nuclear weapons.      Pak noted that although the South's response to the four North  Korean demands still falls "short of our expectations," it is  proof of Seoul's recognition of the basic "reasonableness" of the  demands (Pyongyang radio, 12 March)--a formulation that may allow  Pyongyang, having made its points, to yield without losing its  "dignity."      Summit Talks     Signaling a willingness to eventually hold a  North-South summit meeting, while at the same time illustrating  North Korea's desire to put the South on the defensive, Pak  claimed that the South has rejected the North's offers of top-  level talks dating back 20 years.  In particular, he revealed  that in "early April 1992" an unnamed North Korean "special  envoy  visited Seoul and invited the ROK president to Pyongyang  around the time of DPRK President Kim Il-song's 80th birthday.  Implying that Pyongyang could use the South's rejection of the  summit for propaganda purposes, Pak pointedly noted that up to  now the North had "never mentioned" its special envoy's visit to  Seoul or his offer.      Joint Communique     Seeking to foster the impression of progress  at the 12 March meeting, the North unsuccessfully proposed a  North-South joint communique(SEE NOTE) to "reconfirm" both sides'  intention to exchange envoys "at an early date."  Pyongyang  apparently hoped it could use such a communique to claim to  Washington that North Korea has met its prerequisites for  reconvening high-level U.S.-North Korea talks.  (Although U.S.-  DPRK high-level talks tentatively are set to start on 21 March,  Washington is reportedly insisting that the special envoys must  be exchanged between the North and South before such talks could  be held (Yonhap, 12 March).)   (NOTE: Precedents for issuing North-South joint communiques in  recent years are somewhat mixed.  A joint communique was issued  at the fourth round of inter-Korean prime ministerial talks  (Pyongyang radio, 24 October) in a departure from the practice of  the previous three rounds.  Communiques were also issued  following inter-Korean talks on the nuclear issue in 1992  (Pyongyang radio, 19 February 1992, 14 March 1992).  However, in  August 1992 the South rejected a North Korean proposal for a  joint communique following another meeting on the nuclear issue  (Yonhap, 31 August 1992).)      Just how eagerly Pyongyang wanted a joint communique was  demonstrated in the extraordinarily conciliatory remarks Pak made  in pressing for the communique.  In accusing the South of  delaying the realization of the envoy exchange by "suspecting"  Korean motives, Pyongyang radio portrayed Pak as indirectly  admitting that the North was also partly to blame for the delay  (12 March).  The radio cited him as saying that the North on its  part had created "four barriers "--a clear reference to the four  North Korean demands.  In pleading for compromise, Pak also  cautioned against the sides playing a zero-sum game, declaring  that neither side should "absolutize" its own position.      Limiting Rhetoric     In line with the image of conciliation the  North Korean leadership is trying to project, Pyongyang media  have in recent days continued to moderate their personal attacks  on ROK President Kim.  The KCNA report of an 11 March commentary  in the party paper Nodong Sinmun calling for unity of South  Korean "patriots" against their government avoided using the  South Korean leader's name, referring to the ROK Government only  as the "'civilian' fascist forces" (11 March).  For the past few  months, Pyongyang media have been signaling the North's  reluctance to deal with the South Korean government with repeated  harsh personal attacks on President Kim.  The first sign of  moderation on this issue appeared last week.      Implications     Pyongyang's attempt to project a conciliatory  stance toward Seoul suggests that the North may try to work out a  substantive accord on the envoy exchange at the next scheduled  session on 16 March.  Failing that, the North may hope that  taking the high road on this issue will strengthen its contention  of the South's intransigence and thus enable it to pressure the  United States to proceed with bilateral talks.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 25/5/1994 -- The government of  the self-proclaimed Dniester republic today requested President  Boris Yeltsin and the Federal Assembly to facilitate the  shipment of Dniester rubles to Tiraspol. Boris Akulov, deputy  of the Dniester supreme soviet, told BASA that the banknotes are  currently stored at the Gosznak plant in Moscow. Previously,  some Russian organs blocked their shipment to Tiraspol. This  decision was later annulled by the Russian Arbitration Court at  the Dniester official's request. According to Akulov, there is  the shipment of banknotes to Tiraspol. A delegation comprising  Dniester deputies and public organization representatives has  been organized and will leave tomorrow for Moscow to conduct  negotiations on shipping the banknotes as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Rome, March 23 (AFP) -- Luciano Violante resigned  Wednesday [23 March] as head of the Italian Parliament's  Anti-Mafia Committee, a parliamentary source said.    Violante, 52, a deputy of the former communist Democratic  Party of the Left (PDS) and a former magistrate, sent a  resignation letter to the leaders of the upper and lower houses,  the source said.    Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of rightwing Forza Italia (Go  Italy) party, had demanded his resignation, after an article in  the LA STAMPA daily quoted Violante as linking a close  collaborator of the television magnate to the Mafia.    Violante implied in an interview with LA STAMPA that  Marcello  Dell`Utri, president of Fininvest's advertising company  Publitalia, controlled by Berlusconi, was under investigation in  Sicily in connection with a Mafia drug and gun-running affair.    The Anti-Mafia Committee leader later denied the comments  and  late Tuesday at a PDS rally in Sicily said he was "considering  resigning to attack more freely the man who set a trap for me  and is now using it."</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIVE SUMMER STORIES  </P> <P> Only occasionally do book reviews contain a sentence or brief paragraph from  the author of the book. Your expertly selected stories give one a feeling of  the authors' works.  </P> <P> The outstanding illustration with each story is also profoundly effective. And  the cover by Jim Heimann is a delightful change -- so cool and refreshing.  </P> <P> JOHN SMITH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Huntsman almost doubles its size ANOTHER round of the petrochemicals industry's musical chairs came to an end yesterday with some companies leaving the game, and others confirming their intention to reinforce their interests. Texaco, the US oil company, virtually ended its participation in the chemicals industry. Huntsman group, the Salt Lake City-based company, nearly doubled its size through two separate deals, and vastly extended its European operations. Consolidated Press Holdings, the Australian group controlled by the media mogul, Mr Kerry Packer, confirmed its continuing interest in the chemicals sector. Elf Atochem of France sold its expandable polystyrene business to Huntsman, but acquired Enichem's low density polyethylene activities. For Texaco, the sale of almost all its chemicals operations follows a steady decline in profitability for this at best marginal chemicals subsidiary. Texaco Chemical's earnings fell from Dollars 268m in 1989 to only Dollars 7m in 1991, and last year the business made a loss of Dollars 49m on a turnover of Dollars 1.4bn. The Texaco subsidiary has been shedding operations and cutting costs for the past few years, but the group faced a massive capital expenditure bill of about Dollars 400m for its massive propylene oxide/MTBE plant at Port Neches, Texas. The new Huntsman-Packer joint venture, Huntsman Corporation, has an option to buy half or all of the plant which is due to come on stream at the end of 1994. Huntsman group said the acquisition extended the range of products available to the company, including fuel and lubricant additives, textile chemicals, agricultural, solvents and surfactant products. Elf Atochem's sale of its expandable polystyrene business to Huntsman Chemical Corporation, a subsidiary of Huntsman group, allows it to quit a business in which it was only a marginal competitor. With capacity of only 50,000 tonnes a year, it was in a poor position to take on the likes of Shell (175,000 tonnes a year) or BASF of Germany (195,000 tonnes a year). Instead, the French company has enlarged its polyethylene activities by acquiring Enichem's low density polyethylene plant. The operation is at the same site - Carling Saint-Avold - as both Elf Atochem's ethylene cracker, which provides raw materials for polyethylene, and its plastic derivatives business. For EniChem, the chronically loss-making Italian state chemicals group, the sale should further its drive to cut costs and improve earnings.</p>

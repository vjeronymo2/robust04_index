			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Kim Tae-hui, director  of the international department of the Central Standing  Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon), issued a statement on April 13 denouncing the  Japanese reactionaries who argue that a "countermeasure" with  regard to the socalled nuclear "suspicion against North Korea"  must be one of the "basic policies" of the next regime.    "Such argument is aimed at intensifying the hostile policy  toward the DPRK. It can never be overlooked," he said.    Expressing resentment at the fact that the Japanese  reactionaries are joining the United States in the criminal act  of breaking international faith, and pursuing a hostile policy  toward the DPRK through a strengthened "international  cooperation system" of the United States, Japan and South Korea,  he said:    "It is very dangerous that some quarters of the ruling  coalition are crying for the 'establishment of a crisis control  system' to cope with 'a case of contingency in Korea' and even  'an amendment of the law' for the dispatch of the 'self-defence  forces' to Korea, while describing 'North's nuclear development'  as a fait accompli.    "It is noted in Asian countries, too, that such attitude of  the Japanese reactionaries means involvement in the increase of  tension in northeast Asia.    "We strongly demand that a next regime of Japan, whatever it  may be, bear full responsibility for the past colonial rule over  Korea and rectify the unjust hostile policy toward the DPRK and  the repressive policy against the Koreans in Japan."</p>

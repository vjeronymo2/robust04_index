			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Skopbank reduces operating loss 56% A big reduction in credit losses enabled Skopbank, the Finnish state-owned bank, to cut its operating loss by 56 per cent to FM216m (Dollars 39.95m) in the first four months from FM488m a year ago. It expects to remain in the red for the rest of the year, although the 1994 deficit will be around half last year's FM1.6bn total. The drop in credit losses to FM207m from FM526m reflected an improving Finnish economy and lower interest rates. Non-performing assets totalled FM2.27bn at the end of April, against FM3.97bn a year earlier. The bank, the biggest casualty of the Finnish banking crisis, said income from financial operations fell to FM82m from FM117m due mainly to a FM33m loss on bonds.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The abbot of Wat Tham Krabok in Saraburi  yesterday said he had closed his drug rehabilitation centre to  new Hmong arrivals, as the Interior Ministry announced it was  considering a plan to wipe out the remaining anti-Vientiane  movement allegedly operating from the temple.    Phra Chamrun Panchan said he regretted the decision not to  admit more Hmong drug addicts for treatment. [passage omitted]    Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut, who did not  provide details of the plan to put an end to anti-Vientiane  activity based in Thailand, yesterday said some of the Hmong at  the drug treatment centre are connected with right-wing  anti-Vientiane rebel leader Vang Pao.    Deputy Interior Ministry Permanent Secretary Chaloem  Phromloet said that 6,052 of the 10,000 Hmong at the temple are  illegal immigrants from Laos, not from northern Thailand as are  the others who are known as Thai Pukhao [Thai mountain people].  According to the ministry's figures, there are less than 200  drug addicts at Wat Tham Krabok. The National Security Council  last year asked the Interior Ministry to screen residents of the  temple to separate the drug addicts from the alleged Hmong  rebels in disguise. The ministry was also asked to take  necessary action against those using the temple for reasons  other than drug rehabilitation.    Phra Chamrun said provincial authorities had deployed  militiamen around his temple for several weeks after a report  last year that the sprawling compound had been used by rightwing  Hmong opposed to the Lao government as a staging area for  sabotage and acts of terrorism inside Laos.    "But the militiamen have since been recalled because they  did  not find any illegal activities committed by the Hmong people,"  he said.    He said he wanted the provincial authorities to send in  observers to monitor the work of his staff at the drug  rehabilitation centre to make sure no illegal activities took  place.    The abbot complained that the authorities tended to regard  him and his staff with suspicion.    Phra Chamrun said although the number of Hmong hilltribe  people undergoing treatment was small, the majority of the close  to 10,000 Hmong at the temple were their family members and  relatives.    The abbot denied that any of the Hmong residing at his  temple  had anything to do with Gen Vang Pao, the leader of a Hmong  armed force opposed to Vientiane.</p>

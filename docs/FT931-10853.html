			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / US rejects imposition of Bosnia plan THE US will support the plan for a Bosnian peace settlement proposed by international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen, if it is accepted by all the warring parties. But it will reject any attempt to impose it on the Bosnian Moslems if they continue to reject it, the White House said yesterday. However, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said President Bill Clinton still intended to put forward his own proposals, which would be aimed at making a peace agreement more acceptable to Moslems. Though it is clear the Clinton administration has not yet clarified its policy on Bosnia and there are evidently considerable differences of opinion between the president's advisers on how to handle the problem, the prevailing view in Washington appears to be that the Moslems are getting a bad deal. Most US officials appear to be convinced that the Moslems will never agree to a map dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces because they consider that these endorse at least some of the effects of the Serbs' policy of so-called ethnic cleansing. That map has, so far, been endorsed only by the Bosnian Croats. Mr Vance and Lord Owen continue to deny vigorously that the Moslems come off second best in their plan. Though the mediators admit that it is impossible to return to the pre-conflict situation, they emphasise that the Serbs will have to give up as much as 39 per cent of the territory they at present occupy. They also stress that they have gone out of their way to meet Moslem demands that Bosnia should continue to have a central government, which will be responsible for foreign affairs and will be able to veto any move by the Serb provinces to join up with a greater Serbia. The mediators further point out that their peace plan already has the support of all the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, including Russia and China and the European Community. However, they would be very happy to endorse any alternative proposals from the US which were acceptable to all the warring parties and the Security Council. Reuter adds from Zagreb: The Croatian government and rebel Serbs agreed yesterday to talks at the UN in New York to stop renewed fighting in Croatia's Serb-held Krajina region, said Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief of the UN's military peacekeeping mission in former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> BAD VIBRATIONS: Rep. William E. Dannemeyer repeated his frequently-voiced  opposition to homosexuality in introducing his motion to expel Rep. Barney  Frank from Congress for his relationship with a male prostitute (A1). . . .  "There is something about homosexuality that sets Mr. Dannemeyer to vibrating,  I don't know what it is," Frank said. "I think that there is a growing  sentiment in the House of Representatives that Mr. Dannemeyer and reality only  rarely coincide." Zan Dubin and Bob Schwartz  </P></p>

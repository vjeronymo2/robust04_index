			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: The Gulf Between Us - West Yorkshire Playhouse Even before it opened Trevor Griffiths' new play, which he directs himself, was sending shockwaves around the north of England: a leading playwright of the left was being let loose on a war still warm in the public imagination. That he is the first major playwright to confront the Gulf War on stage says something about our reluctance to look our recent history in the face. The fuzzy awkwardness of his response says yet more about the disarray among left-wing thinkers still struggling to find a new coinage in the ruins of the old order. While setting the play in an unnamed war and country, Griffiths makes it quite clear what and where they are. It opens with the unforgettable image of the Gulf war: a bomber closing in on its target with view-finders trained for the much-vaunted surgical strike. Seconds later we are on the bomb-shattered ground beside the swathed ruins of a mosque with a neat torpedo hole in both sides. Billy Ryder (Paul Slack), a cocky British brickie turned entrepreneur, has been ordered at gunpoint to repair the damage before nightfall. His 'mate' for the job is a bearded oddball transformed, by an error on his identity papers, from a gilder into a builder. They are guarded by an innocent called Ismael, (Akram Telawe) who carries a cellular telephone in one hand and a machine gun in the other. In the background is the din of rioting women who believe their children were inside the mosque when it was struck. This then is a play about the morality of warfare as seen by the people on the ground: echoes of the infamous bunker tragedy, when sheltering women were killed at the height of the Gulf War, are too clear for there to be any serious doubt that the children will turn out to have died. One awaits the impassioned lecture about wasted life and US imperialism, which is dutifully delivered by the woman doctor who discovers the corpses deep into the second act. Yet instead of using the incident to score propaganda points, the Arab authorities are uncharacteristically bent on a cover-up. This is the plotting twist that enables Griffiths to establish his position. He is not simply banging the drum of East against West but of footsoldiers and civilians against the war machine, whether operated by bungling local officers or cynical long-range decision-makers. Old-fashioned Marxist historical analysis is softened and refracted by the introduction of what Griffiths himself calls a 'magic realism', centred on the figures of O'Toole and a wacky Asian youth who turns out to be his apprentice. Dave Hill, tall, bearded and studiedly ambiguous, plays O'Toole like an Old Testament seer whose identity baffles the touchingly prosaic Billy and Ismael, turning their naive preconceptions to the sort of subversive social comedy at which Griffiths excels. When isolated in a spot of orange light O'Toole becomes a prophetic story-teller, urging us to learn the lessons of history; moving forward into the plot, he acts as a deliberate spoiler, smashing a brick down on Billy's hand to prevent him completing the mosque wall before its message is clear. Like so much in this play he is a fascinating and flawed figure, representing a wholly admirable desire to escape the shackles of polemical theatre, but in doing so, allowing the focus to become fuzzy and the impact dissipated. At worst he is a device for evading the underlying issues of the conflict: its economic imperatives, its religious trappings. A complicated, and ongoing, political mess is sentimentalised into a simplistic fable about the inevitable sacrifice of innocent lives in war.</p>

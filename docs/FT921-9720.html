			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Hungary freed from Cocom curbs HUNGARY has become the first east European country to be entirely freed from restrictions on imports of high technology goods from the west under the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom), the US government officially confirmed yesterday, writes Nicholas Denton from Budapest. The relaxation of western controls is subject only to Budapest implementing further safeguards for transferred technology, which is understood to be a formality. The decision on Hungary was taken in Paris last week by the Cocom group of western countries. Cocom was designed to prevent technology with military uses leaking to the former Soviet bloc, but its purpose has disintegrated along with its target. A lifting of restrictions on Czechoslovakia and Poland is expected to follow. The tangible impact in Hungary will be to allow the armed forces to purchase western military equipment. However, defence ministry officials said the procurement budget was too tight for western defence firms to hold out much hope in the short term. Most western high technology exports to Hungary were liberalised in 1990 and 1991. Digital telephone switching equipment was removed from the list of restricted goods in 1990, allowing Hungary to begin to close a technology gap estimated at 10 years and embark on vital modernisation.</p>

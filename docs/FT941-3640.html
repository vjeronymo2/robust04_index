			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Digital to seek Dollars 500m in public offering Digital Equipment, the struggling US computer manufacturer, plans to raise Dollars 500m through a public offering of 20m depositary shares priced at Dollars 25 a share. The company said proceeds would be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. It recently announced plans to cut its European workforce by 20 per cent with the loss of 6,000 jobs over the next 12 months. Each depositary share represents a one-fourth interest in a Series A cumulative preferred share. For the six months to January 1 this year, Digital suffered a net loss of Dollars 155.3m, compared with a loss of Dollars 334.4m in the same period a year ago. Digital has been struggling to come to grips with fundamental changes in the computer market. These have shifted demand away from its mini-computers to networks of much cheaper personal computers, and workstations, using 'open systems' rather than proprietary software. The dividend rate, redemption provisions and dividend payment dates of the preferred stock will be established at the time of sale. The company said the preferred stock would not be convertible.</p>

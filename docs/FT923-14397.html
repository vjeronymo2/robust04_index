			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bimec tops Pounds 6m but sees downturn FOLLOWING AN extensive restructuring programme, Bimec Industries, the aerospace, waste treatment and engineering company, increased pre-tax profit from Pounds 5.36m to Pounds 6.04m for the year ended March 31, on turnover up from Pounds 74.5m to Pounds 103m. Each of the group's main divisions was profitable, although the company warned that orders were now down to Pounds 50m compared to Pounds 55m at this stage last year. The half year results would therefore be disappointing unless there was an early upturn in the economy, the company said. Earnings per share remained stable at 5.1p - after allowing for the rights issue last July - and an increased final dividend of 0.83p (1p) is recommended, to maintain the total at 1.5p.</p>

The industry is faced with a large supply of Zante Currant raisins. The suspension will only apply to 1994&hyph;95 reserve Zante Currants so that the value of a portion of the free tonnage inventory held by handlers on July 31, 1994, can be adjusted downward toward current market price levels. This adjustment is necessary to help the industry become price competitive and to aid it in marketing Zante Currants. This action was unanimously recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), which is responsible for local administration of the order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  October 27, 1994 through July 31, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Richard P.

The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule will allow the Committee to implement an inventory price adjustment program for Zante Currents during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year, which began August 1, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and a majority of producers of California raisins may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the order, seasonal volume regulations can be established. The free percentages prescribe the portion of the crop that can be shipped at any time to any market. The reserve percentages prescribe the portion of the crop that must be held for delayed shipment. Reserve raisins are held in a reserve pool by handlers for the account of the Committee. Funds generated from the sale of reserve pool raisins are distributed equally to equity holders (growers).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule will suspend the penultimate sentence in &sect;989.67(j) of the order for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. That sentence provides that: ``However, such raisins shall not be sold at a price below that which the committee concludes reflects the average price received by producers for free tonnage of the same varietal type purchased by handlers during the current crop year up to the time of any offer for sale of reserve tonnage by the committee, to which shall be added the costs to the equity holders incurred by the committee on account of receiving, inspecting, storing, fumigating, insuring, and holding of said raisins, and including costs of taxes and interest:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That, where the outlook for the next crop year or other factors have caused a downward trend in the prices received by producers for free tonnage raisins or in the prices received by handlers for free tonnage packed raisins, reserve tonnage may be sold to handlers at the currently prevailing or the approximate computed field price for free tonnage raisins, as determined by the committee.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limited volumes of Zante Currants are produced in California. The 1993&hyph;94 California production of Zante Currants was 5,643 tons, which is 32 percent larger than the prior four-year average of 4,279 tons. The estimated 1994&hyph;95 production is greater than 6,500 tons or over 50 percent more than the 1989&hyph;92 four-year average. It is anticipated that the production of Zante Currants will continue to increase in the next one to three years as newly planted acreage begins to produce and/or reach full production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Greece is the major producer of currants, generally representing at least 85 percent of the annual world production of such raisins. In 1992&hyph;93, Greek currants were in short supply and prices rose sharply. As a result, the market for California Zante Currants strengthened significantly and the grower price increased to $1,600 from $1,365 per ton the previous season. In 1993&hyph;94, the grower price for California Zante Currants was $1,200 per ton. The 1993&hyph;94 Greek currant crop was approximately 50,000 tons, of excellent quality, and prices were very competitive with those quoted for California Zante Currants. This resulted in a significant drop in California Zante Currant shipments here and abroad. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

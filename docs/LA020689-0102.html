			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EC RESTRICTS MICROCHIP MARKETING  </P> <P> The European Community today introduced strict new rules affecting access to EC  markets for microchips in a move that diplomats said could intensify U.S. and  Japanese charges of protectionism.  </P> <P> The EC's executive commission said in a statement that the regulation requires  a crucial high-technology stage in the manufacture of microchips to take place  in the community for them to be considered "made in the EC."  </P> <P> Defining the origin of the wafer-thin semiconducting circuits, which are at the  heart of computers and most modern electronic products, is important because  any EC business importing them as components must pay duty on non-EC  microchips.  </P> <P> The EC said that for a microchip to count as EC-made, a process known as  diffusion must take place in the community. Diffusion is the complex and costly  procedure of imprinting the pattern of the microcircuit on wafers of silicon.  </P> <P> That would exclude microchips that are assembled in the community from wafers  diffused elsewhere, the practice of some, but not all, of the big U.S. and  Japanese manufacturers.  </P> <P> "It has been established that the diffusion stage is technically the most  complex, the most difficult and that which requires the biggest investment in  research," the commission said in its statement to justify the decision.  </P> <P> Some non-EC microchip manufacturers already carry out diffusion in the  community, including Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola Inc. and Japan's NEC Corp.  So do big EC producers such as NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken of the  Netherlands, West Germany's Siemens AG and Britain's Plessey Co. PLC.  </P></p>

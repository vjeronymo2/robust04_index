			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TWO-WAY STREET  </P> <P> It will be a dark day for the music business if Tracy Chapman's male-bashing  anthem "Fast Car" is awarded even one Grammy ("Tracy Chapman: The Grammy  Favorite," Jan. 8).  </P> <P> Consider this: If Bob Dylan wrote a song about quitting school to take care of  his troubled mother but then abandoning her, getting married but later taking  the children and abandoning his troubled wife, people would think he was a  monster. But when Chapman sings of abandoning troubled men, she is roundly  applauded. Is there a double standard at work here?  </P> <P> And after seeing the video for this song, it is obvious to me that Chapman, for  crass commercial gain, is exploiting a racist stereotype of black men as lazy  people and lousy fathers.  </P> <P> "Fast Car" is designed to portray the singer as a victim. But an inspection of  the lyrics reveals that the woman in the song is calling all the shots. She is  not a victim but a victimizer.  </P> <P> I suppose that we shouldn't blame Chapman. We all live in a society where  male-bashing is used to sell everything from cigarettes to automobiles. Why  shouldn't she get to join the party?  </P> <P> JAMES L.

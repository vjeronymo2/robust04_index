			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HE ERRED, KARL SAYS ON STAND  </P> <P> One-time video business whiz Stuart Karl, indirectly embroiled in an ongoing  legal malpractice trial, admitted Tuesday that he made mistakes in his  well-publicized dealings with entertainment giant Lorimar but stressed that he  is now "trying to look forward, not back."  </P> <P> In Superior Court in Fullerton, the 37-year-old Karl repeatedly had trouble  remembering details of his business dealings, saying that some of his  recollections were vague and that he was trying to put that chapter of his life  behind him.  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, Karl, along with plaintiffs Court Shannon and Gary Hunt, ran  the Irvine-based Karl-Lorimar Home Video, a division of Lorimar Telepictures.  However, all three were forced to resign when Lorimar discovered that they had  an interest in Continental Marketing Distributors, a video supplier to  Karl-Lorimar.  </P> <P> Karl was the first witness for the defense in a legal malpractice suit filed by  Shannon and Hunt against Newport Beach attorney Michael Genovese, who is  accused of giving the pair bad advice that led to the loss of their jobs.  </P> <P> Genovese denies any wrongdoing. His attorneys declined to discuss the case with  reporters Tuesday.  </P> <P> Karl had been so reluctant to discuss his involvement in the Lorimar affair  publicly that his lawyer had earlier sought to have his testimony heard in  secret. But Judge Kazuharu Makino rejected that move late last month, saying  that he would not grant Karl "a private court."  </P> <P> While seeking to justify his past business practices, Karl also said he takes  responsibility for his decision not to disclose to his bosses at Lorimar his  financial stake in a Lorimar supplier. He resigned in March, 1987, amid charges  that the arrangement amounted to a conflict of interest.  </P> <P> "I made the mistake. I didn't listen to . . . advice," Karl said at one point  during his more than three hours on the stand.  </P> <P> Karl said that it was never his intention to hide his financial stake in the  Torrance- based CMD from the Lorimar board of directors. Rather, he simply  decided not to deal with the matter until CMD gained more clients.  </P> <P> "I guess I avoided what I should do and go to the board," he said. "I just put  it off."  </P> <P> He took this action against the advice of Genovese, who as Karl's attorney  advised his client to approach Lorimar with the issue, Karl testified.  </P> <P> However, Karl defended the legitimacy of the arrangement between Karl-Lorimar  and CMD, saying that he believed the deal was honest because outside bids were  taken before awarding contracts to CMD and because he was kept at "arms length"  from the process.  </P> <P> Karl continually stressed that positive thinking and a good attitude got him  through his troubled times, which included an admission that he made illegal  campaign contributions to former presidential candidate Gary Hart and his  filing for bankruptcy protection against about $4 million in delinquent taxes.  </P> <P> At the beginning of his testimony, Karl revealed that he underwent cancer  surgery six months ago. Bonnie Brown, an attorney of the plaintiffs, said he  had skin cancer. Karl and his attorney declined to discuss any aspects of his  day in court.  </P></p>

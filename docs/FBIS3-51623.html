As you know, workers around the country are meeting to  discuss the measures that must be adopted to solve one of the  biggest problems the country is confronting, excess currency.  Luis Sexto will introduce the subject.    [Sexto] I am going to talk about the meetings underway  throughout the country to discuss the possible measures that  could be adopted to reduce, among other things, excess currency.  Some listeners have called to ask me: What kind of measures will  be adopted? What is going to be done? I have told them that I am  not a fortune-teller. You can ask a reporter for his opinion on  specific social problems or political happenings, but you cannot  ask the reporter, or anyone else for that matter, to predict  which measures will be adopted. We do not know that.    We are holding parliaments in the workplace. We have seen  that the country is looking for a solution; it is asking around.    [Roque] And people have doubts. Undoubtedly, many people  must  satisfy their need to be informed. There are times when  information is not available because we not have enough  newspapers, because a power outage does not allow them to listen  to a specific program. These are reasons we are all familiar  with. However, I do believe we must inform on this problem. We  must continue to broach it.    This problem has been discussed on "Straight Talk" in the  past; however, today we are somewhat repeating it. We must do so  because many people need the information, need to be told what  is being done.    [Sexto] I agree and this is what motivated me to come here  and talk about this crucial and basic problem for our country.  The other day we talked about the big material basis our country  has to overcome in the special period. We talked about all those  real material and economic possibilities our country has as a  result of all that it has built throughout the past 35 years.  However, it is also necessary to adopt economic measures. We  must streamline and improve other aspects of our economy that  will make it easier for the whole material infrastructure to  operate properly.    [Roque] Then why do people have doubts? Many of the people  who have expressed doubts do not work. Many of these people stay  at home; they have no way of attending a parliament at the  workplace.    [Sexto] I believe that the people want measures to be  adopted. I believe the people want to see the problem solved.  Some are uncertain about the whole process. I want to say that  this is a very delicate process. This is a very delicate  situation. Some people may think that the country is taking too  long to solve a pressing problem. The seriousness of the problem  has been addressed publicly; our leaders have discussed this  problem in public. However, we must also realize that this is  such a serious and delicate problem that we must find the  appropriate way to solve it and not make mistakes while solving  it. The country must not make mistakes when solving the problem;  otherwise, it will have to correct those mistakes and the  situation will be even worse. We must find the best measures for  everyone.    From the technical viewpoint, it is quite possible that the  economists know what to do and can do it quickly; however, it  has already been said, and I repeat: In Cuba, economy and  politics go hand in hand. Economy and politics are one. This  means that all economic measures adopted must first be analyzed  from the political point of view. All interests must be  reconciled before adopting any measures. We must avoid affecting  the majority of the population.    [Roque] Luis Sexto and I, Juan Carlos Roque Garcia, are here  searching for coinciding points on this "Straight Talk" program.  We are talking about doubts the people have about the measures  to be adopted. Their doubts are quite normal. The people are  worried and they want to know what is happening. They want to  know what kind of measures will be adopted. I wish to make it  clear that these measures are still on the drawing board.    [Sexto] There is something I noticed among the listeners  who called in. They are aware of what is being discussed at this  or that work center, shop, or factory. Perhaps they are a bit  confused about what is going on. Many people think that all the  suggestions presented at these parliaments in the workplace are  the actual measures that will be implemented.    [Roque] I will give you an example. A few days ago Renato  Recio was on this program and he talked about a work center in  Matanzas where the workers suggested that the number of sick  leave days a worker can take be specified. This is only a  suggestion made by the Matanzas workers. This has many people  thinking. Many people have called asking what this would entail.    [Sexto] I know. Many people think that just because  something  has been suggested by a worker -- the worker made his suggestion  publicly and the media covered it -- it will immediately become  a measure to be implemented. They believe that any suggestion  made will become a measure to be implemented.    [Roque] It is quite possible.    [Sexto] Yes. We have undertaken a process that many have  called parliament in the workplace. The Cuban Workers Federation  has approached the working class. It has sought the wisdom of  the worker, the wisdom of the working man, to find the best way  to solve this serious problem Cuba is facing.    [Roque] Most of the voters are included in that group. We  must also realize that we heavily depend on production to solve  the problem. Right?    [Sexto] Right.    [Roque] This is the reason the worker is being approached.    [Sexto] There is another purpose behind those parliaments in  the workplace. The idea is not only to find a suitable proposal  on solving the problem of the budget deficit and excess  currency. The idea is also to get the workers to talk about how  they can be more efficient. They are discussing what has to be  done at the specific workplace to make it more efficient. When  we improve efficiency we are also contributing to the reduction  of excess currency. We are producing things that will be a  tangible basis for the money we earn at a workplace. We will  earn that money after we have produced a product.    [Roque] Many listeners write or call us. We must not forget  that many of these listeners are not directly members of a work  center; however, they are going to be affected by the measures  that will be implemented.    [Sexto] If we use the word affected, some people may think  they are going to be hurt by the implementation of the measures.  I think many people may be a bit confused about this. We talk  about measures that may affect the people or represent a  sacrifice. People are wondering: What's cooking? Am I being  prepared for something when I am told that these measures could  affect me? Are they getting ready to hit me on the head? This  has created uncertainty among some.    [Roque] But we cannot overlook the fact that measures are  measures and someone will always be affected by them.    [Sexto] It is quite logical that the measures will affect  some people. But let us stop and think about this a bit. I do  not know what kind of measures are going to be implemented. I  believe that no one in Cuba knows what measures are going to be  implemented. Perhaps soon we will know. We will know once these  meetings have ended and the National Assembly of the People's  Government holds its extraordinary session.    I believe that the people may be affected to a certain  extent, and we should put the word affected in quotation marks.  For example, I believe that one of the measures that could be  implemented -- and any thinking person in the country would  agree -- will be the elimination of some of the gratuities the  government provides. The elimination of some gratuities would  allow the state to balance its income and spending. One of the  sources for excess currency is the imbalance between what the  government receives and what it spends in social benefits,  subsidies, and others. The deficit this creates is harmful to  our economy. Perhaps some of these gratuities should be  eliminated, but first we must study how this elimination will  affect the people. Up to now we have been enjoying many services  for practically nothing.    Let us say that from now on we have to pay for the products  included in the school ration book. What is the cost of a  workbook and pencil compared to free medicine and free education?    [Roque] Luis Sexto is asking what would happen if parents  had  to pay for pencils and workbooks. This is something we get for  free.    [Sexto] People would say that eliminating things like this  affects them. And if we had to pay for uniforms, well, that  would be for children with scholarships. Uniforms are usually  bought at the store. Right now we do not have enough uniforms.    I also believe we could increase the amount we pay for  electricity. What we pay for electricity is practically  nothing. What would a few centavos mean if we are getting free  medicine? What would a few centavos mean if we do not have to  pay when a child gets sick, when you get sick, or when you get a  heart transplant. That is what I am talking about. What if the  telephone rates are increased. I am not saying that the  telephone rates are going up. I am not saying that the  electricity rates are going up. What I am saying is that this  is what I am going to suggest when I participate at my  Parliament in the Workplace. It is necessary for our country  to be in accordance with the demands of the situation. Our  country cannot continue to subsidize electricity; it cannot  continue to subsidize telephone costs; it cannot continue to  subsidize some basic products. The state is paying so that the  consumer does not have to pay high prices for those products.  That is what I am talking about.    [Roque] We are nearing the end of the program.    [Sexto] Give me a minute to finish what I was saying. I do  not want to confuse the people with what I am about to say. I  am not a fortune-teller. What measures are going to be adopted?  I do not know. I think no one does. Let us wait for the ANPP  extraordinary session and let the deputies decide what strategy  our country will follow. What I want to do is remind the  listeners that these measures will be adopted to solve a  problem, not to create more problems. That is what we must  remember. That is what we must keep in mind, and we should not  be frightened.    [Roque] A process of awareness must be carried out. The  people must be made aware of what is going to be done.    [Sexto] I believe that these parliaments in the workplace  also are contributing to making the people aware of the problem.  We have never had a problem like this one. Back in the  seventies, the country faced a similar situation and the problem  was solved differently. Back then we had the socialist bloc, we  imported more products, new products were put up for sale, and  part of the excess currency was taken off the streets. However,  today's situation is different and we must become aware of this.  Juan Carlos, I do believe that all that will be done will be to  solve the problem. That is what we must keep in mind.    [Roque] You finished just in time. BOHEMIA reporter Luis  Sexto was with us today on Straight Talk.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese bank launches Y100bn convertible deal MITSUI TAIYO Kobe Bank, the Japanese bank, has launched an unusual offering of exchangeable preferred stock which will boost the bank's tier one capital above the 4 per cent level recommended under Basle guidelines. The deal is believed to have been looked on favourably by the Japanese Ministry of Finance. The Y100bn deal, arranged by Goldman Sachs, is one of only a handful of yen-denominated convertible deals for Japanese borrowers to be offered in the Euromarket, and the first such deal to be arranged by a US bank. Nomura is acting as joint lead manager. The structure of the deal was designed to attract managers of convertible funds in Europe, by offering a higher coupon in conjunction with a higher premium. The paper pays a fixed dividend of 6 3/4 per cent semi-annually, and the exchange price will be set on March 19 at a premium of 15 per cent above the closing share price. For stock which has not already been exchanged, there is mandatory redemption in exchange for shares on June 30, 1995. If the share price has fallen, the number of shares will increase correspondingly, although there is a limit on the number of new shares. Traditionally, Japanese banks have issued yen-denominated convertible bonds in the Japanese domestic market and dollar or Swiss-franc denominated bonds in the Eurobond market, all with fairly low coupons and priced at a low premium. However, the poor performance of the Japanese stock market has caused these sources of funds to dry up in recent years. Japanese banks have found it increasingly hard to raise equity-linked debt, after being spoilt for cheap funding in the early and mid-1980s. The deal met firm demand from fund managers, particularly funds which stress income and traded well above its par issue price to close at 103 bid. Despite the success of the transaction, it may not prompt heavy supply of such paper. The structure was specially designed to allow the bank to use the proceeds as tier one capital and although it might be applicable in other cases, there would not be automatic clearance of the necessary regulatory hurdles. The paper was issued through a vehicle company called Sakura Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsui Taiyo Kobe. The bank will shortly change its name to Sakura Bank, or Cherry Blossom Bank.</p>

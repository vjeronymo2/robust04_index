			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] Secretary Viktar  Ivashkevich has told a BELAPAN correspondent that the BNF  leadership has received unofficial information concerning  attempts by the Council of Ministers to ban the activities of  the BNF and to strip leader Zyanon Paznyak, of the legislative  opposition, of his deputy powers. The opposition newspaper  SVABODA reported the same in a recent issue. According to  SVABODA, the Cabinet of Ministers leadership have requested that  the Prosecutor's Office, KGB, and the Interior Ministry find  legal grounds to ban the BNF. The Prosecutor's Office  reportedly has been asked to consider the possibility of  initiating criminal proceedings against Zyanon Paznyak.  However, as has been pointed out by Viktar Ivashkevich, the BNF  leadership thus far knows nothing about any concrete legal  measures taken by law enforcement bodies.</p>

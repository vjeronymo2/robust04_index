			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> R&amp;B SINGERS DRAW ON GOSPEL ROOTS FOR EMOTIONAL INTENSITY  </P> <P> What the playground is to a pro basketball player, the church is to top-flight  R&amp;B singers. It's where you begin if you want to play in the big leagues.  </P> <P> Miki Howard and David Peaston are among the finest pop-R&amp;B singers of  recent vintage, and it's no accident that they both began by singing in gospel  choirs. The whole purpose of religious music is to convey an inner experience  of ardor and passion. On stage at the Celebrity Theatre Saturday night, Howard  and Peaston both showed that they learned their early lessons well enough to  carry that fervor over to songs of romantic love.  </P> <P> Howard, originally from Chicago, was a convincing romantic tragedian. After a  slow beginning, her hourlong headlining set began to smolder with a streak of  songs in which Howard cast herself as the lover spurned or ignored.  </P> <P> On "Baby, Be Mine," Howard, elegant in a white suit, reached back to the church  and turned the song into a keening prayer for romantic salvation. The dramatic  set-piece ended with steamy uplift when one of Howard's backing musicians  joined her for a duet that answered her rising pleas with promises of physical  consolation.  </P> <P> Howard kept the mood torchy and blue through a medley of blues and soul songs  drawn from a series of precursors -- Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Lena  Horne and Aretha Franklin. The segment took on a bit of an archival cast,  however, instead of emphasizing the timelessness of songs like "Stormy  Weather." The segment ended with Howard's three backing singers crooning "Let's  go back to the blues," lending it a false Vegas touch.  </P> <P> Howard quickly made up for that lapse with the deep-blue, late-night saloon  singing of "You've Changed," which came across with an immediacy that belied  any notion that older material belongs on a museum shelf. After that long  stretch of romantic woe, Howard tried to finish on an uplift. She undercut  herself by summoning dozens of fans to the stage during "Until You Come Back to  Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)," a Stevie Wonder song previously done by Aretha  Franklin. The crowd surrounding Howard made for a festive mood on stage but  left everyone else in the house feeling like an uninvited onlooker at a wedding  party. Howard got the energy level back for her finale, "Love Under New  Management."  </P> <P> Throughout the show, Howard displayed her gospel-influenced ability to build  passion by repeating phrases and stretching syllables over a multitude of  notes. These fiery displays didn't stray from the point of the songs and,  therefore, never came off as mere show.  </P> <P> Peaston was far more inclined to grandstand than Howard. But even if he  repeated his showiest vocal maneuvers too often, listening to this large, round  mound of soul sound was still a treat (even amid some terrible sound  distortion).  </P> <P> From Eddie Kendricks to Philip Bailey, most top R&amp;B tenors have sung with a  smooth, creamy tone. What makes Peaston distinctive is the bite in his  falsetto. He was able to sound thick and raspy even in his upper register -- a  knack that gave his singing exceptional body and vibrancy.  </P> <P> Peaston performed with a palpable warmth and sense of delight, arms waving and  eyes popping. He used his bulk to his advantage. Occasionally, he would make a  quip about it. More often he would just shake it. When a big man mambos -- as  the large Orange County blues singer Robert Lucas puts it in one of his songs  -- people pay attention. Peaston showed he could mambo with the best of them.  </P> <P> Peaston's 65-minute show began with a false step into Vegas slickness, as his  trio of backup singers crooned snippets of his songs as reverentially as if  they were holy writ. But things soon were on track as Peaston moved from  effective funk to a swinging, R&amp;B version of "God Bless the Child" to some  well-executed straight blues.  </P> <P> It was encouraging to hear Howard and Peaston both drawing upon Billie  Holiday's legacy and doubly encouraging to hear both of them dip into the  straight, traditional blues. R&amp;B has largely discarded the "B" since disco  and techno-funk arrived about 15 years ago, and that neglect has cost it an  inexhaustible wellspring for passion and character. It was nice to hear  successful, contemporary pop-soul practitioners putting it back in the mix.  </P> <P> Troop, a singing and dancing ensemble of five youngsters from Pasadena, opened  with a lightweight but energetic set of techno-funk. They combined hip-hop  dance athletics with good vocal craftsmanship. But the backing vocals sounded  suspiciously robust during some of the more heated dance maneuvers, when mere  mortals would more likely be panting for breath than singing in perfect,  swelling harmony. The guys in Troop may be cardiovascular wonders -- or they  may have been cheating by lip-syncing some of their parts to a tape. Only their  sound engineer knows for sure.  </P> <P> The fact is that in the MTV age, not only is it hard to tell whether a  performance is real or Memorex, but slipping ethics among video wonders like  Janet Jackson and Milli Vanilli have made it common for so-called "live" acts  to slide by on a prerecorded crutch. If Troop stands unjustly accused here,  it's because the shoddy standards of others render today's dance-popsters as  ethically suspect as politicians.  </P> <P> Singers like Howard and Peaston, who developed their crutch-free vocal chops in  church, know what a lip-synced "live" performance is: It's a sin.  </P></p>

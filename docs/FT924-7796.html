			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Anger as PM opts to miss S African rugby game TODAY'S historic rugby match between England and South Africa continued to be dogged by controversy when it emerged last night that Mr John Major had cancelled plans to attend the game. Mr Major had been expected to accompany South African president F W de Klerk, who arrived in London yesterday, after talks with him in the morning. Yesterday, rugby authorities tried to defuse a row over national anthems. They said only God Save the Queen would be played today and not Die Stem (The Voice). The decision was taken after objections by the African National Congress that Die Stem was too closely associated with the ruling National party and the policy of apartheid. A decision to play neither anthem was revoked in the face of protest by English fans. Downing Street officials said last night no announcement about Mr Major's attendance had been made. The prime minister had a heavy official and private programme over the weekend, including his daughter's 21st birthday party, and that was the only reason he was not going to the match. However, angry South African rugby officials made clear they had been expecting Mr Major to be Mr de Klerk's host. Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, is expected to take his place. Mr Major's decision is likely to be seen by Pretoria as a snub, though Downing Street stressed that any such interpretation would be 'ludicrous'. An official pointed out that Mr Major would be driving from his Huntingdon constituency for today's meeting. The importance of the occasion for South Africa was highlighted in a speech last night by Mr de Klerk who hailed it as a symbol, 'perhaps more than any other . . . (of) the restoration of normal relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom'. The game is the first between the two sides at Twickenham since 1969.

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Travel: A little hacienda that I know . . . - Michael Thompson-Noel has been sampling a mix of top-class and good value hotels some grand, some not, but each of them proof of the diversity and rapidity of evolution in the international hotel business. Take the Hacienda de San Rafael in western Andalucia, Spain. It is 30 minutes from Seville, Jerez or Arcos and 75 minutes from Ronda. The hacienda is owned and run by Kuky and Tim Reid and is entirely surrounded, at this time of year, by fields of sunflowers stretching to the horizon - a magnificent spot. In turn, Hacienda de San Rafael is one of the most memorable small hotels you may ever encounter, not only for its location but for its food and atmosphere. The building dates back more than 150 years. Until 20 years ago the hacienda was a molino, used for producing olive oil. It has been restored with enormous care. At present there are seven bedrooms with bathrooms, plus two additional bedrooms for family use. There is a large living room and dining room located on either side of the entrance to the rose-, jasmine- and bougainvillaea-strewn courtyard, off which four of the bedrooms, duplex-designed and with en-suite bathrooms, are positioned. There is a swimming pool, gardens and a paddle-tennis court. The food is exceptional and Kuky Reid possibly the nicest woman in Europe. The current room-and-breakfast rate at Hacienda de San Rafael is Pounds 70 per night. Lunch or dinner: Pounds 22. The hacienda can be booked exclusively for a group of 10-14. Until October, a group booking costs Pounds 1,080 per day plus 10 per cent service charge. In winter: Pounds 620 plus 10 per cent. You can book for the Hacienda de San Rafael through TRI Hotel Marketing in London. Alternatively, you can use Kirker Travel, a vigorous and expert travel organiser that specialises in upmarket European short-break holidays in Spain (primarily Madrid, Barcelona and Seville, but also including hotel itineraries throughout Granada and Cordoba), Portugal, Amsterdam, Paris and Italy. It also handles rail holidays. Kirker's current charge for three nights at the hacienda on a half-board basis, including car hire and flights from London, is Pounds 569 per person. Extra nights: Pounds 109. Or you could have three nights at the hacienda (half board) and three (B&amp;B) at the immaculate Casa de Carmona, 20 minutes from the centre of Seville, for Pounds 845 per person. Another excellent establishment is Warsaw's Hotel Bristol. It first opened its doors in 1901, with concert pianist and Polish statesman Ignacy Paderewski as one of its biggest shareholders. It became a Warsaw landmark. Under the communists the Bristol was closed 12 years ago, but has now been re-established as a joint venture between Forte Hotels and Poland's Orbis. And it is absolutely smashing - stylish, comfortable, discreet and immensely well-run. The service is so professional that there were times when I imagined I was in some hot-shot hostelry in Rome, Sydney or Beverly Hills, the sort of place that charges Dollars 1,250 a night just for looking at you. The Hotel Bristol has 163 bedrooms and 43 suites, two superb restaurants (one Polish, one Italian), the best hotel cafe I have ever sat in and an indoor swimming pool. Warsaw is more problematic: dull and dusty and (as yet) uninteresting. I went on a coach tour to Chopin's birthplace. It cost Pounds 30, which was absurdly expensive, though we were given a Chopin recital by a Warsaw pianist, Marta Gozdecka, that calmed and charmed us. And on Saturday night I found my way to the ballet at the Warsaw opera house which - for Giselle - was surprisingly enjoyable. The best seats cost Pounds 5. You will find information on the Hotel Bristol in the Forte International brochure, covering Forte hotels in more than 50 places in Europe, the US, Caribbean and Middle East. The guide price for the Hotel Bristol quoted recently was Pounds 61 or Dollars 90 per person per night, including breakfast, for two people sharing (singles: Pounds 95/Dollars 140), though room rates are subject to currency adjustment. Offers in the brochure include extra-value longer stays, such as seven nights for the price of six. In many cases children stay free of charge when sharing a room with their parents. Vastly different is the newly-opened, 150-apartment Corfu Plaza Hotel near Agios Georgios beach in south-western Corfu, the latest addition to Corfu's huge package holiday industry and owned by the local Rizos family. I doubt that FT readers will be fighting to get into the Corfu Plaza - it is not their scene at all - though they might want to send irksome teenagers there for a cheerful introduction to a delightful island. I was more taken with two other Rizos hotels in Corfu. Like the Corfu Plaza, they are to be found in the Thomson Summer Sun brochure - the Hotel Yaliscari Palace at Pelekas and, even more so, the Hotel Aghios Gordios at Aghios Gordios. The Thomson brochure is a 508-page encyclopaedia of feel-good writing of the highest class. Of the Hotel Aghios Gordios, it says: 'Couples of all ages will love the romantic setting, peace and tranquillity amid breathtaking scenery.' I am not sure about peace and tranquillity. When I was there the joint was jumping. But the customers looked respectable. The general manager is a beauty. The location is spectacular. And the view westward over the Ionian Sea is without doubt . . . romantic. Two people could have a seven-night (half board) Thomson package holiday at the Aghios Gordios in late September or October for about Pounds 680, which is probably good value. Finally, I spent a weekend recently in a Novotel in the centre of Lille, in northern France. Lille was an eye-opener - excellent shops and restaurants, plenty to see and do - and I am a fan of Novotels anyway, so that was nice. There are 270 worldwide. Generally, corporate manifestos are risible. But Novotels deliver the goods. There are said to be eight fundamentals underlying the Novotel approach to hospitality - a spacious 24 sq metre room; children under 16 sharing their parents' room accommodated free; swimming pools and gardens; special weekend leisure packages, especially at Evasion and Thalassa hotels; meals served from 6am to midnight; business services; parking facilities at each hotel, and convenient locations. In addition, rates are extremely competitive. UK telephone numbers: Hacienda de San Rafael: TRI Hotel Marketing, 081-876-3419. Kirker Travel: 071-231-3333.

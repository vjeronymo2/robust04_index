			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Heseltine maintains ban on TV services from BT Any opportunity for British Telecommunications to offer television entertainment and home-shopping services before the end of the century was ruled out last night by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The move came despite a recent call from MPs for a government ban on BT providing such services to be lifted. In a clear indication that the government wants to encourage cable TV operators to invest in local cable systems, Mr Heseltine said that the 10-year ban, imposed in 1991, would be maintained. He is due to give a formal statement on the issue this week to the Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee, which called this year for the restriction on BT to be removed. However, Mr Heseltine gave a clear intimation of his response on BBC TV's Money programme last night, when he was asked whether the ban forbidding BT to offer video-on-demand and home shopping on an 'electronic superhighway' would end early. 'That's not going to happen,' he replied, adding: 'I've made it absolutely clear we will not break the government's word. There is effectively a commercial, contractual relationship upon which people have invested millions of pounds. You cannot then turn round and say: 'I'm sorry, the British government's changed its mind'.' BT has been lobbying for some time for a lifting of the ban, which forbids it using its network to carry entertainment services until at least 2001, with a review at some stage after 1998. The company became particularly concerned about the issue several years ago when cable companies began to expand from television services into the telephone market. However, Mr Heseltine's reluctance to lift the injunction has been criticised by MPs on the Trade and Industry Select Committee, which fears that it could leave the UK lagging the US and Japan in the development of information services. Last night Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said he was disappointed Mr Heseltine had rejected his detailed proposals, which would have protected the interests of both BT and the cable companies. BT said last night it was 'disappointed' at Mr Heseltine's refusal to bring forward the date for lifting the ban. 'We want a date when we can start so that we can justify our present levels of investment,' BT added.</p>

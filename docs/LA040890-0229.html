Signed a  five-year, $16-million contract with the Angels.  </P> <P> Comments: Considered baseball's premier free agent last fall, Langston's  presence has given the Angels a surplus of quality starters. The left-hander is  best known for his fastball, which has helped him strike out at least 200 in  five of the last six seasons, but he also can be effective with a variety of  breaking and offspeed pitches. Langston has had a tendency to give up the long  ball -- he allowed 30 or more home runs a season from 1986-88 -- but many came  inside Seattle's cozy Kingdome. His earned-run average has improved in each of  the last four seasons, from 5.47 to 4.85, 3.84, 3.34 and 2.74, and he has  proven a durable commodity. He has been on the disabled list just once in six  years.  </P></p>

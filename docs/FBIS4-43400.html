			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Olli Kivinen: "The Intolerable Problem in </F> Foreign Policy"]    [Text] The way that Esko Aho's cabinet operates has  demonstrated that strengthening the role of parliament and the  cabinet in conducting foreign policy is no simple matter. This  cabinet's policy provides strong arguments for those who are  opposed to to the partial transfer of the conducting of foreign  policy from the president to the cabinet.    The real core of the problem is that the cabinet needs to  govern and blaze the way if it is to be given additional  authority in foreign policy.    The way that the cabinet has handled the situation that has  arisen after the negotiations between the European Union [EU]  and Finland has not been encouraging, but it underscores those  very problems that are to be feared in the operations of future  cabinets also.    The most important decision in our country's history that is  to be made under normal conditions, after calm deliberations,  i.e., the EU membership decision, has been badly confused with  domestic policies and the inner turmoil within one political  party. In addition to this, the way that the domestic subsidy  plan has been dealt with is coming close to making the entire  issue a labor market issue.    The reluctance of leading ministers of the cabinet, or, more  accurately, of the Center Party, to commit themselves to the  result they themselves negotiated, their sour expressions as  well as evasive, sometimes even misleading statements have  astonished even foreign ambassadors who have long tenure in  Helsinki and are amicably disposed toward Finland.    The impressions gained by foreign countries can be corrected  with precise statements. Finns are in a more difficult position.  The citizenry has clearly expressed a desire for more  information. The media organs are offering enormous amounts of  it, but cabinet statements would push anyone at all into a state  of uncertainty. The cabinet has not even voided the statement of  its own negotiator, Esa Harmala, that Finland's domestic  agricultural plan can be approved here only after the EU  commission has approved it. This is not the case. The EU  commission only makes statements to members and Finland is not a  member. The details of a domestic plan are neither conditions  for, nor obstacles to membership.    At its worst, uncertainty nourishes doubts expressed in  tavern discussions that the cabinet is trying to use its  waffling and confusing information to force wage earners into  opposing the membership, thus making the entire membership  project null and void.    Anyone at all can conceptualize endless hypothetical  examples  of the kinds of difficulties the country is faced with if  foreign policy is demoted to be a part of an internal power  struggle within one political party. As an extreme situation,  one can even imagine a situation in which a national defense  decision is postponed due to the inner conflicts within one of  the leading governing parties.    Simply put: Foreign policy is a matter in which a small  country cannot afford to play political bumper pool in the same  way as with domestic income distribution issues or details of  social policy.    The cabinet must define its objectives, realize them, and  stand behind the results. Order must reign in foreign policy.  Else, the country's credibility will waver.    Minister of Development Cooperation Toimi Kankaanniemi is a  different matter altogether. He is a hostage of the cabinet so  that his party cannot too seriously erode support for the bigger  governing parties. He is opposed to the EU membership push, in  other words, cabinet policy. His staying in the cabinet is  assured by well-chosen words that do not prevent his preaching  against integration. In conditions reminiscent of an ice hockey  match, it is strange that one member of the team is trying to  shoot in the opposite goal.    In addition to this, Kankaanniemi has become involved in the  dispute about the status of Jerusalem, again contrary to the  policy of the Finnish cabinet. The Middle East crisis is  complicated enough without a noncomprehending and uninformed  Finnish minister's becoming involved in a dispute on which  Israel has not been able to get the backing of even its  staunchest Western supporters. Continuing to hang on to  Kankaanniemi as a cabinet member adds to the atmosphere of  confusion.    The drafting of foreign policy has been made more difficult  already by the emergence of new concentrations of authority. The  president of the Republic has his own staff, so does the prime  minister. The foreign ministry bunker is as old as the hills and  will not change into anything else. Construction of yet a fourth  fortress is well under way as the Armed Forces are making more  efficient their operations in political wrangling over national  defense policy.    The United States is a superpower and can afford the  legendary vying for supremacy between the White House, the State  Department, and the Department of Defense. Russia also recalls  its greatness and absorbs two foreign policies, the president's  and the military's. A small country cannot afford any confusion.</p>

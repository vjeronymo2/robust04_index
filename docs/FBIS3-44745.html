			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Pan Hsiao-ping (3382 2556 1627): "Lu </F> Ping Says That a Lenient Policy Must Be Adopted Toward Former  Hong Kong Residents Who Intend To Regain Their Right of Abode"]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council,  said today that for former permanent residents of Hong Kong to  regain their right of abode in Hong Kong after losing such a  right, a more lenient policy should be adopted after 1997.  Because these people had once obtained permanent resident  status in Hong Kong, they are different from those newly arrived  in Hong Kong and applying for the right of abode. He said:  Furthermore, we welcome persons of ability from various  countries to Hong Kong, which is an international economic city,  and we should provide them with some conveniences.    Lu Ping answered reporters' questions this morning and  afternoon on the issue of the status of permanent residents. Lu  Ping said that the Preliminary Work Committee is studying the  issue as to what conditions will cause former permanent  residents of Hong Kong to lose their right of abode and what  requirements they would have to meet in order to regain their  right of abode after losing such right. He thought that for the  former permanent residents of Hong Kong who want to regain their  right of abode, a more lenient policy should be adopted. Lu  Ping pointed out: "The issue of nationality and the issue of  right of abode are two different matters. After 1997,  foreigners can also obtain the right of abode in Hong Kong as  well as the status of permanent resident." But Lu Ping added:  "After non-Chinese nationals obtain permanent resident status,  if they return to their own countries to live or emigrate to  other countries then they might lose the status of permanent  resident of Hong Kong because they have given up Hong Kong as a  place of permanent residence."</p>

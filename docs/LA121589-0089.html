			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN THE EAST BLOC;  </P> <P> E. GERMANY SCRAPS AGENCY IN CHARGE OF HATED SECRET POLICE;  </P> <P> REFORMS: ACTION BY THE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP SEEKS TO SATISFY A MAJOR DEMAND OF  THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT.  </P> <P> East Germany's Communist government sought to satisfy a major demand of the  country's mass opposition movement Thursday by abolishing the state agency in  charge of the huge and hated secret police apparatus.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the Office of National Security told Western journalists that the  institution was being shut down and its responsibilities distributed among  other ministries. The office was created last month to replace the State  Security Agency, popularly known as the Stasi, which ran a vast network of  agents to spy on East Germans and repress internal dissent.  </P> <P> No details of the reorganization of the security apparatus were available  Thursday. Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer, while confirming that the  Cabinet had acted on the issue, said no official information will be released  until the government reports on its actions at a "round table" of political  parties and opposition groups.  </P> <P> Opposition groups demanded the dismantling of the domestic secret police at the  first meeting of the round table last week. Earlier, crowds of demonstrators  around the country had occupied or besieged the regional and local offices of  the Stasi in cities around East Germany, in part to prevent the destruction of  evidence of corruption.  </P> <P> Ad hoc citizens' committees in Dresden, Rostock and other cities are still  standing guard around the state security buildings and overseeing their  operations. Though the present security forces chief, Wolfgang Schwanitz, has  described the occupations as violent "stormings," no injuries have been  reported and tensions appear to have diminished in recent days.  </P> <P> Even without the official action taken Thursday, the state security apparatus  around the country has been rapidly collapsing. Seventeen top officials of the  agency were forced to resign last week, and Schwanitz said personnel have been  reduced by up to 50% in some divisions as agents were sent to work in mines,  border checkpoints or the transport industry.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the agency said Wednesday that in addition to the occupations  in big cities, local security offices in many small towns are being closed in  cooperation with opposition groups.  </P> <P> Government spokesman Meyer said at his weekly news conference after the Cabinet  meeting that while the government is seeking to satisfy the round-table groups'  concerns about the security forces, the service would not be abolished. East  Germany will continue to keep up a security apparatus, "like every other  country," he said.  </P> <P> Opposition groups and the citizens' committees now monitoring the former Stasi  installations have said they would tolerate a continued spy service only if it  were directed exclusively toward external enemies. They have also demanded the  trial of dozens of former Stasi officers accused of corruption or abuse of  power.  </P> <P> Meyer said that the special hospital used by the state security will be opened  to the public soon and that the now-notorious compound where the country's  Communist leaders have lived will be turned into a 400-bed rehabilitation  center.  </P> <P> Former Communist leader Erich Honecker and several other deposed officials are  still living under house arrest in the well-appointed villas of the Wandlitz  compound near East Berlin. But Meyer said that Honecker would have to move out  by February so that the new medical rehabilitation center could be installed.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, one of the country's principal new opposition groups proposed a  three-point plan leading to a neutral confederation of German states. A press  conference by the Democracy Now group in East Berlin reflected the growing  sentiment in the country for a move toward union with West Germany.  </P></p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Third of employers insist on overtime ONE THIRD of companies insist employees should work overtime, according to a survey published by Industrial Relations Services. But more than half the companies in the study said they had recently introduced measures to restrict overtime, including shift work, extra staff and tighter management control. However, only five of the 65 companies in the survey set limits on the amount of overtime worked by an employee. The amount of overtime being worked was similar to last year, with five out of six companies reporting levels of overtime 'currently the same or lower than last year'. According to the survey, St Regis Paper said it restricted overtime in one week to 28 hours, while Scottish Amicable Life Assurance said it limited overtime to 24 hours a month. Suttons Seeds said overtime in the company had to be approved by the directors. Calor Gas and PPG Industries (glass fibre division) said they employed temporary or contract staff as a way of reducing dependence on overtime. Both PLM Redfearn, a packaging company, and Premier Fabrics said they had recruited more staff to cut overtime. Few companies have altered their methods of calculating overtime pay in the past five years, with little difference between manufacturing and service sectors. The most common rate for overtime pay is time and a half on weekdays and Saturday, double time on Sunday and double time plus time off on public holidays. The overtime rate is calculated as a fraction of a worker's normal hourly rate and then added to the hourly rate. The median overtime hours worked in the survey amounted to four a week but on average 20 extra hours were worked at Tate and Lyle. Overtime pay remains predominantly a blue-collar worker phenomenon. A third of respondents said overtime entitlements stopped at supervisory level while another third used the lower level of management as the cut-off point. London Underground, Woolwich building society and John Brown Engineering said overtime working extended to at least some of their middle management.

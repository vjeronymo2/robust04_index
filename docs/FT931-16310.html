			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bid deadline for Siddons extended PACIFIC BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK toolmaker, yesterday extended the deadline for its ADollars 86m (USDollars 58m) bid for Siddons Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group, giving substance to speculation that the offer will soon be increased. Pacific BBA said the cash and paper offer would remain open until January 27, nearly two weeks after the original deadline. It said that acceptances had been received for 0.1 per cent of Siddons' stock. The extention will give Pacific BBA time to consider whether to raise its ADollars 1.81-a-share offer to match a rival ADollars 2 cash bid by WA Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, the US engineering group. The WA Deutsher bid values Siddons at ADollars 94m. Mr Roger Flynn, Siddons' managing director, said the company was unsure whether the extension would lead to an increased offer. 'They have delayed to allow an extension to the bid, but whether they do or not will be up to them,' he said. 'The bid is still unacceptably low, and the board stands by its decision to reject it, particularly in light of the Illinois Tool Works bid.' The Siddons board is pressing for an offer in line with an independent assessment by Schroders Australia, which valued the company at between ADollars 2.60 and ADollars 3.00 a share. Siddons shares closed 4 cents lower yesterday at ADollars 2.01 in weak trading on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Krasowski: "Professionals or Bunglers?; </F> Politicians and Journalists Do Not Think Highly of Each Other"]    [Text]There is no agreement among politicians about  professional television journalists. According to some  politicians, the journalists are professional and thorough,  while other politicians accuse television journalists of bias,  superficiality, and sensation seeking.    For a few months now, there has been a spirited argument  going on among politicians as to the assessment of the new  public television management, but that is not the only theme of  the argument. Another one is something much more tangible --  assessments of the degree of professionalism of television  journalists.    According to Jan Litynski of the Freedom Union, in recent  times, the level of reporting and of television news programs  has much improved and he says it is "quite high." In his view,  the commentaries and reports are professional and describe well  the essence of the political event in question.    While Litynski's only complaint concerns constant changes in  the arrangement of television studios, Jerzy Wiatr of the  Democratic Left Alliance has some more serious accusations to  levy. In his view, the general level of professionalism  displayed by television journalists, is low. "There are  instances of professional, intelligent, and unbiased  journalists" -- Wiatr lists Andrzej Morozowski as one of them --  "but there are also many very bad ones." He adds that the level  is much below the capabilities that exist in Poland and that is  because many valuable people are removed.    In Wiatr's opinion, the main "sin" of television journalists  is not political prejudice but superficiality. In contrast to  their Western colleagues, Polish journalists are often times  poorly prepared to handle the topics they have been assigned.  They often try to cover up this ignorance with engaging in  polemics or even with a certain degree of aggressive behavior.    According to Litynski, television journalists are not  biased.  Even if one can be critical regarding, for instance, the  composition of a panel of guests invited to some political talk  show, there is no bias in that whatsoever. Wiatr in turn thinks  that often, errors in journalistic work do not indicate simply a  lack of professionalism but also bias.    Tomasz Nalecz of the Union of Labor has high praise  concerning television journalists. True, he thinks they engage  in too much sensation seeking (a report about a Sejm deputy who  caused an accident after having drunk two beers is more  important than a significant decision by the Sejm) but he adds  immediately that the team of journalists servicing the Sejm is  fully competent and professional.    Nalecz is outraged at the decision to suspend Grzegorz  Miecugow for failure to include a report on the president's  return from Estonia in "Wiadomosci" [main television newscast].  Nalecz thinks Miecugow was right in his decision.    "This proves that we still do not have a purely information-  oriented type of journalism" -- Nalecz says. "But I do not  condemn journalists because a short leash has always been  applied to them."</p>

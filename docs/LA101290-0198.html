			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'MISS DAISY' ALLOWED A DRIVER  </P> <P> Actor Hume Cronyn got permission to build an apartment for live-in help after  arguing that his wife, Oscar-winning actress Jessica Tandy, is ailing and that  his eyesight is failing.  </P> <P> Tandy, 81, and Cronyn, 79, were turned down in August for a zoning waiver but  were approved Tuesday by the Zoning Board of Appeals.  </P> <P> "Old age is a hardship," Cronyn told the panel. "One that you'll be dealing  with over the years."  </P> <P> The apartment on their property would be for a driver or attendant, Cronyn  said. He said the need had become more urgent since Tandy was hospitalized for  a heart condition after surgery. Cronyn did not disclose the nature of her  surgery.  </P> <P> Tandy, who won an Oscar for her role as an elderly woman who needed a chauffeur  in "Driving Miss Daisy," has suffered from angina for 10 years.  </P> <P> Cronyn also said a driver may become necessary because his eyesight is failing.  "I don't know how long we'll go on driving or looking after our place," he told  the board.  </P></p>

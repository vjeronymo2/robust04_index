			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA) -- Omani Minister of State for  Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah has said that his  country and Iran will work together to establish peace and  stability in the Gulf region.    Following his meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati today, Bin-'Alawi told MENA that he and the  Iranian minister discussed several important issues, including  the situation in Yemen, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Gulf region  in addition to bilateral ties.    Touching on the Gulf security arrangements, Bin-'Alawi  explained that this issue was not discussed during the meeting.  Our stance is clear in this connection, he said, noting that  his meeting with the Iranian minister focused primarily on the  issues included on the agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement  Conference.    The Omani state minister emphasized that a cease-fire in  Yemen will give Yemenis the chance to return to negotiations and  decide their country's future.    Replying to a question on relations between the Sultanate of  Oman and Israel, Bin-'Alawi said that there are no relations  between his country and Israel and that the Israeli delegation  that visited Muscat recently only took part in the multilateral  negotiations. This does not mean that there are Omani-Israeli  relations, he said.    I clearly explained that the establishment of such relations  in the future means that Israel will have to withdraw from all  the occupied Arab territories and that a comprehensive peace  will have to be established between Israel and all Arab states,  he said.</p>

In his words, the winter was fairly calm in Tajikistan.  There was no starvation, factories reopened, prices began to  decrease gradually. Serious anti-terrorist steps were taken.  On the other hand, the commander thought, the struggle for  power was becoming increasingly bitter on every level.    Pyankov predicted that as mountain passes opened in the  spring, opposition fighters and gangsters based in Afghanistan  and Tajikistan would step up their activities.    He said that tactical exercises of CIS forces were staged  for  after 20 March.</p>

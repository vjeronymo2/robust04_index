			<p>CSO     [Text] A partnership composed of Chiyoda Corporation and  the Petroleum Energy Center (Yasutomo Tateuchi, chairman) has  accepted a contract to participate in Chinese projects to  conserve energy and preserve the environment. As part of a model  project implemented by the New Energy Development Organization  (NEDO), the partnership will provide technical assistance in the  recycling of gases emitted in the operation of refineries to  generate electrical power. The project will extend over three  years from this fiscal year to encompass a 30-month construction  period and will cost about 2.5 billion yen. Chiyoda Corp. has  been exerting special efforts in winning contracts for  environmental preservation projects in developing nations.    The model project represents a joint venture between NEDO,  the Chinese National Planning Committee and China Petrochemical  Company (CINOPEC) and involves the construction of an energy  recovery system in the fluid contact cracking (FCC) unit of the  Shengli Refinery with an annual capacity of 7 million tons in  Zilu, Shandong Province.    The project has been subdivided so that Chiyoda Corporation  will handle the engineering phase of the petroleum  refinery-related system and the Petroleum Energy Center will  handle the training of local personnel in the operation and  maintenance of the new system.    The system will gasify heavy crude at high temperatures,  cause the separation of high-octane gasolines and light oils and  extract high-temperature, high-compression gas emissions from  the newly constructed FCC recycling tower for in-house  generation of electricity through the use of an expander  turbine. The system will enable a reduction in energy  consumption and enhance environmental preservation by capturing  catalytic particles including heavy metals which were formerly  released into the atmosphere.    Chiyoda Corporation has also tied up with the Engineering  Promotion Association (Yoshihiko Kamitoko, chairman) in winning  a contract from NEDO this fiscal year to install a simple  sulphur removal system at China's Chongqing Zhangshou Chemical  Plant as a model project promoting clean coal technology in  support of the effective use of coal and prevention of  environmental pollution. These organizations will beef up their  technical assistance programs in response to the increasing  number of environment-related projects in China and Southeast  Asia.</p>

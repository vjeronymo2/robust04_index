			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry confirmed  reports that Turkey was setting up a logistic support center in  the eastern city of Erzurum for international monitors of the  Azeri-Armenian conflict.    However, a Foreign Ministry spokesman hastened to add that  this was in no way a "base" but merely a logistical support  center.    Spokesman Ferhat Ataman's clarification follows claims in  some of the newspapers that the new structure would be a "second  Poised Hammer" -- a similar structure to the ones set up by  United States, France, and Britain for protecting the Kurds in  northern Iraq.    Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said Tuesday [31 May] that the  force was important for the monitoring of a cease-fire.    "It is important that peace efforts are made under a CSCE  umbrella on a multinational basis," she told Parliament members  of her True Path Party.    "Preparations are under way for a logistic support center in  Erzurum for the use of international monitors to be sent to the  region of conflict," she said.    Erzurum is eastern Turkey's major city closest to the  Armenian border.    Turkey is a member of the Minsk group of 11 nations working  to resolve the six-year-old Azeri-Armenian conflict over the  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, most Armenian populated but  technically ruled by Baku.    Armenian forces that have taken all of Karabakh have in the  last year seized 20 percent of Azeri lands proper, forcing about  1 million Azeris into refugee camps.    Turkey sides with fellow-Muslim and ethnic kin in Azerbaijan  urging an end to fighting and a withdrawal of Armenian forces  from Azeri territory.    Ataman, meanwhile, said earlier reports that Azerbaijan had  attacked the Azeri enclave of Nakhichevan were unconfirmed. "We  have checked the speculations and apparently, there was some  firing at the border, but there is no Armenian gain of  territory," Ataman said.    Turkey says it has the right of guarantee over this enclave  at its border. Asked what Turkey would do in case of an  Armenian attack, Ataman said: "We have made our point known.  There is no change in that."    Ankara has said in the past that it would not tolerate an  Armenian attack on Nakhichevan.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Anger at Hong Kong's BCCI alert: Commissioner warned bank's subsidiary to reduce exposure to parent before closure THE Hong Kong banking commissioner has admitted warning managers of the local subsidiary of Bank of Credit and Commerce International to reduce their exposure to the parent company before the worldwide closure of BCCI on July 5. The warnings followed earlier alerts arising from the late publication of BCCI's 1990 accounts. BCC Hong Kong (BCCHK) reduced its lending to the rest of the group from Dollars 757m (Pounds 418m) at the end of 1989 to Dollars 4m at June 30 1991. Mr David Carse, Hong Kong banking commissioner, also sent examiners into BCCHK branches the day before the closure was announced, when he already knew it was planned. The disclosure, revealed in a report last year by Mr Carse to Sir David Wilson, governor of Hong Kong, has provoked an angry response from bank supervisors in Gibraltar, where BCCI depositors lost Dollars 96m in the closure. Mr Brian Davidson, Gibraltar's banking supervisor, said yesterday he had made representations about the warnings to the UK's Bingham inquiry which is examining the role of the bank regulators in the BCCI affair. 'We actually feel quite aggrieved here about it all,' he said. The 30 local UK authorities which lost Pounds 83m in the collapse are also complaining because they say the Bank of England gave them no inkling of problems in BCCI before the closure. Creditors of BCCI are now demanding to know how widespread and comprehensive the warnings may have been and whether they affected banks in other jurisdictions. The Bank of England said yesterday it had not seen the Hong Kong report and could not comment. Mr Carse's report outlines the extent of Hong Kong's foreknowledge gained as a member of an exclusive group of bank supervisors who formed a college of regulators for BCCI in 1988. The initial members were the UK, Spain, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Hong Kong became a member in July 1989. He said concerns because of the delay in publication of the 1990 BCCI accounts led his office to urge BCCI Hong Kong to increase its liquidity and to reduce lending to other parts of the group. In calendar 1990, BCCHK's lending to other parts of BCCI was reduced by nearly Dollars 600m to Dollars 175m. Details of the July 2 meeting at the Bank of England, when it was decided to close BCCI, were passed to Mr Carse the same night. He said he put various contingency measures in place, including dispatching a team of examiners to the bank the day before the closure. He said in the report: 'I held discussions with the management of BCCHK and its auditors to obtain their current assessment of the bank's financial position. Without revealing the precise nature of my concern, I explained to the management of the bank that I understood there were some problems in the rest of the group that were delaying finalisation of the 1990 accounts and that BCCHK should ensure that it maintained high liquidity.' BCCI Hong Kong was sufficiently solvent after the shutdown to remain open on the Saturday after the closure and its doors were not closed until the following Monday. The Gibraltar supervisor has complained that the use of the college to exchange information without informing regulators in other jurisdictions was unfair. 'We did not even know there was a college of regulators,' Mr Davidson said.</p>

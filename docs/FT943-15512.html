			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gantry builds holding in Bridge Oil The battle for Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based energy group, threatened to reach stalemate last night. Gantry Acquisition, one of the two rival US-based bidders, raised its stake in Bridge to almost 10 per cent, buying shares at prices ranging up to 95 cents. Gantry said it wished to proceed with a full takeover offer at 95 cents a share - which would value Bridge at ADollars 399m (USDollars 285m) - but required further information before it would do so. In particular, it wanted to know if its Texan rival, Parker &amp; Parsley, would accept a higher Gantry offer in respect of its own 21 per cent stake in Bridge. Until yesterday, Gantry had been offering 85 cents a share for Bridge, while P&amp;P was offering 90 cents a share. P&amp;P described Gantry's 'alleged wish to make a 95 cents a share highly-conditional offer' as 'a mirage'. It said it would not accept such an offer in respect of its own Bridge shares. Gantry insisted it had no intention of accepting P&amp;P's 90 cents offer, and accused P&amp;P of using delaying tactics.</p>

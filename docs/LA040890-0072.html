			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEAVING HELSINKI FOR 'REAL' FINLAND  </P> <P> Last summer, in a quiet Helsinki park, I met a Finnish beauty named Seija who  at first seemed interested in my impressions of her country. But when I told  her I had not yet explored life outside the capital, she could not hide her  impatience.  </P> <P> "So you haven't been outside HEL-sinki," she said, accenting the first syllable  as Finns do. "That's too bad. You won't meet any Finns in Helsinki."  </P> <P> She had dismissed me as a typical tourist. What she didn't know was that I had  lived in Finland for a few years when I was in my twenties and already was  familiar with her wonderful country of diverse scenery and fascinating people.  </P> <P> Helsinki is an interesting stopover for anyone visiting Leningrad or Moscow.  But Seija was right. Away from the city, the rewards are even greater.  </P> <P> The real Finland is small towns and country villages -- places where one can  observe what Finns call sisu, the steely determination that has kept Finland  independent despite 40 wars with neighboring Russia.  </P> <P> During my four remaining days in Helsinki I decided to take four day-trips from  the central city; trips designed to bring me in closer contact with Finnish  culture. The destinations were easy to reach on inexpensive public  transportation, which provides excellent service for the English-speaking  visitor.  </P> <P> In assessing my needs, I decided that what I most needed was relaxation. I had  been told Haikko was the ideal place.  </P> <P> Haikko Manor is a luxurious mineral spa about 18 miles from Helsinki. A large  estate on 25 acres, it has a fully-equipped fitness center where one can take  part in aerobics, slosh around in a mud bath or simply relax in the sun.  </P> <P> The hotel interior is a pleasant surprise. The anteroom and guest suites have  been restored to their original 19th-Century appearance, with antique armoires  and four-poster beds in the manor's 27 double rooms.  </P> <P> As I entered the foyer, an ersatz version of a czar's summer home, I was  offered a glass of domestic champagne made from white currants. It was a  fitting prelude to the unusual day ahead.  </P> <P> Treatment began in the sauna, a Finnish invention, and as I entered, I wondered  if I would be on the menu that evening, wilting under 220 degrees of  birch-scented heat.  </P> <P> A Finn demonstrated the use of the viihta, the bundled twigs the Finns use to  increase circulation. I beat myself silly with the things, hoping no one was  looking. When I had turned a bright borscht-red, I retired to a private room to  relax and slake my thirst with a cold beer.  </P> <P> With my energy restored, I plunged into the dining room for a first-class  smorgasbord. Others with stamina signed up for water gymnastics and  weightlifting, but I'll take smoked salmon, pickled herring and fresh berries  as a responsible alternative, any day.  </P> <P> Haikko Manor offers special packages determined by the length of your visit. A  20-minute massage costs about $17. Rates for the more complex treatments rise  accordingly.  </P> <P> Haikko is 35 minutes by taxi (about $60, one way), one hour by bus and two  hours by boat (summers only) from downtown Helsinki. For overnight guests,  manor rates begin at about $160 per double and include swimming, sauna,  breakfast and service charges.  </P> <P> The next day I journeyed to a small Finnish town I remembered from my travels  nearly two decades before.  </P> <P> Porvoo is one of Finland's four 15th-Century medieval towns constructed by  Hanseatic traders. About 25 miles away, it is the closest of the four to  Helsinki and according to many Finns, the most beautiful.  </P> <P> The name "Porvoo" means "castle on the river," although the original castle  there did not survive the Middle Ages.  </P> <P> I arrived on a bus at a gently bubbling river lined with red-roofed waterside  storehouses. I stopped a Finn and asked about the buildings. "They were used  for storing salt," he said, in perfect English. "We Finns are a salty race."  </P> <P> At Tuomiokirkko (Porvoo Cathedral) I explored the gray stone church, the oldest  surviving structure in Porvoo from that period. The church was built in 1418,  gutted partially by fire in 1708 during the Great Northern War, and rebuilt  during that century. It is beautiful.  </P> <P> As I entered I was drawn to the artfully marbled pulpit and gallery,  reconstructed in 1729 by Johan Friedrich Schultze. Look for the artist's mark  behind the organ, on the church's back wall. It is an eerie, mysterious  signature.  </P> <P> Many of the old town's buildings date from the early 18th Century. Much of the  original architecture was demolished by fire in 1760 and reconstructed by the  townspeople themselves.  </P> <P> The town hall, built in 1746, was partially saved and renovated. Today it is a  historical museum. Adjacent to it, Holm House, an art museum, displays period  pieces painted by Albert Edelfelt and sculptures by Ville Vallgren, both  celebrated artists in Finland. The buildings are open daily.  </P> <P> Cafe life is very much a part of old town Porvoo. Finns are, for reasons  unknown, the No. 1 coffee drinkers in Europe. Porvoo residents more than hold  their own. I whiled away the better part of a sunny afternoon in a charming  little cafe called Helmi, at Valikatu 7, chatting with a young Finnish couple  on their honeymoon.  </P> <P> We nibbled pulla, yeasty little buns flavored with cardamom and rock sugar, and  spooned thick local cream into the muddy coffee. The afternoon passed quickly.  </P> <P> Buses for Porvoo leave every hour from Helsinki's Central Bus Depot, at  Simonkatu 3. The ride takes about 45 minutes. If you visit between May and  September, a boat, the J. L. Runeberg, leaves Helsinki daily at 10 a.m. and  arrives Porvoo at 3 p.m.  </P> <P> Remember that you cannot take the boat in both directions and still have time  to see the town the same day. Further information is available at the city's  municipal office, at Rihkamatori A.  </P> <P> On Sunday I wanted to stay closer to my hotel. There was an ideal option.  Suomenlinna (literally "Finland castle") is a picturesque island only 20  minutes from the main harbor by public ferry. What's more, it is accessible all  year.  </P> <P> Getting there is fun. Board a small tug marked "Suomenlinna" at Helsinki's  waterside marketplace and pay 75 cents on board. We swept past private islands  and rocky shoals in the Helsinki archipelago, and saw families rigging their  sails for an afternoon cruise.  </P> <P> The day was so clear that I could see Estonia, the Soviet republic on the  Baltic sea. It was visible across the Gulf of Finland about 40 miles away.  </P> <P> Suomenlinna is a fortress in name only. But in the early 18th Century the  Swedish navy built it as a garrison to counter the threat of attack from the  east. In 1918, the year Finland achieved independence from the Russian  Bolsheviks, the island passed into the hands of the local authorities. It has  been open to the public since 1973.  </P> <P> Today, 900 residents live a peaceful life there and visitors come to picnic,  party, absorb culture and relax. I arrived early in the day. That's when I met  Jarmo, a mathematics professor from a local university, who was taking his  family out for the day. Traditionally reticent, Jarmo, like other Finns, seemed  all too happy to practice English on a foreign visitor away from the chaos of  the city.  </P> <P> I joined Jarmo at Piper, a wonderful, weather-beaten wooden coffee shop with  grand columns at the entrance. Fresh baked cinnamon rolls, country eggs and hot  spice tea made for a grand breakfast, as we listened to the wash of the sea  from a long table on the veranda. We watched dozens of Finns sunning themselves  on terraced rocks overlooking the surf. Some had spread out blankets for a  summer picnic.  </P> <P> Suomenlinna has seven museums. Follow the path hugging the shore and you can't  miss them. Armfelt Museum is a storehouse of antique furniture and maritime  artifacts. Ehrensvard Museum is the fully restored home of an 18th-Century  Swedish naval officer.  </P> <P> Suomenlinna has a wonderful fortress restaurant called Walhalla where you'll  find serious eaters from Helsinki. Walhalla, which is several hundred years  old, is a large bomb-proof dining hall with excavated brick walls and regal  appointments. It features dishes such as salted salmon and roasted game.  </P> <P> A three-course lunch is available for less than $20 a person. The baked potato  alone is worth the journey from Helsinki. Boats returning to Helsinki leave  every half hour.  </P> <P> The most ambitious day-trip of the four is also the most rewarding. Tampere is  the regional capital of Hame province, about 130 miles from Helsinki. I lived  there for two years and loved it.  </P> <P> To get there this time I rented a car in Helsinki and headed north on Finland's  E4. En route, I passed through some of Finland's most spectacular scenery. In 2  1/2 hours I was home.  </P> <P> Tampere is a mill town that grew up along the banks of a river, the  Tammerkoski. Flanking the central city isthmus are two large lakes, Nasijarvi  and Pyhajarvi.  </P> <P> I was there to see the many works by Finland's world-famous architect, Reima  Pietila. Pietila's work reflects a post-modern, environmentalist style and is  well suited to the charms of the city. The main city library, at Pirjankatu 2,  is his most recent completion.  </P> <P> Opened in 1986, its stone, glass and copper motif resembles a large sculpture,  like many of the architect's works.  </P> <P> Other Pietila buildings, such as Kaleva church and Hervanta town center, are  scattered throughout Tampere. A guide to Pietila's work is available at the  City Tourist Office at Verkatentaankatu 2.  </P> <P> Tampere has had considerably less foreign influence than Helsinki, as strongly  evidenced in its cuisine. Those who live there will tell you it is more Finnish  than what is eaten in Helsinki. I stopped by the market square for local  delicacies, looking for the hometown black pudding called verimakkara, a  sausage made from liver and rice. There, something amazing happened.  </P> <P> The same woman who sold the pudding 20 years ago is still there and recognized  me. We chatted while I ate two enormous pieces of sausage. "So," she said, "I  haven't seen you in a while. And why hasn't your Finnish gotten any better?"  </P> <P> That afternoon I went to Rustholli for a country-style Finnish lunch of  reindeer steak, pike-perch and lanttu laatikko, a farm table casserole made  from rutabaga, at Rusthollinkatu 16. Rustholli is a hotel restaurant on Lake  Nasi, about six miles from the city center. A No. 28 bus will transport you  there in about 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Driving back to Helsinki in late afternoon I squeezed in a visit to Iitala, 35  miles south of Tampere. Iitala is home to Finland's largest glassworks,  Nuutajarvi. Tours are offered daily and this is the place to buy Finnish  crystal at cut-rate prices in the factory outlet store. Seconds with tiny  blemishes are sold at a fraction of the cost of similar items sold in Helsinki  and elsewhere.  </P> <P> I arrived in Helsinki at 10 p.m. It was dusk and I was tired. I walked through  the park where I had met Seija four nights earlier, hoping to see her again.  But the park was empty except for one harmless drunk.  </P></p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / US fears Pyongyang missiles The US has expressed concern that North Korea is in the process of developing two new types of long-range ballistic missile with the potential to threaten most of Asia. Mr James Woolsey, director of the CIA, told a symposium at the agency's headquarters on Thursday night that if the new North Korean missiles were bought by unnamed countries in the Middle East, Europe could also potentially be at risk. 'These new missiles have yet to be flown,' Mr Woolsey said, 'and we will monitor their development, including any attempts to export them.' Earlier this month Jane's Defence Weekly reported that satellite reconnaissance had detected what appeared to be full scale mock-ups of two new missiles at a site of North Korea's north east coast. He drew a distinction between the threats posed by the North's nuclear and missile programmes. On the former, the US, according to congressional testimony this week by Mr Winston Lord, the undersecretary of state for Asian affairs, still hopes Pyongyang will agree to full inspection of its facilities. But planned bilateral talks due next week have been postponed and the US is again considering re-activating the Team Spirit military exercises held jointly with South Korea. These were put on hold, as were prospective deployment of US Patriot anti-missile missiles in South Korea, so as to induce the North to co-operate with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Yesterday, Congressman Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, urged further pressure on North Korea, including deployment of the Patriots and going ahead with the Team Spirit exercises. 'The pattern has been that North Korea does eventually accede if enough pressure is brought on them,' he said on TV. 'All we can do is to ratchet that pressure up and at the same time keep open the opportunity for a negotiated solution.'</p>

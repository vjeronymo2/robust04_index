			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Labour attacks retailers on cards LARGE retailers were accused yesterday of charging 'astronomic' rates of interest on their store cards by the Labour party after a survey showed that many high-street retail chains charge an average of 30 per cent a year interest on their store cards. For the first time, Labour has called on the government to ask the Office of Fair Trading to investigate store cards. The survey shows that several well-known high street chains, including John Lewis, Burton, Habitat, and Next, have not cut interest charges on their store cards in the past two years even though base rates had fallen from 15 per cent to 10 per cent before yesterday's increase. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, described store-card interest rates as a scandal. 'Some of these stores must be making more out of their astronomic interest rates than they are making out of retailing,' Mr Cook said. 'There is no point in the big stores' complaining about the lack of consumer confidence if they are not prepared to help. Customers can hardly be expected to take on more credit at these rates of usury,' he continued.</p>

The 55-minute meeting at the truce border village of  Panmunjom ended without setting a date for the next round of  talks. The talks collapsed with North Korean negotiators  walking away from the dialogue table, the officials said.    The South Korean side urged North Korea to drop  "unreasonable" demands and show sincerity in its attitude to  make improvements in working through differences over procedural  matters, they said.    Song Chung-tae, the chief South Korean delegate to the  inter-Korean dialogue, sounded out a tough warning that the  nuclear issue is entering a critical phase, with the  international community considering punitive actions at some  point.    "Time is quickly running out and it is hard to tell what  ominous consequences North Korea's recalcitrance on the nuclear  issue will bring about," Song said.    In response to Song's remarks, his northern counterpart Pak  Yong-su raised his country's earlier demands and accused South  Korea of using the inter-Korean contact as a way to scuttle  high-level talks between the United States and North Korea.    Pak blamed South Korean's uncooperative acts for failing to  make significant progress in the inter-Korean dialogue for an  exchange of special envoys.</p>

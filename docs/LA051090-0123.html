			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ROTTERDAM POSSE ROCKS THE HOUSE  </P> <P> The best rock 'n' roll has always been characterized by a willingness to flirt  with anarchy. Hendrix was most amazing when he snatched songs back from the  brink of chaos; so in their way were the Stones, James Brown and the Velvet  Underground.  </P> <P> Punk-rock bands, the Sex Pistols and the Germs, raised the chaotic moment to an  institution.  </P> <P> Anyway, the last band you would have expected to make great rock 'n' roll was a  young funk band from Holland unpromisingly named Urban Dance Squad, but at the  Whisky on Tuesday, the Rotterdam posse rocked the house.  </P> <P> Ticky-ticky house beats floated from a turntable, while the guitarist jammed  (bits of distortion, shards of wah-wah, Richie Blackmore squeals) over the  percolating drums, whucka-whucka deejay scratching and steady bass. Then wham!  the twitching bits of rhythm coalesced into a unison power riff whose impact  was trebled by the contrast to what preceded it.  </P> <P> "Singer" Rudeboy feinted and jabbed like a boxer (his wrists were even taped),  flicking his wireless mike back and forth like something Rocky would have done  between the push-ups and the session with the meat, swigging Evian instead of  Budweiser, rapping rapid-fire, barely accented English -- just how the Beastie  Boys' King Ad-Rock might sound if he had a Dutch uncle.  </P> <P> The obvious comparison is to the Red Hot Chili Peppers (who were in the  audience), but Urban Dance Squad is more hip-hop than the Chilis' funk.

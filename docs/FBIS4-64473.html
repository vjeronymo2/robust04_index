			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["deu"-signed report: "SPD Does Not Want To Increase Taxes"] </F>   [Excerpt] Bonn -- Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and candidate for chancellor,  has confirmed his promise that, as chancellor, he will not  increase the quota of taxes and surcharges beyond the level  planned for 1995. "This is a very clear promise," Scharping  stated in Bonn on Tuesday [3 May] after the session of the SPD  Party Council, which was harmonious, according to participants  in the meeting. The body that includes representatives of the  land and district organizations discussed the draft of the  government program that was adopted by the SPD Executive  Committee one week ago with one abstention. Scharping added that  even unpleasant surprises when counting the cash after a  changeover of power in Bonn would not change anything. The limit  of burdens has been reached. Within the existing system,  however, he considers a number of changes necessary. [passage  omitted]</p>

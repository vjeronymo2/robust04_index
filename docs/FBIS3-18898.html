They were commenting on a disclosure by a U.S. State  Department official in Washington that "difficulties" were being  experienced by Agency inspectors who went to North Korea a week  ago to vet seven declared facilities.    They are trying to determine whether North Korea has  diverted  plutonium from its Yongbyon reactor since the IAEA's last full  inspection in February last year.    Agency spokesman David Kyd refused however to go into detail  about the reported difficulties. The inspection was continuing,  with some tasks accomplished and others still to be carried out,  he said. The team hoped to wind up the mission as scheduled by  next Tuesday, and there was no plan to recall the inspectors any  earlier.    "It is half-time now and there is no use in speculating how  the game will end," Kyd remarked.</p>

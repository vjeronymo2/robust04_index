			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLASTIC SURGEON SHOULD FACE TRUE JUSTICE  </P> <P> Jeffrey L. Gunther, the presiding judge in Dr. Michael Elam's case, the  controversial cosmetic surgeon, apparently needs more than mere cosmetic  surgery. If his recent decision ("Doctor Who was Stripped of His License Gets  Reprieve," Sept. 6) is any indication, he needs a full-fledged brain transplant  as his thought processes and sense of logic seem to be severely impaired.  </P> <P> Instead of concluding that Elam's medical license should be revoked, as the  Medical Board of California had recommended due to numerous violations,  including forged insurance billings, a botched "tummy tuck" and unwanted  operations, Gunther gave him a mere slap on the wrist, which included requiring  Elam to take an ethics class and to have his practice monitored until his case  is resolved in court.  </P> <P> Apparently, the deciding factor in the judge's ruling was around 75 letters  submitted by doctors in support of Elam. Hmmm, just another example of the  "good ol' boys" network, of doctors protecting their own.  </P> <P> A more fitting punishment would have been to allow some of Elam's disgruntled  clients to perform cosmetic surgery on him. As they say, an eye for an eye, a  face for a face, a tummy for a tummy.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Gyll named Procordia chairman MR Soren Gyll, who is to take over as chief executive of Volvo, the Swedish car and truck group, was named yesterday as the new chairman of Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and food group which wants to merge with Volvo. Mr Jan Ekberg has been named to succeed Mr Gyll as president and chief executive of Procordia with effect from May 13. Mr Ekberg is currently head of Procordia's pharmaceuticals business, Kabi Pharmacia. Volvo will put forward Mr Gyll's name at its annual shareholders' meeting on May 12 as the successor to Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the present chairman of Procordia (who is also chairman of Volvo). Both Mr Gyll and Mr Ekberg are understood to be strongly in favour of merging Procordia with Volvo. Sweden's business community was surprised by the latest round of management changes because it was still not certain that the proposed SKr38.7bn (Dollars 6.4bn) merger between Volvo and Procordia would go ahead. The Swedish government, which has a 42.7 per cent voting stake in Procordia, blocked the original merger plan in January on the grounds that the terms were not attractive enough and that the deal did not make sound industrial sense. Volvo also has a 42.7 per cent voting stake in Procordia. However, talks are still taking place between Volvo and the government concerning Procordia's future. Whatever the outcome of those talks, Mr Gyll is due to take up his position as chief executive of Volvo in the middle of May. Mr Gyll, who has been chief executive at Procordia since 1984, is credited with masterminding the turnround in the group's fortunes by concentrating on the food and pharmaceutical sectors.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Canadian premier names cabinet Ms Kim Campbell, sworn in as Canada's first woman prime minister yesterday, has named her new cabinet, cutting the number of ministers from 39 to 25 as part of a sweeping government reshuffle, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The new finance minister is Mr Gilles Loiselle, a bilingual Quebecker. Mr Perrin Beatty was named to the external affairs portfolio, while Mr Jean Charest, Ms Campbell's main rival in the Conservative leadership race, becomes deputy prime minister. Ms Campbell, whose Progressive-Conservative party is lagging in the polls, is expected to call a general election in the autumn.</p>

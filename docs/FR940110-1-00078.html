			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.17(c)(3) of the proposed rule provides that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest or other income earned by a loan fund or loan consortium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a loan or a grant received from an applicant, other than any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved fee or interest rate spread charged to the borrower,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either (i) must be used by the loan fund or loan consortium to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide funds for additional projects meeting the threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in &sect;960.9 of the proposed rule and the criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the approved AHP application, or (ii) must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forwarded to the applicant, which in turn must forward the funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Bank to be used for additional AHP projects. This is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change from the provision in the Board's existing policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines that allows loan funds and loan consortia to earn and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  amounts of income on loans or grants received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from applicants. The Board believes that accounting for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  amounts of interest or other income earned on loans or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants received from an applicant is no less of an administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden than accounting for all such interest or other income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earned. Therefore, the proposed rule requires all interest or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other income earned on loans or grants received from an applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be used by the loan fund or loan consortium for additional AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects or returned to the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(c)(4) of the proposed rule provides that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans or grants received by a loan fund or loan consortium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to one AHP funding cycle are combined with loans or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants received by such entity pursuant to another AHP funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle in a single rental housing project, the loan fund or loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consortium shall require the recipient of the funds to follow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the use of such funds from the AHP funding cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is more restrictive as to the approved AHP criteria. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement does not apply when loans or grants received by a loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund or loan consortium pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are combined to finance a single owner-occupied housing project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reason for this provision is that funds are more easily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traceable to separate units in an owner-occupied housing project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than to separate units in a rental housing project. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of owner-occupied housing projects, it is possible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use loans or grants from different AHP funding cycles according to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the different criteria approved by the Bank in each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respective funding cycles. However, the loan fund or loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consortium in its discretion may require the recipient of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds to follow the requirements for the use of such funds from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP funding cycle that is more restrictive as to the approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(c)(5) of the proposed rule provides that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans provided by a loan fund or loan consortium pursuant to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP that are repaid to such entity must be re-lent or provided as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants by such entity within a reasonable period of time after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such repayments, or must be repaid to the applicant, which in turn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must repay such funds to the Bank, and must be made available by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank for additional AHP projects. The Bank shall in its AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plan identify what constitutes a reasonable period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time for such purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(d) of the proposed rule sets forth the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring and reporting requirements where an applicant makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans or grants pursuant to the AHP to a loan fund or loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consortium which uses the funds to finance owner-occupied or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rental housing units. Section 960.17(d)(1)(i) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule requires the Bank to monitor such units, according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring requirements of &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, to determine compliance with the long-term requirements, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as compliance with the special needs priority, the District  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank priority or priorities, and the economic mobility priority,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where applicable. In addition, &sect;960.17(d)(1)(ii) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule provides that the Bank shall require the sponsor or owner of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a project receiving a loan or grant from the loan fund or loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consortium to submit to the Bank such reports and certifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as are required under &sect;960.15(c) of the proposed rule. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.17(d)(1)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to report to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank any new loan or grant made using repayments of loans by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower. If a loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants from an applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of such funds must be reported separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(d)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank may contract with either the applicant or the loan fund or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan consortium to meet the monitoring requirements of &sect;960.14(e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through (h). Under &sect;960.17(d)(2)(i) of the proposed rule, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank contracts with the applicant to meet such monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, the Bank shall require the applicant to monitor the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP-assisted housing units according to the monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank also shall require the applicant to require the sponsor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner of the project to submit to the applicant such reports and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifications as are required under &sect;960.15(c) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. In addition, the applicant shall require the loan fund or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan consortium to report to the applicant any new loan or grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made using repayments of loans by the borrower. If a loan fund or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan consortium receives loans or grants from an applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, the use of such funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be reported separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

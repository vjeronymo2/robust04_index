			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Area Must Have Attained the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of North Carolina's request is based on an analysis of quality assured ambient air quality monitoring data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Most recent ambient air quality monitoring data for calendar year 1989 through calendar year 1992 show an expected exceedence rate of less than 1.0 per year of the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS in the Raleigh/Durham area. (See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H.) Because the Raleigh/Durham area has complete quality-assured data showing no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the Raleigh/Durham area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS. In addition, there were no violations reported for the 1993 O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  season. The State of North Carolina has committed to continue monitoring in this area in accordance with 40 CFR part 58.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Area Has Met All Applicable Requirements Under Section 110 and Part D of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 17, 1980, and on September 10, 1980, EPA fully approved North Carolina's SIP as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 26038 and 45 FR 59578). The amended CAA, however, revised section 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA reviewed the North Carolina SIP to ensure that it contained all measures due under the amended CAA prior to or at the time the State of North Carolina submitted its redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 110 Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although section 110 was amended, the Raleigh/Durham area SIP meets the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, see 57 FR 27936 and 57 FR 27939 (June 23, 1992), many are duplicative of other requirements of the CAA. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Part D Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before the Raleigh/Durham area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled the applicable requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Raleigh/Durham area is classified as moderate (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.334). The State of North Carolina submitted their request for redesignation of the Raleigh/Durham area prior to November 15, 1992. Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the State of North Carolina must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c) and 176, and the requirements of subpart 2 of part D, which became due on or before November 13, 1992, the date the State submitted a complete redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator but no later than three years after an area is designated as nonattainment. EPA had not determined that these requirements were applicable to classified O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas on or before November 13, 1992, the date that the State of North Carolina submitted a complete redesignation request for the Raleigh/Durham area. Therefore, the State of North Carolina was not required to meet these requirements for purposes of redesignation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon redesignation of this area to attainment, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions contained in part C of title I are applicable. On December 30, 1976, and on February 23, 1982, the EPA approved the State of North Carolina's PSD program (41 FR 56805 and 47 FR 78376).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Plan Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 176 of the CAA requires States to develop transportation/air quality conformity procedures which are consistent with federal conformity regulations. Section 176 provides that EPA must develop federal conformity regulations, requiring states to submit these procedures as a SIP revision by November 15, 1992. EPA promulgated final conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (transportation conformity) and November 30, 1993 (general conformity). Since it was impossible to establish a SIP revision date of November 15, 1992, in these regulations, EPA established a regulatory submittal date of one year after promulgation of the conformity regulations. The State of North Carolina has committed in their maintenance plan to revise the SIP to be consistent with the final federal regulations. In addition, the State Air Quality Section will work closely with the State Department of Transportation (DOT) and local transportation agencies to assure that Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) in the maintenance areas are consistent with and conform to the SIP and meet federal requirements on conformity. This review process is being extended to include all major projects regardless of source of funding, as well as all federally funded projects. A complete description of the conformity review process is included in the TSD prepared for this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

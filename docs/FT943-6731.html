			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Sunday shop opening becomes legal All shops in England and Wales will be able to open legally tomorrow for the first time - but this is unlikely to lead to a shopping free-for-all. The Sunday Trading Act became law yesterday, permitting all shops smaller than 3,000 sq ft to open freely on Sundays, and larger shops to open for up to six hours. It replaced the Shops Act 1950, which placed tight restrictions on Sunday opening. Sunday trading has long been deregulated in Scotland. The move is not expected to lead to a large increase in the number of stores opening. Many small businesses have been opening in defiance of the act for years while larger chains have increasingly flouted the law in recent years, saying that it was outmoded. The biggest first-time opener will be Marks and Spencer, which has consistently refused to open on Sundays outside Scotland, and campaigned for the law to allow Sunday opening only in the four weeks before Christmas. Twenty of its stores will open on Sundays from tomorrow, 17 of them in out-of-town locations. John Lewis Partnership, which also refused to open in the past, has decided that its first Sunday opening should not be on a bank holiday weekend. Eighteen of the group's 108 Waitrose supermarkets will open on Sundays from next week, with the rest likely to open during the pre-Christmas period. John Lewis department stores will remain closed. Some retailers fear the extra expense of opening on Sundays and paying staff premium rates will not be recouped by sales. The St David's shopping centre in Cardiff decided against Sunday opening after a poll found most shops opposed it. But the largest centres - Lakeside in Essex, MetroCentre in Tyne and Wear, and Meadowhall near Sheffield - will all open. The group Keep Sunday Special, which campaigned to limit Sunday opening, said the change would 'further erode both family and community life'. The Consumers Association said that the change did not go far enough.</p>

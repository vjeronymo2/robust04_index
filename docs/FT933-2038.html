			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Murray Johnstone agrees to US ownership for Pounds 49m MURRAY Johnstone, Scotland's second largest independent fund manager, is being sold for Pounds 49m to United Asset Management, a quoted US company which owns 35 other fund managers. Murray Johnstone, which manages funds totalling Pounds 4.3bn, will retain its name and independence of operations, investment policies and personnel. Four Murray Johnstone investment trusts - Murray International, Murray Income, Murray Smaller Markets and Murray Ventures - own 75 per cent of Murray Johnstone Holdings. They and the current and past employees, who own 18 per cent, have agreed to UAM's offer of new shares in the US company with a cash alternative. The remaining 8 per cent is owned by Kemper Financial Services of Chicago. UAM is a holding company based in Boston which owns 35 fund management companies managing a total of Dollars 86bn. It has a market capitalisation of Dollars 1.1bn. UAM does not manage securities itself and does not dictate investment strategies to its subsidiaries, but it encourages them to compete against each other. UAM will receive a percentage of Murray Johnstone's revenue. Murray Johnstone said the deal would enable it to expand and to reward staff. 'We're delighted to have found a solution which enables us to retain our managerial independence and stay in Glasgow,' said Mr Giles Weaver, managing director. The Glasgow-based fund manager's expansion has been limited by its ownership structure because the investment trusts did not want to increase their stake in what is an unquoted company, already accounting on average for 4 per cent of their portfolios. A further complication is that The Cadbury committee on corporate governance has expressed unease about Murray Johnstone's ownership structure, in which Murray Johnstone manages the assets of its main shareholders, a structure typical of a number of smaller fund managers. In 1991 Murray Johnstone offered itself for sale to other fund managers in the UK and Europe, but was unable to find a purchaser on acceptable terms. The acquisition is UAM's biggest outside the US. It already owns Alpha Global Fixed Income Managers and Ki Pacific Asset Management in London.</p>

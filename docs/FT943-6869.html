			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: News stands the pain Any media investors hoping for a quick end to the UK newspaper price war will be disappointed. News International's decision to raise by 15 per cent the advertising rates on The Times and The Sun is a clear sign that the battle for market share has many rounds to go. The rate increases are contingent on The Sun's and The Times' circulations staying above 4m and 600,000 respectively, which could not be guaranteed if cover prices were put up. Having suffered a Pounds 45m drop in operating profits in the year to end-June, it makes sense for News International to hang on for the benefits. Not only will advertising revenues rise, but the growth in sales will lead to a rebound in circulation revenues. Mr Murdoch can also take grim satisfaction from the pain he is causing rivals. The Telegraph's cover price cut has stemmed its loss of market share, but this week's 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits was worse than analysts expected. All Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Telegraph, could say was that he was looking forward to the challenge posed by the price war. Meanwhile, results from elsewhere in Mr Murdoch's empire show how well he can stand the pain. The contribution from News International's 50 per cent stake in BSkyB trebled to Pounds 79m. Fears that the satellite group was running out of momentum appear unfounded. The other TV interests of News Corporation, the parent group, are also picking up. There are signs that Fox Network's Dollars 1.6bn investment in American football rights is paying off, while the losses from his Asian satellite venture were a modest Dollars 20m. Nothing suggests that Mr Murdoch either wishes or needs to change tack.</p>

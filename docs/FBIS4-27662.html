			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign borrowings by Thai banks hit a record  high in the first four months of this year with the amount  doubling from last year to Bt140 billion, the Bank of Thailand  reported.    Thai banks have resorted to overseas loans to fund domestic  credit which reached Bt200 billion in the same period, as the  outstanding deposits fell by about Bt20 billion compared to the  end of last year.    The Bangkok Bank saw its deposit fall by Bt23.4 billion  during this period, with the First Bangkok City Bank witnessing  a drop of Bt4.9 billion, the Bangkok Metropolitan Bank a Bt4.6  billion drop, Bangkok Bank of Commerce Bt4.4 billion, Siam  Commercial Bank Bt2.5 billion, Union Bank Bt900 million, and  Thai Thanu Bank Bt35 million.    It is the first time that half of the banks saw their  deposits eroded as finances were largely diverted to mutual  funds and equity investment.    According to Phisit Li-atham, the central bank spokesman,  the  banks showed outstanding deposits of Bt2.37 billion at the end  of April, an increase of 14.4 per cent compared to the same  period last year, and Bt23 billion compared with the end of last  year. Deposits usually grow at an annual rate of 19-20 per cent.    The general picture, though, is not to bad. The 91 local  finance companies in the first quarter chalked up outstanding  deposits of Bt595.69 billion, an increase of 37.73 per cent  compared with the same period last year and Bt54 billion higher  then the end of 1993.    The finance companies market share, of the financial sector,  rose from 18.4 percent at the end of 1993 to 20.2 percent at the  end of this year's first quarter. The banks' market share fell  from 81.6 percent to 79.8 percent and is expected to decrease  further when the half-year figures are announced. [passage  omitted]</p>

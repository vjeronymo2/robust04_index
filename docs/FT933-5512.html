			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Brussels turning against welfare THE European Commission is swinging in favour of recommending that some EC welfare policies be cut back because they discourage job creation. Accounts emerging of a closed 'seminar' commissioners held on Wednesday, to prepare a White Paper on EC competitiveness, growth and unemployment, indicate that the free-market element in the Commission is starting to seize the initiative. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, who at a meeting of French Socialists last weekend called for a European social pact to fight unemployment, contributed little to the debate, according to officials. But Mr Martin Bangemann, the German liberal in charge of industry, Mr Peter Schmidhuber, the German Christian Democrat responsible for the EC budget, Sir Leon Brittan, the British Conservative commissioner for trade, and Mr Abel Matutes, the Spanish conservative in charge of energy and transport policy, all pushed hard for a strategy based on cutting EC social security costs, keeping down wages, and labour market flexibility. They found substantial support, officials say. Mr Bangemann urged more short-term employment contracts, arguing that the crisis was driving Europe back to 'tribal politics'. Mr Schmidhuber and Mr Matutes said Europe's welfare system discouraged people from working, while Sir Leon said there was nothing wrong with lower wages, the official said. Only Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian Socialist competition commissioner, and Mr Padraig Flynn, commissioner for social and employment policy from Ireland's Fianna Fail party, took issue with this. Mr Van Miert warned that cutting wages and social wages in real terms would reduce demand. Mr Flynn argued that with three-quarters of EC jobs in sectors not subject to international competition, there was little profit to be had from reducing the earning power of those who held them.</p>

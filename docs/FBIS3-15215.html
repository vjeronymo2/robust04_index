In a statement issued on Wednesday, the faction of his  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia claimed the right to  Shakhray's laurels. "The party has promised its voters to ensure  the adoption of this act and it has kept its promise," the  statement said.    However, in his statement on February 23 Konstantin Zatulin,  secretary of the faction of Shakhray's party in the parliament,  said that the initiative to adopt the memorandum of accord  together with the resolutions on amnesty belonged to the Party  of Russian Unity and Accord.    Meanwhile, Shakhray and Zhirinovskiy have been trying to  distance themselves from the political consequences of amnesty.  Shakhray said at a session of the State Duma, the lower house,  that despite his will, "the consistency of the plan of national  reconciliation was broken." As a result, those pardoned will  "again dive for political fighting," he said [as received].    Zhirinovskiy noted that his "party is in no way connected  with the people who have been pardoned under amnesty."</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / International Company News: Aetna Life &amp; Casualty improves to Dollars 207m AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, the largest shareholder-owned insurer in the US, improved its profits performance in the first quarter of 1992 following reduced losses from its property-related holdings and asset sale proceeds. The company reported a Dollars 207m profit after tax in the first three months, compared with Dollars 137m a year earlier. The improvement derived from a turnround on net realised capital gains - with Aetna chalking up a Dollars 76m profit after tax this time, compared with a Dollars 16m loss a year ago. The company said without this its results would have been lower. Like most of the large US composites, Aetna has been faced by souring real estate investments recently, but yesterday it said that realised capital losses from additions to reserves for mortgage and property write-downs were Dollars 41m, against Dollars 52m a year ago. Realised gains of Dollars 117m more than offset this - with Dollars 50m coming from the sale of a portion of the company's interest in MBIA, the bond insurer. On the commercial property-casualty side, Aetna's first quarter earnings were Dollars 60m, compared with Dollars 33m a year ago, but this included net realised capital gains of Dollars 37m against Dollars 1m in the first three months of 1991.</p>

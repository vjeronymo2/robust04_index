			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Letter: UK government sensible to change means to achieve objectives Sir, I do not agree with your editorial ('Mr Major must choose', October 1). The government's economic policy has not collapsed. It is intact and working significantly better than before. Your editorial has confused ends and means. The government's policy has not changed, but the way it is setting out to achieve that policy has changed. Its policy is to increase the rate of economic growth in the UK in order to improve the welfare of the population. In order to achieve this objective it has been bringing down the rate of inflation. This needs to be done because economic growth can only be sustained if the return on capital employed is high in relation to interest rates. Nominal interest rates can only be kept down for a sustained period of time in an economy which has a low rate of inflation. The government thought Britain had a better chance of maintaining a low rate of inflation if the country were inside the ERM. Our membership of the ERM was therefore a means to an end, and not an end in itself. As things turned out, our membership of the ERM led to higher interest rates, a depressed economy, collapsing profit margins and, as a consequence, a poor return on capital employed. The object of the exercise, a higher rate of investment and a faster rate of economic growth, was not being achieved. When a government finds that its means are not enabling it to achieve its objectives it is eminently sensible for it to change the means. Fortunately, the chancellor, Norman Lamont, discovered in the nick of time that it was necessary to change course rapidly in order for the government to be able to achieve its policy ends. He deserves our support for his bold move. Some commentators, however, have suggested that a falling currency leads to a higher rate of inflation. This is not so. The rate of money growth determines the rate of inflation. Here the government has an exemplary record. There is, therefore, no need to be worried about inflation. It will continue to fall, interest rates will also continue to fall, the return on capital in relation to interest rates will come right, and our rate of economic growth and the welfare of the nation will improve substantially in the medium term. Norman Lamont is the best man for the job. Patrick Evershed, 24 Cambridge Street, London SW1 4QH</p>

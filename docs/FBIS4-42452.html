			<p>BFN     [Text] President Konstandinos Karamanlis today said that  what happens in relations among states can not be explained  logically, as these relations are ruled by absurdity and  anarchy. The president said an example of the above is the  Greek-Albanian relations which are ruled by absurdity.    Furthermore, the president refused to comment on the  elections for the European Parliament, citing his office, but he  indirectly advised fewer statements. He said that he prefers to  remain quiet when everybody else is talking.</p>

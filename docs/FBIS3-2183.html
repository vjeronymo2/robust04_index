Under the agreement, Airbus, one of the world's three  largest  aircraft manufacturers, will further commission China's Xian  Aircraft Industry Corporation and Shenyang Aircraft Industry  Corporation to produce parts for it.    Analysts said that the move is expected to expand  cooperation  between Airbus and China, as well as to increase Airbus' share  in the potentially huge market of China.    Airbus started its cooperation with Chinese manufacturers in  1985, when it delivered an A310 aircraft to the Shanghai-based  China East Airlines.    Parts produced for Airbus by the two Chinese corporations in  recent years include protection hatch doors for A300s and A310s,  carbon fiber-made vertical tail ribs and wing ribs, and  emergency exit hatchways for A320s, as well as supplementary  parts for A300s and A310s.    To date, Airbus has sold 35 aircraft to China, 18 of which  were delivered last year.    Market forecasters said China is expected to purchase 620  airplanes between now and the year 2011, about 21 percent of the  global demand during that period.    Official figures show China's air industry expanded by 30  percent in 1993, despite a world-wide recession.    To get to grips with the Chinese market, which Airbus  considers its most hopeful business opportunity, Airbus has  opened a new office in China, called Airbus Industrie China, to  handle increasing business activities in this most populous  country of the world.    Airbus also plans to set up a training center in Beijing  this  spring in a bid to provide better services for its Chinese  customers.    Sources said that the recently signed agreement did not  spell  out what particular parts the two Chinese partners will produce  for Airbus. But they said the new parts will involve more  sophisticated techniques and more advanced technological  know-how.    Boeing Corporation of the United States also struck a big  deal with Chinese manufacturers late last year.</p>

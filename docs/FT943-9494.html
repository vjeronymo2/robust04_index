			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / World Trade News: A very faint ripping sound - A look at restructuring in the European textiles industry If the textile and clothing industry were not dominated by small companies, a restructuring which has seen it account for 30 per cent of manufacturing job losses in the European Union since 1988 might have caused more of a stir. Instead, with relative quietness, productivity has risen by 25 per cent in the clothing industry and 17 per cent in textiles - against a manufacturing average of 10 per cent - production has been cut, and 600,000 jobs have been shed. There have been scuffles. A group of senior British industrialists is due to meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, today to try to persuade the British government to withdraw its support for a Pounds 157m (Dollars 243m) textile plant near Belfast which the industrialists say will lead to further job losses. But by and large the sector's contraction has been accompanied by little politicking. Restructuring has brought a slicker, leaner industry, which now faces the phasing out of protective quotas under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement with expectations of a gradual and partial decline, rather than annihilation. A more severe future was possible. Even with the MFA in place, the industry has been confronted by its inability to compete on cost with producers in low-cost countries, particularly in Asia. Textile and clothing production has traditionally been labour intensive. European labour is expensive labour. And it is labour costs that have been the main cause of the European industry's loss of competitiveness, concludes a recent study for the European Commission. As a result, clothing and textile imports into the EU have risen sharply. Excluding imports arising from subcontracting by European producers outside the EU, clothing imports into the EU rose by 80 per cent between 1988 and 1993. Within textiles, it has been the earliest stages in the production chain and the least technical areas of production that have been hardest hit. European consumption of very basic fabrics, especially synthetic and cotton fabrics, is now dominated by imports. For other fabrics, the loss of market share to imports is progressing up the textiles production chain, with fibre producers the first to suffer, followed by spinners and weavers. The finishing and dying of fabrics remains largely unassailed by direct competition because of its greater technological complexity, but it is still feeding a contracting market thanks to the displacement of clothing manufacturers through imports. Moreover, the entire industry has suffered the effects of the European recession. The EU is still the largest market in the world for clothing, and, with more than 50 per cent of textile output sold to clothing producers, the fortunes of textiles and clothing producers are inextricably linked. Upwards of another 20 per cent of textile output goes to producers of home furnishings and carpets, and a further 20 per cent to industry, much of it to cars and construction. However, although recovery will help the industry it will not reverse the steady decline in spending on clothing and footwear as a proportion of total consumption. The industry's response has been two-fold. Some producers have secured themselves and their markets through targeting niche or high-quality markets unlikely to be satisfied through low-cost mass production. More generally, producers have played to their strengths, in terms of proximity and versatility, by shifting towards just-in-time delivery, in short runs, of products made to customer's own specifications - a trend particularly noticeable in the UK. Another approach, in which German producers have led the way, has been to move away from integrated production and, instead, subcontract from low-cost countries on the European rim, particularly eastern Europe, but also North Africa and Turkey. The ending of the MFA, as agreed in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, is scheduled to take place in four phases over 10 years, beginning on January 1 1995, when 16 per cent of quotas will be removed. Officials from both the European Commission and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade foresee little difficulty in identifying this first 16 per cent, although there may be some wrangling within the EU over whether any effective quotas should be offered up, by way of good faith. Europe will be able to choose which quotas it removes at each stage. And when the phase-out bites harder, as further quotas are removed and existing ones raised at the beginning of 1998, 2002 and 2005, the industry will not be without some safeguards against real injury to markets. Clothing and textiles are to be incorporated into the Gatt, which does allow quotas in cases of serious damage to industries. But there can be no change to the scale and pace of the phase-out and the end of the arrangement will exacerbate the effects of global trends on the European industry. By type of product, industry experts Kurt Salmon Associates point to the bed linen and blankets sector as the next to be hit by heavy competition from imports, followed in the second half of the 1990s by the more technologically sophisticated curtain and table linen sectors. And by country, it will be those producers, predominantly in southern Europe, who have so far escaped the need to restructure because of their lower costs, that will be hardest hit. However, for Europe's textile negotiators, the lifting of the MFA is barely a hardship at all. They have the huge growth in exports from China to worry about - and that was never covered by the MFA.</p>

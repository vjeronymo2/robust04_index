			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA'S BIG MEN DO THE JOB;  </P> <P> BRUINS GAIN 19TH VICTORY BY BEATING CALIFORNIA, 81-73  </P> <P> While the sellout crowd of 6,578 in Harmon Arena taunted UCLA forward Trevor  Wilson with its familiar sing-song chant of "Tre-vor, Tre-vor, Tre-vor," a  couple of other big Bruins, namely Kevin Walker and Don MacLean, set about the  business of helping Wilson shut them up.  </P> <P> MacLean scored 27 points and had nine rebounds. Walker scored 21 points, made  five of six shots from three-point range and held California star Leonard  Taylor to 22 before Taylor fouled out. Wilson had 17 points and 12 rebounds  while, at times, being called upon to play guard.  </P> <P> It all added to an 81-73 victory for UCLA Thursday night, a victory that gave  UCLA a 19-7 record going into its final regular-season game against Arizona  Saturday.  </P> <P> The Bruins would love to reach the 20-victory plateau. But they were thrilled  with No. 19 because that probably means they will gain a berth in the National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament.  </P> <P> "I would like to think that we have taken the decision out of the committee's  hands now," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said. "I hope it's a lock."  </P> <P> The Bruins had a lock on the game with five minutes left when Wilson scored  inside to give the Bruins a 72-58 lead. But there were a lot of fouls called  over the final minutes as the Golden Bears kept scrapping, and the Bruins  missed the front end of a string of free throws.  </P> <P> Yet, as Wilson pointed out, "They made a couple of runs at us, but we always  seemed to come up with a big play when we needed it."  </P> <P> Once again, Walker got the Bruins off to a great start with his three-point  shooting -- four for four in the first half. That forced Cal out of its zone.  </P> <P> "After Walker shot 'em out of the zone, and we made them play us man-to-man,  we're almost impossible to defense man-to-man at the forward spots," Harrick  said.  </P> <P> "Walker just played a tremendous game for us. He played the total, consummate  team game, He sacrificed himself to play defense on Leonard, and he's a great  player. We did as good a job as we could playing him. And Walker still managed  to get his points."  </P> <P> Also, when guard Darrick Martin started to struggle and Harrick found his bench  a little short on guards with the absence of the injured Kevin Williams, Wilson  did a good job of switching positions.  </P> <P> "Putting Wilson at guard confused them a little," Harrick said. "I think that  caused them some matchup problems. They didn't have anyone to stop him."  </P> <P> Sending backup forward Charles Rochelin in for Martin put Pooh Richardson at  guard alongside Wilson.  </P> <P> "They tried to box and chase Walker," Harrick said. "But then Trevor hits or  MacLean hits. And Walker was willing to pass the ball."  </P> <P> Walker had four assists.  </P> <P> Cal never led, but the Golden Bears did manage to pull into a tie early and cut  the Bruins' lead from six points to one point midway through the first half. In  the second half, the Golden Bears made a couple of runs to get within striking  distance before UCLA scored seven straight points to take a 60-50 lead.  </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> Freshman Don MacLean played the entire game and did not seem to be bothered by  the sprained arch in the top of his left foot. His 27 points were a conference  high for him. The only game in which he scored more (41) was against North  Texas. . . . UCLA has won nine of 11 . . . Pooh Richardson went zero for three  from the free-throw line, all misses on the front end of one-and-ones. Darrick  Martin was zero for six from the field. . . . Cal, 18-11 overall and 9-8 in the  conference, has one game left, against USC Saturday, but will finish in fifth  place in the Pac-10 season standings.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Pact erodes tariff aid for Third World Tariff cuts agreed in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks will lead to big reductions in the value of special trade preferences for developing countries and erode their competitive advantage, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). A report to this week's meeting of Unctad's committee on preferences estimates that preferential tariff margins on imports will be cut by about 23 per cent in the European Union, 15 per cent in Japan and 9 per cent in the US. Trade covered by the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) will shrink by some 17 per cent, because of new zero duties agreed in the Uruguay Round, to about Dollars 120bn (Pounds 80bn) in the three main trading groups. The preferential share of exports from developing nations to preference-giving countries will drop from 39 to 32 per cent, Unctad predicts. Though most developing countries will benefit from the general lowering of tariffs and other import barriers in the Uruguay Round, they are anxious to keep the advantages of trade preferences which help them compete with more efficient industrialised country producers. Unctad has called for increased preferential margins and duty-free treatment for Third World goods following the Uruguay Round deal. Preference-giving countries are also being urged to extend GSP benefits to farm products and textiles where import quotas will be scrapped or phased out under Uruguay Round accords. Trade under the GSP rose almost 20 per cent in 1992 to Dollars 77bn and is thought to have increased further in 1993, Unctad says. There are 16 different preferential schemes benefiting over 160 developing nations. Trade under these schemes has risen more rapidly than trade in general over the past 20 years. However, developing countries have long complained that the GSP is too restricted in scope and operation. Only half dutiable exports by beneficiary countries are covered, and only half of these actually receive GSP treatment.</p>

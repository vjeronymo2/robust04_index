			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Mu (1728 3092): "CPC Sets Out Two Major </F> Principles for Reform and Opening"]    [Text] China Has Got Into a Position From Which There Is  No Turning Back, As If It Was Riding a Tiger; This Will Either  Do Good or Harm to China and Determine the CPC's Future    It is safe to say that mainland China has got into "a  precarious position from which there is no turning back." Such  an assessment can apply to both the general political and  economic situations and the process of reform and opening  initiated by the CPC leadership. The economic construction and  in-depth reform are now under way. The 1988 policy of suspending  construction projects and rectifying economic order will never  be introduced again. The only way out is to restrain this  "tiger which has left its den" so that it behaves well. China  has got into a crucial position with regard to its diplomacy and  its domestic political situation which will either "do China  good or harm and determine the CPC's future." The CPC leaders  are now applying themselves to working out a suitable strategy  to deal with the situation in an attempt to provide stable  internal and external environments to enable economic growth to  follow a steady upward course.    A CPC leader said: Last year witnessed rapid economic growth  and great achievements but we should be aware that there are  still some difficulties and problems, the main one being too  great an amount of investment in fixed assets. Deng  Xiaoping has said too rapid economic growth will get us into  trouble. The economic growth rate must be appropriate but  China's current economic growth rate is too high despite the  macrocontrol. There has never before been such a precedent in  the world.    Some senior CPC leaders recently said that they are most  afraid of "three major difficulties" which have led to the  precarious situation I have mentioned. The three major  difficulties are said to be as follows: "One, excessive capital  construction and excessive money supply resulting in inflation;  two, the central government has actually relaxed its grip on the  shopping basket project and, if we cannot keep the project  going, how can ordinary people bear the burden brought about by  price increases in nonstaple food? and three, the reform is at  a crucial stage and new reform measures must be put into effect  but some problems will crop up in the process of reform."  Clearly the fact that these three problems have become  entangled makes it more difficult to straighten things out.  <H5>  Two Major Principles for Reform and Opening </H5>   The problems which call for immediate solution are how to  carry out unified government decrees, how to achieve concerted  action, and how to coordinate the demands and plans of the  various central departments and localities for stepping up their  own development while promoting reform and opening up. Each  usually has its reasons for development, makes its own analysis  of the situation, and has its own strengths and special needs.  Deng's speech, made during his south China tour, which calls  for rapid development, also makes it all the more difficult to  achieve full communication between the higher and lower levels  and to persuade every unit to keep in step with the central  authorities.    The CPC policy decisionmaking body has set out, after  study, two principles for reform and opening up: First, the  reform policy must be in the interests of the majority and  second, the reform policy must take into account the tolerance  of the majority.    The first principle means any reform policy must be  beneficial to the majority instead of causing them losses.  Though it is impossible for a reform policy to bring a benefit  or the same benefit to everyone, it must bring a benefit to the  majority.    The second principle means the reform policy must be  acceptable to the majority. If the policy is unacceptable to  the majority, it must not be put into effect because it will  certainly meet with a rebuff if it is.  <H5>  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji Calls for Thinking of Danger in </H5> Times of Peace    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said: Historical experience has  told us we must take actual conditions into account in deciding  which reform policies should be introduced first and which ones  later and how the reform should be accelerated. The present  situation is: First, leaders of the central authorities must  keep a cool head and value the historical experience. Second,  our present conditions are different from those in 1988. We  have put many more reform policies into practice and the people  have much greater tolerance. Third, it should be admitted that  leaders of a number of localities are prepared for, cherish a  hope for, and have demanded deepened and accelerated reform. If  all of us can make a concerted effort to crack several hard  nuts, we will take an important step forward toward the market  economy. However, there are a fair number of problems calling  for attention, some of which are even fairly serious and can  only be solved with difficulty. For instance, the problem of  large and medium state-owned enterprises changing their  operating mechanism; the problem of helping many workers gain  subsistence; the problem of arousing the peasants' enthusiasm  for production; the problem of providing outlets for surplus  rural labor; the problem of promoting ideological and cultural  progress; the problem of fostering a healthy citizenry; and the  problem of maintaining social order. There are also quite a few  additional concerns. Thus, we must think of danger in  peacetime and must not relax our vigilance in the face of the  excellent situation. We must be aware of the existing problems  and do our work in a meticulous and sound way.       The CPC leadership has really achieved remarkable results in  this respect. All unauthorized construction projects,  development zones, and stock and futures markets have been  closed down. The malpractice of arbitrarily increasing the  prices of agricultural, sideline, native, and special products,  which easily trigger buying sprees; the various means of raising  funds; the setting up of renamed companies; the official  racketeering; and smuggling activities were all held in check.  The macrocontrol from top to bottom and government decrees were  carried out more smoothly than before. Improvements were also  made in the tax reform, slowing down economic growth, improving  the economic efficiency of state firms, and adjusting investment  volume.  <H5>  Stabilizing the Situation and Solving Contradictions </H5>   When meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir in  Beijing in mid-May, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin especially  mentioned the "4 June" incident, stressing that the original  verdict of the incident remains unchanged and that a bad thing  has been changed into a good thing, namely, the development and  stability over the last few years. Jiang, who was personally  elevated by Deng as the core of the third generation of the  central leadership and who has been in this position for five  years, was duty-bound to reiterate Deng's line and major policy  decisions to clarify various rumors and misunderstandings.    The factors and the three major problems mentioned above  have  resulted in more social contradictions and destabilizing factors  on the mainland such as unemployment in urban and rural areas,  the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural  prices, price increases, unauthorized charges, white slips as  IOU's, debt chains, the big gap between the rich and the poor,  disparity in income, social disorder, the splitting up of  different social groups, conflicts of interest, controversies,  corruption, and unhealthy tendencies in society. However, the  CPC leadership has stated with certainty that some destabilizing  factors are unavoidable but they will not result in a great  turmoil.  <H5>  Uphold the Six Musts and Nevers Principle and Stick to the </H5> Main Theme    However, the CPC has spared no efforts to bring the  situation  under control. They have seen to it that the media pay a  guiding role and that propaganda and ideological work is subject  to and serves the central task, namely, economic development.  Ideological work must be subject to economic and political  needs. While ideological education cannot solve all problems,  it can achieve something. If the authorities make sure that the  media plays a good guiding role, it is possible to solve  contradictions, undo puzzles, coordinate relations, allay  resentment and, thus, create a united, stable, and harmonious  society. The CPC has also advanced a "six must's and six  never's" principle for the media to follow, namely: One, they  must be helpful and never make trouble; two, must stick to the  main theme and never "make noises"; three, must take social  results into account and never forget all moral honor at the  sight of profits; four, must abide by propaganda discipline and  never have their own way; five, must "concentrate on the central  task" and never "disperse their strength"; and six, must make  every effort to carry out the party's policies to the letter and  never blow success out of proportion.    Again, the CPC authorities have also taken measures to  strengthen market control, check price jumps, crack down on  speculators. In the meantime, they have continued to improve  all facets of public security, check corruption, promote  education and strengthen school management, resettle unemployed  workers, and energetically support poor areas in the countryside  with a view to alleviating contradictions and nipping evil in  the bud.  <H5>  Focus on Key Points and Never Surpass Three Economic Targets </H5>   The CPC leadership is gratified by the economic situation  and  the results of reform in the first four months of this year.  The fiscal, tax, and financial reforms have proceeded normally  without a major hitch. The "trend of increasing prices" once  seen in the market has been brought under control and prices  declined notably in April. The difficulties in agricultural  development such as bottlenecks in energy and communications,  which present great restrictions on economic growth, and  excessive investment, however, remain unsolved.    The CPC authorities stressed the need not to surpass the  economic targets set by Premier Li Peng in his government work  report: One, economic growth rate is to be kept at 9 percent;  two, fixed assets investment kept at 1,300 billion yuan; and  three, the general index of national retail prices kept within  10 percent. According to these targets, industrial growth is  only allowed to hit 11 percent or below. However, China's  industrial growth rate in the first quarter was 18 percent and  in quite a few areas enterprises are still competing with each  other for more and larger projects and greater speed. The 1994  growth rate of fixed assets investment is to be kept at 9  percent but the investment made by state departments and  enterprises rose by more than 40 percent during the first  quarter and the retail prices in large and medium cities are  likely to soar at any moment. Zhu Rongji said: The task  of solving major contradictions and problems remains tough. The  problems of excessive construction are still there. If this  situation continues, it will be harmful to various localities  and the whole country. He demanded that various localities and  departments think and act in compliance with the central  government's major policy decisions, strengthening and improving  macrocontrol and taking decisive and effective measures to solve  the problem concerning fixed assets investment. A  considerable amount of self-provided funds have now exceeded the  limit set by the regulations on the sources of self-provided  funds, so it is necessary to strictly define and codify the  sources of funds. Approval must be obtained before borrowing  money abroad and sufficient funds must be provided for the key  projects.   <H5>    Four Major Measures for Promoting Agricultural Production </H5>   According to a source, sufficient funds and human and  material resources have been sent to the construction sites of  over 100 state key projects and about 1,000 key construction  projects. The construction of the following projects is being  speeded up in quality: The irrigation works at the Three Gorges  and at Xiaolandi on the Huang He; the harnessing of the Huai He  and Tai Hu; the Beijing-Jiujiang, Baoji-Zhongwei, Houma-Yueshan,  Nanning-Kunming, Hangzhou-Zhuzhou, and other key rail lines; key  port projects in Dalian and Shanghai; fiber-optic cables linking  Beijing with Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou and linking  Qinghai with Lanzhou and Urumqi; and large coal mines and  hydraulic and thermal power plants in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner  Mongolia. The technical transformation in six old major  industrial cities, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan,  Dalian and Chongqing is being accelerated. The state has  decided to inject an additional 15 billion yuan into the six  cities to accelerate the adjustment of the industrial product  mix, increase their competitiveness, and keep up their strength  for further growth.    In setting up a modern enterprise system, the central  government has decided to proceed from reinvigorating individual  enterprises to enlivening all state enterprise; from granting  preferential policies to introducing new systems; from carrying  out enterprise reform to pressing ahead with the whole project  of establishing a socialist market economy; from allowing no  state enterprises to go bankrupt to allowing only the best to  survive; and from discussing principles and directions to  exploring specific measures. More resolute measures favoring  agricultural development will be taken. First, increasing  investment in agriculture and rural economic development  projects; second, increasing the purchasing prices of grain and  cotton when new grain goes on sale this year; third, improving  the special system for stockpiling reserves; and fourth, setting  up the noncommercial agricultural development bank.  <H5>  Expand Relations with Foreign Countries To Increase Influence </H5>   With "Asia fever" on the rise in the world, China's  development has become all the more spectacular. Jiang Zemin  said: "China needs the world for its development and vice  versa. A stable, developed, and strong China will not make any  threats against other countries; rather, it will make greater  contributions to peace and development in the world including  the Asia-Pacific region."    Over the last few years, the CPC has achieved great results  in carrying out Deng Xiaoping's omnidirectional diplomacy. In  particular, it succeeded in foiling the economic sanctions  jointly imposed by seven major countries and thus enabled China  to take an active part in international affairs again. China  has also increased official contacts, economic cooperation, and  cultural exchanges with other countries. Statistics show China  has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries to date.  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said: China's  relations with neighboring countries have been consolidated in  the process of development and the PRC has cemented optimum  good-neighborly relations with surrounding countries since its  founding. China has strengthened its solidarity and cooperation  with the large numbers of developing countries through mutual  support and has improved and expanded its cooperative relations  on a mutually beneficial basis through dialogues on an equal  footing.    Since last year, seven members of the CPC Central Committee  Standing Committee and other senior party, government, and  military leaders have visited many countries and regions around  the world to carry out diplomatic activities. State leaders or  important political figures from: Major Western countries,  including the United States; surrounding and other Asian  countries; European and African countries; and Australia have  also come to China for a visit. The military has also made much  headway in opening itself to the outside world and in  establishing ties with its counterparts in foreign countries.  Over the last few years the military has received military  delegations from over 40 countries and has sent 120 delegations  to foreign countries, comprising 1,300 people including the  defense minister, the chief of general staff, and high-ranking  military officers. The military also exchanged warship visits  with foreign countries. Early this year, General Liu Huaqing,  vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited  Thailand and Indonesia to increase mutual understanding and  friendship with ASEAN countries, thus opening a new chapter in  China's military diplomacy.   <H5>    Great Achievements in Foreign Trade </H5>   China has made the most conspicuous achievements in  expanding foreign trade and economic relations. These  achievements are also unprecedented ones since the CPC gave up  the policies of closing itself to international intercourse and  self-reliance. Over the last 15 years, China has approved  174,000 foreign-funded projects with the actual use of foreign  funds standing at $60 billion. Last year China approved 83,000  foreign-funded projects, up 70 percent from the previous year's  figure, with the actual introduction of foreign funds amounting  to $25.8 billion, up 130 percent from the previous year's  corresponding figure. The five special economic zones, the 14  open coastal cities, the 30 economic and technological  development zones, the 13 bonded areas, the New Pudong District  in Shanghai, the coastal economic development zones, the  capitals of 18 provinces and autonomous regions in the interior,  and the 13 cities, counties, and towns along the border, have  formed an initial pattern of comprehensive opening up. Last  year, China's foreign trade volume hit $195.7 billion, 8.5 times  that of 1978, and its trade volume jumped from 32d to 11th place  in the table showing each country's trade volume.    According to a commentary in the NEW YORK TIMES, from now  until the end of this century, China will spend about $560  billion on capital construction. If American businessmen can  get one percent of the contracts, this will give hundreds of  thousands of jobs to American people. Some people have tried to  revoke China's MFN trading status for human rights reasons but  this would be "an error of the times" because it would amount to  the United States pointing a gun to its own head while  announcing that it was going to press the trigger.  <H5>  No Rush in Promoting Democracy </H5>   The CPC stressed the need to take the initiative in dealing  with the human rights issue. China has taken an active part in  the publication of the "White Paper on the Human Rights Issue"  and in the International Conference on Human Rights held by the  United States in Vienna last year, acting as vice chairman of  the conference, tabling many proposals to promote global  economic cooperation and protect the ecological environment, and  endorsing the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action. When  visiting northern European countries, Li Ruihuan, Chairman of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National  Committee, said China respects the international community's  universal principle on human rights and agrees to the conduct of  international dialogues on human rights. This is the first time  a core member of the CPC leadership has made such a statement.  In the meantime, Li said it is necessary to take into account  specific conditions in various countries in applying the  universal principle on human rights. China opposes interference  in other countries' internal affairs and hopes that various  countries will respect each other, increase understanding, agree  to disagree, and make progress together.    The CPC's diplomatic strategy is based exactly on Deng  Xiaoping's instructions: "Two conditions are essential to a  successful modernization drive: First, favorable internal  conditions, meaning that we must persist in current reform and  opening China to the outside world and maintain political  stability and unity; second, favorable international conditions,  meaning lasting global peace." Deng maintained that China  must practice democracy finally but it will not work if we act  in haste.</p>

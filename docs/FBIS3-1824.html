			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff correspondent Liang Li-ming </F> (2733 7787 2494): "Wang Fengchao Says China Sets Up Another  Kitchen in Reaction to Britain's Violation of the Agreement and  Will Fully Implement the Basic Law in Hong Kong"]    [Text] Beijing, 25th (HSIN PAO)--Wang Fengchao, State  Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office deputy director, said  this morning that when China mentioned "another kitchen" this  was aimed against Chris Patten's move to set up "another  kitchen" because Britain violated the principles of the Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law and China could only set up  "another kitchen" so that Hong Kong can enjoy a high degree of  autonomy, Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong, and fully implement  the Basic Law.    Wang Fengchao said he would try to visit Hong Kong this year  if he had the time.    In his news conference given this morning to the media  before  a meeting with the Preliminary Work Committee Political Affairs  Panel, Wang Fengchao, promoted from second department director  to deputy director late last February, said that China would act  according to the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law, safeguard Hong Kong's executive sovereignty together  with Hong Kong people, and properly handle preparations in  various areas. After 1997, a high degree of autonomy will be  allowed according to the policy of one country, two systems to  lay a foundation for Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong.    He continued: China's wish is cooperation with Britain in  the latter period of transition and working for a stable  transition and smooth political changeover according to the  Basic Law.    However, he pointed out, as Britain has refused to cooperate  politically with China, turned its back on the relationship of  cooperation with China, persisted in its course, got itself in  deeper and deeper, and ruined the basis of cooperation. Without  an atmosphere of cooperation, it is difficult for work in other  areas not to be affected. This is something China did not want  to see and the responsibility lies entirely with Britain.    Regarding "setting up another kitchen," Wang Fengchao said  Britain did not recognize the agreements and understandings for  the transition it made with China and set up another kitchen;  because of this China could only "set up another kitchen" based  on the blueprints outlined by the Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law. On the current division of labor within the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office, he said Deputy Director Wang  Qiren has been transferred to the Bank of China as its  president. There are now three directors. Director Lu Ping  oversees general affairs; Chen Zhiying takes charge of the work  of Sections 1 and 3, that is Hong Kong and Macao affairs. Wang  himself is responsible for the work of Section 2 (that is Hong  Kong political and social affairs) and the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Research Desk. Wang said that he felt the heavy burden  of responsibility after he became deputy director. Fortunately,  he could see the direction clearly.</p>

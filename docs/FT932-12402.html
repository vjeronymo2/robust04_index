			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (7): A new leaf for the textbook town - Letchworth, the original garden city, is leaving the public sector LETCHWORTH, the world's first garden city, still features strongly in textbooks in numerous languages. And last year alone, the Garden City Corporation - the public body formed by Act of Parliament in 1962, to replace the original First Garden City Ltd, set up in 1903 to buy nearly 4,000 acres - played host to no fewer than 500 visitors from 22 countries. Once again, however, the corporation's future is before parliament. A private bill, to allow the corporation to become a heritage foundation (an industrial and provident society with charitable status) had its first and second readings in the Commons in January, and will begin its committee stage next month. Royal Assent is expected early next year. The corporation was asked by the secretary of state for the environment to come up with plans to leave the public sector. The heritage foundation option was chosen because it will maintain the corporation's tax-exempt position, enabling it to continue to plough back revenue from its estate into the town in the form of grants and community facilities. It will also allow flexibility in the management of the estate, and protect it against commercial takeover. Local opinion appears broadly in favour although there have been nine petitions against the bill - one from the Letchworth Leaseholders and Freeholders Association, and others from individuals, most of whom are connected with the same organisation. From the very early days, Letchworth, which now has a population of around 33,000, grew and flourished, enjoying full employment. Then came the early 1980s recession. Unemployment quickly reached 13 per cent as the four major engineering and manufacturing firms that had formed the focus of the town's employment - ICL, Shelvoke &amp; Drewery, Borg Warner Automatic Transmissions and Kryn &amp; Lahy - scaled down their operations, or left. Faced with this unforeseen crisis, the Garden City Corporation was forced to review its policy. The resulting strategy remains in place today: the town could no longer rely on a handful of large employers. A good spread of smaller and medium-sized businesses would provide a more stable employment base. In addition, a more hands-on management role was called for, helping new businesses to set up; nurturing and looking after existing ones and responding to their needs. As a first step, a corporation-funded business centre was established in 1981 to give free advice and other assistance to those wishing to start new businesses, and a variety of small units to rent were provided on the estate. Then, as the strategy began to bear fruit - and corporation chief executive Andrew Egerton-Smith points out that, until the current recession, Letchworth prided itself on a business start-up rate way above the national average - it was decided that larger units were needed. In the mid-1980s, a site was acquired with PosTel, and development began of what is now the Letchworth Business Park. Occupiers now include Du Pont Pharmaceutical, John Tann, Barron McCann, Unichem, Tesco Computer Centre and Sainsbury's. The park also accommodates a new business centre, with free advice on offer. The Letchworth Business Club was formed in 1986, and now has 400 members. It is widely-regarded as one of the most successful of its type. Meetings are addressed by high-profile speakers, but the club also provides a forum for business discussion and encourages trading between members. It has links with training, cultural and educational organisations, and is expanding its contact area to assist other business clubs in the south. Typical of Letchworth's flexible approach and determination to grow its own employment base is Fermark, a supplier of brassieres to Marks &amp; Spencer. The company moved to Letchworth in the late 1960s from London's east end. Fourteen years ago it had just 60 staff; today it has 450, including 100 new recruits in the past few months. Fermark's production director, Peter Girdler, says that, over the years, the corporation has made several additions and alterations to the factory and, more recently, added an attractive facade. Now, with the company once again outgrowing its 28,000 sq ft premises, the corporation is refurbishing a nearby factory unit, which will house its packing and warehousing operations, leaving production at its existing site. A more recent Letchworth recruit is Altro, which manufactures industrial safety flooring. Its products are in use at, among other sites, 10 Downing Street, Wembley Stadium, the White House, Melbourne Cricket Club and the QE2. The company moved on to the garden estate in 1988, acquiring a 120,000 sq ft building which has been upgraded and refaced. It subsequently moved its car valeting subsidiary Autoglym to an adjoining building, and recently took the opportunity of adding the building on the other side for future expansion. Altro has expanded during the recession, turning in record results - pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.1m) on turnover of Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 32.4m) for the year to September 1992. Chief Executive Michael Fincham says that, when the company moved from Hertford, it looked as far afield as Leeds and Bradford in its search for a new base. Plus-factors for Letchworth, besides the pleasant living conditions, included its excellent communications - close to the A1 and M1, airports and the rail services - and the businesslike attitude of the Corporation.</p>

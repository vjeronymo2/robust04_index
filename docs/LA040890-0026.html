			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: NEW-FOUND COMMERCIAL SUCCESS PLAGUES THE GRATEFUL DEAD, LONGTIME  FOLLOWERS  </P> <P> There's an adage, espoused on refrigerator doors across America, that states:  "You can never be too rich or too thin." But is it possible to become too  successful?  </P> <P> Yes. Probably not if you happen to be the owner of the Oakland-Los  Angeles-Oakland Raiders. But for rock musicians, especially, sometimes a good  thing can become too much.  </P> <P> Look at the poor old Grateful Dead, who after 25 years just keep on truckin' .  The group has suddenly found itself performer-non-grata at Irvine Meadows  Amphitheatre, where it had played annually since 1983, because of problems  caused at least partially by a huge turnout for the Dead concerts last year.  This year, the group will move its annual spring Southland shows to a soccer  field at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson.  </P> <P> What happened?  </P> <P> In the short view, the Dead can be seen as the victims of bad publicity, held  responsible for the actions of people over whom they had no control, nor  rightly could be expected to. For one thing, the band took the heat from locals  and city officials about overflowing streets and freeways, complaints that  should have been shared at least equally by the nearby El Toro Marine Corps Air  Station, which brought thousands of onlookers into the area with an air show  that same weekend.  </P> <P> But beyond the specifics of the Irvine Meadows incident, the Dead are feeling  the symptoms of a condition that few people ever expected this oddball group to  contract: an overdose of commercial success.  </P> <P> The band, which has long epitomized the if-it-feels-good-do-it '60s hippie  ethic, ambled along for years, a sizable but manageable pack of loyal Deadheads  in tow for every show. The group would play its marathon four-hour-plus  concerts, which were less musical events than tie-dyed carnivals with a rock  soundtrack. At multiple-day engagements, fans would set up camp in parking  lots, living in tents, vans and motor homes, while all manner of  free-enterprise advocates would sell all manner of merchandise out of  backpacks, suitcases and station wagons.  </P> <P> Dead shows, while always full of eccentric characters -- many of whom probably  could have sat through gallbladder surgery with a smile -- were comparatively  peaceful events. This was especially true as the group trundled into the 1980s,  when the all-stops-out extremism of punk rock made for particularly drastic  contrast.  </P> <P> There was an advantage in traveling the frontage road of the rock freeway: The  Dead could sell a couple hundred thousand copies of each album and fill up  concert halls without having to worry about dodging celebrity-hungry  photographers from People or the National Enquirer. But then, in 1987, the Dead  did something no one expected. They turned out a hit single.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the Dead became the focal point for a whole new audience that knew  little about the sense of brotherhood and camaraderie that typified Grateful  Dead gatherings. These people looked at the Dead and saw only the  quintessential rock party band, an entity whose followers seemed to emerge from  suspended animation long enough to shout, "Can you dig it?" "groovy" and  "ohhhhhh, mannnnnnn!" for a few hours at a concert before stepping back into  mothballs -- headbands, cotton drawstring trousers and all.  </P> <P> Dead shows soon began to draw more and more fans interested in nothing more  than partying their brains out, oxymoronic as that may be. That contingent  isn't by any means new to the group's following, but the dimension to which it  has grown is.  </P> <P> "I have friends who were complaining about the 'new' Deadheads in 1972 --  really," said the group's longtime publicist, Dennis McNally. "But without  being invidious to any one group of people, in general (problems have resulted  from) sheer numbers. You put lots of people in a small space, and some people  start stepping on some people's toes. . . . We've had to put an end to the  camping and vending to calm down what goes on outside our show.  </P> <P> "It's kinda sad," McNally said, "and it's massively challenging. Most of what  we have to deal with these days is the fallout of getting bigger. The story  every year is that it all gets a little bigger, a little more complicated."  </P> <P> As usual, the people who lose the most are the longtime fans. And the loss is  that much greater with acts like the Dead, who have fostered an intensely loyal  following that treats the group members not as gods to be worshipped but as  friends to be cherished.  </P> <P> Bruce Springsteen and Peter Gabriel are other examples of artists forced to  change the very essence of their acts as they've captured more of the pop  mainstream with their music. Springsteen had to abandon his penchant for  jumping into the crowd; his audience became filled with people who'd rather  take home a piece of his blue jeans than shake his hand.  </P> <P> Gabriel, too, has favored human contact with his audience: At the end of his  shows, he used to stand at the edge of the stage, back to the audience, and  fall backward into the arms of his fans. They would pass him, hand over hand,  to the back of the hall, at which point he would jump down and run back to the  stage.  </P> <P> This intensely emotional, almost spiritual ritual was enacted countless times  before his 1983 Top 30 hit "Shock the Monkey" and continued even after he  racked up a No. 1 single in 1986 with "Sledgehammer." But the last time I saw  Gabriel attempt this, the change was sobering. What once had been an exercise  in trust had been reduced to a mad grab for a piece of a star, as fans  literally tore the shirt from his back and stripped the shoes and socks from  his feet.  </P> <P> The Grateful Dead, Springsteen and Gabriel probably won't let these changes  stop them from touring. But as McNally said, "It's kinda sad."  </P> <P> Perhaps the secret for rock stars who want to prevent their followings from  getting out of hand can be found in the words of Neil Young, who has found his  share of mainstream success but has changed directions too quickly to have a  serious head-on collision with fame.  </P> <P> After his 1972 No. 1 hit, "Heart of Gold," gave him a taste of life in the big  time, he commented: "This song put me in the middle of the road. Traveling  there soon became a bore so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw  more interesting people there."  </P></p>

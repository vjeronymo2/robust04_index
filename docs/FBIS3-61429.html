			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. V. Kolchenko, S. M. Rak and N. P. Chechenev </F> under the rubric ``Communications Lines''; UDC 621.315.2]    [Abstract] Analysis of the effects of powerful explosions  on ground areas containing buried communications cables reveals  that, in many cases, established limits on such blasting  operations may be relaxed without significantly affecting the  mainline cable integrity under dynamic load. Allowable distances  from the location of the blasting charge, as determined by  individual cable characteristics, may even be within the throw  zone of the blast. Employing an analogy to underground pipes,  the cable is viewed as a structural member resting on a cushion,  its momentary deformation independent of the orientation of the  blasting charge relative to its location. Moreover, movement of  the cable and ground are synchronous and conform to the  hypocentric distance from the blast. Formulas for determining  the necessary strength of underground cable are arrived at based  on computations of the coefficient of seismic intensity, and  bending moment and radius of curvature of the cable structure.  Final values for allowable distance are determined to be the  greater of all values obtained by computation and comparative  analysis. Charts specifying inherent characteristics for dozens  of different cable designations are provided for selection of  the proper cable diameter, rigidity, load-bearing strength,  jacket thickness, etc. for use in or near areas of seismic  disturbance. The authors offer their findings as a basis for new  departmental standards for cable requirements. Figures 3; tables  2; references: 6 Russian.</p>

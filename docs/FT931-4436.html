			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton under car company pressure THE 'Big Three' US motor companies - Ford, GM and Chrysler - yesterday urged the Clinton administration to negotiate a 'results-oriented' pact with Japan which would achieve a bilateral trade balance on a specific schedule. Mr Peter Pestillo, an executive vice-president of Ford Motor Company, told the Senate commerce committee they were recommending a five-year schedule with regular monitoring. 'Japan can make its own decisions as to how to achieve this goal - by importing more, or exporting less, or both,' he said. 'What we need is results-oriented policy, not 'regrets' about not meeting targets, as in the recent semiconductor case.' On Tuesday, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, told the Senate finance committee the administration was seriously studying a similar plan to negotiate goals for Japanese imports called 'temporary quantitative indicators'. The Big Three laid out a case for government assistance based on their massive reinvestment in recent years - Dollars 61.3bn (Pounds 43.1bn) from 1989 to 1992 - and the importance of the domestic industry to the US economy. The US trade deficit with Japan has remained at Dollars 32bn a year since 1986. Mr Pestillo said the main Japanese producers were 'dumping' cars in the US at prices 14 per cent below those charged in Japan. 'In 1991 the top seven Japanese automakers earned Dollars 8.5bn in Japan, while losing Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars 3.6bn in North America,' he said. 'In the past four years they earned an average of more than Dollars 9bn in Japan, while losing an average of more than Dollars 3bn in North America and almost Dollars 1.4bn in Europe.' The US industry decided not to bring a dumping case against Japanese producers in order to give the new administration time to find 'a private remedy', Mr Pestillo said.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS HAVE NAME FOR IT: MIKE DOWNEY  </P> <P> Where does Mike Downey get off using his column to express a personal vendetta  against Kirk Gibson, or anyone for that matter? And where does The Times get  off allowing a reporter to let loose with such a diatribe?  </P> <P> More often than not, I find Mr. Downey's columns at least mildly entertaining  and informative.  </P> <P> But the opinions expressed in his column of Dec. 2, whether validated or not by  other reporters and/or baseball people, were appallingly out of line. Is Kirk  Gibson an angel? No (he's a Royal). Has he demonstrated surly behavior at  times? Probably. Has his behavior been at times crude and inappropriate?  Possibly. But that is no reason to use the much-valued editorial space of a  major metropolitan newspaper for a blatant cheap shot.  </P> <P> DANIEL J. LUBIN  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

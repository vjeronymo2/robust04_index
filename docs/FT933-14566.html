			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Iraq braced for more US strikes IRAQ yesterday began to prepare the public for possible US military attacks, following its refusal to let United Nations weapons inspectors seal off two missile sites west of Baghdad pending installation of remote-control cameras, writes our Middle East Staff. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN weapons inspection team, flew to Bahrain yesterday on his way to Baghdad in what is likely to be the final attempt to persuade Iraq to abide by UN Security Council resolutions. The Baghdad newspaper al-Qadissiya warned that the US would not hesitate to strike against Iraq again and said the confrontation over the missile test sites was a a pretext for attack. Another newspaper, al-Jumhuriya, earlier accused Mr Ekeus of masterminding a conspiracy to broaden the scope of UN resolutions.</p>

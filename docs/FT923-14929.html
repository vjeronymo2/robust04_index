			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / How to Spend It: A jewel of a name LALIQUE is one of the greatest of names in the litany of fine French companies that cluster together near the Madeleine in the poshest part of Paris. It was Rene Lalique who lifted the company out of the ranks of mere producers of glass into starry status of world-famous designers of sought-after crystal. However, Rene Lalique actually began in a smaller way  -with jewellery. Marie-Claude Lalique, his grand-daughter, has now gone back to where her grandfather started and has produced a summery, colourful collection of crystal jewellery, photographed right. The Cabochon collection comes in 14 colourways, including bracelets and ear-rings, brooches, pendants, pins, tie clips and cufflinks. Prices range from Pounds 345 for the bracelet and Pounds 125 for the ear-rings to Pounds 75 for the pendant. The collection is stocked at the Lalique shop at 162 New Bond Street, London W1Y 9PA, at Selfridges of Oxford Street, London W1, at Mappin &amp; Webb in Regent Street and from Mulberry Hall, Stonegate, York. Some lovely new wallpapers from Osborne &amp; Little have been brought out. Scaglia is a striking paper rendering of Italian marbling which comes in 20 different colourways, ranging from a rich terracotta to a heavenly pale blue, from palest apricot to a country green. Stronger and more striking than its forerunner, Sienna, it is an easy, almost instant way of conjuring up some of the latest paint effects. If Scaglia is too strong for your tastes then take a look at Pietra, also new to the range, which imitates very soft Italianate stone effects. There are some 20 different colours: gentle stones, beiges, greens, blues, pinks. Both papers come in rolls of 10 m long by 52 cm wide and both sell at Pounds 17.15 per roll (inclusive of VAT) from Osborne &amp; Little's own shops at 304-308 King's Road, London SW3 5UH and 39 Queen Street, Edinburgh, and from good interior decorators and designers. What does a well-dressed chap wear on his feet when he is relaxing around the house during the summer? Docksiders, that's what. Once the only shoe the yachting crowd would contemplate, it has now become the THE snob shoe for fashionable landlubbers as well. The pukka original version was a soft, comfortable moccasin, treated with oil to make it waterproof and with rubber soles to keep the wearer steady on deck. The most noticeable trademark, though, are the eyelets and lacing at the sides. Versions abound in almost every high street shoe shop, but anybody who is not near a good shoe shop might like to buy the Sebago version direct by mail from Shipton &amp; Heneage, 117 Queenstown Road, Battersea, London SW8 (tel: 071-738-8484). Prices are Pounds 55 for the women's shoe, Pounds 60 for men. Colours are plain tan, two-tone tan, suede, navy and white, navy and tan. And remember - NO socks.</p>

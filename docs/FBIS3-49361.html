In addition to the assembly, Polak said, a series of other  demonstrations, manifestations and protests are being prepared.  Polak would not specify any times or locations "so they will not  be prevented."    Polak called Clinton the representative of a country "that  is  not qualified to be a parliament of human rights and that does  not have the right to talk about peace." The President himself  "awakens false hopes" and his policies "postpone necessary  changes," Polak said.    Prague Police Spokesman Petr Link told CTK today that the  police had not been notified of any demonstrations in connection  with Clinton's visit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>   [Text] IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in the Gaza  Strip have received new orders: They are to enter refugee camps  as rarely as possible, to avoid altogether entering city centers  locations rife with friction, and to do their best not to harm  Palestinians.    A senior Gaza Strip officer said yesterday that the troops  have been instructed to intensify their patrols on the Gaza  bypass road and the road to the Qatif Bloc, in order to prevent  terrorist attacks. "This is the period that precedes our  departure," the officer explained, "and it is a sensitive  period."    The officer revealed that the evacuation of equipment and  buildings from the Strip would start in the coming days. "Bases  and buildings will not be handed over to the Palestinians,  except for a few buildings that will be used by their police  force. A special committee will coordinate the transfer of  buildings."    This is how the evacuation will be carried out: First the  IDF will pull out of areas controlled by Fatah, namely the PLO,  and the areas will come under Palestinian command. This process  will continue until only the "hottest" locations, such as the  Jabalyah refugee camp, remain under IDF control. The latter  will be evacuated after Fatah is firmly established in most of  the Gaza Strip. The first sites to be evacuated will be  evidently Rafah and Dayr al-Balah in southern Strip.</p>

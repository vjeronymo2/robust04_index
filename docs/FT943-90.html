			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Korea Development Bank offers Dollars 500m global The eurobond market saw a flurry of new issues in a variety of currencies yesterday, despite falls in government bond prices. Korea Development Bank launched a Dollars 500m global offering of 10-year bonds amid volatile conditions in the dollar sector. The bonds, which were priced to yield 80 basis points over US Treasuries, were widely distributed, with Europe and the US each accounting for 40 per cent of sales and Asia for the remainder, lead manager CS First Boston said. 'There was some buying of the bonds by UK accounts and by Far Eastern investors looking to swap back into fixed-rate yen, for example,' said one syndicate manager. 'But the dollar sector is lethargic at the moment, with spreads widening across all maturities, and some investors were put off by the Korean political risk.' Most syndicate managers thought the bonds were fairly priced, although some said that some US accounts had been looking for extra yield for an issue of this size, which is small for a global offering. In the D-Mark sector, the European Investment Bank launched a DM1bn offering of eight-year bonds fungible with an existing tranche of bonds issued in October 1992. The issue, priced to yield 15 basis points over German bunds, was sold mainly to European institutional investors, lead manager Westdeutsche Landesbank said. An official at the EIB said: 'We expect this issue to be enough for us not to go back to the D-Mark market this year but it is very difficult to predict.' The proceeds from the offering were not swapped out of D-Marks, he said. Syndicate managers said demand for the bonds was slow. 'The D-Mark sector is reviving but it is still difficult to push long-dated issues, especially after the recent pick up in supply,' said one syndicate official. The Kingdom of Belgium and the African Development Bank tapped the D-Mark sector earlier this week, and the World Bank is expected to launch a global D-Mark offering next week. In the French franc sector, the Kingdom of Sweden launched a FFr2bn offering of fixed-rate two-year bonds, priced to yield 18 basis points over government bonds. Lead manager Banque Paribas said 70 per cent of the bonds were sold to institutions and fund managers outside of France. 'They bought them on an asset-swap basis, swapping the bonds into floating-rate French francs,' it said. The Republic of Iceland is expected to launch its debut euroyen offering soon, market sources said. The Y5bn to Y6bn offering will be of five-year bonds, they said. Statkraft, the Norwegian state-owned electricity generator, is set to launch its debut eurobond offering over the coming weeks. The issue is likely to be a fixed rate D-Mark offering, of around DM300m, of five or 10-year bonds, lead manager Deutsche Bank said.</p>

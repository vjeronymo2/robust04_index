			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] As Nigerians watch the unfolding political events in  the country between the military government of General Sani  Abacha and prodemocracy activists, the newspapers report efforts  by both parties to achieve one result or the other.    THE GUARDIAN, in a major headline writes: "Diya Seeks  Dialogue on Crisis." The paper reports that the Federal  Government has not sued for dialogue as a viable means of  resolving the political crisis in Nigeria in which prodemocracy  activists want the military regime to hand over power to  civilians based on the annulled 12 June presidential election  results of 1993. THE GUARDIAN observes that the new approach by  government became visible following the meetings Nigeria's chief  of general staff Lieutenant General Diya had with traditional  rulers in the eastern and western regions of the country.    The SUNRAY reporting in the same vein has it that foreign  nationals in Nigeria are becoming jittery because of tension  created by M.K.O. Abiola and the National Democratic Coalition  to form a parallel government in the country.    The SKETCH on its part reports that the former governor of  Anambra State, Chief C.C. Onoh, arrested by security agents in  connection with the political situation in the country, has been  released. It said the former governor regained his freedom  yesterday Wednesday and that he refuted all allegations against  him. The paper also reflects on the airport interview Chief Onoh  granted journalists at the Enugu Airport in which he urged  Nigerians to allow peace to reign in order to find a lasting  solution to the country's problems.    While the TRIBUNE reports that Chief Anthony Enahoro, a  former minister in the First Republic, and Chief Bola Ige,  former governor of Oyo State, have regained their freedom, it  reports the arrest of other politicians but the paper failed to  say who they were. It says their release was [words indistinct]  the intervention of the minister of justice, Dr. Olu Onagoruwa.  However, THE GUARDIAN reports that Chief Bola Ige was still  being detained. Both papers may have published at different  times. It however reports that 23 former civilian governors out  of 30 of them who served during the last military regime in  Nigeria have called for a dialogue among the different interest  groups in the country to resolve the political stalemate without  resorting to war.    The CHAMPION, reasoning in the same way, reports that the  ex-  governors felt that this step will help reduce tension. The  DAILY TIMES echoing in the same angle reports that other  prominent Africans like Dr. Akinola Aguda, a former director  general of the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies and  Dr. Mole Nkose, director, South African Institute of Economic  Policy, have joined others to appeal to all the contending  groups to use dialogue to handle the political situation in  Nigeria. The TIMES also reports this by stressing that  Nigeria's chief of general staff, Lt. Gen. Diya, has appealed to  Nigerians to give the Abacha regime a chance to prove its  sincerity.</p>

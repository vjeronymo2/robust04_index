			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / County council job cuts threat: Tens of thousands of posts at risk, mainly in north and Midlands COUNTY COUNCILS are poised to make tens of thousands of redundancies over the next few months, adding to the wave of job losses announced before Christmas by the large city authorities. County councils are currently discussing draft budgets for next year. Prospects are growing of large-scale job losses in those counties, mainly in the Midlands and the north, which face capping by the government if their spending rises by more than a tiny margin on this year. With education by far the biggest responsibility of counties, that will mean widespread teacher redundancies, and large cuts in spending on schools. Humberside has advised the Department of Employment that 1,000 job losses could be in the offing, and it has warned schools that funding for their devolved budgets next year could be as much as 7.5 per cent down on this year. Derbyshire has advised that 2,000 job losses are in prospect, 1,000 of them in education, unless the government revises its criteria for capping council spending. According to the Association of County Councils, a further 12 of England's 39 county councils are constrained to a spending increase of less than two per cent above this year's level, placing them in a similar predicament. Mr Martin Doughty, Labour leader of Derbyshire county council, said: 'The government's spending assessments are deeply unfair. We have no reserves left, yet our spending is being capped at only 1.75 per cent above this year. Unless it is changed, there will have to be big job losses.' County councils in the south-east are less badly affected. Most have been allowed to increase their spending by more than the prevailing inflation rate, since their spending for this year is generally well below the capping level. However, counties in the north claim that they are also benefiting unfairly from changes to government spending assessments. London boroughs and smaller district councils in the north are also shedding staff in large numbers. The London borough of Lambeth is to lose 1,000 posts. North Tyneside council will today issue compulsory redundancy notices, and aims cut out 1,100 of the 9,500 people employed in April 1992. To the surprise of North Tyneside's leaders, 700 employees have volunteered to leave, substantially reducing the compulsory redundancies required. The redundancies come on top of a loss of 1,000 jobs between April 1990 and 1992. Moreover, the council, which in 1991 lost a national test case legal battle over the enhanced voluntary severance scheme it was then offering, is now giving volunteers no more than the statutory terms to which they are entitled. Of the 700 volunteers, who include 200 teachers, the majority are over-50s taking early retirement. They qualify for enhanced pension and lump sum payments on top of their redundancy payment. Average redundancy payments made to the volunteers are Pounds 5,600 for white collar staff and Pounds 2,200 for manual workers.</p>

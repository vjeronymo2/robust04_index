			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: UK-Greek team in tunnel deal A British-Greek joint venture, Christiani &amp; Nielsen-TEGK, has signed an Ecu40.2m (Dollars 50m) contract to build an undersea tunnel linking two ports in western Greece. The tunnel project, which is still to be ratified by parliament, is the first infrastructure project to be launched under the European Union's new Ecu16.8bn funding package for Greece. Christiani &amp; Nielsen-TEGK was the low bidder among 10 consortia shortlisted for the project, the environment and public works ministry said. The 1km tunnel between Aktion and Preveza at the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf will be constructed using a 'cut-and-cover' method. Several pre-cast concrete segments will be sunk into a channel to be dredged in the seabed. The choice of a tunnel rather than a bridge to replace a ferry crossing between the two ports was made on environmental grounds to protect the gulf and the site of a famous ancient naval battle in 31 BC, at which the Roman fleet defeated Antony and Cleopatra, according to the environment and public works ministry. The tunnel link, due to be completed in 1998, is part of an EU-funded plan to improve the road network and expand harbours in western Greece.</p>

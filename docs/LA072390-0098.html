			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Health Insurer Sued Over Cancellations: A class-action suit was filed Tuesday  against Great Republic Insurance Co. for its cancellation in May of health  insurance to about 14,000 customers. The breach-of-contract suit was brought in  Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> It is on behalf of those covered under a master policy for group insurance who  were being treated for an insured medical condition when Great American  canceled. The policy expressly gave Great American the right to cancel  coverage. But the suit contends that the insurer "devised a scheme" to deprive  the insured of their coverage by terminating the policy, then offering a  conversion policy with limited coverage. At the time of the cancellations,  claims were exceeding premiums, Great Republic attorney John Chakman said.  (Filed July 17, 1990. Case No. BC005960)  </P></p>

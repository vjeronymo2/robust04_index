			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALAYSIANS HAVE TURNED AWAY 8,500 'BOAT PEOPLE,' OBSERVERS SAY  </P> <P> More than 8,500 Vietnamese "boat people" have been turned away from Malaysian  shores despite a pledge by the country to offer the refugees asylum,  international observers said Friday.  </P> <P> The officials said they fear the practice of turning away the Vietnamese,  called boat people because they flee Vietnam in boats, could spread the growing  refugee problem to other parts of the Pacific.  </P> <P> "What we experience in this part of the world now with the Vietnamese boat  people, I believe could have a contagious effect," U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees Thorvald Stoltenberg said Friday.  </P> <P> Stoltenberg, who is making his first visit to the region since assuming office  in January, said he fears an accord adopted last June at the Conference on  Indochina Refugees is in danger of collapsing.  </P> <P> Under the accord, Southeast Asian countries agreed to offer asylum to all  refugees while efforts continue to stem the flow of people from Vietnam.  </P> <P> Reports from Malaysia and other countries, however, indicate they have been  turning away the refugees, leaving them adrift to try their luck elsewhere,  because the countries are overburdened by the thousands of Vietnamese refugees  already housed in crowded camps.  </P> <P> Since the Communist invasion of 1975, thousands of Vietnamese have fled their  homeland in an exodus that has not abated over the years.  </P> <P> Hong Kong has forcibly repatriated some Vietnamese and offered money to others  to return home voluntarily.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Budapest Duna TV in Hungarian at 1920  GMT on 13 June carries an unscheduled 30-minute compilation  called "Help Yourself, the West Will Help You Too." The  program, which deals with the political and economic conference  held in Innsbruck on 11 June, includes a 20-minute exclusive  interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist  Party, MSZP. Jozsef Laszlo hosts the program; the place and  date of the interview are not given.    Laszlo outlines the agenda of the Innsbruck conference and  introduces its participants. Video clips are shown of Gyula  Horn's arrival at the venue; there are extracts from his  interview given to Austrian Television. Also shown are an  extract from an interview with German politicians Hans-Dietrich  Genscher and Rudolf Scharping, who both express their trust in  Hungarian democracy and Gyula Horn's premiership.    The interview with Gyula Horn follows next. Horn reiterates  his criticism -- outlined at the Innsbruck conference -- of the  European Union, EU, for not having concrete programs on  cooperation with the Visegrad countries. He repeats his  arguments in favor of an urgent change. He confirms Hungary's  readiness to repay its debts and urges the EU to draw up a  timetable for Hungary's process of joining the EU.    Horn also confirms the three main elements of the MSZP's  foreign policy. Asked about relations with Hungary's neighbors,  he says:    "There is a basic treaty with Ukraine, as well as an  agreement of about 20 pages on cooperation in minority matters.  I have to say that the question of whether the Ukrainian side  indeed observes the agreement also has to be examined, since  there have been reports that this is not happening exactly the  way it should."    Horn adds: "There have been problems in its implementation,  and what is happening is not exactly what had been promised by  the other side, in Kiev."    Horn is then asked about relations with Slovakia. He  replies:    "When I met [Slovak Prime Minister Jozef] Morvacik in  Bratislava about one and a half months ago, I said that we  should try to free the entire Danube matter -- the Gabcikovo  matter -- from its political overtones and hold substantial  talks on it. We cannot reconcile ourselves to the situation  they created, which would mean the eventual implementation of  variant C. We consider unacceptable any kind of divergence from  the water distribution system recommended by the EU, which would  be disadvantageous for Hungary. We regard this as a key  question, and Moravcik promised that they would revise the  decisions, the position, taken by them [Slovakia]."    After further elaborating on the subject, he says:    "As far as the Office for Hungarians Beyond the Border is  concerned, I do not know whether there is any need for it or  not. I am personally convinced that there is no need for it. I  have to say -- although the reports may be exaggerated, or  perhaps they are not well founded -- that I have heard a lot of  negative things about its activities. However, there are people  even within the party who say that this office should be  maintained. We will examine this question. We will not make a  hasty decision on it."    At the end of the interview Horn outlines the most urgent  tasks of the new government: a detailed review of the economy,  decisions on the world exhibition and the Gabcikovo project, and  solutions to the most serious problems in health service. He  says:    "I am convinced, finally, that the Hungarian Government has  to prepare an overall program -- which should be handed over,  first and foremost, to the EU and, in addition, to the United  States and Japan as well -- that would serve as a basis for  Hungarian modernization. I mean complete modernization of the  infrastructure, including roads, transport, telecommunication  and all large networks in connection with this, since  modernization cannot be started without this. And I am thinking  of a revision of all the rules, regulations, laws, and decrees  that prevent a larger influx of foreign capital into the  country."</p>

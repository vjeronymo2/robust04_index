			<p>BFN     [Text] Japanese banks are actively selling their credit  rights on the former USSR because repayment by Russia, which  took over the former USSR's obligations, remains uncertain.  Total Japanese bank loans to the former Soviet Union totaled  200 billion yen at the end of March, nearly 100 billion yen less  than in September 1993. These credits are being sold to  European investors through European commercial banks and  securities firms. In some cases, East European countries with  outstanding loans with Russia are buying them to offset such  credits.    A total of five or six city banks, including Fuji Bank and  Daiichi Kangyo Bank, and a number of local banks are reportedly  selling off their credit rights with the former USSR.    Most of Japanese banks-held credit rights with the former  USSR are loans to the Russian Bank for Foreign Economic  Relations [BFER]. The current price of credit rights on the  Russian BFER being dealt on the international financial market  is 27-28 percent of the face value. It has been falling since  last December, when the price saw its peak at 54 percent.  Although the main cause of a drop in prices is a rise in  long-term interest rates, some analysts point out: "Japanese  banks' active sales are another cause of a drop in the prices."    In addition to those of former the USSR, Japanese banks are  actively disposing of bad loans of other nations. Last year,  they disposed of their claimable assets of Argentina by changing  them to Argentine government-issued bonds (Brady bonds). They  also disposed of their credit rights with Brazil last April.  For Japanese banks, how to sell off credits with the former  Soviet Union is another major issue. And with this in mind,  they have started selling their credit rights with the former  Soviet Union.</p>

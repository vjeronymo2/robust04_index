			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Letter: Poster concept lacks punch Sir, One of the 'golden rules' I learnt when studying advertising for my marketing diploma is as follows: 'Never spend your client's money advertising his competitor's name or product'. That rule is blatantly ignored by the Conservatives' pre-election 'Double Whammy' poster. The effect on the passing observer is the name Labour mounting an assault on the twin evils on the boxing gloves. Whose side, one wonders, is the agency on? Peter Kreamer, 39 Bell Lane, Eaton, Wick, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 6LQ.</p>

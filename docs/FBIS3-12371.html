While condemning the dastardly and  despicable act on behalf of the government and the people of  Pakistan, the prime minister in a statement issued in Islamabad  last night, said the incident reflects religious intolerance  which nowadays has been directed toward the Muslims of  Palestine, Bosnia, and Kashmir. While condemning this tendency  toward religious intolerance, she said Pakistan considers it as  nothing but unreasonable steps taken at individual and  collective levels. Pakistan has taken note of PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat's appeal to convene an emergency session of the UN  Security Council and as a member of this body, Pakistan will  give full attention to this serious matter. The prime minister  urged the members of the UN Security Council to make use of the  tenets enshrined in the UN Charter and to implement the UN  Security Council Resolution Number 242 and 338, and other  resolutions on Jerusalem.</p>

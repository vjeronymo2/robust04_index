Since this was the shippers' first opportunity to make such a change in its election and due to certain shippers' confusion over the implementation dates of the fuel reimbursement election, Williston Basin herewith seeks a one-time waiver of its tariff requirements to allow any and all shippers the one-time opportunity to change its method of fuel reimbursement effective April 1, 1994. Any such changes made effective pursuant to this waiver would be effective from April 1, 1994, forward until changed in accordance with Section 38 of the General Terms and Conditions of Williston Basin's Tariff. Williston Basin will post this one-time waiver of its tariff on its Electronic Bulletin Board and notify each shipper via written correspondence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).

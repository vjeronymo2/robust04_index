			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UTAH MAGNATE, GE UNIT MAY JOIN IN BID FOR ARISTECH  </P> <P> Utah chemical magnate Jon Huntsman and a General Electric Co. division said  Friday that they are attempting to form a 50-50 joint venture that could  acquire Aristech Chemical Corp. for more than $899 million.  </P> <P> Huntsman Holdings Corp. and GE Plastics of Pittsfield, Mass., said the proposal  could enable Huntsman to boost his offer for Aristech to at least $26 a share  from $25, according to a letter that the Salt Lake City businessman mailed to  Aristech board member R. S. Evans.  </P> <P> Aristech spokesman David Higie declined to comment Friday.  </P> <P> Huntsman is in a bidding war for Aristech with Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan and  Aristech's senior management, which last week offered $26 a share. The senior  management group is led by Aristech Chairman Thomas Marshall.  </P> <P> Aristech has about 32 million shares outstanding, or 34.6 million when fully  diluted. Aristech stock dropped 12.5 cents to $25.125 in New York Stock  Exchange trading on Friday  </P> <P> Huntsman's $25-a-share offer, worth about $865 million, was rejected in  November.  </P> <P> Aristech's board in effect rejected the Mitsubishi-management bid on Wednesday  when it announced that it would seek bids from buyers willing to pay more than  $26 a share. The board set a bidding deadline for 5 p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> In his letter, Huntsman asked Aristech to extend the deadline until Feb. 20 to  give him more time to review Aristech's financial condition and form the joint  venture.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, the 5 p.m. Jan. 29 deadline for the submission of bids, as set  forth in your Jan. 24 letter to me, will not afford us an adequate opportunity  to conduct the necessary review," Huntsman wrote.  </P> <P> "In view of Mitsubishi Corp.'s and Aristech management's lengthy period to  conduct a complete review of Aristech, fairness dictates that we be afforded a  reasonable due diligence review period," the letter said.  </P> <P> Huntsman has signed an agreement not to accumulate additional Aristech stock  unless he offers to buy all outstanding stock for $25 per share or more.  Huntsman currently owns 8.7% of the company's stock, according to Huntsman  spokesman Joel Frank.  </P> <P> In Securities and Exchange Commission documents, Huntsman said he has signed a  confidentiality agreement in return for receiving confidential financial data  about the company.  </P> <P> Much of Aristech's holdings are former USX Chemical Corp. properties. The  company employs about 1,800 people at 10 plants in eight states.  </P></p>

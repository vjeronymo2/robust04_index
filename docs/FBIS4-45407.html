			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric "Criminal Diary": </F> "Shosse Entuziastov Leads to Drugs Den"]    [Text] The "laboratory" where the narcotics were  manufactured ceased operations after the arrival there of staff  from the Balashikha Internal Affairs Directorate. It was housed  in an apartment in a block on the Shosse Entuziastov.    In the apartment they discovered eight kg of poppy stems,  several liters of solution, a large quantity of syringes, and  all kinds of devices for boiling, roasting, pounding, and  grinding the material. They also found several batches ready  for use. When the agents saw these things they decided to set  up an ambush and waited in the apartment.    A few minutes later a young man from the Caucasus region  entered the apartment. He was carrying 20 kg of poppy stems and  1.5 liters of solution. He and the owner of the apartment, a  23-year old local man, were taken to a remand center. Many  local youngsters may have used the services of the drugs  laboratory. An investigation is being carried out.</p>

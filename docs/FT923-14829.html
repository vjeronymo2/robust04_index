			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Arts: The master of pleasing decay - Architecture John Betjeman called him the most intelligent man in England, John Russell called him an aesthete and a moralist, and at his 80th birthday retrospective at the Tate Gallery in 1983, Alan Bowness praised him for 'his enthusiasm, open mindedness, his good sense, his natural modesty and his excellent taste'. There is no doubt that John Piper, who has just died aged 88, was much more than a topographical painter. He was a creator as well as an observer and by the end of an incredibly full life he had established his own vision of England. It is a vision that still counts because it interpreted so many romantic and poetic strands of viewing the essence of English architecture and landscape. Piper's own words sum up his mission far better than any words from a mere critic. 'My aims in painting are to express a personal love of country and architecture and the humanity that inhabits them, and to increase my own understanding and nourish my own love of the work of other painters of the past and the present.' These aims applied as much to his work as a writer, stage designer and as a remarkable architectural photographer. Although he was determined to master as many varieties of artistic media as possible - printing, lithography, aquatints, pottery, photography, stained glass and engraving - it was all in the service of recording landscape and architecture. Anyone who has looked at architecture in England sees it partly through the eyes of John Piper. This year has been a sad one in the toll of deaths of some key figures in the English architectural world. Not least was the death earlier this year of Sir James Richards, the man who, as editor of Architectural Review, was a friend of John Betjeman, John Piper, Osbert Lancaster and many others who combined their talents in the pages of that magazine. Sir James Richards was always known as JMR when he was on 'The Archie'. He gave me my first job in architectural journalism and remained a quiet friend over the years, always encouraging and giving thoughtful advice. It was JMR who first introduced John Piper to John Betjeman and encouraged their collaborations on the Shell Guides to British counties; he also published the work of both of them in the Architectural Review. In the Shell Guides - and also in some of Murray's Architectural Guides - it is sometimes hard to separate the contributions of Betjeman and Piper; but John Piper's brilliant architectural photographs are always distinctive. They shared the same approach to looking at England and it is worth recording their manifesto: 'We still believe in the virtue of making clear our reactions to buildings and to towns and villages. We believe that houses and churches do, and should, inspire love and hate, and that it is worthwhile recording the reactions of two observers, instead of making a cold catalogue. We are aware that this puts us in some bad company; and that occasionally our remarks, made after only one or two visits to places, will very likely offend people who know those places better and have looked at them longer; but we shall be content if we succeed in inspiring love for a few buildings which might otherwise receive neglect, or a cold, impartial revaluation.' Not a bad creed for any writer, artist or photographer. It was Piper with his almost unnerving feeling for places who made us look at English Romanesque sculptures; the austere churches on Romney Marsh; the English seaside, especially Brighton; the isolation of the Isle of Portland; and the lush classical beauty of Stowe. I think it was the sombre painting of Seaton Delaval, that marvellous Vanbrugh house on the Northumberland coast, that first inspired my affection for Piper's work. His thunder clouds and lowering skies that lurk over the paintings of Windsor Castle commissioned by Queen Elizabeth brought forth the comment from King George VI: 'You didn't have much luck with the weather, Mr Piper.' Piper created a romantic world that often echoed his own enthusiasm for what he called 'pleasing decay'. This is a world where buildings are beginning to go back to nature, where they have that picturesque character that Ruskin called 'parasitical sublimity'. This is a sublimity caused not by the inherent character of the building or ruin, but by something external to it. Piper's views of bomb-damaged buildings in Bath or of uncleaned and unrestored Oxford buildings both show the romantic nature of decay. Piper had strong views on restoration and cleaning and I am not sure that he would have been entirely sympathetic to some of the activities of English Heritage or the National Trust. He would have seen the point of leaving Stonehenge to fend for itself and of making houses stable, but not over restored. But this enthusiasm for the intangible atmosphere of the past nourished a creativity that made a lot of new works of art. The Eton College chapel windows are a brave essay in abstraction, while being completely in tune with the ideas of medieval stained glass. At Coventry Cathedral, the Baptistry window has a memorable presence that is almost theatrical. Perhaps it is that Coventry window that seems to burn brightest with John Piper's extraordinary energy. He never stopped working, looking, talking and enthusing about the glories of England. There are more than 5,000 of his beautiful photographs in the archives of the Tate Gallery and any sadness at his death can be tempered by gratitude for his enduring vision. He did achieve what Betjeman saw as his mission in the 1940's, 'to weld closer together his deep, learned and poetic love of England with his clearly formed principles of what a picture should be'.</p>

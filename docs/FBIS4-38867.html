			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- The Russian Federation  Council, which approved the key figures of the draft budget on  Thursday, increased defence appropriations in 1994 from  initially envisaged 37 trillion rubles to 55 trillion, according  to First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin.    He told TASS by telephone that lawmakers adopted the  decision  mostly because the 37-trillion appropriations would mean a  closure for many defence enterprises and mass unemployment.</p>

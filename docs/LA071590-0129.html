Just 5 inches in diameter  and 6 inches high, these three-tiered cakes are perfect, tiny versions of the  traditional wedding cake.  </P> <P> The mini-cakes ($22.50 each) come in white- or chocolate-cake versions with  apricot or raspberry filling, and The Bakery prides itself on using only pure,  natural ingredients and flavorings. What could be more perfect for an  anniversary celebration -- or perhaps to sweeten a marriage proposal?  </P> <P> The Bakery on Melrose, 7261 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 934-4493.DEBORAH  SROLOFF  </P></p>

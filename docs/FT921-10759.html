			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German steel pay settlement fails to inspire bourses NEWS OF a settlement in the German steel pay dispute failed to inspire continental bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ended mixed. After a burst of enthusiasm on news that a steel strike had been avoided, with the FAZ index rising 5.52 to 688.69 at midsession, the DAX closed just 1.52 higher at 1,689.01, well below its high of 1,698.74. Volume rose from DM6.5bn to DM7bn. Some traders said that the 6.4 per cent pay rise for steelworkers was likely to be seen as a benchmark for forthcoming settlements, others that steel was effectively the last of the 1991 pay round and did not set a pattern for 1992. Steel shares put in a mixed performance, with Mannesmann rising DM3 to DM354 and Thyssen, which has gained on a series of analysts' meetings recently, up by only 50 pfg to DM220.50. Meanwhile, the lifting of the strike threat helped some car shares as fears evaporated that automotive output might be hurt by stoppages at key suppliers. BMW gained DM5.50 at DM541.50; but Daimler Benz, which had earlier risen by DM5.80 to DM755, ended 30 pfg up at DM749.50 and Volkswagen rose 50 pfg to DM338, off its high of DM341. The progressive ebbing of enthusiasm seemed to continue in London, where Daimler had lost DM3 of its DM5.50 gain by the late afternoon close. Most of the other German blue chips were given similar treatment. PARIS had a generally unexciting day. Volume fell back sharply to FFr1.7bn after Friday's FFr4.8bn, which was bloated by month-end option expiries. After opening marginally weaker, an afternoon fall in the bond market pushed the CAC-40 index down by 18.27 to close at 1,856.98. Among large-capital shares, Alcatel fell FFr14 to FFr574 and UAP dropped FFr19 to FFr529, but dealers attributed the declines to position-squaring after Friday's options-related activity. One of the day's biggest fallers was the media company Hachette which slid FFr7.80 or 4.8 per cent to FFr170, as the market waited to see who would rescue the bankrupt television company La Cinq, in which Hachette has a 25 per cent stake. Also on the downtrend was L'Oreal which fell FFr8 to FFr720 in relatively high volume of 62,390 shares. Dealers said the share had been hit recently by a decision by investors to sell stocks on a high rating. News of disappointing French perfume sales in 1991 prompted further selling. MILAN lost its early highs as last week's approval of legislation on takeovers failed to have much consequence. The Comit index rose 3.32 to 544.69 in turnover estimated at around L80bn after Friday's L103.7bn. Trading was dominated by domestic operators. Dealers were generally disappointed by the details of Ferruzzi's planned merger of its subsidiaries Eridania and Beghin Say. Their main complaint was that the way the merger was presented made it impossible to make any earnings valuations. Shares in Montedison, which is seen as the main beneficiary of the restructuring, gained L20 to L1,365 but Eridania tumbled L120 to L7,090. Pirelli rose L55 to L1,230 ahead of its capital-raising operation. Also in industrials, Fiat was unchanged at L5,101 in spite of the growing collection of 'sell' notes issued by UK brokers in the wake of its poor 1991 results. Kleinwort Benson said yesterday that the results did not allow a change of its negative fundamental stance on the car company. STOCKHOLM fell in thin trade ahead of the 1991 results season, led off today by Electrolux, whose profits could be down by a quarter, or more. Electrolux B were flat on the day at SKr236 but the Affarsvarlden General index fell 7.4 to 962.7. Volvo B fell SKr5 to SKr376; it said that its car sales, in unit terms, fell by 14 per cent last year. The worst performing sector was insurance, down 2.3 per cent with Skandia down another SKr1 at SKr153. Skandia said yesterday that falling property prices and insurance losses had reduced its net assets from SKr210 to about SKr188 a share. AMSTERDAM looked towards Germany for most of the day: the CBS Tendency Index rose just 0.6 to 122.3 with gains evenly spread. Turnover was Fl 524.7m. The software group, Volmac, was the most active stock, putting on Fl 1.50 or 5.5 per cent to Fl 29 on turnround prospects. Royal Dutch slipped Fl 0.10 to Fl 145.40, recovering from a low of Fl 144.20 following Friday's news of losses at US subsidiary Shell Oil. Grolsch gave details of its acquisition of a UK brewer: it declined Fl 2.90 to Fl 180. Elsevier continued its strong advance, gaining Fl 1.10 to Fl 109.10, a new high. OSLO weakened almost 2 per cent as the all-share index fell 8.31 to 438.57. Elkem, the metals producer, continued to fall in spite of a settlement in the German steel dispute: its A shares fell NKr6.5 to NKr57. VIENNA firmed to its highest level in four months. The all-share Vienna Bourse Index rose 4.61 to 460.44 and the 18-share ATX index added 11.19 to 1,014.01. ISTANBUL fell for the fifth consecutive day: the 75-share index was down 198.16, or 4 per cent, at 4,728.03.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1136.52  1137.48  1139.69  1138.64  1137.77  1135.30  1133.39  1134.04  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High 1139.69       Day's Low 1133.01  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Jan 31    Jan 30    Jan 29    Jan 28    Jan 27     1137.97   1131.87   1132.85   1143.22   1142.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

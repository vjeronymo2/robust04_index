Washington will accept Seoul's  request that it not issue Kim a residence permit, a senior  official at the South Korean Embassy said Tuesday.    The State Department notified the embassy that Kim has  applied for a resident's permit and said that it will deal  prudently with the application by Kim, who is suspected of  taking bribes related to Korea's military build-up program, the  official said.    "It will take a little time for us to receive an official  confirmation from the U.S. State Department, I guess," he said.  "But it is clear that Kim did not ask for political asylum in  the United States."    The Korean Government has explained to the U.S. Government  that Kim is wanted for prosecution in Seoul and has asked it to  deal cautiously with any application to extend his visa or for a  residence permit, according to the official.    "The U.S. reaction was that it will make a decision on the  problem through prudent internal discussion," he said.    In the notification, the State Department did not reveal the  date, place or content of Kim's application, but embassy  officials think it was made this year.    Kim went to Washington as a guest researcher at the Heritage  Foundation in April last year and stayed when he was implicated  in irregularities in the Yulgok (military modernization) project.</p>

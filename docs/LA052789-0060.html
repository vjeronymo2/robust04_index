			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOMELESSNESS IN SUBURBIA' AND SHEEN'S OFFER OF A SANCTUARY  </P> <P> This is to tell Sheen that I support his recent statements regarding the poor  and the homeless.  </P> <P> Although I don't live in Malibu, I would say that if there were a hundred  Martin Sheens in this part of the world we would really have a much gentler,  kinder nation. Last October I saw him in the very first ranks of peaceful  demonstrators to walk across the cattle guard at Mercury, Nev., in an attempt  to stop nuclear testing. Several hundred men and women from all across the  United States came to express their desire to stop nuclear testing and to draw  attention to the enormity of the crime against humanity that nuclear testing  is.  </P> <P> That Sheen involves himself in such activities and in his other concerns for  the ill-housed is testimony to the man's concern for the human condition. We  who are well-fed, well-housed, etc., should take our hats off to him.  </P> <P> How different the world would be if another Hollywood actor had been this  concerned with the ill-clothed, the ill-fed, the ill-housed in this, the  richest country in the world.  </P> <P> ABRAHAM ROTHSTEIN  </P> <P> Fontana  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Algiers, March 29 (AFP)--President Lamine Zeroual  has said the government has made "contacts" with the Islamic  Salvation Front (FIS), in an effort to form a transitional forum  among the country's political parties.    According to a statement sent to AFP Monday evening by the  opposition leftist Ettahaddi party, the president stressed that  the "government is now waiting for the FIS to keep its promise  to stop terrorism."    The statement did not say what the government may have  promised the FIS, which it officially banned in January 1992  after the army intervened to cancel a general election the FIS  looked poised to win.    Government dialogue with the banned party has been a point  of  controversy in recent days, since the Islamic Society Movement  (MSI) released a statement, which the government contested,  implying that FIS leaders were talking with the government. The  MSI is a moderate Islamist rival of the FIS.    According to Ettahaddi, Zeroual "assured that dialogue (with  political parties) would not be exclusive," but that he would  "leave out any who attack the constitution." He also said that  the government would not discuss anything that "is not  negotiable."    The goal of the talks, which began last Wednesday, is to  form  a National Transition Council. The proposed body would have 200  members representing political parties, the government, unions  and professional organisations.    The organisation would be a quasi-legislative body in which  the FIS would occupy around 40 seats. The council is scheduled  to get underway by the end of April.</p>

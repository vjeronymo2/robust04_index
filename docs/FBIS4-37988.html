			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Abu Dhabi, June 26 (AFP) -- Omani Foreign  Minister Yusuf Bin-'Alawi 'Abdallah called Sunday [26 June] on  behalf of the six Gulf states for a halt to the civil war in  Yemen.    "The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are eager to  see Yemeni brothers put an end to their destructive war,"  'Abdallah said during a stopover in Abu Dhabi.    'Abdallah met with his United Arab Emirates counterpart  Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan following a meeting in  Jeddah with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal.    'Abdallah said: "It is up to the Yemenis to decide" their  future, referring to the south's declaration of the breakaway  Yemen Democratic Republic on May 21.    The secession was implicitly recognised by five members of  the GCC -- Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrein and Kuwait --  which said unity could not be imposed by force.    'Abdallah said the UN Security Council, currently chaired by  Oman, is examining a draft resolution on Yemen.    "The project is the subject of consultations between the  five  permanent members of the Security Council," he said without  elaborating.    Oman and Saudi Arabia played a key role in the adoption of  UN  Security Council Resolution 924 of June 1, which called for an  immediate ceasefire. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / US accepts Russia's move on freer emigration In preparation for his summit next week in Washington with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, President Bill Clinton issued a declaration that Russia allows its citizens to emigrate freely, thus moving a step closer towards normalising US trade with the former Soviet state, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Under a US law called the Jackson-Vanik amendment, trade relations with communist countries were linked to the governments' emigration policies. With the law still in effect, Mr Clinton has been required to issue a yearly waiver to allow Russian products to get Most Favoured Nation tariff treatment. MFN gives them the same low tariffs as the members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Clinton's declaration ends the need for a yearly waiver, but falls short of requesting a new law from Congress. It has been long argued that Jackson-Vanik discouraged private investment in Russia because investors had no certainty they could export into the US. As long as the Jackson-Vanik amendment is still on the books - and the president has not requested its removal - the administration must still report to Congress every six months on the status of Russian emigration policies. Congress can also vote to disapprove the president's action, taken on Tuesday, but there is no sentiment for a reversal. A US trade official said the president was following the same procedure established with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, as trade relations were normalised. Ultimately Congress passed legislation altogether removing them from the Jackson-Vanik requirements. Although Mr Clinton has not yet requested similar legislation for Russia, the trade official said the administration hoped it was sending a signal to investors that 'things are more stable' in Russia.</p>

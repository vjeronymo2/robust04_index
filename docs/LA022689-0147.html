			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH ON GUN CONTROL  </P> <P> President Bush is dead wrong in maintaining that the AK-47 is needed by the  bigger game hunters. Our wild game is being decimated fast enough without the  use of those infernal weapons. A hunter with a high-powered rifle should be  satisfied with one shot at his game. If he wants to spray the target with a  volley from an AK-47 he is no sportsman at all.  </P> <P> GEORGE L. PETERSON  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Technology: Stars on a silver disc - Philips and Pioneer are competing to bring Hollywood to life in the living room Even the most sedentary cinema-goer must once have had a sneaking desire to stand alongside Clint Eastwood as the showdown loomed or join Indiana Jones in an escape from marauding tribespeople. Playing out such fantasies on the television screen is also the dream of film makers and electronics companies. This autumn European consumers will be bombarded with the first stage in such dream fulfilment - feature films on a silvery disc. In a Pounds 3m advertising campaign Philips is promoting full-length films on compact disc - the five-inch disc already widespread in the music and computer market. Ironically, they will be challenged by Japanese electronics company Pioneer, which is promoting in Europe the 12-inch Laserdiscs developed - and largely abandoned - by Philips over a decade ago. Laserdisc is acknowledged as the superior product. 'It's like a comparison between a hardback and a paperbook book,' concedes Simon Turner, director of Philips Interactive Media Systems. Laserdisc produces high-quality digital 'surround' sound with broadcast picture quality, as the large disc size means the picture is not compressed. Philips' Digital Video, on the other hand, has to squash the pictures to get an entire film on to CD. For every one piece of data that is included on the disc another 129 are discarded. When the disc is played the eye does not notice the compression because the discarded data relates to parts of the screen that are not changing. Only the moving parts of the film are updated, resulting in a picture quality which Philips claims is slightly superior to a VHS video. The accompanying sound is digital stereo, of a similar quality to that achieved on audio CD. Digital Video is the final piece in Philips' concept of CD-I (compact disc interactive) which combines digital images, sound and now video images for computer games, educational purposes and general entertainment. Despite the inferior quality, says Turner, the five-inch disc is the one consumers identify with and want to buy. 'It's not equivalent to Laserdisc, but that's of no interest to 95 per cent of the UK population who have never seen Laserdisc.' Laserdisc, he concludes, is a niche market for the movie connoisseur. At Pioneer, Guy Warren, senior manager of marketing and sales for Europe, begs to differ. Although the technology failed to grab the public imagination in the 1980s, when there were few recorded films available and the players were expensive, Laserdisc has since proven popular outside Europe. In Japan, one in 10 households has a player, and in the US 1m Laserdisc machines are in use. 'This autumn will probably be a turning point for Laserdisc in Europe,' predicts Warren. 'There will be several blockbuster films released.' They will included Basic Instinct, Chaplin and Universal Soldier. The Laserdisc players sell for Pounds 399, although a single film costs around Pounds 25. A feature film on Digital Video will cost less than Dollars 25 (Pounds 17). In common with Digital Video, and unlike videocassettes, Laserdiscs are virtually indestructible, and the machines can play audio CDs as well. Warren believes the growing popularity of large-screen and projection television sets will fuel demand for these high-quality recordings. In Europe, Pioneer plans to follow the route that established the technology in the US: it will buy the rights to blockbuster films and publish them on Laserdisc in the European Pal television format. Neither Pioneer nor Philips see their products as a direct competitor for the VCR. In Japan there is now no market for audio CD players, only for Laserdisc ones, says Warren. Turner goes one step further. 'Really we see CD-I as this box which produces many different values in the home. Games will be much better quality and there will be interactive films.' Much of Philips' bold advertising campaign will focus on persuading consumers that CD-I will bring together what used to be a plethora of distinct media. 'What is interesting is that the traditional delineations in the publishing and broadcasting industries are disappearing,' Turner says. 'What CD-I is doing is mixing these up.' For Philips, CD-I forms the basis of a home entertainment system that combines computer games, digital audio, traditional linear movies and a combination of movie clips and computer animation. One scenario envisaged by Philips is the mixture of film footage and computer images  - a chase scene from Star Wars, for example, where viewers ride alongside Luke Skywalker and control a space vehicle using a joystick on a CD-I console. The attraction of such technology has not been lost on Pioneer. It has just launched Laseractive in the US and Japan and promises a European launch during 1994. Laseractive is a collaboration between Pioneer, Japanese electronics manufacturer NEC and games company Sega, and delivers interactive games and films similar to those on CD-I. Pioneer is again pushing the superior quality of its product: the larger storage capacity of Laserdisc enables Laseractive to give an improved picture quality and superior computer images and interactive software. The company also believes the greater storage capacity of Laserdisc will enable the technology to compete with high-definition television, which has a far greater number of picture elements. Philips counters by saying CD-I technology will have progressed by the middle of the decade, the earliest date by which HDTV will be available. Double density discs will be available using blue lasers, which can be focused more finely than today's red laser systems. Warren also argues that on the home-movie front Laserdisc has a further advantage over CD-I in the run up to the Christmas buying season: the technology is well-proven and widely available. This autumn Philips is selling a slot-in cartridge for Pounds 150 which will upgrade existing CD-I players, bought largely for games software, to enable them to play feature films and interactive games incorporating Digital Video. Not until early next year will the company launch a CD-I player with Digital Video included as a discrete unit. They will also sell a 'black box' to convert audio CD players to play CD-I discs with Digital Video. For the harassed parent who views such home entertainment systems as a threat to domestic peace and quiet there is one further frightening thought: both CD-I and Laseractive are designed to incorporate home karaoke systems.</p>

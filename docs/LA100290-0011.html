			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAY'S SUIT AGAINST BOY SCOUTS  </P> <P> In response to "Boy Scout Question," editorial (Sept. 24):  </P> <P> Your editorial on gays becoming Scout leaders was remarkable.  </P> <P> The public, in general, must break away from these fears of homosexuals. They  are only different in their choice of a companion.  </P> <P> It is truly sad that Curran has to go through the courts to become a Scout  leader. This should prove to the courts that this man cares and wants to help  mold minds in a proper way, not in a sexual way.  </P> <P> TRACY HART  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / US near accord on Earth Summit draft DELEGATES preparing for the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in June have come up with a compromise proposal that seems likely to pave the way for agreement on a global warming convention. Mr Jean Ripert, the French delegate chairing negotiations at the United Nations in New York, said the US had agreed to a draft which would set non-binding guidelines for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Agreement on this issue, which has until now pitted the US against the rest of the world, would open the way for President George Bush to attend the summit. He is the only major world leader so far not to have agreed to attend. Environmentalist groups yesterday complained that Mr Ripert's draft represented an intolerable watering down of efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The EC has until now insisted on a treaty which by the year 2000 would cap emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, at 1990 levels. President Bush has refused to accept specific targets and timetables, but his administration says that actions the US has already taken will result in cuts in emissions of all greenhouse gases by 7-11 per cent, close to the reduction needed to stabilise at 1990 levels.</p>

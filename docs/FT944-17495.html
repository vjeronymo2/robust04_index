			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Brazil holds back from imposing capital controls A senior Brazilian central bank official said yesterday that the government may consider imposing capital controls in some circumstances, but ruled out Chilean-style restrictions on the exit of capital. Mr Gustavo Franco, director of international affairs at the central bank, said the type of capital controls introduced for a period late in 1993 'may be used again if necessary but we'd rather not need to use them'. These controls included a tax on some inflows, mainly designed to prevent surges of short-term capital. He added that two rules would govern any decisions made on the subject: Rules should not be changed for decisions taken in the past, but only relate to future decisions; Rules should not be introduced that would affect the exit of capital - to do so would be unfair. Speculation in Brazilian financial markets that capital controls would be imposed has been cited as a factor depressing the stock market in recent days. The fear is that large inflows following the probable victory of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Monday's election could damage the finely-poised anti-inflation strategy by either over-elevating the exchange rate or by swelling money supply. Mr Franco said that a path of low-inflationary growth implied two new elements for the Brazilian economy: a strong exchange rate and current account deficits, instead of surpluses run over the last decade. A current account deficit was the corollary of capital inflows the country needed to tap foreign savings. In reference to Mexico's high current account deficit, which exceeded 6 per cent last year, he said: 'There is no point in thinking Brazil is going to become like Mexico, but there is no point either in becoming mercantilists and thinking that having a very large trade surplus is good for the economy.' He added: 'Appreciating the currency and trade liberalisation are things that make good economic sense'. The last stage of the so-called Real plan - the introduction of a new currency in July - has brought inflation down to about 1 per cent a month in September from about 45-50 per cent earlier in the year. 'It was a good start, but let's not get the idea that that the whole thing is finished,' Mr Franco said. Future growth demanded public savings and that would only, paradoxically, come with austerity. 'Growth under fiscal discipline and under democracy is the challenge of the next administration,' he said. He was speaking at a seminar organised in part by Banco do Brasil, Latin America's largest bank and part state-owned, which yesterday announced the opening of a new securities subsidiary in London. The subsidiary, BB Securities will underwrite, trade and market emerging market securities. It will aim to raise capital for companies from Brazil and other South American countries, according to Mr Alcir Calliari, Banco do Brasil chairman.</p>

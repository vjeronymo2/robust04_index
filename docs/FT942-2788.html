			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Materials handling boosts FKI - Hardware side moves into Europe with Pounds 25.8m castors purchase FKI, the electrical engineering and electronic components group, yesterday announced a 38 per cent rise in profits and the acquisition of Rhombus, a German castor manufacturer, for Pounds 25.8m. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 38m to Pounds 52.3m. Turnover advanced 5 per cent, from Pounds 756.1m to Pounds 794.5m, including a contribution of Pounds 46.8m from acquisitions. Mr Bob Beeston, chief executive, said the group had done everything it had set out to do during the year, raising margins on steady turnover. Nevertheless, the share price closed 9 1/2 p down at 163 1/2 p. Rhombus is being acquired from Albert Schulte Sohne for Pounds 5.4m cash and the assumption of Pounds 20.4m of debt. Mr Beeston said it would take FKI's hardware division into Europe for the first time, complementing Faultless Caster which is the market leader in North America with a 21 per cent share. The German company has 15 per cent of the European market, with a modern factory in Wermelskirchen and another in Malaysia. Customers include makers of shopping trolleys, hospital beds, and home and office furniture. It is not expected to make a contribution to FKI's profits until next year. FKI operates through five divisions - hardware, materials handling, automotive, engineering and process control. Profits increased in all five, with materials handling the outstanding performer. Profits in the division rose from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 17.5m on turnover of Pounds 176.9m (Pounds 173.3m). Both the materials handling and the automotive divisions benefited from the improvement in the US automotive sector. The automotive division lifted profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 4.6m on turnover of Pounds 171.7m (Pounds 152.4m). The hardware division made profits of Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 16.1m) on sales of Pounds 172.1m (Pounds 132.6m), helped by the Pounds 66.5m acquisition of Truth, the US manufacturer of hinges, operating and locking mechanisms for windows and doors, last November. Engineering profits edged ahead to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 10.5m) on turnover of Pounds 97.6m (Pounds 100.8m), while process control profits were Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 5.2m) on sales of Pounds 176.2m (Pounds 161.4m). Mr Eric Bowers, finance director, said that margins had improved from 5.9 per cent to 7.6 per cent, with margins of 8.7 per cent in the second half. Gearing was 50 per cent at the end of the year, but would reach 60 per cent with the acquisition of Rhombus. Earnings per share rose from 6.2p to 8.22p. A final dividend of 2.2p is proposed, giving a total for the year of 3.7p (3p). COMMENT The constant emphasis on margins and the reluctance to push for revenue growth at any price has certainly paid dividends. It has to be asked whether the rate of growth can be maintained. However, this year Truth should kick in strongly, and the following year the latest acquisition will be adding to the bottom line. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 68m this year give a prospective multiple of 16. It looks as though high expectations of the current management have been fully reflected in the share price, and yesterday saw some profit taking.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (21): Safe hands are needed to pass it on - Trusts IF ALICE gives Bob money to invest for Claire in such a way that Bob, thereafter, owns that money, not for himself, but for Claire the legal relationship between Alice, Bob and Claire is that of a trust. Alice is the settlor, Bob the trustee and Claire the beneficiary. A change of ownership from Alice to Bob is essential to create a trust. This is what makes a trust different from any other legal arrangement, and also the reason why, unless specified to the contrary, the settlor has no further rights over or entitlement to the trust assets after the trust has been created. This does not mean that the trustees can do with the trust assets what they choose. If a trustee in any way benefits from the trust assets, unless specified by the settlor at the time of creating the trust, or deals recklessly with the trust assets, he can be sued by the beneficiary. The settlor's instructions to his or her trustees are usually contained in a Trust Deed, which should be carefully drafted by a lawyer, so as to reflect the settlor's wishes accurately. The unique legal relationship of a trust is of great importance in commerce. Trusts are widely used, for example, in pension schemes, share employment schemes, investment transactions and joint ventures. Trusts have also traditionally been used to provide for the weak and needy, and for those beneficiaries such as widows, charities, infant children and future generations, so that capital is protected and preserved in the safe hands of the trustees (one of whom could also be the settlor). Not surprisingly, the unique legal relationship of the trust means that it must be taxed differently, from either an individual or a company. Trustees cannot be taxed on trust income and trust capital as if it were their own personal income or capital to enjoy; neither can the funds simply be added to the beneficiary's income or personal capital, because a beneficiary has no control over these funds and in many cases does not receive any money until much later, if at all. Trusts are taxed according to the type of trust and the relationship between the settlor and the beneficiary. They are categorised, depending on what the trustees do with the income of the trust fund. If the trustees must pay all the income of the trust to a particular beneficiary - the 'life tenant' - the trust is an 'Interest in Possession' trust. All other trusts are 'Discretionary' trusts, because the trustees either have discretion as to which beneficiary should receive the income or how much the beneficiary should get, leaving the trustees free to accumulate what remains of the income with the existing capital of the trust fund. One important sub-class of the Discretionary trust is the 'Accumulation and Maintenance' trust for children under the age of 25. Provided the conditions set out in inheritance tax legislation are met, the penal inheritance tax provisions imposed on Discretionary trusts can then be avoided. Because trusts are taxed in a different, often more advantageous way, from either individuals or companies, they are often used as part of a family tax mitigation scheme. The table sets out the tax effects of the various settlements. The most tax-effective trust is one set up by a 'Non-UK domiciled' settlor for a UK resident beneficiary with trustees resident in a tax haven. This trust can effectively avoid UK income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax if carefully structured and managed. If a trust is to be used as part of a tax mitigation exercise, it must be remembered that a trust cannot always be changed at a later date, if the tax regime changes or the settlor decides that he or she needs the money personally. A trust should therefore be treated with respect and should not be entered into lightly.

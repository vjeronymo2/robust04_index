			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Surprise shake-up at GM as Smith replaces Reuss GENERAL MOTORS last night surprised the US automotive industry by promoting Mr Jack Smith, once head of its European operations, to be president and chief operating officer of the company. He replaces the widely-criticised Mr Lloyd Reuss, who has been moved to a less powerful position. The move places Mr Smith in a strong position to replace Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, whenever he should retire. Mr Reuss, a long-time close colleague of Mr Stempel, has been appointed executive vice-president in charge of new vehicles and systems. Mr Reuss's new job includes responsibity for developing electric vehicles and Saturn, the compact car being built using new manufacturing techniques. Mr Reuss had been criticised for not adopting a tougher approach to GM's problems in the North American market. Mr Stempel had reportedly come under pressure from institutional investors and some board members to replace him. Mr Smith, formerly head of GM's international operations, will now also take charge of all the company's North American vehicle and component oper-ations. The company said the aim was to integrate more fully GM's North American and international vehicle operations to accelerate a return to profit in North America. The company's US operations have been losing money heavily for the past two years, because of recession and severe price competition, while international operations have been reaping large profits, particularly in Europe. The company announced a restructuring plan in December which will involve the closure of 21 plants, the loss of more than 70,000 jobs and an upheaval of the management structure of the US business. Mr Smith will take Mr Reuss's place as head of the strategy board overseeing this reorganisation. The company said the changes would 'promote the adoption of best practices throughout the corporation, such as the operating techniques which have proven so successful for GM's international operations'.</p>

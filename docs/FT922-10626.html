			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Matra slashes dividend after decline MATRA, the French elec-tronics and defence group, has cut its dividend from FFr8 in 1990 to FFr5.5 for 1991 after a sharp fall in profits. Net profits fell from FFr606m (Dollars 108.60m) in 1990 to FFr252m in 1991, after a decline in operating profits from FFr1.3bn to FFr965bn. Turnover rose 6 per cent to FFr22.7bn. Matra, which is chaired by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, attributed the fall in profits to tough trading conditions, and to its 17 per cent increase in research and development costs, to FFr3.2bn, during 1991. However it said it expected 1992 to be a better year. The decline in profits comes at a sensitive time for Matra, which is orchestrating a merger with Hachette, the heavily-indebted publishing group also run by Mr Lagardere. Hachette recently announced it was trying to recapitalise after making hefty provisions on its losses in La Cinq, the French TV station which folded earlier this year. The French government has given the go-ahead to the long standing plan for Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), one of France's largest state-controlled banks, to swap up to 10 per cent of its equity with Dresdner Bank of Germany.</p>

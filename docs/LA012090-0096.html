			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSITION GOES SLOW IN ROMANIA;  </P> <P> REFORM: NATIONAL PEASANTS PARTY SUPPORTS PLANS TO ABANDON REFERENDUM ON ENDING  DEATH PENALTY, OUTLAWING COMMUNIST PARTY.  </P> <P> The National Peasants Party said Friday that it supports the decision of the  National Salvation Front, Romania's provisional government, to abandon plans  for a referendum on the death penalty and on outlawing the Communist Party.  </P> <P> The Peasants Party has emerged as the leading political group in the country  since the revolution that ousted the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu last month. Its  support could help rally public opinion behind the front, which has  flip-flopped on the two issues.  </P> <P> A week ago, the front's leader, under pressure from a crowd of rowdy  demonstrators, decreed an end to the Communist Party and said the death penalty  would be reinstated for top officials of the Ceausescu government and the  secret police. A day later, the front said the issues would be put to a  nationwide referendum.  </P> <P> But on Thursday the front rescinded both decisions. Capital punishment,  abolished after Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed Dec. 25, will  remain abolished. The Communist Party will be allowed to exist, but most  observers agree it has virtually no public support.  </P> <P> "We were fully informed of the decision before it was announced," Iftene Pop,  vice president of the Peasants Party, said, "and we agree with it fully. We  have already expressed our opposition to the death penalty, and we do not want  to see the Communists banned. We want to see them defeated in a free and fair  election."  </P> <P> The Peasants Party, Pop said, has received membership applications from 100,000  Romanians, many of them from a generation that can remember when the Communists  overturned the 1946 election -- the last free election here -- after the  Peasants won 76% of the vote.  </P> <P> Although Pop said his party supports the decisions of the front, a commission  of 140 members that came together in the first days after the Ceausescu  overthrow, he added that the Peasants and other parties will continue to press  for a delay in the date for national elections, now set for April.  </P> <P> "The Peasants, the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party have  submitted a letter to the front calling for elections to be held in September,"  Pop said. "We hope the front will follow this suggestion."  </P> <P> Ten other groups have announced their intent to file as legal political  parties, and most of them, Pop believes, will be hard pressed to organize  effective political campaigns by April.  </P> <P> At the same time, the parties are wary that the front could become entrenched  if elections are delayed too long.  </P> <P> "It is a difficult situation for all of us," Pop said. "The Romanian people  have gotten accustomed to the idea that power becomes degraded. We are wary of  this with the front, and we must be candid about it. We worry that the front  might get too used to wielding power. We support the front, because it is good  for maintaining order and stability. We need the front to get food to the  people and to create and to guarantee the conditions for free elections. But  that is all. We do not want to see the front overstepping its mandate."  </P> <P> Pop said the Peasants Party also supports a draft election law that the front  announced Thursday. It calls for the creation of a two-house national  legislature and separation of executive, judicial and legislative powers. All  political parties, excepting those deemed fascist, will be allowed to  participate, and all will have equal and free access to radio, television and  press, the front said.  </P> <P> A public discussion on the election law will precede its adoption, according to  Silviu Brucan, a member of the front's 11-man executive committee. Brucan said  all political parties will be consulted.  </P> <P> "We don't need anything original in Romania," Pop said. "A clear, plain and  simple democracy is what we need."  </P></p>

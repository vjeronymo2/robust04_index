			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL CUTS BRADLEY'S TRANSIT PROGRAM OUT OF BUDGET  </P> <P> In a setback for Mayor Tom Bradley, the City Council on Tuesday eliminated from  the 1989-1990 budget a $7-million transit program the mayor had proposed in the  waning days of his recent election campaign.  </P> <P> On a recommendation by Finance and Revenue Committee Chairman Zev Yaroslavsky,  who called the proposal an "outrageous" use of scarce transit funds, the  council voted 8 to 7 to eliminate the "L.A. Pride Lines" program.  </P> <P> The program would have used half of its budgeted $7 million to put 25 aging  Rapid Transit District buses back into commission on eight of the more heavily  traveled lines. The program would have used the remaining $3.5 million to hire  250 area high school students to clean these and other buses. All of the funds  would have been supplied under Proposition A -- the voter-approved half-cent  sales tax that is earmarked for public transportation projects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One of Final Items  </P> <P> The issue arose late in the council's second day of deliberations on the  $3.25-billion budget. It was one of the final items up for consideration before  the council completed adoption of the Finance and Revenue Committee's report on  the budget, a key step in the complicated and lengthy budget process.  </P> <P> After setting priorities among the hundreds of programs up for budget  increases, the council ended up cutting about $25 million of Bradley's  proposals.  </P> <P> The transit proposal had been supported by several council members from  inner-city districts, such as Gloria Molina, who urged fellow members to  finance the program. She said it is important for the working poor, who make  the greatest use of bus service.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said that transit funds should not be wasted on what he said was  essentially a youth jobs program.  </P> <P> But Councilman Marvin Braude said, "What's wrong with using Prop. A funds to  clean up buses? . . . What's wrong with hiring young people? . . . What's wrong  with experimenting a little? This is innovative and it is imaginative."  </P> <P> In defeating the program, council members agreed to use the funds at a later  date for other transportation programs.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in an unexpected victory for the mayor, the council voted  overwhelmingly to restore the full $2.2 million in funding for the Clean and  Green program, which employs inner-city youths in environmental summer jobs.  The council's Finance and Revenue Committee had recommended holding the program  to its current year funding level of $1.2 million.  </P> <P> In another budget action, the council agreed to appropriate $500,000 to install  four-way stop signs at all intersections around elementary schools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Owe It to the Youngsters'  </P> <P> "Judging from the response I have personally got from the PTAs and the parents  and the principals . . . I think all of us owe it to the youngsters," said  Yaroslavsky, who proposed the project.  </P> <P> Ed Rowe, general manager of the city's Department of Transportation, said the  agency gets calls and letters from about 17,000 people a year asking for new  stop signs. Most of them, he said, are petitioning for signs near schools.  </P> <P> The council mandate applies to all 413 elementary schools in the Los Angeles  Unified School District. It also includes an additional 216 schools -- private  elementary schools and a few junior high and high schools.  </P> <P> The council also approved $1 million for new library books and longer hours for  city swimming pools and also formally voted to drop funding for the  controversial Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recent Disclosures  </P> <P> In recent years, the group received about $400,000 in grants from the city,  largely at the urging of Bradley. The mayor dropped the funding request  following disclosures that he maintained real estate investments with Juanita  St. John, task force director, and that the group was behind in its financial  reporting to the city.  </P> <P> "I don't think we need to say much more about that subject," said Yaroslavsky,  a frequent Bradley foe, in recommending that the council eliminate funding for  the group.  </P> <P> Councilman Robert Farrell, one of the mayor's staunchest supporters, cast the  only dissenting vote.  </P></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Murray Smaller Trust raises net asset value MURRAY Smaller Markets Trust, the Glasgow-based investment trust specialising in the world's less accessible stock markets, improved net asset value per share by 11.6 per cent to 302.7p, against 271.2p over the year to November 30. Net revenue for the six month period fell to Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 1.34m) for earnings of 2.29p (2.39p). The interim dividend is raised from 1.25p to 1.35p. Mr David Briggs, a director of Murray Johnstone, the trust's management arm, said many markets in which the trust was invested fell sharply in local terms in the period. The exception was Malaysia which increased by 17 per cent. In contrast, the FT-A world index rose nearly 17 per cent because of the strong performance in sterling terms of the US and Japanese markets, to which the trust was minimally exposed. The trust had taken profits in Malaysia, but was 'comfortable' with its heavy Far East weighting. Since November there had been recoveries on the Honk Kong, Mexican, and Argentinian markets.</p>

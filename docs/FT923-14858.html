			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / French truckers switch focus of protest to south FRENCH roads remained chaotic yesterday despite the government's efforts to end the lorry drivers' dispute. Some roadblocks were cleared in the north but new ones were erected in the south. Force Ouvriere, one of the trade unions involved, threatened to step up its protest because of the government's refusal to abandon plans to introduce a new penalty system under which driving licences can be forfeited for motoring offences. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, held an emergency meeting of ministers in the morning to try to resolve the dispute. The government has already threatened to suspend lorry drivers' licences unless they abandon their protest. The transport ministry has been sending regional representatives to negotiate with the protesters. Some drivers have already dispersed. By yesterday morning, roadblocks had been cleared from some sections of the motorways around Paris, Lille and other parts of northern France. A convoy of 200 Belgian lorries trapped near Lille was escorted to the border by riot police. It was a different picture in the south where many roads remained blocked. In Toulouse, one band of lorry drivers started to dismantle their roadblock, only to be replaced by another group. Drivers also continued their strategy of sealing off individual targets such as petrol depots. The dispute has led to shortages of food, fuel and medical supplies. This weekend the government is suspending the usual weekend restrictions on heavy goods vehicles in an attempt to speed up deliveries. Taxi drivers in Lille reinforced the campaign by staging their own protest against the new system, driving through the city at a snail's pace. In London, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, attacked the 'enormous disruption both to business and to people's annual holidays'. Belgium advised its citizens not to travel in France.

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P> Cubic Corp. on Monday settled a shareholder lawsuit that alleged that  executives at the San Diego-based defense contractor used defense-industry  consultants to bribe federal officials in order to win lucrative contracts.  </P> <P> The settlement, in which Cubic acknowledged no wrongdoing, was approved during  a brief hearing before U.S. District Court Magistrate Harry R. McCue.  </P> <P> The settlement approved on Monday included $1.2 million for plaintiffs'  attorney fees but no monetary award for Cubic shareholders who had sought  unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  </P> <P> The settlement was driven in part by the "unavailability of insurance coverage  to satisfy a judgment" against the company, according to terms of the  settlement.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement approved on Monday, Cubic agreed to have a  "distinguished professor of corporate law" lecture its executives on "a  director's obligation to shareholders."  </P> <P> Cubic also agreed to stage "regular presentations" to its employees about  "ethical considerations in government contracting."  </P> <P> The suit was filed in 1988, shortly after federal agents searched Cubic's San  Diego-based Defense Systems division during the ongoing "Ill Wind"  investigation into procurement fraud in the defense industry.  </P> <P> No charges have been brought against Cubic or its executives in connection with  that investigation. However, the settlement reached on Monday acknowledged the  possibility that Cubic might seek a "compromise disposition" of the  investigation.  </P> <P> No shareholders appeared at Monday morning's hearing.

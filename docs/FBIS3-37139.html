The measure does not affect Moscow though the number  of broadcasts in St. Petersburg have been reduced, he said.    Cutbacks in the number of TV programs on two state-run  channels follows a decision by communications workers in  response to a Rbl 80 Bn debt run by the Ostankino and All Russia  TV companies.    Russian PM Viktor Chernomyrdin after Wednesday's meeting  with  Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and Ostankino TV Company  Chairman Alexander Yakovlev instructed the Finance Ministry to  raise funds to help phase out the debt.    Glubokov said regional broadcasting would resume as  repayment  was made.</p>

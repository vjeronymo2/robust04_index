			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION OF INSURANCE FIRM'S COLLAPSE DEMANDED  </P> <P> There were calls from several quarters Tuesday for a comprehensive Insurance  Department investigation into the collapse of Coastal Insurance Co., and one  industry source said he had been informed that there will be an official  inquiry.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it was learned that all California auto insurance policyholders will  be assessed a surcharge of up to 1% on their premiums so that the  state-appointed, industry-administered California Insurance Guarantee Assn. can  pay off claims against Coastal's 200,000 auto insurance policies in the state.  </P> <P> Association Director John W. Gates estimated Tuesday that this will cost  between $80 million and $100 million. That means California's approximately 13  million auto insurance policyholders each will pay an average of $6 to $8 extra  to meet Coastal's claims obligations.  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie stopped short of saying that there will  be an investigation of Coastal's demise.  </P> <P> "Any and all actions taken by the Department of Insurance in the Coastal matter  will be taken to the court," said Gillespie, referring to the Coastal  bankruptcy case. "The matter is pending before the court and there will be no  statements from the department apart from those proceedings."  </P> <P> But Harry O. Miller, chief executive of the defunct company, said he had no  doubt there will be an inquiry.  </P> <P> "Basically, the Department of Insurance always conducts one (in such  bankruptcies), and I'm sure they will here," he said.  </P> <P> He has attributed the collapse of Coastal to mounting claims and an adverse  environment for the auto insurance business in Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> Those calling for an inquiry said they thought it should go beyond a cursory  exploration and provide a detailed public explanation of why Coastal failed.  </P> <P> On Monday, in an uncontested action, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dzintra  Janavs complied with a Gillespie request and ordered Coastal liquidated.  </P> <P> Citing the general policyholder surcharge to pay off Coastal claims, some  consumer representatives said Tuesday that the Insurance Department should be  required to explain why its regulatory oversight was unable to prevent  Coastal's failure.  </P> <P> Steven Miller, head of the Insurance Consumer Action Network, criticized  Gillespie for being unwilling to provide information thus far. Miller, no  relation to Harry Miller, said Gillespie has been referring everyone to the  documents filed by her department when it sought the liquidation order. But he  said he had perused the documents and they provided no details about what  caused the company to fail.  </P> <P> "It is incumbent on the insurance commissioner to go into this entire matter,"  said Westwood attorney Joseph Moreno, who said he represented a number of  clients in claims against Coastal that were not honored.  </P> <P> Moreno said Coastal had stopped paying its claims in December, several weeks  before Gillespie's Feb. 2 action placing the company into conservatorship.  </P> <P> Many of Coastal's own highest-paid salesmen were kept uninformed that the  company was in financial difficulty, said Donna Miccio, wife of Coastal  salesman John Miccio, who also urged an investigation. The Redondo Beach  housewife said her husband had come back from a week's vacation in February to  be told that he and 1,300 other employees were out of their jobs.  </P> <P> Going beyond calling for an inquiry was Harry Snyder, West Coast director of  the Consumers Union. He said a seizure of assets from Coastal managers should  precede any surcharge on policyholders.  </P> <P> "The rest of the state's policyholders should not pay one penny until all the  officers and shareholders of Coastal have been required to give up all their  gains," Snyder said. "This is another case where the executives leave a trail  of disaster to be picked up by the average citizen, while they continue with  their high-living ways."  </P> <P> He noted that Harry Miller, the chief executive of both Coastal and its parent  company, Advent Management, was responsible last year for giving or lending  more than $5 million to support an insurance initiative rejected by 87% of the  electorate. He questioned why there should be a policyholder surcharge to pay  off such losses.  </P> <P> Harry Miller declined comment on Snyder's points.  </P></p>

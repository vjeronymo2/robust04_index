			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Germany not ready for UN council seat CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl said yesterday Germany would not be in a position to accept a permanent seat on the UN Security Council if one were offered today, Reuter reports from Bonn. He said Bonn's post-war constitution for now barred Germany from shouldering an international role and sending troops on UN missions outside Nato territory. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told the General Assembly in September that Germany would not take the initiative, but would seek a permanent seat if a change in the council's composition was considered. The council now has five permanent members with the power of veto: the US, Russia, Britain, France and China. Mr Kohl's coalition wants German troops to be able to take part in UN peacekeeping missions and eventually fight alongside its allies on missions like the US-led Gulf war that drove Iraq out of Kuwait last year. But the opposition Social Democrats are denying him the two-thirds majority he needs to amend the constitution, written to contain German military might after the war. Mr Kohl said it was unacceptable that Germany had to withdraw the destroyer Hamburg from a UN-mandated force monitoring the embargo in the Adriatic after the Security Council decided ships sailing for Yugoslavia could be stopped and searched earlier this month.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (31): It's time for a Pep - but which one? - In giving personal equity plans a fillip, the chancellor has made the choice more difficult / The Experts' Panel THE TIME for personal equity plans (Peps) seems finally to have arrived. The chancellor's decision to raise the annual limit for investment in qualifying unit and investment trust Peps from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000, seemed, on initial figures to have opened the floodgates for pent-up demand. About 230,000 new unit trust Peps were opened in the first three weeks of this tax year alone, while net investment of Pounds 151m made it the best month for sales since Peps were introduced. All our experts made clear that this move has made Peps much more useful for the general investing public. However, their varied choices show that there can be serious problems choosing between unit and investment trusts. With 155 companies offering 1,414 unit trusts (at the end of April) investors can be excused for feeling confused. The case for Peps is clear: they allow investment in equities, traditionally good for long-term growth, free of either capital gains tax or income tax. But they do carry charges, which can eat into the tax advantages. It is possible to buy Peps with shares in a single company up to a maximum of Pounds 3,000, but these should be regarded as a distinct animal from a 'managed' Pep, and our experts have not considered them. Yet even in this restricted field, there is room for differences of opinion. Tony Shepherd, of Shepherd Associates, who is also chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, says: 'Selection must first depend on competitive performance and charges; but it is also important that it does not upset the balance of the investor's allocation of equity investments. Within his portfolio, the highest yielding investments should be placed in the Pep to maximise the income tax advantage. 'Unit trusts are competitive, with initial charges averaging 3 per cent if commission paid to a fee-charging intermediary is reinvested. On investment trusts, stockbroking commission, stamp duty and market spreads usually result in a higher initial charge. But investment trusts generally have lower annual management fees. 'Depending on the structure of the Pep, some may charge VAT, adding a further 0.9 per cent charge up front. A number of companies make additional annual charges of up to 1 per cent for the plan administration. 'Some investment trust plans make an initial charge of up to the equivalent of 1 per cent plus VAT (based on a Pounds 6,000 investment), in addition to the initial costs of the investment itself. Others charge between 3 and 5 per cent plus VAT (of which up to 3 per cent is commission for the adviser), but this may include the cost of buying shares which can be an additional 1 to 1.5 per cent plus VAT on top of the underlying management charge. 'The unit trust Peps of M&amp;G, James Capel, Schroder and Fidelity are free of additional charges, and each allow access to a range of funds likely to continue to perform well. Selection of investment trust Peps is more complex, but a new investor in equities - say, with no more than Pounds 1,500 to invest this year - could obtain a wide international spread at modest cost with Foreign and Colonial.' John Edwards, a former FT personal finance editor who now works as an adviser at Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, says: 'Recommending a Pep has become a lot easier since the last budget. Now it is just a question of selecting the right trust for your Pep. A few years ago, I considered investment trusts to be superior, and particularly favoured Dunedin and Touche Remnant. But with discounts narrowing as the result of a big influx of funds, I believe investment trusts have lost some of their competitive advantage. They are inherently more risky. Maybe charges are generally cheaper, but in the long run it is return on investment that counts. 'So my first choice would be a unit Pep from Perpetual. This medium-sized group has an excellent track record, winning quite a lot of awards over the past 10 years. Furthermore it is one of the few groups to tailor funds specifically for Pep investors. It has two special funds, the Growth Option or the High Income Option, and I particularly favour the High Income Option to avoid paying income tax. 'My other recommendations may seem a bit boring, and a bit surprising in view of their recent track records. They are Fidelity and M&amp;G. The performance of Fidelity funds read like a horror story in 1990, but it has subsequently taken some drastic action to pull its stock up. It had to do something. The group's decision to cut their initial charge from 5 to 2 per cent provides further evidence that it is determined to recover lost ground, and obviously makes it more attractive to investors. 'M&amp;G is somewhat similar. It, too, has suffered a rough time in recent years as a result of the underperformance of small company stocks in particular. But it is now doing a lot better in a rising market, and is well placed to take advantage of any recovery in the UK economy. Its Recovery fund has a superb long-time record, even though suffering some nasty blips in recent years.' Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, has a slight preference for investment trusts. He reasons as follows: 'A lot of people would invariably contribute to a Pep on a lump sum basis, but there is nonetheless a strong argument for drip-feeding contributions on a regular basis, and certainly the systematic savings would have innumerable advantages over any form of saving life assurance may offer. 'There remain two further important factors - performance, which is of overriding importance, and costs. 'There is no substitute for long-term consistent gains, particularly if you have the ability to select more than one fund within your Pep.' Mr Boyton's favoured four companies are set out below. He says they not only produce considerable income (where applicable) but have made consistent long-term gains for their investors. Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trusts, which have a Pounds 50 initial charge, and allow contributions from Pounds 100 up to Pounds 500. James Capel unit trusts, which charge 5.25 per cent initial and 1.5 per cent annual. They offer a selection of income, growth and tracker funds, with monthly contributions from Pounds 50 to Pounds 530.12. Stewart Ivory's New Saints Pep, which has an annual charge of Pounds 25, excluding VAT. He describes this as one of the lowest charging Peps  - monthly contributions are allowed from Pounds 150 to Pounds 500. Touche Remnant, which offers four investment trusts, of which TR City of London is the most popular. Charges are 5 per cent initially and 1.25 per cent annually. Angela Cooper, of Noble Lowndes, divides Peps into two categories: share-only Peps and unit trusts. Noble Lowndes operates a panel of 15 different providers for the two different forms of Pep, all of which are on the list for different reasons. These are the criteria she uses when selecting the most suitable Pep for a client: 'An individual's attitude towards risk, together with the purpose for investing in a Pep, will dictate the Pep providers which may be appropriate. The investment expertise of the Pep providers needs to be identified, so that those with consistently good performance are considered. 'It is then important to compare the charging structures, in particular the level of the initial charge and ongoing annual management charge. These cover the costs of setting up the plan, making the appropriate investments and managing the plan on an ongoing basis. General Peps usually allow for single or regular contributions, and sometimes a phased investment option is available. The latter is a system whereby a lump sum is paid to the selected Pep provider to 'drip' into the market over an agreed term. 'Some providers also have a facility for exchanging existing shareholdings for holdings within the Pep, for which there may be a charge. Some Peps will allow for a regular tax free income to be taken or permit partial encashment providing that a certain minimum level still remains invested. If an individual becomes dissatisfied with the investment performance of their Pep provider, then it is possible to transfer the funds to an alternative provider but a charge will usually be made.'</p>

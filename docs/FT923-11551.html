			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / People: Jones to find business for Swedish market Lynton Jones, the former diplomat who founded the London outpost of Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter market, is on the move again. He has been appointed chief executive of OM London, the UK arm of Sweden's fast-growing electronic options and futures exchange. Olof Stenhammar, who founded OM seven years ago on his return from Chicago's trading pits, is keen to increase the amount of international business done through OM London which, along with OM Stockholm, operates as an exchange and clearing operation. The London operation has been hard hit by the recent abolition of Swedish turnover taxes which meant that roughly 40 per cent of OM London's volume has moved back to Sweden. Jones, 47, who was head of public affairs at the London Stock Exchange before he joined Nasdaq, has been given the job of finding new business. OM London, which has a staff of over 20, lists options and futures contracts on Swedish stocks as well as the Swedish OMX stock market index. A separate clearing service is offered for interbank trading in interest rate futures and in options and futures on the LDCx-index. However, Jones' appointment suggests that OM is keen to broaden its base. There is nothing, for instance, to stop it launching new products which will compete with those on more established exchanges. As a private sector operation - OM's shares are quoted on the Swedish stock exchange - OM is able to make decisions about new products far more quickly than some of its more bureaucratic competitors. However, it is coming close to outgrowing its Swedish domestic market and needs to develop new areas of business if it is to sustain its growth. In his last annual report Stenhammar says that OM's international operations are 'naturally not without risks' but notes that, 'if we succeed, we can create something really big'.</p>

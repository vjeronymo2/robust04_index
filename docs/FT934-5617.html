			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Risk &amp; Reward: Distinction between hedges and futures becomes blurred As the distinction between hedge funds and futures funds becomes increasingly blurred, the most successful funds are likely to be those which combine features of both types of investment vehicle. 'It's getting harder and harder to pigeonhole funds under distinct categories such as hedge funds or futures funds,' says Ms Nicola Meaden, managing director of Tass Management, which tracks futures funds. Hedge funds, which combine cash and derivative instruments, lie somewhere in the middle of a continuum between low-leverage, traditional bonds-and-stocks funds and high-leverage derivatives-only futures funds. Essentially, a hedge fund buys liquid assets - mostly equities, but also bonds, currencies and commodities - and hedges them against adverse market movements by selling derivatives against them. Hedge funds can use complex, speculative trading methods to maximise returns, including using leveraged funds - money borrowed against the value of assets - and hedging techniques, such as short-selling. Futures funds invest mostly in futures and options in about 60 to 70 product markets internationally. They are mainly financial derivatives such as interest-rate or bond futures, but can include liquid commodities contracts. Futures funds tend to be run by pools of fund managers whose investment decisions are often based on complex quantitative computer models. Both types of fund can exploit different market conditions with great flexibility. 'The beauty is it's irrelevant what happens as we can go long or short in any market,' says Mr Gerald Bichunsky, a director at Momentum UK, specialists in active management styles for hedge and futures fund managers. One example of a classic hedge strategy involves buying some Japanese stocks and selling the Nikkei stock index. This has proved to be a successful strategy amid the Nikkei's recent slide. Most importantly, both types of funds share what Mr Bichunsky calls active investment styles. 'People are looking less at asset class and are increasingly focusing on investment style.' While a passive investor might simply seek to track a bond or stock index, an active fund manager will aim to aggressively outperform his benchmark. Thus, the more active the management style, the more powerful the risk-reward profile will be. However, an important difference remains in the range of instruments in which either fund can invest, with hedge funds able to spread themselves more broadly across cash and derivatives markets and use a more diverse set of strategies and styles. 'Good futures fund managers will move increasingly into cash,' leaving less of a distinction between the two types of fund, says a fund manager at a large London-based hedge fund. While some futures funds put on stunning performances this year, they have been outperformed by hedge funds over the long run. 'Thanks to the flexibility of their instruments, the number of long-term consistently successful hedge fund managers is higher than the number of consistently successful futures fund managers,' says Momentum's Mr Bichunsky. This year's bull run in global stock and bond markets has helped lift hedge funds' performance, and some say these funds may find it harder to make money in cash markets when the rallies ebb. 'We've had a terrific rally in stocks and bonds, but as a hedge fund, what do you do next year?' asks Mr Peter Swete, chairman of Sabre Fund Management.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: ARMS CONTROL  </P> <P> Judd Nelson stars as Marty Malt, a man with something extra -- an arm growing  out of his back -- when the dark comedy "The Dark Backward" shoots later this  year.  </P> <P> "The arm is going to be realistic -- almost like another character, like the  tail on the lion in 'The Wizard of Oz,' " promises co-producer Randy Turrow,  adding that special effects are already underway.  </P> <P> To be directed by scripter Adam Rifkin, the "around $2 million" picture  explores what happens when Marty -- a garbage man -- realizes his dream to be a  comedian. That weird third arm is his ticket to success, but when it suddenly  disappears. . . .  </P> <P> Turrow promises "some surprising cameos" -- possibly some of Nelson's buddies,  with whom Rifkin teamed in his "Never on Tuesday." Not yet released in this  country, it co-stars Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Nicolas Cage and Cary  Elwes. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / NatWest rules out general pay increase NATIONAL Westminster Bank, one of the largest white collar employers in Britain, yesterday signalled a tough 1993 pay round by telling its 80,000 staff that it could not afford to offer an across-the-board pay rise. NatWest, which is among the most influential setters of pay trends in the UK labour market, said staff would only receive performance-related pay rises. These will vary between 3 per cent and 6 per cent for most staff, with a minority getting no rise. The NatWest offer is the first in the banking pay round and may be followed by other low offers from high street banks, which are trying to restrain costs. Barclays Bank, which could declare a loss for 1992 in March, meets unions next week. The pay offer, which was strongly criticised by unions, indicates that signs of recovery in the economy are unlikely to be reflected in higher pay rises in the spring pay round. NatWest's pay settlement date is in April. Further signs of pressures on pay emerged in a telephone survey conducted by the Financial Times yesterday, which found that more than 20,000 employees of recession-hit construction companies have had earnings frozen. Mr Mike Goodswen, NatWest's director of human resources, said the bank had decided not to make an across-the-board pay increase because of internal cost pressures and because the state of the labour market did not require it. He said the move did not constitute a pay freeze, as some union leaders yesterday described it. 'That is part of the old mentality,' he said. He estimated that NatWest's pay bill would rise by at least 3 per cent. The bank said it would compensate for the lack of a general increase by raising performance-related pay increments by between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent. Increments for non-managers are split into three bands: satisfactory, good and outstanding. Staff who are judged satisfactory and are not at the top of pay bands will receive between 4.5 and 6 per cent, as opposed to between 4 and 5 per cent. Those graded outstanding may receive up to 7.5 per cent. The NatWest Staff Association, which represents about half the bank's staff, said employees were not being rewarded for their contribution to expected increased profits in this financial year. Mr Dai Davies, NWSA assistant general secretary, said staff faced 'continual pressures to achieve sales in the face of severe customer criticism' as well as the fear of compulsory redundancy and the erosion of fringe benefits. Mr Alan Ainsworth, chief negotiator for the Bifu financial services union, said the bank's 'arrogant disregard for staff feelings' was unbelievable. He said about 5,500 jobs had been cut in NatWest last year with more likely. The number of UK pay freezes has been rising recently. The Engineering Employers Federation estimates 13 per cent of settlements in engineering involve wage freezes. The Confederation of British Industry revealed one manufacturing group in three had introduced a freeze since the beginning of the bargaining period last August. The most prominent freezes include: A six-month wage freeze for Rover Group employees from November as part of a two-year pay deal which includes a 3.6 per cent rise this May and 3.6 per cent from November. A freeze on basic rates for manual workers at Calor Gas, the gas production, distribution and retailing company. A 12-month freeze for all 3,500 employees at Swan Hunter shipyard followed by an inflation-linked pay rise. Construction pay freeze, Page 5</p>

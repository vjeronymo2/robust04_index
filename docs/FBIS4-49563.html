			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The Bank of China (BOC)  announced here today that private savings in foreign exchange in  the bank exceeded 10 billion U.S. dollars by the end of April  this year.    The figure is a net increase of four billion U.S. dollars  over the end of 1992, when the total personal foreign exchange  deposits in the bank totaled 6.09 billion U.S. dollars.    According to BOC spokesman Zhu Chi, the increase in private  hard currency savings has averaged 250 million U.S. dollars per  month since 1993, compared with an annual growth of one billion  U.S. dollars between 1990 and 1991, and 1.4 billion U.S. dollars  in 1992.    Zhu attributed the eye-catching growth to the increased  entry  and exit of citizens resulting from the country's expanded  policy of opening to the outside world.    Remittances from residents' overseas relatives constitute  another rich source of foreign money held by those residents on  the mainland.    However, Zhu noted, the BOC's deposit policies play a  positive role in attracting hard currency savings.    When the bank began to accept personal deposits in 1984,  depositors could not withdraw their money at will. The  restriction was removed in 1985, and a 100-percent increase in  deposits was witnessed the following year.    To encourage personal savings, the bank grants preferential  rates for big sums and long-term foreign exchange deposits.    As a state bank specializing in foreign currency and foreign  trade, the BOC now sets the deposit interest rates on behalf of  the People's Bank of China, the central bank. The interest  rates closely follow the rates on the international financial  market.    With the recent rise in the interest rates on the U.S.  dollar  in world capital markets, the bank has raised the rates  accordingly eight times in a row since the start of 1994.    At a result, the one-year deposit interest rate for U.S.  dollars now stands at 4.3125 percent, as compared with 2.75  percent at the end of last year.</p>

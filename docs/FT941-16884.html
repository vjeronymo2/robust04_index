			<p>940107 FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): In touch by fax while on the move Sending a fax message or receiving electronic mail while outside the office may be simplified by the EO 440, a portable tablet measuring only 10in by 7in. The tablet stores outgoing messages until the machine is plugged into a mobile phone or standard phone socket, when the messages are sent. Incoming messages are held centrally by AT&amp;T's Easylink electronic mail service until the machine is plugged into the telephone network, when they are delivered. The EO 440, which is sold in the UK by Olivetti, has a display which recognises hand-writing and a stylus so that messages or faxes can be written or annotated. The tablet can also run standard software packages. Olivetti: UK, 081 785 6666.</p>

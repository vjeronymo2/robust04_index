			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREPPING FOR L.A.'S PODIUM;  </P> <P> FINE-TUNING THE PHILHARMONIC FOR SALONEN'S '92 TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Although it has been only 18 months since Andre Previn abruptly resigned as  music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, an orchestra for 1992 --  Esa-Pekka Salonen's orchestra -- is already taking shape.  </P> <P> Some of the signs of change are overt, as in the announcement of a whole new  performing-recording unit, the reaching of agreement between management and  players on a new contract which will place the Philharmonic at the fore of U.S.  orchestras in size and salary, and trends in programming.  </P> <P> Other changes are more subtle. Heiichiro Ohyama's name has quietly disappeared  from the masthead as assistant conductor (his contract was not renewed).  Meanwhile, Previn's other assistant, David Alan Miller, has been promoted to  associate conductor (his contract is for two years), leaving Salonen a clean  slate for an assistant of his own choice when his term as music director begins  in 1992.  </P> <P> Stephen Stucky's period as composer-in-residence also ends with this season,  and there are strong indications from within the Philharmonic that another  change in the artistic leadership will be announced shortly.  </P> <P> The Philharmonic began the season by launching the Carnegie Hall centennial  celebrations in New York. The home season then opened with three weeks of  Previn programs -- with associate conductor David Alan Miller replacing Previn  on the podium last week -- which offer some suggestive contrasts with the  Salonen program on tap tonight, including a new piece that was first considered  in Previn's term but only became a firm commitment under Salonen.  </P> <P> "I like combining things that can be contrasting or surprising. There will be  some fairly wild combinations in my first season. I believe in combining old  and new works -- I'm not a great believer in barriers between eras and styles."  </P> <P> In that regard, Salonen actually considers the program tonight, surrounding  some early Sibelius and a new Finnish piece with standards of French  Impressionism, to be fairly conservative. The tie that binds is in fact Kaija  Saariaho's new work, "Du Cristal."  </P> <P> "It is kind of in between, a link from the Impressionists to Sibelius," Salonen  says. "It is a colorist piece, but it's not really neo-anything."  </P> <P> "The piece was originally commissioned by the Helsinki Festival," said  Saariaho. "I came to discuss it with my publishers, who wanted to get me a  big-figure fee, so they suggested a joint commission to Mr. Previn and Mr.  (Ernest) Fleischmann (Philharmonic managing director)."  </P> <P> The Philharmonic expressed interest in the work, which was given its world  premiere by Salonen on Sept. 5, at the Helsinki Festival. But "the problem was  always: Who would conduct? It was quite obvious that it ("Du Cristal") was not  Previn repertory," Saariaho said.  </P> <P> That problem was readily resolved by the advent of Salonen, a longtime  acquaintance of the 38-year-old composer.  </P> <P> "Du Cristal" is Saariaho's first piece for large orchestra. She works slowly,  and on only one piece at a time. "It ("Du Cristal") has been in my mind for a  long time," the composer said. "The piece must exist in my mind before I can  write it."  </P> <P> Although Saariaho is deeply interested in using computers and electronics in  music, "Du Cristal" only employs a single synthesizer in the orchestra. It has  a partner piece, "A la Fumee," which will feature the amplified and  electronically processed sounds of cello and alto flute soloists.  </P> <P> In both cases the titles, "From Crystal . . . Into Smoke," suggest "the  different ways a material can exist, such as water becoming steam," according  to the composer. This follows her interest in the possibilities of musical  transformations, which suffuse "Du Cristal."  </P> <P> The piece also features some innovative string techniques, involving trills  between normal notes and harmonics, and bow pressure, and Saariaho is attending  rehearsals to ensure that those demands are understood. She is also listening  carefully to balances, because "all the time there are three layers of things  going on."  </P> <P> Salonen, however, said we will not be awash in Finnish music during his tenure.  "I don't see my role in L.A. as an ambassador for Scandinavian music. Of  course, I will program music that I know, by composers I know, but the emphasis  is going to be on American music, because I see that as a basic  responsibility."  </P> <P> The Philharmonic has already forged a respectable reputation for programming  American music under Previn, as represented by the program last week, featuring  Stucky's "Angelus" and William Schuman's Third Symphony, both works that Previn  and the orchestra offered to Carnegie Hall audiences in September.  </P> <P> The repertory which Salonen believes should be strengthened in the Philharmonic  programming may be a surprise, though not to those who have studied his  Philharmonic agendas since his debut with the orchestra in 1984.  </P> <P> "I think there are certain areas which I would like to emphasize more -- Haydn,  Mozart, all the Classical composers," Salonen, 34, said. "I don't believe in  the total reconstruction of a style. Our brain is different, we hear things  differently, so I'm not deeply worried about (period) instruments."  </P> <P> The organization behind Salonen's vision for the orchestra seems healthier than  ever. Compared to the major Eastern orchestras, the Philharmonic has a  relatively small endowment, and relies instead on revenue from Hollywood Bowl,  something explicit in the formation of the new Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.  </P> <P> Under Fleischmann, the Philharmonic has parlayed the Hollywood Bowl into a  major asset, keeping a budget now approaching $30 million firmly in the black.  This financial muscle is reflected in the new musicians' contract, which has  been approved by the orchestra players, though official signing is still a few  weeks away, according to trumpeter Boyde Hood, chairman of the Orchestra  Committee.  </P> <P> The three-year contract provides for a total 18% increase, bringing the base  weekly wage to $1,240 for the 1992-93 season. If other orchestras do not boost  their scale in the interim, that will leave the Philharmonic in a virtual tie  with the Philadelphia Orchestra as the highest paid in the country. With  provisions for four additional string players, it will also make the  Philharmonic the largest orchestra in the nation.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a validating process," Hood says, "and a vote of confidence from  the (Philharmonic) Assn., that they think we are one of the top orchestras in  the country."  </P> <P> The Philharmonic that Esa-Pekka Salonen will lead into the planned Disney Hall  is clearly an empire in the making -- two orchestras now, the Philharmonic  Chamber Music Society (six concerts at Gindi Auditorium), the Green Umbrella  new music concerts (seven concerts at the Japan America Theatre) -- embodying  much of the "community of musicians" concept espoused by Fleischmann two years  ago. As such, it may become a model for the orchestras of the new century.  </P></p>

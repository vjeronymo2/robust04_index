			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 HURT IN ACID SPILL AT COCA-COLA PLANT  </P> <P> More than 1,200 gallons of phosphoric acid gushed out of a valve Tuesday at a  Coca-Cola USA bottling plant east of downtown Los Angeles, injuring three  workers who inhaled the potentially toxic fumes, authorities said.  </P> <P> The spill occurred shortly before 1 p.m. when a worker left the valve open on  one of two tanks used for mixing chemicals, Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells  said.  </P> <P> Fifty workers were evacuated and 12 were examined by paramedics. Two women and  a man, who complained of chest pains or respiratory problems, were treated at  White Memorial Medical Center. Nine others were to undergo further examinations  by a doctor at the company's clinic, Wells said.  </P> <P> At full strength, phosphoric acid can burn skin and eyes and is harmful if  inhaled, but the spilled acid was partly diluted and therefore the hazard was  reduced, authorities said.  </P> <P> The plant borders the Los Angeles River, but there were no reports that the  acid had entered the flood control channel. Most of the spill ended up in the  sewer system, Wells said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICS / UNOPPOSED CANDIDATES;  </P> <P> MANY IN CONGRESS LACK CHALLENGE;  </P> <P> THE NUMBER OF UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS IS GROWING. THE BELIEF IS THAT SEATED  LAWMAKERS ARE UNBEATABLE.  </P> <P> From coast to coast, congressional elections are increasingly becoming a game  of solitaire.  </P> <P> Already, 75 U.S. representatives are guaranteed no major party opposition in  this fall's election. By the time filing deadlines in all the states close,  that number could reach into the mid-80s, up from 47 a decade ago. Likewise,  four senators have drawn no major party challenger.  </P> <P> VOTERS STYMIED: In a year when disenchantment over the savings and loan scandal  and deadlock over the budget have produced glimmers of resentment against  incumbents, that means voters will have no chance to register their feelings  for perhaps nearly one-fifth of the House members and about one-eighth of the  senators on the ballot this year.  </P> <P> "There are very, very few challengers, and yet the atmosphere is such that you  can take some of these guys out," lamented Charles E. Cook, the publisher of a  political newsletter in Washington. "As a result, what could be an  anti-incumbent year is likely to be so only in isolated circumstances."  </P> <P> Like the boll weevil, uncontested races once were a uniquely Southern blight,  as Republicans routinely chose the better part of valor against entrenched  Democratic incumbents. But the pattern has spread. Eight of New York's  representatives are unopposed in the general election. So are five of 11 in  Massachusetts, six in Pennsylvania, five in Illinois, three in Wisconsin and  two each in California and New Jersey.  </P> <P> Free passes are still a mainstay of Southern politics -- but now on a  bipartisan basis.  </P> <P> In Virginia, for example, Republicans failed to find challengers for any of the  five Democratic House members seeking reelection. But the Democrats could not  produce a candidate to oppose Republican Sen. John W. Warner. Republicans found  no one willing to step up against powerful Democratic Sens. Sam Nunn in Georgia  and David Pryor in Arkansas; but Democrats were unable to recruit an opponent  for Republican Sen. Thad Cochran in Mississippi -- a state that did not elect  its first Republican senator in this century until 1978.  </P> <P> In both Texas and Florida, five Republican representatives are running  unopposed -- as are 10 Democrats in the two states.  </P> <P> WHY IT'S HAPPENING: Experts cite several reasons for the growing number of  races without even token opposition:  </P> <P> The conventional wisdom that it is virtually impossible to unseat an unindicted  incumbent with a steady pulse. "These people are being told . . . you cannot  win, so they don't run," Cook said. "This all becomes terribly  self-fulfilling."  </P> <P> The high cost of campaigning. In Virginia, former Rep. Joseph L. Fisher  seriously considered running against Warner but backed away when he decided he  could not raise enough money to topple an incumbent. "I doubted I could get  enough money together to have a good chance," he said.  </P> <P> The imminence of congressional redistricting. "You are seeing a lot of  (potential) challengers say 1990 is not the best year to run," said Howard  Schloss, communications director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign  Committee. "People don't want to run in a district that is going to disappear  in two years."  </P> <P> The expectation that a large number of incumbents may step down in 1992, the  last year, under campaign reform laws, in which retiring members with enough  seniority may convert to personal use any campaign surpluses they have  accumulated.  </P> <P> The growing tendency of local party leaders to discourage challengers from  stirring secure incumbents who, if faced with opposition, might unleash media  and field operations that could benefit all the candidates on their ticket.  </P> <P> LARGER IMPLICATIONS: Many analysts consider the rise in uncontested races only  the most tangible symbol of a larger problem: the stunning decline in  competitive congressional races. In the last election, not only were 98.5% of  all House members reelected, but more than 88% of them were sent back to  Washington with over 60% of the vote.  </P> <P> This year, analysts estimate that as few as two dozen House members could face  serious competition. "It's bizarre," said Thomas E. Mann, director of  government studies at the Brookings Institution. "The fact is every state in  the union ought to be competitive."  </P></p>

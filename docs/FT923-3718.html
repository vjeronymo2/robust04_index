			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading CURRENCY worries continued to dominate trading in the derivates market, making for a volatile session in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. An early squeeze in the September contract on the FT-SE Index, after opening at 2,326, sent it climbing to 2,347 by 9.30am. September then drifted lower to trade between 2,323 and 2,343 as dealers focused on the latest developments in Scandinavian currencies. As a result of weakness in other European markets, and a spate of disappointing corporate results, September continued to drift, although early firmness on Wall Street helped the future claw back some of the decline. The contract traded at a premium to cash for most of the session. It eventually stood at 2,336, down 3 points from Tuesday's close and 11 ahead of the underlying cash market. Turnover of 10,775 lots for the September future was reasonable, as was volume in the December contract, which came to 4,000 contracts. Traded options volume remained dull but was above Tuesday's poor level. A total of 26,112 lots were traded, of which the FT-SE 100 option accounted for 9,951 and the Euro FT-SE option 2,342. British Aerospace, on 1,430 lots, was the busiest stock option.</p>

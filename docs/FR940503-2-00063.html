			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> March 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Cyrus Nasseri, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Assistant Secretary, Conservation, and Renewable Energy, United States Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Dear Mr. Nasseri: This is a petition for waiver and application for interim waiver submitted pursuant to title 10 CFR 430.27. Waiver is requested from the furnace test procedure as prescribed in appendix N to Subpart B of Part 430. The test procedure requires a 1.5 minute delay between burner and blower start-up. Rheem is requesting authorization to use a 20 second delay instead of 1.5 minutes for our series (^)GDG upflow, (^)GLH downflow, (^)GVH horizontal, and (^)GPH upflow/horizontal residential gas-fired furnaces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rheem will be manufacturing these appliances with an electronic device that controls the blower operation on a timing sequence as opposed to temperature. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Improved energy efficiency is achieved by reducing on cycle losses. Under the Appendix N procedures, the stack temperature is allowed to climb at a faster rate than it would with a 20 second blower on time, allowing energy to be lost out of the vent system. This waste of energy would not occur in actual operation. If this petition is granted, the true blower on time delay would be used in the calculations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current test procedures do not give Rheem credit for the energy savings which averages approximately 2%. This improvement is an average reduction of 20% of the normal on cycle energy losses. Rheem is of the opinion that a 20% reduction is a worthwhile energy savings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rheem has been granted previous waivers regarding blower on time to be used in the efficiency calculations for our (^)GEB and (^)GKA series condensing furnaces and/or (^)GDE, (^)GLE, (^)GDG, (^)GLG and (^)GVG series furnaces. Several other manufacturers of gas furnaces have also been granted a waiver to permit calculations based on timed blower operation. Also, ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;1993, paragraph 9.5.1.2.2 specifically addresses the use of timed blower operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Confidential and comparative test data is available to you upon your request, confirming the above energy savings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers that domestically market similar products are being sent a copy of this petition for waiver and petition for interim waiver. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> &blank;&blank;&blank;Sincerely, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Daniel J.

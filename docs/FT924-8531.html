			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden 4: Aviation free-for-all - Christopher Brown-Humes on change in the air WHEN IT comes to airline deregulation, the Swedes do not do things by halves. Within the space of a few months a highly protected domestic market, which gave Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) a virtual monopoly, has given way to an environment characterised by increasingly fierce competition. 'Sweden is now the most deregulated and open market for civil aviation in Europe,' says Mr Mats Odell, minister of transport and communication. Liberalisation formally took effect on July 1 and Mr Odell takes satisfaction from the results it has already produced. There were those who thought SAS had such a strong position that opening the market up would have only a limited impact. 'We have proved the sceptics wrong,' he says. There has certainly been no shortage of companies applying for, and getting, concessions to operate on domestic routes in direct competition with SAS. Transwede, Malmo Aviation, Golden Air and Avia are among the companies now posing a direct challenge to the Scandinavian national carrier and its majority-owned subsidiary, Linjeflyg. The presence of the newcomers has already made itself felt on pricing. Fares have come down by 10 to 40 per cent. 'Even the threat of competition has reduced prices on routes where competition is still not a reality,' says Mr Odell. For instance, on the Stockholm-Malmo route which Transwede and Malmo Aviation operate in competition with SAS, the economy return fare has been cut from SKr1,000 to SKr700 since the competition emerged. One of the keys to the deregulation success, Mr Odell believes, has been the re-opening of Bromma, Stockholm's city airport, which has given the new companies access to peak-time slots which they might otherwise not have had. This airport can handle much smaller aircraft than the main Stockholm airport at Arlanda used by SAS. In addition, SAS has been prevented from using Bromma as a centre for its intra-Nordic traffic. One of the dangers of the deregulation process, though, is that remote communities in the north of the country will lose their air services because they are no longer viable. Mr Odell is determined that this will not happen and promises that in the last resort the state will ensure these vital services continue. SAS purports not to be worried by the arrival of rival carriers, although it admits that the competition has been fierce. 'When the domestic market was opened up we expected our share of the domestic market to fall to 70 per cent from 97 per cent,' says Mr Lennart Svantemark, SAS vice-president of foreign affairs. It is not down to the 70 per cent level yet, but it is already less than 90 per cent. There is a broader European context to the changes in the domestic market, because the government is anxious to ensure there are slim pickings for foreign carriers, as and when they are permitted access to the Swedish market. Liberalisation of the EC airline market takes another big step forward in 1993, with an immediate impact on SAS's operations out of Denmark. But it will not be long before foreign carriers get the chance to fly between two points in Sweden as an extension of existing services. SAS does not expect to lose market share as a result of European deregulation, but it does foresee increased pressure on pricing. It points out that it is already used to competition from other national carriers, such as Lufthansa and British Airways, to and from the Scandinavian market. Nevertheless, the carrier has no doubt that it needs both size and efficiency to compete in the new, more competitive conditions. That is why, on the one hand, it is pursuing ever closer ties with Swissair and Austrian Airlines, through the so-called European Quality Alliance (EQA). Many believe that this will eventually end in a full-blown merger with one or both airlines. On the other hand, it has launched a determined efficiency drive, which has reduced costs by 20 per cent over the last two years with the loss of 3,500 jobs. There is a further plan to increase efficiency by 8 per cent a year over the next three years. The evidence suggests the group is managing to survive the dual challenges of deregulation and recession. It returned to profit in the first six months of this year, turning round 1991's first half SKr1.02bn loss into a SKr502m profit. Whether all the smaller airlines now operating within the Swedish market survive is another matter.</p>

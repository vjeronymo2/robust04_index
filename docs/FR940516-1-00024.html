			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the current provision requiring the description of carrying broker or introducing arrangements benefitting the CPO or CTA and their principals has been revised to make clear that payments for order flow and soft dollar arrangements must be included. Payment for order flow is a practice whereby FCMs and IBs compensate CPOs and CTAs for directing customers to them. Soft dollar arrangements consist of arrangements whereby customer or pool funds are used to pay for research or other services that benefit the CPO or CTA. Both practices have been of concern to regulators because, among other things, they are often inadequately disclosed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, e.g., SEC Release No. 34&hyph;33026, 58 FR 52934 (October 6, 1993) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Market 2000, An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments: Study V, Best Execution <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (Division of Market Regulation, SEC, January 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Separately, under proposed Rule 4.24(k) (``Related Party Transactions''), any material transactions or arrangements for which there is no publicly disseminated price between the pool and any person affiliated with a person providing services to the pool, would be required to be disclosed, including the costs of such transactions to the pool. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 67 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission believes that this type of disclosure may be viewed as already required in many cases under the general requirement that material information be disclosed. However, given the increasing use of over-the-counter transactions in which pools contract with the pool operator or an affiliate of the pool operator, an express requirement for such disclosure appears warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 67 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this requirement is illustrated by the events preceding the demise of Stotler Funds, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stotler Group, Inc. (``Stotler Group''), a registered FCM. See Complaint,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> CFTC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> v <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Stotler Funds, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Civil Action No. 90 C 4387 (N.D. III., July 31, 1990). The defendant, Stotler Funds, Inc., was the general partner and CPO of, among other pools, Compass Futures Fund (``Compass'') and Advanced Portfolio Management, Limited Partnership (``Advanced''). The Commission's complaint included allegations that in December 1989, Compass used pool funds in the amount of approximately $4,550,000 (about 80% of its assets) to purchase commercial paper issued by Stotler Group and that Advanced used pool funds in the amount of approximately $1 million (about 10% of its assets) to make a loan to Stotler Group. The disclosure documents of Compass and Advanced did not disclose such uses of pool funds. The limited partnership agreement for Compass specifically precluded the use of pool funds to make loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Litigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current Rule 4.21(a)(13) requires disclosure of any material administrative, civil or criminal action within the five years preceding the date of the disclosure document against the CPO, CTA(s), FCM, IB and their principals. Like the current rule, proposed Rule 4.24(1) would require the disclosure of administrative, civil or criminal actions against certain persons involved in operating or trading the pool during the five years preceding the date of the disclosure document. However, this requirement would be substantially simplified. Concluded actions that resulted in an adjudication on the merits in favor of such persons would not be required to be disclosed. In addition, disclosure of the litigation background of FCMs and IBs would be limited as follows. First, with respect to litigation brought by private parties, the proposed rule would provide for the materiality of the action to be determined by reference to the potential financial impact upon the FCM or IB. Specifically, an action would be considered material if it would be required to be disclosed in the notes to the registrant's financial statements prepared pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP''). Generally, under GAAP, certain information regarding litigation must be disclosed if the potential of a financial loss from the litigation is either probable ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , likely to occur) or reasonably possible (more than remote but less than likely). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except for events occurring subsequent to the issuance of the latest certified financial statements, under this paragraph, litigation required to be disclosed would already have been disclosed in the FCM's or IB's latest certified financial statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See FASB&hyph;5 (Accounting for Contingencies) relating to disclosure of contingencies, including litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, the requirement to disclose actions brought by the Commission and other regulatory agencies against FCMs and IBs would be streamlined. Actions brought by the Commission would be treated differently from those brought by other regulatory agencies due to the presumptively greater significance of such actions to an investment decision. All actions brought by the Commission would be considered material other than concluded actions which did not result in fines exceeding $50,000 and did not involve allegations of fraud or other willful misconduct. Actions brought by any other federal or state agency or by a self-regulatory organization, whether domestic or foreign, would be considered material if they involved allegations of fraud or other willful misconduct. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 69 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 69 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Litigation disclosures in CTA disclosure documents with respect to FCMs and IBs would be simplified in similar fashion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

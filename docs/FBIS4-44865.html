			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroaki Suzuki] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Last year, the various manufacturers of application specific  integrated circuits (ASICs) took turns announcing complementary  metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) gate arrays with 0.5m  feature sizes that employ the latest in MOS technology. These  gate arrays conformed to past technical trends, and compared to  the previous generation of gate array series, featured overall  enhanced performance, faster signal propagation delay times per  standard gate of roughly 200-250ps, and packed between  300,000-500,000 gates on a single chip.    While achieving this kind of high performance, these  0.5m  gate arrays also reduced their supply voltage from the standard  5V to 3.3V, making them advantageous from the aspects of power  consumption and operating noise. However, most applications of  CMOS gate arrays are still 5V systems, and what is needed is  technology that can be used in systems with dual 5V/3V power  sources. And while the operating speeds of the logic gates in  these gate arrays have been enhanced remarkably, inter-chip  signal transmission speeds have not kept pace, and this  unbalance has begun to make itself conspicuous. Premised on this  unbalance, double clock technology is becoming prevalent in  state-of-the-art microprocessors, and new technologies are in  the process of being developed for gate arrays as well.    This report focuses primarily on the move toward 3.3V supply  voltage that is accompanying the introduction of 0.5m CMOS  gate arrays, and the high-speed inter-chip signal transmission  technology for multiple chips that has recently begun to be  supported by gate arrays.  <H5>  Switch From 5V to 3.3V Power Sources </H5>   The switch to 3.3V power sources for 0.5m CMOS gate  arrays  is highlighted by the fact that most of the leading-edge CISC  and RISC processors announced between last year and this year  were built for 3.3V power supplies. However, as will be  understood from studying the CMOS gate array specifications  listed in Table 1 and the trend toward higher speed illustrated  in Figure 1, the main reason for the switch to 3.3V technology  lies in the fact that, in order to maintain the trend toward  faster operating speeds in 0.5m generation devices as well,  these devices employ MOS transistors with high drive  capabilities, with 0.5m gate lengths and extremely thin gate  oxide films of plus or minus 100 Angstroms that are simply not  built for 5V of power. Because 0.5m transistors are  optimized  for 3.3V power supplies, even though their gate voltage has been  reduced from 5V to 3.3V, they possess equal or better drive  capabilities than previous generation transistors, and are  approximately 20% faster than previous generation devices.

Trends in Number of Gates and Operating Speeds </FIG>    Another big reason for reducing supply voltage has to do  with  measures aimed at power consumption. It is well known that the  power consumption of large-scale integration (LSI) CMOS devices  comprised of complementary circuits is not a major problem since  there are no direct current paths and quiescent power  dissipation is practically zero. But even the power consumption  of CMOS circuits, when operated at ultra-high speeds, increases  on a par with bipolar circuits. The power consumed during  operation is the switching-generated charging current of the  parasitic capacity attached to the output node of the gate  circuit, and is proportional to the average operating frequency,  as well as to the scale of the gate corresponding to the  parasitic capacity value. Although scaling down feature sizes  reduces the average parasitic capacity value per gate, the  effect of increasing the number of gates more than offsets this,  the upper limits of operating frequency also rise, and most  high-end applications suitable for 0.5m devices will  continue  to use 5V, increasing power consumption significantly. This will  make it impossible to use the now popular inexpensive plastic  flat package (PFP), requiring instead the use of extremely  expensive ceramic packages with low thermal resistance values  and/or the construction of heat sinks, resulting in higher  priced LSIs. Charging current power consumption is generally  proportional to fcv[.sup]2[/] and the supply  voltage multiplied by two. Designing devices capable of  operating on 3.3V of power will reduce power consumption by  roughly 1/2, enable inexpensive packaging to be used for most  applications just like before, and will support the trend toward  lower costs.  <H5>  Dual 3V/5V Technology </H5>   Gate arrays with 0.5m dimensions are being designed to  operate on 3.3V of power, and 3.3V microprocessors, memory  devices and other products are in the process of being shipped.  However, hardly any of the general-purpose periphery LSIs are  being adapted for 3.3V operation, and the standard for buses  that run inside personal computers (PCs) is still 5V. This turn  of events will lead to a situation where 3V and 5V circuit  components will have to co-exist inside a single system,  requiring that these systems incorporate interfaces to serve as  bridges between the two types of power sources. However, since  microprocessors and other general-purpose LSIs are not being  designed to handle dual power sources, in the end, this role  will fall to the custom-built LSI ASICs.    However, as pointed out above, 0.5m MOS transistors are  not constructed to withstand 5V of power, meaning that 5V/3.3V  conversion will be difficult to achieve in 0.5m gate arrays.  Some sort of circuitry solution will be required instead. Figure  2 illustrates a 0.5m CMOS circuit capable of handling a 5V  amplitude input signal. In this circuit, inserting the n-channel  transistor serially into the input cuts off the high voltage so  that not more than 3.3V is applied to the inverter circuit  n-channel transistor, which has a 0V substrate bias. The in-line  n-channel transistor gate has a bias of 3.3V, and this circuit  is constructed so that not more than 3.3V of bias is applied to  any gate regardless of changes in input from 0V to 5V.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-02B>      Figure 2. 5V Input Buffer </FIG>    There is no simple means of dealing with a 3V-to-5V output  if, say, a through-current is not permitted in a 5V LSI input  circuit, or if a CMOS level is required as a result of noise  margin problems. Conversely, if a 5V LSI requires a  transistor-transistor logic (TTL) level (0.8-2.0V), then it is  possible to make the connection with a 0V-to-3.3V amplitude  output as-is without doing anything. The problem lies with  tri-state and/or two-way buffers. With an ordinary 3V buffer,  when the buffer itself is in a high impedance state, 5V of  voltage can be applied to the output pin from the outside, and  that voltage level will flow backward (reverse current) from the  MOS transistor drain region through the parasitic diode to the  3.3V power source. To prevent this phenomenon, as shown in  Figure 3, the n-channel transistor must be inserted serially  into the output pin similar to the way the input circuit was  designed. Naturally, this transistor will function as an in-line  resistor when the buffer is in the output mode, lowering the  buffer's drive capabilities. At high-level output in particular,  the back-gate bias effect also comes into play, greatly reducing  drive capabilities. Besides this circuit, there have been  reports of cases where complicated circuit configurations that  use floating n-wells have been used to enhance high-level output  characteristics. But in each of these instances, the  characteristics deteriorated, and they were of little use in  high-speed, high-drive-capable buffers.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-03A>      Figure 3. 3.3V/5V Tri-state Buffer </FIG>    An alternative course of action to the 3V/5V interface  approach, albeit a complicated one, is to simultaneously  fabricate 0.8m transistors capable of withstanding 5V on top  of the 0.5m gate array, thereby creating transistors capable  of 5V input and output. This is called the multi-oxide process  because it alters the thickness of the oxide films on the gates  of the 3V and 5V transistors. Table 2 provides an example of the  specifications of a 0.5m gate array product that employed  the  multi-oxide process. This approach makes metal layer switching  possible at each pin for both 3V I/O and 5V I/O.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-03B>      Table 2. Example of Multi-oxide Gate Array TC183G I/O Buffer Characteristics </FIG>    Figure 4 shows an example of 3V/5V-conversion I/O buffer  circuits that made use of the multi-oxide process. Although the  process is complicated, the circuits themselves are clear-cut.  The 5V input circuit can also be fabricated using a two-stage  inverter circuit comprised of 0.8m transistors, which  compared to the input circuit illustrated in Figure 2, is  faster, facilitates circuit threshold value control and also has  a large noise margin. The 5V output buffer makes use of a level  shifter circuit configured from 0.8m transistors to convert  the 3V signals coming from the logic circuit inside the gate  array to the 5V level for output. Even though this level shifter  circuit causes an additional 1ns delay, this buffer offers  output characteristics on a par with ordinary 5V gate arrays.  This buffer readily serves as a direct drive for buses that  require large load drive capabilities, something the tri-state  buffer circuit shown in Figure 3 has difficulty doing. This  buffer is also being adapted for use with the PCI bus, which is  rapidly coming into widespread use as a next-generation standard.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-04A>      Figure 4. 5V I/O Circuits That Utilize the Multi-oxide Process </FIG>    Because of the outstanding 5V I/O buffer characteristics of  the multi-oxide gate array, they are not only finding  application in dual 3V/5V systems, but are also being used as 5V  input-3V logic processing-5V output devices in 5V systems that  require the low power consumption and high speeds of 0.5m  gate arrays.  <H5>  High-speed Interfaces </H5>   As the operating speed of the logic circuits inside gate  arrays is enhanced, the slowness of signal transmissions between  multiple LSIs is becoming more pronounced. If we adhere to past  ways of thinking, it would seem that all we have to do is scale  down the feature sizes in order to increase the drive  capabilities and operating speed of the output buffer. But in  actuality, numerous output buffers operate simultaneously in  synch with the clock, in which case, the high speed, uniform  switching of powerful drive buffers generates considerable noise  on the order of 1V in the power source inside the gate array,  which in turn causes malfunctions. Power source noise can be  alleviated by fabricating numerous power source pins, but  too-fast switching also inhibits high-speed transmission as the  transmission waveform is distorted owing to the reflected waves  in the conductors on the printed circuit board. Therefore, it  has become commonplace for recent gate arrays to offer an  extremely wide variety of buffers so that you can select those  with the lowest noise from among buffers that offer combinations  of the various load drive capabilities and permissible  transmission times required in output pins.    However, no matter how many different kinds of buffers there  are, that alone will not improve transmission speed. Therefore,  as one solution to low-noise, high-speed transmission, attention  has recently focused on small amplitude signal transmission  systems that enable high-speed transmission by limiting the  output amplitude without aimlessly increasing load drive  capabilities. Of these, the GTL system is the closest to  practicalization, and is starting to gain support as a standard  cell in 0.5m gate arrays. There is also an emitter-coupled  logic (ECL)-level small amplitude signal transmission system  that has been in use for some time. But, although the ECL system  makes it easy to design the circuit threshold level for bipolar  circuits, it cannot be realized as readily for CMOS circuits,  making the ECL system unsuitable for use with CMOS LSIs. But GTL  system standards were established with CMOS LSIs in mind. As  Figure 5 indicates, a GTL system driver consists of a solitary  n-channel transistor. In actual circuits,  driver-transistor-generated noise is reduced by adding a  through-rate control circuit to gently control ON/OFF. And the  input circuit is an ordinary CMOS P-top high-speed comparator.  Table 3 shows the DC specifications for the GTL system. Note  that maximum output amplitude is held to 1.2V, and the  terminating resistance value is assumed to be 50_O_. This  system  is suitable for high-speed buses with large load capacities and  long transmission lines.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-04B>      Table 3.

Ordinarily, signal transmissions between chips are  synchronized to a system clock supporting multiple chips, and  transmission takes place in the space of a single clock cycle  with the signal output from a certain chip's flip-flop being  derived by another chip's flip-flop at the next clock timing  pulse. However, as shown in Figure 6, since large-scale gate  arrays distribute thousands of clocks in a single chip, a  multi-stage clock buffer is located inside the chip, causing  unnecessary delays. Thus, a large phase difference exists  between the system clock on the PCB and the clocks that are  actually supplying timing pulses to the flip-flops inside the  chip. In a worst case scenario, this clock phase difference  itself accounts for the greatest portion of the permissible  transmission time. As the conceptual diagram provided in Figure  6 indicates, PLL technology eliminates this phase difference and  lengthens the effective transmission time permitted by the  buffer, thereby making high-speed transmission possible.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-05B>      Figure 6. Signal Transmission Circuit Employing PLL </FIG>    In gate arrays, the structure of the LSI makes it difficult  to treat an analog circuit PLL as a macro cell. However, as  shown in Figure 7, it is possible to integrate a PLL into a gate  array as a cell if it is a digital PLL that uses the gate chain  to delay the input clock nearly one clock cycle and adjusts  phase. Increasing numbers of manufacturers are supporting PLL  technology as a countermeasure to clock phase difference  beginning with their 0.5m generation gate arrays.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-06A>      Figure 7. Block Diagram of Digital PLL </FIG>    As described above, considerable improvements are being made  in inter-chip signal transmission speeds via the joint use of  small signal amplitude buffers and PLL technology in CMOS gate  arrays.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   Gate array technology, broadly speaking, is supported by  device, EDA, packaging and testing technologies. In this report,  we limited our discussion to device technology strongly  reflected in CMOS technology. But needless to say, in designing  the ultra-large-scale gate arrays unique to CMOS gate arrays,  EDA technology that supports top-down design and technologies  that facilitate testing techniques are essential. Gate array  technology will most likely continue to become more and more  integrated as scaling techniques work to increase gate array  operating speeds and integration levels.  Bibliography    1.

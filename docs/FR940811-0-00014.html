This amendment adds a requirement for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature, periodic functional tests of that locking feature following its installation, and repair of any discrepancy found. This amendment is prompted by the identification of a modification that ensures that the level of safety inherent in the original type design of the thrust reverser system is further enhanced. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible discrepancies in the thrust reverser control system that can result in inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective September 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0060, Revision 2, dated August 19, 1993, and Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0061, Revision 1, dated August 5, 1993, as listed in the regulations, is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The incorporation by reference of Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0054, dated December 13, 1991, and Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0053, dated December 13, 1991, as listed in the regulations, was approved previously by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 27, 1992 (57 FR 3004, January 27, 1992). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

The action proposed to require inspections, adjustments, and functional tests of the thrust reverser system; installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature; periodic functional tests of that locking feature following its installation; and repair of any discrepancy found. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, requests that a note or provision be added to the proposal to indicate that relief provided by the Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) is not revoked by the adoption of this AD. The commenter states that deactivation of a thrust reverser is not considered to be an unsafe procedure and is, therefore, not the subject of the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs. The FAA agrees that certain relief may be provided to operators as requested by the commenter, and finds that the airplane may be operated in accordance with the provisions and limitations specified in the FAA-approved MMEL, provided that no more than one thrust reverser on an airplane is inoperative and that no synch-lock on that airplane is in an unlocked position. The FAA has revised paragraph (e) of the final rule accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA also questions the requirement contained in paragraph (e) of the proposal for repetitive functional tests of the synch-lock installation. The ATA states that its members are not opposed to accomplishing the proposed tests as part of their maintenance programs, but are opposed to accomplishing the tests as part of the requirements of an AD. The ATA reasons that the ``intent'' of the proposed rule is to terminate the tests required by AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA questions the rationale for the proposed repetitive functional tests of the synch-lock installation, since the synch-lock configuration has not been shown to be unsafe. The ATA acknowledges the FAA's statement in the Discussion section of the proposal that the synch-lock is a new design whose reliability has not been adequately proven through service experience. The ATA states that, under this rationale, an operator's maintenance program for newly certificated airplanes would simply consist of Certification Maintenance Requirement (CMR) items, since the reliability of newly designed systems has not been adequately proven through service experience. The ATA believes that AD control of the proposed repetitive tests is justified only if it can be shown that the tests cannot be administered safely within an operator's maintenance program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA acknowledges that without issuance of an AD, the proposed repetitive tests may not be incorporated into every operator's maintenance program in a common manner at common intervals. In light of this consideration, the ATA requests that an alternative to accomplishment of the repetitive tests be provided in the final rule. The suggested alternative for paragraph (e) of the AD follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing the synch-lock installation, revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program to include a functional test of the synch-lock. The initial test would be accomplished within 1,500 hours time-in-service after modification. The AD would no longer be applicable to operators that have acceptably revised their maintenance programs. Operators choosing this alternative could use an alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by section 91.417 or section 121.380 of the Federal Aviation Regulation (14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing this alternative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA believes that its proposal should be adopted because the proposed repetitive tests will likely continue for as long as Model 767 series airplanes are operated. The ATA adds that, while there are numerous AD's that require repetitive inspections that would continue for the life of the aircraft, in such cases, either a satisfactory terminating action has not been developed or service experience has shown that control of the inspections cannot be safely administered through an operator's maintenance program. The ATA's proposal is intended to minimize the impact of the AD process on an operator's maintenance program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes the concerns of the commenter regarding the requirement for periodic functional tests of the synch-lock following its installation, as required by paragraph (e) of this AD. However, the FAA has determined that such tests are necessary in order to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the integrity of the synch-lock installation. The actions required by this AD are consistent with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force as necessary to ensure adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category airplanes. Representatives of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America, Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force. Representatives from other organizations, such as the ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities resulting from the recommendations of the task force. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

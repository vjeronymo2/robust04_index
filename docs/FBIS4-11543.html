			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Juan Buria] </F>   [Text] Many economists have pointed out that before 1959  Cuba had a strong economic dependency on the United States.  Recently Cuba also had strong ties with countries of the  socialist bloc, ties which were abruptly broken. That, together  with the U.S. blockade, brought our country to the situation of  the special period.    Nevertheless, today, in the midst of these difficulties,  Cuba  is making great efforts to diversify its commercial ties with  the world. In this connection, just yesterday, British  Ambassador Leycester Coltman announced the possibility that  another British firm may come to Cuba to work in oil  exploration. At this moment, important firms from France, Great  Britain, Canada, and Sweden are working in the oil exploration  sphere in Cuba. It is a process whereby we are redirecting and  diversifying our trade with the whole world.    In Great Britain's case, Ambassador Coltman pointed out  that,  years ago, Cuba's exports were up to $50 million. In 1992, that  figure dwindled to $43 million and in 1993 to $21 million.  However, Ambassador Coltman noted that the first quarter of 1994  marked a certain recovery. In other words, it is not only in the  [word indistinct], but other activities as well.    Another thing I wanted to point out was about trade with  Latin America. Economist Osvaldo Martinez, president of the  Commission on Economic Affairs of the National Assembly of the  People's Government, recently said that in 1990, 83 percent of  our exports and 87 percent of our imports were concentrated in  Europe. Back then, Latin America represented only 7 percent of  exports and 7 percent of imports. In 1993, our exports to Latin  America grew from 7 to 14 percent, and our imports from 7 to 47  percent.    This is additional proof, along with Ambassador Coltman's  statements and other elements mentioned by the press and our  leaders, that Cuba is making efforts, in midst of its economic  difficulties, to diversify its ties with the entire world.</p>

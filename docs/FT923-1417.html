			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Moratorium agreed on nuclear dumping NEGOTIATIONS on a new international treaty to curb sea pollution finally ended yesterday in Paris with an agreement for a 15-year moratorium on dumping radioactive waste. The Convention on Marine Pollution will be signed later this week by the 12 countries bordering the north-east Atlantic, which had been sharply divided until late on Monday night over the radioactivity issue. Britain and France, which need to decommission old nuclear submarines and power stations in the next two decades, retain the right to dump low and intermediate radioactive waste in the sea after 2007. But they must continue to study land-based alternatives and report the results every two years from 1997 to the other signatories - Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, the Irish Republic, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. After 15 years, Britain and France would still not be able dump radioactive waste without discussing it with other signatories and producing studies assessing the potential harm to people and marine life. The Department of the Environment said yesterday: 'There is not yet any proven land-based alternative and it may be that disposal at sea will represent the best environmental practice.' The alternatives of demolition and storage might also present health risks, it had commented earlier. A solution to the impasse on Monday, when Finland, Iceland and Spain were set on a permanent ban, came when the UK agreed to extend its original offer of a 10-year ban to 15 years. Mr Bob Edwards of Greenpeace France, the environment pressure group, said: 'In the end the UK and France made the right decision, although we still think they should have accepted a permanent ban.' The rest of the treaty, which has been overshadowed by the nuclear issue, includes commitments to reduce discharges of other toxic substances and heavy metals, with the aim of eventually eliminating some of them. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said: 'The convention has shown some limited progress, but I am alarmed that there are no timescales agreed for the reduction of polluting materials.'</p>

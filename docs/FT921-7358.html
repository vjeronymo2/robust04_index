			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Casebook SECURITY is one of the main selling points of with-profits life policies. Bonuses credited cannot be withdrawn and policies are thus supposed to be much less volatile than alternatives such as unit trusts. Try telling that to Joshua Martin, who has a 10-year policy with Clerical Medical, maturing soon. Late in 1990, Martin, who had been contributing a gross Pounds 500 per year, asked for a quotation of his policy's maturity value. Clerical Medical wrote on November 11, 1990, giving an estimated maturity value of Pounds 11,360. Since that date, share prices, as represented by the FT-A All-Share index, has risen by more than 20 per cent. So, you might think that Martin's policy has increased in value since the estimate was made. Wrong. The actual maturity value is set to be Pounds 9,799. How did this occur? Clerical Medical says two factors explain the shift. The first is that its quotation was based on previous terminal bonus payouts. At the time the quotation was given to Martin, terminal bonuses were still healthy, reflecting the strong performance of 1980s stock markets. Since then, it has become clear to many life companies that the investment returns that were available in the period 1975-87 will not persist. Terminal bonuses have been cut, particularly on shorter-term policies such as Martin's. The second factor is a shift in Clerical Medical policies that were started after 1981. The final value of policies started after that date contained a much lower proportion as terminal bonus. The combined effect is that the terminal bonus, quoted at Pounds 4,260 in November 1990, will actually be less than Pounds 2,700. What is puzzling is that the Gulf crisis-related fall in stock markets occurred before the quotation was given. The change in the relative importance of the terminal bonus would also have been known at that time. Admittedly, Clerical Medical's quotation did say: 'The benefits actually payable may be higher or lower than illustrated.' And the company now has shifted its policy so that it bases its quotations on likely future terminal bonuses rather than what it paid in the past. But Martin's case has two lessons. The value of a life policy can depend greatly on a terminal bonus that might be affected by short-term investment factors. And forecasts of maturity values must be treated with extreme caution.</p>

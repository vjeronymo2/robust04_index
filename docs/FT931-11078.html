			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Observer: Fresh-faced With an eye on the UK Budget, now less than six weeks away, the BBC has finally finished fine-tuning its economics team. Gerry Baker, 30, and with a first in PPE from Oxford, has been hoiked out of Panorama, where he was a producer, to take over as economics correspondent from Steve Levinson, 44, who has defected to Channel 4 news. Levinson, an old Press Association hand, did a lot to improve the Beeb's economic coverage after Daniel Jeffreys quit. However, the 1990 arrival of Peter Jay, well-known economic guru and former ambassador to Washington, meant that Levinson had to move if he wanted to be more than number two. Another casualty of Jay's growing economic empire is Dominick Harrod, 52, son of the late Sir Roy Harrod. He's been economics editor of BBC Radio since 1979 and leaves next month. Bimedia types, who can flit effortlessly between radio and TV, are all the rage at the Beeb currently and, as an old wireless man, Harrod seemed increasingly sidelined. What's left of his empire will now fall into Jay's hands. By contrast, Baker seems to have all the right connections. He's no stranger to BBC director-general John Birt, having started his TV career on LWT's Weekend World, and also gets on well with Jay. He produced Jay's recent documentary about Bill Clinton during the making of which the Beeb's 56-year-old economic guru is reported to have sampled his first McDonald's hamburger.</p>

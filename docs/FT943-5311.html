			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Dynastic moves at Danone Heads of French companies are often criticised for being too monarchic - and perhaps too dynastic, in the case of Antoine Riboud, the 75-year-old head of the Danone food group, whose son, Franck, 38, has been just made his number two, writes David Buchan. Antoine Riboud, whose management style is described by one Paris analyst as increasingly authoritarian and peremptory, has never made any secret of his desire to see his son rise to the top of Danone, which he has built up under the name of BSN, recently dropped in favour of the more identifiable best-selling brand of Danone yoghurt. But the announcement of Franck Riboud's elevation to 'vice chairman and president' under his father who is 'chairman and chief executive' was careful to mention that the move was made at the initiative of Michel David-Weill, the board's non-executive vice chairman and head of Lazards, which owns 5.9 per cent of the group. Franck Riboud, who replaces the retiring Georges Lecallier, has worked at Danone since he graduated from the Lausanne Polytechnique in 1981. He has had a taste of responsibilty at most branches of the group's multifarious food businesses and since 1992 he has been reponsible for corporate development. Danone officials claim that any idea of Franck being groomed to take over from his father is premature; the latter can go on until he is 80, according to the group's statutes. At the board meeting which elevated Franck, it was also announced that Jacques Vincent and Christian Laubie would join Philippe Lenain in the inner circle as senior vice-presidents.</p>

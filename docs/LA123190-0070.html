			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS BECOME BEST IN THE WEST;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: THEY HEAT UP IN THE FOURTH QUARTER TO BEAT THE CHARGERS AND THEIR  ROOKIE QUARTERBACK, 17-12, WINNING THE AFC WEST TITLE. L.A. TRAILS AT HALFTIME,  9-7.  </P> <P> The Raiders were 11 minutes 20 seconds from explaining a loss to a former  University of Idaho quarterback named John Friesz and booking wild-card passage  to Miami. Then they reached down deep and pulled out the AFC West title,  rallying to defeat the San Diego Chargers, 17-12, before 62,593 at the Coliseum  Sunday.  </P> <P> The Kansas City Chiefs, who needed a San Diego victory to win the division,  looked on from home in glee, then horror, as the rookie quarterback Friesz  guided the Chargers to the brink of victory. Friesz only acted his age when it  mattered.  </P> <P> As if waiting to be scared stiff before reacting, the Raiders ordered up an  80-yard scoring drive in the fourth quarter, capped by a 17-yard pass from  quarterback Jay Schroeder to fullback Steve Smith with 3:53 to play.  </P> <P> It was as easy as that. Some Raiders didn't wish to face the consequences of a  loss to Charger players who will pick up their paychecks Tuesday and call it a  forgettable season.  </P> <P> So the Raiders survived a scare, won their division, received a first-round bye  and now prepare for an unknown opponent. That won't be determined until  first-round games are completed next weekend.  </P> <P> A Raider loss would have set up a wild-card game next weekend in Miami against  the Dolphins.  </P> <P> "It entered my mind," defensive end Greg Townsend said. "But I didn't think  about it."  </P> <P> The Chargers were accused by some of football heresy for throwing the upstart  Friesz into real, live NFL action, but the Raiders certainly didn't make San  Diego pay for it.  </P> <P> Imagine the locker-room scene at halftime, when the Raiders pulled in trailing,  9-7.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you what, it was real quiet," Schroeder said. "What could you say?"  </P> <P> With no one suggesting setting their watches ahead three hours to Miami time,  the Raiders opted to make enough big plays in the second half to win the game.  Four seemed to be about right.  </P> <P> Big Play No. 1: Special teams man and backup safety Dan Land got it started on  the kickoff following Jeff Jaeger's 45-yard field goal that gave the Raiders a  10-9 lead with 13:33 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Donnie Elder took the ensuing kickoff and went 90 yards down the left sideline.  Land never conceded the touchdown and tripped Elder up at the seven-yard line.  </P> <P> "That was the biggest play," Townsend said. "If they score, who knows what  happens?"  </P> <P> The Chargers settled for a 21-yard John Carney field goal with 11:36 remaining.  San Diego regained the lead, 12-10, but the Raiders took a measure of pride in  holding the Chargers to three points.  </P> <P> Land didn't only see Elder running away from him. He saw the Raiders' season  running away with him.  </P> <P> "I've got to catch him," he said he told himself.  </P> <P> Trailing again, the Raiders took over at their own 20 and wouldn't give the  ball up until after Smith scored the game-winner and 3:53 remained.  </P> <P> Schroeder, who struggled most of the game, was five for five on the drive for  70 yards.  </P> <P> Big Play No. 2. On third and six at the Raider 24, Schroeder found Tim Brown  open over the middle for a 22-yard gain to the San Diego 46. After a two-yard  run by Bo Jackson, Schroeder passed 18 yards to Jackson.  </P> <P> Big Play No. 3. On third and three at the San Diego 27, Schroeder rolled left  and scrambled four yards for the first down, lowering his shoulder into two  Chargers defenders to make the necessary yardage.  </P> <P> Schroeder's thoughts: If not him, who? If not then, when?  </P> <P> "I knew I had to get it," he said. "I saw the down marker on the sideline."  </P> <P> Schroeder's first down set up a scoring pass to Smith that fooled everyone in  the stadium, including the Chargers. Smith is best known as a blocker for  Heisman Trophy winners Jackson and Marcus Allen. Once a season, around the  holidays, Smith becomes a secret weapon. This was the time, and Smith won the  division. He slithered out of the backfield into the left flat, accepted the  perfect pass from Schroeder and raced into the end zone untouched.  </P> <P> Most figured that was the game. Friesz, remembering all those comebacks he led  in Division I-AA at Idaho, gave it one last fling. He threw 16 yards to Anthony  Miller on third and 15 to give the Chargers a first down at the Raider 46.  </P> <P> But on second and 10, defensive end, Scott Davis, who earlier had blocked an  extra point, came up with Big Play No. 4 when he sacked Friesz for a seven-yard  loss. Friesz threw six yards to tight end Arthur Cox on third down, but his  fourth-down pass fell incomplete with 51 seconds left, preserving the Raiders'  first division title since 1985.  </P> <P> While it wasn't a championship effort by the Raiders, they came up with enough  moments.  </P> <P> "We did what we had to do," Allen said. "Guys like Dan Land, who ran down that  guy on the kick return. Jay Schroeder lowering his shoulder on that big third  down play. Steve Smith making the catch and taking it in for the touchdown.  Scott Davis making the big sack. I like to think that's a sign of a champion."  </P> <P> Raider defensive end Howie Long said it's the little things that separate  champions from Chargers.  </P> <P> "San Diego pushes a lot of teams to the envelope and finds a way to lose," he  said. "The Raiders push teams to the envelope and find ways to win. San Diego  is a minute away from being 10-6."  </P> <P> The Raiders are two victories from the Super Bowl, although you wouldn't know  it by Sunday's post-game celebration. There was none. No champagne, no  balloons, no party favors.  </P> <P> "We just won the AFC West," Long said. "See me after the Super Bowl, then I'll  tell you we're there."  </P> <P> Still, five years is a long time between playoff games.  </P> <P> "We got knocked off the mound," Townsend said, "and it was a long, hard climb  back up."  </P> <P> Who's back yet?  </P> <P> Raider owner Al Davis, measuring his elation, roamed the locker-room floor and  dreamed of bigger games to come.  </P> <P> "Start worrying about the next one," he yelled to Long.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> In his first NFL appearance, quarterback John Friesz completed 11 of 22 passes  for 98 yards and one touchdown, a seven-yard pass to Craig McEwen in the second  quarter. Freisz: "I did some good things and I did some bad things." That  seemed the consensus. "Friesz had an up-and-down day," Chargers Coach Dan  Henning said. . . . Quarterback Jay Schroeder also completed 11 of 22 passes  for one touchdown, although he totaled 162 yards. Bo Jackson, who gained only  28 yards in 11 carries, refused to speak with the media afterward.  </P> <P> San Diego tailback Rod Bernstine led all rushers with 114 yards in 27 carries,  punishing Raiders along the way. "Bernstine must have a new contract to do this  year," defensive end Greg Townsend said. "He deserves whatever he gets." . . .  Cornerback Lionel Washington missed the game with his sore hamstring pull. He  said the decision not to play was made 20 minutes before the game after owner  Al Davis asked about his condition. "I said I was 90%," Washington said. If he  had to do it over? "I'd have said I was 100%." Washington expects to start in  the playoffs. . . . With one catch for 30 yards, Willie Gault fell 15 yards  short of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the season. . . . Jackson won the  team rushing championship with 698 yards to Marcus Allen's 682. . . . San Diego  linebacker Junior Seau, the first-round pick and former USC star, recorded his  first sack of the season in the first half. . . . Schroeder finished the season  with 19 touchdown passes and nine interceptions.  </P></p>

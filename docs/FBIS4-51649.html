			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] North Korea rejected the International Atomic  Energy Agency's [IAEA] new proposal that the IAEA conduct gamma  mapping and analysis on used nuclear fuel later. Accordingly,  the IAEA has canceled the plan to send five inspectors to North  Korea.    IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said: North Korea sent a reply to  the IAEA's new proposal on 29 April, and an analysis of the  reply message by IAEA high-level policy makers has come to the  conclusion that it is unsatisfactory [manjoksuropchi motan  kosuro kyollonul naeryoddago].    He stressed: The IAEA has canceled the planned visit to  North Korea by the five inspectors, who were supposed to leave  for the country today [30 April], since North Korea notified  that it cannot meet the IAEA's demand that North Korea allow the  inspection team to conduct necessary inspection activities when  fuel rods are changed.    Hans Meyer also said that the IAEA plans to discuss the  change of fuel rods with North Korea again early next week.</p>

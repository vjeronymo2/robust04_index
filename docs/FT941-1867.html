			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Macy board settles rift The board of R. H. Macy, the US department store chain which is in Chapter 11 protection, yesterday approved a reorganisation plan after apparently resolving a last-minute rift which threatened the retailer's independence. The company said the plan saw Macy's emergence from protection in January 1995, but gave no further details. The proposals were submitted to Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US secretary of state appointed by a federal bankruptcy court to lead the negotiating process. Macy's creditors, which are owed Dollars 6bn, were due to review them today. On Monday, Mr Vance granted the board a one-day extension to submit a plan after it failed to settle its differences. The board disagreement centred on the valuation the company would place on itself. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman of Loews and CBS, was leading one faction in pushing for a Dollars 3.8bn valuation, which would result in a greater return on claims by public bondholders and other junior creditors. Macy's management was urging a Dollars 3.5bn valuation, which would benefit senior creditors.</p>

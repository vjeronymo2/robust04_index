			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Madrid offices bombed Bombs in Madrid yesterday damaged the Labour Ministry and the headquarters of INI, the state-owned conglomerate that owns most of Spain's public companies, Tom Burns reports from Madrid. While the bombs were small and the damage slight, the explosions were a dramatic prelude to today's May Day rallies, which will underline a growing union revolt against government policies. In the wake of government cuts in unemployment benefits and of plans to legislate curbs on wildcat strikes, unions have planned a half-day general strike on May 28 and further stoppages in October.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] One of the reasons representatives of democratic  forces did not advance to the second round of presidential  elections lies in their disunity -- this according to Viktar  Ivashkevich, secretary of the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF]  Executive Board, while speaking to BELAPAN about the results of  the 23 June presidential elections.    He recalled that BNF had once appealed to presidential  candidates Karpenka and Shushkevich to withdraw their  candidacies in support of [BNF Chairman] Zyanon Paznyak.  Karpenka was forced to do that, but Shushkevich did not take  this step, and the democratic forces now have to pay for the  shortsightedness of such a policy. Still, even if there had  been no disunity among democrats, Ivashkevich believes  Lukashenka would still have had a better chance for victory.  "Our citizens still want to try the taste of communism," the  BNF secretary said, "let them do that."    Asked what tactics the BNF will use in the second round,  Viktar Ivashkevich replied as follows: "We will not participate  in the dispute between the communists and Komsomol members (this  relates to Kebich and Lukashenka -- BELAPAN). The front will  concentrate on the consolidation of its ranks and preparation  for the parliamentary elections."</p>

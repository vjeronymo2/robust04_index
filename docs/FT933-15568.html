			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Pounds 50m gas processing plant for Teesside ENRON, the US gas group, is to start construction of a second gas processing plant on Teesside next year, costing Pounds 50m, Chris Tighe writes. The investment was confirmed yesterday at the official opening of the company's first Teesside gas processing plant at Seal Sands. The installation and its adjacent sister plant will process North Sea gas fed through the 254-mile central area transmission system pipeline, a recently completed Pounds 1bn project. The Pounds 70m plant can process 300m cu ft of gas a day and receives supplies from the Everest field. Amoco expects gas from the Lomond field to come on stream next week. The second plant, due to begin operation in 1996, will process up to 300m cu ft of gas a day from the new Judy/Joanne North Sea complex. Enron is a 50 per cent partner in Teesside Power, the joint venture which owns the new combined heat and power Teesside power station. It is supplied by gas from the new processing plant.</p>

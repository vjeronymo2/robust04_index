			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: French, Brazilian groups allotted stakes in BPA Portugal has chosen one Brazilian and three French companies as the foreign investors allotted shareholdings, totalling 7.5 per cent, in the privatisation of Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), the country's largest retail bank. Caisse National de Prevoyance and Mutuelles du Mans, the French insurance companies, will take stakes of 3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively. The Brazilian Banco Economico will buy 2.5 per cent and French bank Credit Commercial de France 1 per cent. The sale of the shareholdings will raise Es15.4bn (Dollars 89m) for the Portuguese state. Credit Commercial de France had been contracted to advise the Portuguese government and negotiate the sale of stakes in BPA to foreign investors. Foreign shareholders are limited to holding 3 per cent of BPA individually and 7.5 per cent collectively. The sale of stakes to foreign companies is the third phase of BPA's privatisation and will bring the total capital in private hands to 75 per cent. The state is expected further to reduce its shareholding in BPA later this year by not exercising subscription rights in a planned capital increase to Es110bn from Es100bn. The bank is now controlled by a group of Portuguese investors who own 27 per cent. Mutuelles du Mans owns 37.5 per cent of BPA Seguros, an insurer in the BPA group. Credit Commercial and Banco Economico have co-operation agreements with the bank.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD TRAVEL WATCH: SOME MIDDLE EAST COUNTRIES CONSIDERED SAFE  </P> <P> World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed  judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change  overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United  States, contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the  nearest American embassy.  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> Iraq/Kuwait: The State Department has issued an advisory to Americans to "defer  all non-essential travel to the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, and to Qatar,  Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates . . . Note that this advisory applies only  to the eastern province, not the rest of Saudi Arabia."  </P> <P> While travel to Israel, Turkey and Egypt remains safe for the most part, the  unpredictable nature of the current Persian Gulf crisis means the possibility  of violence against Americans could increase if hostilities escalate -- or even  if there's a stalemate.  </P> <P> ASIA  </P> <P> China: In an effort to boost tourism after last summer's massacre of student  demonstrators, China's National Tourism Administration has created a 24-hour,  7-day-a-week hotline, with English- and Japanese-speaking operators, to  investigate complaints by tourists and to help resolve transportation and  lodging problems. In Beijing, the number is (01) 513 0828; in Shanghai, dial  (021) 439 0630. There are also numbers for Tianjin, Guilin and the following  provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejian, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Gansu.  </P> <P> India: There are many areas in this country considered "disturbed," protected  or restricted that require special permission from the government to visit.  Check with the Government of India Tourist Office, 3550 Wilshire Blvd., Suite  204, Los Angeles 90010, (213) 380-8855, for details. For travel between India  and Pakistan, the only official border crossing point for foreigners is at  Attari, Punjab/Wakah, Pakistan, by train or road, any day of the week between  9:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. A Pakistani visa is required.  </P> <P> AFRICA  </P> <P> Somalia: There have been a growing number of violent crimes, including bombings  and shootings, in the capital of Mogadishu and environs. Other parts of the  country are also unstable; avoid travel to Somalia at this time.  </P> <P> Tanzania: While photography in game parks is unrestricted, travelers should be  aware that elsewhere in the country, severe photo restrictions are enforced.  Many places not clearly identified as off-limits for photographs -- hospitals,  schools, bridges and harbors, for example -- can in fact be taboo. Be careful  of not just what you shoot, but who is watching, even if it seems to be an  innocent picture.  </P> <P> Also, security officials don't always notify the U.S. Embassy of detention or  arrest, so quick consular access to U.S. citizens can't be guaranteed.  </P> <P> EUROPE/SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> France: As of Jan. 1, smoking will be forbidden on commuter trains, in the  corridors on nonsmoking cars on long-distance trains, and on nonsmoking  platforms.  </P> <P> Romania: While the security situation has calmed down, it is wise to avoid  travel alone at night, and to keep in touch with the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest.  </P> <P> SOUTH AMERICA  </P> <P> Suriname: Travel continues to be dangerous outside the capital of Paramaribo  and the western town of Neiuw Nickerie. Be careful when traveling outside these  two urban centers, and on the road between Zanderij International Airport and  Paramaribo, especially at night. Register with the U.S. Embassy in Paramaribo  on arrival.  </P> <P> Venezuela: Robberies and violent crime are on the upswing, as are fears that  this country may be in danger of a military coup if the ongoing economic crisis  doesn't ease.  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA  </P> <P> CARIBBEAN  </P> <P> Nicaragua: Roads throughout the country are in rough shape, and travelers in  rural areas should check with local officials for current conditions. Visitors  considering off-road travel, especially in the far north or the mountainous  regions of central Nicaragua, should check with locals about unmarked mined  areas remaining from the long years of Contra/Sandinista hostilities.  </P> <P> Trinidad &amp; Tobago: The recent coup attempt and hostage crisis that  paralyzed this small country and led to extensive looting in the capital city  of Port of Spain is over. The government is in control throughout the country  and tensions in Port of Spain have eased, but a 9 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew remains  in effect. While conditions are improving, it's likely that the curfew will  remain in effect until mid-September, and it may be even longer before normal  airline and cruise ship schedules are resumed. Return flights may be hard to  book at this time. Americans considering traveling here can contact the U.S.  Embassy for the latest information -- 15 Queen's Park West, Port of Spain,  telephone (809) 622-6372.  </P> <P> NORTH AMERICA  </P> <P> Canada: Air Canada introduces smoke-free flying Oct. 1 on all flights between  Europe and North America.  </P> <P> SOUTHEAST ASIA  </P> <P> Myanmar (Burma): Tension is increasing around the country the longer the  government drags its feet in turning over power to the opposition, which won a  landslide vote in May, the first multiparty elections in three decades. Civil  unrest is a growing possibility, and a 10 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew remains in  effect in Rangoon. No individual tourist visas are being granted, and because  of continuing safety problems with Myanmar Airways, travelers should avoid  flying on the domestic carrier.  </P> <P> Indonesia: There has been a rise in insurgent activity in the Aceh region of  northwest Sumatra against government troops and settlers from crowded Java.  Exercise caution.  </P> <P> Philippines: Coup rumors are circulating once again in Manila, although this  has been true almost since Corazon Aquino came to power in 1986. More important  are threats against American officials by Communist rebels who have shown the  ability to strike in urban as well as rural areas.  </P> <P> These threats present little risk for travelers as long as they are not  affiliated with any recognizable American organization, the armed forces or  U.S. government, and they avoid places patronized by U.S. personnel. Most major  tourist areas around the country have not been affected by unrest, and remain  safe.  </P> <P> For more information on safety concerns in countries you may be visiting,  contact the Citizens Emergency Center, U.S. Department of State, Washington,  D.C. 20520, (202) 647-5225.  </P></p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Ahold fixes price for rights issue AHOLD, the Dutch-based food retailer, has fixed the issue price of its previously-announced one-for-10 rights issue at Fl 89 per share. The proceeds of slightly more than Fl 450m (Dollars 253.6m) will be used to strengthen shareholders' equity after a string of acquisitions in 1991 and 1992. The rights issue, announced last month when the company unveiled its 1992 results, had come as a surprise because Ahold had not been expected to issue new shares until it made its next big acquisition. Ahold's shares closed down Fl 0.80 at Fl 96 in Amsterdam yesterday. Trading in the rights to the 5.1m new common shares is due to start on April 19 and end on April 29, with payment on May 13. The rights issue has been underwritten by a banking syndicate led by ABN Amro of the Netherlands.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE  </P> <P> Trying to address an increasing need for day-care facilities, San Diego County  supervisors decided Tuesday to study whether parents would use child-care  centers if they were placed at transit centers.  </P> <P> Officials will examine transit centers in Oceanside and Chula Vista to see  whether parents using public transportation would also drop children off at  day-care centers there.  </P> <P> "One of the greatest difficulties for working parents in using public  transportation is the difficulty in finding appropriate day-care facilities in  close proximity to bus, trolley or rail lines," said Supervisor John MacDonald.  </P> <P> In a unanimous vote, supervisors approved spending $15,000 from a state grant  to study the feasibility of such day-care centers. The study, pending state  approval, will take about three months, said Nancy Allen, MacDonald's chief of  staff. And if the survey indicates parents' willingness to use day care at  transit centers, the supervisors might consider launching pilot projects.  </P> <P> By 1995, nearly two-thirds of preschool children and three-fourths of all  school-age children will have working mothers, according to a report presented  to the supervisors.  </P></p>

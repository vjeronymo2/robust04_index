			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Forswear thy foolish ways 'SING FROM the same hymn sheet,' John Major urged his factious Cabinet colleagues at Thursday's meeting. For his government has embarked on what Downing Street has described as the toughest public spending round for 15 years. But what hymns might the prime minister's colleagues sing as they prepare to meet the Treasury's tough expenditure ceilings? 'Fight the good fight'? Perhaps. 'Dear Lord and Father of mankind, forgive our foolish ways'? Preferably. 'Lord of all hopefulness'? Probably. 'The strife is o'er, the battle done'? Certainly not. The targets for public spending in 1994-95 and 1995-96, reaffirmed at Thursday's meeting, may be the toughest for 15 years, although the Treasury agrees that defining such claims is problematic. But the government's limits are certainly tougher than it has pursued in recent years. It plans to cap the increase in the control total for public spending, adjusted for recession-related items, so that, in real terms the increase between this financial year and next will be broadly flat, which would make it the tightest year since 1989 when the out-turn control total fell. But, while 70 per cent of the deterioration in Britain's public finances since then may be recession-induced, the other 30 per cent reflected a deliberate political decision to spend now and pay later. Between 1991-92 and 1992-93, the control total was allowed to rise by 5.1 per cent, while government expenditure rose as a percentage of gross domestic product from 42 per cent in 1991-92 to 45 1/2 per cent this year. Sooner or later, and probably sooner, the government - and thus the electorate - was going to have to pay, either in reduced services or higher taxes. Strongest enemies Mr Major's task is made vastly more complicated by the internal state of the parliamentary Conservative party. Like Japanese prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa, felled yesterday by a factional dispute within a Liberal Democratic party which has held power too long, Mr Major's strongest enemies are within his own party. Mr Major's attempt to impose discipline on the spending round has been undermined by repeated internal leaks in recent weeks: increased prescription charges, hotel fees for hospital stays, cuts in invalidity benefits, have all been unofficially floated into the public domain in order to force the embattled premier and his increasingly powerful chancellor either to take the political flak or shoot them down. Nor have matters been helped by the apparent willingness of spending ministries to ignore the Treasury's pleas for austerity and lodge increased bids for spending, or the open public debate between left- and right-wing members of the cabinet over whether taxes will have to rise further if the combination of Mr Lamont's budget tax increases and the government's spending plans prove insufficient. As Mr Major knows from reading Trollope, singing together is only part of the story. Archdeacon Grantly and Mr Slope, the bishop's chaplain, were both members of the Church of England, sang in the cathedral together but still pursued very different goals. Yet it is far from certain whether the spending plans will be tough enough for the economy. Chancellor Clarke skated over this issue in last week's Mansion House speech. 'Public finances will be restored back towards balance over the medium term,' he said, adding: 'If I judge that further action is necessary, I shall not hesitate to take it.' But Mr Clarke gave no clues as to whether, when or how these further measures might be taken. Fiscal reconstruction Abundantly clear was Mr Clarke's reliance on economic recovery to do the bulk of the fiscal reconstruction. For he intends to go for growth. He will set economic policy with the interest of business as well as the City in mind. He will trumpet Britain's, and his own, successes loudly. It is a little early for him to take the credit for the generally encouraging news on unemployment, the monetary aggregates and inflation revealed this week or worry about the sluggish performance of retail sales. But he will. 'We have before us the prospect of several years of steady growth and rising employment,' the chancellor said in Tuesday's speech. But will it last? For populist chancellors tend to favour populist recoveries. A lower exchange rate balanced by a tighter fiscal policy may be the best way to ensure an investment and export-led recovery. A lower exchange rate and a looser fiscal policy is much the better way to encourage the kind of consumption-driven recovery which wins elections. But will the chancellor be prepared to raise interest rates if wage inflation accelerates, even in the run-up to the next election? Or is another British inflationary cycle already assured? If the former, then, Chancellor Clarke: 'all our hopes on thee are founded.' If the latter, then: 'Turn Back, Oh man, forswear thy foolish ways.'</p>

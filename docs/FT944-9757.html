			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Sun set to shine on Latin America - Emerging Investor Many of the political storm clouds that worried investors in Latin American stock markets earlier this year appear to have blown away. Presidential candidates pledging adherence to market-oriented economics have been returned by voters in the two largest economies, Brazil and Mexico. In Argentina and Peru, the current leaders, whose policies have met the approval of foreign investors, look set for victory in elections next year. Furthermore, some economists are starting to scale up their growth forecasts for 1995. 'Growth prospects for Latin America are really extremely good. We are expecting growth could be as high as 5 per cent next year and that would make it the best year since 1980,' said Mr Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns in New York. This year's growth expectation averages about 3.5 per cent. Yet the feelgood factor has yet to assert itself. 'The unease in Latin American markets is because of US events that have tended to outweigh a quite substantial improvement in the background fundamentals of the region,' said Mr Dennis. Since US interest rates began to turn upwards in February, Latin American markets have been nervous. The nervousness was compounded by political assassinations and other events in Mexico. Yet given the supposed dependence of the Latin markets on the US interest rate cycle, 1994 has not been too bad. Up to November 4, according to the International Finance Corporation, Latin American equity markets were up 12.4 per cent in dollar terms. Those investors who fought shy of Mexico, as well as Venezuela and Argentina, and invested in Brazil, which rose 77 per cent, Chile, up 47 per cent, and Peru, up 58 per cent, have done best of all. While for non-dollar investors the weakness of the US currency this year pares these gains, they still look reasonable when compared with most stock markets and wonderful compared with the dollar-based fixed-income markets. Returns in the US Treasury market could be the lowest since 1968. In emerging markets, holders of Brady bonds are nursing heavy losses. Latin markets also look good when compared with most of their Asian counterparts. Asia's emergers, according to the IFC, are down 6.6 per cent since the start of the year. Only South Korea, up 29.5 per cent, and India, up 14.6 per cent, stand out. The outperformance of Latin America is somewhat illusory, though. Asian markets peaked late last year and were falling at the start of 1994 as the Latin markets were still rising. Most emerging market analysts reckon Asia's longer-standing growth record justifies the higher price/earnings ratios commanded by Asian companies, but a number believe the gap between the two regions should begin to close as Latin American growth proves persistent. Many say that this year's political and economic developments in Brazil, in particular the prospects for success of the current anti-inflation plan, could provide the trigger for a more positive regional outlook. Mr Jaime de Pinies, managing director at Santander Investment in Madrid, said prospects for Brazilian growth in the coming year or so 'will defy the logic of US interest rates'. According to his company's Latin American strategist: 'The stabilisation of Brazil will not only result in extraordinary returns for those willing to share the risks, but redraw the whole economic map of the region.' He is recommending investors go overweight in Brazil, as well as Chile. Mr de Pinies recommends an underweight position in Mexico to compensate. According to Mr Roger Palmer, director of emerging markets at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, most investment institutions are so underweight in Brazil that those seeking even a neutral position there could drive the market substantially higher. But Mr Richard Watkins of LatInvest, a London-based broker specialising in the region, sounded some notes of caution. The importance of choosing the right stocks is growing. It is no longer just enough to have chosen the right market. And he saw government policies as increasingly reflecting concerns about social welfare and income distribution. He also saw potential difficulties for the utility stocks which dominate many of the Latin markets. Over the next few years, time will run out on the monopoly positions that were granted by governments at the time of privatisation. to many utilities. Competition is about to enter the fray. While that may be good for economic efficiency, it could also shake some of the region's most prominent stocks.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Friday  Week on week  change Stock                            Country  11/11/94     Dollars       %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Erciyas Biracilik                 Turkey    0.8628     0.1607     22.89 Alarko Holding                    Turkey    0.7806     0.1198     18.13 Telebras                          Brazil    0.0442     0.0065     17.26 Light Servicos De Eletricade      Brazil    0.4418     0.0615     16.16 Telebras (Pfd)                    Brazil    0.0512     0.0069     15.60 Pertrobras (Pfd)                  Brazil    0.1612     0.0214     15.29 Companhia Energetica              Brazil    0.1104     0.0145     15.08 White Martins                     Brazil    0.0144     0.0019     14.85 Eletrobras                        Brazil    0.4096     0.0494     13.70 Eletrobras (Pfd)                  Brazil    0.3988     0.0457     12.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Allowances to workers in London increase ALLOWANCES of more than Pounds 3,000 a year for staff working in central London are now commonplace, according to a study. The report by Incomes Data Services, the pay research group, found that two thirds of employers increased allowances last year in spite of the recession. There are, however, significant sectoral variations. Three quarters of companies in retail and oil and chemicals increased their allowances last year, but only about half the finance sector organisations did so. Of the big four high street banks, all but one - National Westminster - held their allowances at 1990 or earlier levels. The government refused for the third year running to increase London allowances for civil servants. The study examined allowances paid by 170 organisations in London and the south-east. Of those, 59 had inner-London allowances of Pounds 3,000 or more, mostly in the finance sector. About two thirds of building societies increased location allowances last year. Alliance &amp; Leicester's service-related payments are the highest - rising to a maximum of Pounds 4,440. Among oil and chemicals companies, the highest allowance is paid by Imperial Chemical Industries (Pounds 3,400). In retailing, 16 of 21 organisations surveyed increased allowances last year in spite of the recession. The highest allowances are reserved for stores in the West End. Littlewoods pays Pounds 53.12 a week, BHS Pounds 64.20 and Burtons Pounds 37. Study 497. Incomes Data Services, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS.</p>

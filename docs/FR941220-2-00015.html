The computer system employed by the Department of Education offers a high degree of resistance to tampering and circumvention by use of software that requires user access to be defined down to the individual data element. This security system limits data access to Department of Education and contract staff on a ``need to know'' basis, including external users of the system (guaranty agency and school personnel) and controls individual users' ability to access and alter records within the system. All users of this system are given a unique user ID with a personal identifier. The software monitors and tracks changes to any data element. Any change to the database is recorded, together with the identity of the individual user who made the change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

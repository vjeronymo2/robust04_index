			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Bush, Clinton score easy wins in Pennsylvania PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton last night claimed easy victories in the presidential primary election in Pennsylvania, the fifth largest state in the union. Early results had Mr Bush beating Mr Patrick Buchanan, who had not campaigned in the state, by a three-to-one margin. No estimates of the size of Mr Clinton's victory were immediately available. In two Senate primaries, watched more closely than the presidential contest, Ms Lynn Yeakel, in her first-ever political race, held an early lead on the Democratic side. If she wins she will face the incumbent Republican, Mr Arlen Specter, who comfortably beat an arch-conservative opponent. Even before the polls had closed the White House was saying that the 91 Republican delegates won by Mr Bush yesterday gave him more than the 1,105 he needs to wrap up the nomination. But a spokesman was later obliged to admit that a few assumptions had been made in the calculation. The president himself, in an appearance before campaign workers in Washington, was conspicuously upbeat, saying that he was ready to rebut all the outrageous accusations he claimed were being made against him by the opposition. The Bush campaign's theme of this week, following last week's concentration on international trade, has been to portray the president as a sure winner on both the economic and political front. Mr Clinton's victory probably mattered more, given the doubts raised about his candidacy and the surge in support for Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent candidate. It was not immediately clear how many of the state's 169 delegates he would win. Before the primary he had about 1,350 of the 2,145 delegates needed for the nomination. Of particular encouragement, according to the exit polls, was the fact that Pennsylvanian Democrats, who tend towards the conservative, had fewer reservations about his character and integrity than had been evident in earlier primaries. However, Pennsylvania was always likely to be more hospitable ground to the governor of Arkansas than New York. His only active opponent, Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, had a lacklustre performance in the state. Last night Mr Bush was due to attend what was being described as the biggest political fund-raising dinner in US political history, with contributors paying Dollars 92,000 (Pounds 52,000) to enjoy the privilege of being photographed with him and the vice-president.</p>

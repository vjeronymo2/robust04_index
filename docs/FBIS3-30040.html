			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Forget About Cabinet Reform and Do Everything </F> To Resolve Economic Issues]    [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa appears to be  someone who likes to make abrupt decisions. Barely days have  passed since the dispute he caused by his out-of-the-blue  announcement on the national welfare tax has subsided. Now the  government and ruling parties are being shaken over the cabinet  reshuffle hassle.    In the past, we have often pointed out that Prime Minister  Hosokawa, his government, and the ruling parties are taking the  current economic conditions too easily and are being laggard in  taking measures. While economic conditions are the worst since  the end of World War II, economic friction between Japan and the  United States is becoming more serious.    Now that the political reform bills -- which were the most  important pending issue -- have been passed, it is now time for  the government to tackle economic issues which have been left  behind. To do so, the government needs to hurry and pass the  third 1993 supplementary budget, and then deliberate the 1994  budget; and to do everything to implement deregulation and  administrative reforms.    In view of the given conditions, it is clear how precipitate  and unnatural the idea of a cabinet reshuffle at this time is.  If the purpose of Prime Minister Hosokawa's cabinet reshuffle  is to remove Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, with whom some  reports say Hosokawa has not been getting along well recently,  then the justification for a reshuffle is very weak. It is not  even worthwhile.    Maybe, Prime Minister Hosokawa is overconfident about his  high public popularity rate. The reason why he was named top  leader was because the public impression of him as the face of  the coalition was good and because his clean image -- which is  different from existing politicians -- was considered as a good  cap on the "political reform government." The political power  game and intraparty circumstances of the coalition parties also  played a role.    In the beginning, the prime minister had to go slow. After  the rice market liberalization and political reform bills issues  were taken care of and put behind him, he became confident about  running the political scene -- we can see that. Furthermore, in  the course of working on the pending issues, the man with whom  he consulted no doubt changed from Chief Cabinet Secretary  Takemura to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary  Ichiro Ozawa.    There was a difference of opinion between Prime Minister  Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura regarding the key  questions of formulating the 1994 budget within 1993 and  instituting a national welfare tax. But, where the two  questions are concerned, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, who  wanted the budget to be formulated by the end of 1993 and  opposed the national welfare tax idea as being too abrupt, was  after all more rational in his thinking.    The prime minister caused political chaos over the two  issues  and thus showed the nation and the world he lacked political  leadership. His political reponsibility for such follies is  great. A conscientious politician would take some kind of  responsibility for this. Indeed, the man who should be  criticized is the prime minister himself. A leader should have  the capacity to lend his ear to criticism and the advice of his  housekeeper, the chief cabinet secretary, as well.    If the cabinet reshuffle is meant to establish and solidify  a  basis for a long-lasting government now that the political  reform bills have been passed, what the prime minister must do  first is present the people with the policy issues he wants to  tackle, including how they will be carried out.    The "political reform government" should change its name if  all it wants to do is decide important matters with only a  handful of coalition leaders behind closed doors. If Hosokawa  wants to carry out a cabinet reshuffle, he must clearly explain  why he needs to do so. And, it is only commonsense to question  whether now is the appropriate time to do so, with the 1994  budget needing to be passed. Now is the time to do everything  to resolve economic issues rather than reshuffle the cabinet.</p>

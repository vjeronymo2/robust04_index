			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India on Wednesday [12 January] protested to  Bangladesh for allowing Pakistan's intelligence agency,  Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), to operate from its soil,  even as a high-power delegation led by Home Secretary N.N. Vohra  was currently in Nepal canvassing for cooperation to strengthen  border vigilance.    India's concern over the happenings in the neighbouring  countries stems from reports that these are being used as  conduits for pushing in arms and ammunition into the border  areas.    In the case of Bangladesh, there is an additional problem of  illegal immigration causing population explosion in the border  districts of Bihar and West Bengal and social tensions in other  areas, including Delhi.    The protest to Bangladesh was made by Prakash Singh,  Director-General of Border Security Force (BSF), at the  Indo-Bangladesh coordination meeting which concluded here on  Wednesday.    The Bangladesh delegation was led by Mohammad Anwar Hossain,  Director-General, Bangladesh Rifles.    Prakash Singh raised the issue of illegation [as published]  immigration from Bangladesh and insisted on the implementation  of the September 1991 agreement between the two countries.    He conveyed the Government's strong feelings on the subject  of assistance to insurgent groups from the North-East in  Bangladesh.    Reliable sources said the Bangladesh delegation contested  the  BSF chief's arguments. It reportedly argued that India had  pushed many people into Bangladesh merely on the suspicion of  their being illegal immigrants.    As a consequence, the meeting did not yield any clue to  solving the burning problem of illegal immigration.    However, there was agreement on two issues: one, that the  undemarcated 50 kms of Indo-Bangladesh border be demarcated at  the earliest, and the other that the work of repair and  maintenance of boundary pillars along the international border  should be taken over by the security forces of the two countries.    It was decided that the two security forces would be  requesting their respective governments to issue directions to  surveyors-general to complete the demarcation of the boundary.    In this context, the dispute in the Mahurichar area was also  discussed. India's argument was that on the basis of  Indo-Bangladesh agreement of 1974 the boundary in this area was  along the course of Mahuri river.    On the other hand, Bangladesh insisted that the cultivation  on the Indian side should be stopped. India did not favour this  proposal saying that the 1974 agreement related to alignment of  the border and not utilisation of land on either side.    Given this background it was obviously only as a matter of  courtesy that the two sides agreed that the security forces of  both sides should exercise utmost restraint and that they should  coordinate their efforts to curb smuggling and other criminal  activities along the border.    The Vohra-led delegation is visiting Nepal after a thorough  on-the-spot study of the situation in the border districts of  Bahraich and Maharajgan in UP [Uttar Pradesh].    Vohra had convened a meeting of top officials of these two  districts as well as those of Siddharath Nagar, Pilibhit and  Gonda districts. He personally visited several checkposts in the  border areas along with heads of intelligence agencies.    The Government has been concerned about the influx of Punjab  extremists in UP.</p>

Heileman Brewing Co., a unit of besieged Australian  entrepreneur Alan Bond's Bond Corp. A combination of Stroh and Heileman, which  makes Colt 45 Malt Liquor, would create the nation's third-largest brewing  company. An article in the Detroit News quoted Stroh President Roger Fridholm  as saying that Stroh might try to acquire Heileman by bypassing company  management and negotiating directly with the brewer's bankers. Heileman scoffed  at the report.  </P></p>

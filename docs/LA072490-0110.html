			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: LIMA;  </P> <P> INAUGURATION IN PERU  </P> <P> Peruvian President-elect Alberto Fujimori takes office Thursday having lost the  support of many former leftist allies because of what they consider the former  educator's turn to the right since beating novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in  national elections last month.  </P> <P> His coalition Cabinet, meant to overcome narrow political divisions, has the  largest military presence of any Peruvian government since 1987. Hurtado  Miller, a center-right agronomist and economist, is the prime minister  designate -- a less powerful post than the presidency.  </P> <P> The son of Japanese immigrants, the new president inherits a ruined economy and  a stalemated war with two leftist guerrilla insurgencies.  </P></p>

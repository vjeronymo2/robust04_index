			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham and Dh. P. Dhimas from Washington] </F>   [Text] Athens could continue the Greek-Turkish dialogue at  a low level and on issues that would not concern the Aegean,  based on the inactive 1988 summit agreements between Athens and  Ankara -- specifically the "Memorandum of Vouliaymeni of 1988"  -- signed by Karolos Papoulias and Mesut Yilmaz.    Yesterday, Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis proposed this  to his U.S. counterpart, William Perry, who was quick to express  the hope that the Greek Government will deal with the tension in  the Aegean with "care and sensitivity."    Athens appears to be well-aware that the U.S. Government  wants to:    a) promote its economic, political, and military penetration  in the Balkans and,    b) support Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's government.    The U.S. Government wants to play a "catalytic role" in the  settlement of Greek-Turkish differences. Without wanting to  stir up Greek-Turkish relations, the Greek Government does not  want an isolated U.S. mediation role. According to government  sources, it wants to point out that the Greek-Turkish dispute is  also a problem of the international organizations, i.e., NATO.  Arsenis told his U.S. interlocutors that Greece also has a NATO  responsibility to protect the Aegean airspace (area 41) [not  further identified] and called U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's statement about disarming fighter planes in the  Aegean "disproportionate."    The Greek side reiterated its firm position that it cannot  abandon its sovereign rights in the Aegean and that an attempt  to resume Greek-Turkish dialogue through the "hot" issues will  immediately lead to a deadlock.    It is unknown whether the U.S. side has accepted or  understood the Greek position on the Aegean, but it appeared  receptive.    Arsenis also expressed Greek views and plans about  broadening  cooperation with the United States, even military cooperation in  the Balkans within the framework of prospects of the  "Cooperation for Peace" treaty. Reviewing the situation, he  showed particular concern about border incidents between Serbia  and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM].    The Arsenis-Perry meeting gave the two sides the opportunity  to briefly outline the agenda of the talks they will have in  Athens during the U.S. defense secretary's official visit in  July.    According to informed observers, Arsenis passed the  "message"  that during Perry's visit to Athens, the Greek side wants talks  on establishing a headquarters in Larissa. Its said that the  Americans received "contradictory messages" from Greece on this  issue, because of Deputy Defense Minister Nikolaos Kouris'  opposition.    Specifically, according to U.S. military sources, Kouris  removed from the agenda of the bilateral defense talks, which  were held in Orlando in January, the issue of the establishment  of a headquarters in Larissa. The topic was included at the  U.S. initiative.    Earlier, in December, the U.S. received an "Arsenis message"  through Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou that the  Greek side wanted to begin talks on the headquarters issue. The  distance of views resulted in U.S. accusations about "Greek  double-talk" on the headquarters issue.    Before meeting Perry and John Shalikaskvili, chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, Arsenis had breakfast at the Greek  Embassy with U.S. presidential adviser George Stefanopoulos,  immediately after arriving in Washington.</p>

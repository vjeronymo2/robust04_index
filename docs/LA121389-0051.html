			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICE VACANCY RATE RISES TO 14%; LEASING SLOWS  </P> <P> The office vacancy rate in the San Fernando Valley edged up to 14% in the third  quarter from 13% a year earlier, while leasing activity dropped 20%, according  to Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services, a division of the San  Francisco-based real estate company Grubb &amp; Ellis.  </P> <P> The biggest contributor to the higher vacancy rate was the West Valley region  that includes Canoga Park, Tarzana and Woodland Hills, where the rate was 19%  during the quarter that ended Sept. 30. The report said the area has  significant new office space, including the 250,000-square-foot Warner Gateway,  and said some companies are leaving the West Valley for less expensive space in  Calabasas, Agoura, Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village.  </P> <P> The East Valley region that includes Burbank, North Hollywood, Studio City and  Universal City was the Valley's strongest market, with a vacancy rate of 9%,  the report said. That area has benefited from growth in the entertainment  industry, the report said.  </P> <P> Grubb &amp; Ellis also noted a decline in Valley office construction in the  third quarter, to 2.37 million square feet under construction from 2.85 million  a year earlier. And despite its high vacancy rate, the West Valley is the  busiest building market with more than 1 million square feet of office space  under construction.  </P></p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Sara Lee snaps up Linter Textiles LINTER Textiles Corporation, Australia's largest clothing and textiles group, once owned by entrepreneur Mr Abraham Goldberg, has been snapped up by Sara Lee of the US after the collapse of the proposed sale to Merrill Lynch Partners. Mr Lindsay Maxsted, Linter receiver and manager of KPMG Peat Marwick, had been trying to close the sale to Merrill Lynch since February. The deal had all but collapsed last week with Merrill Lynch having trouble raising the finance to complete when Sara Lee suddenly came in with a higher offer. Merrill Lynch had managed to bring down the price of the 10 Linter businesses from ADollars 230m (Dollars 179.60m) to ADollars 215m before its bid ran into difficulty. The sale price to Sara Lee was undisclosed, but is understood to be ADollars 220m. Sara Lee, which produces hosiery, underwear and knitwear as well as food products, made an unsuccessful attempt early this year to buy just the Hilton Hosiery business out of Linter. The US company already has a substantial presence in Australia with its Kitchens of Sara Lee foods business and ownership of the drugs and household products group Nicholas Kiwi. It can now include Linter's well-known brands, which include Bradmill Textiles, Formfit, Hilton, King G, Kortex, Pelaco and Stubbies. Contracts for the sale were signed yesterday, and final settlement is expected on May 31. The deal requires the approval of the Victorian Supreme Court and the Foreign Investment Review Board. When tenders were called for the businesses late last year, Linter was estimated to earn about ADollars 55m before interest and tax for this financial year. This forecast has been revised downwards as the Australian economy goes into recession. The group will also be adversely affected by the federal government's decision in March to eliminate quota protection for the textiles and clothing industry next year, two years earlier than foreshadowed in the government's seven-year textiles, clothing and footwear plan. In his statement yesterday, Mr Maxsted said Sara Lee had indicated it would continue the Linter business as 'operating entities'. 'Towards this end, Sara Lee is prepared to make significant investment to expand key businesses in the Linter group,' Mr Maxsted said. Creditors are expecting a pay out of between 40 cents and 46 cents in the dollar.</p>

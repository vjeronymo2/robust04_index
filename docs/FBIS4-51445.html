			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress  (NPC), today issued appointment certificates to 13 new members  of the country's working panel for Hong Kong transition in 1997.    The move was meant to increase the working capacity of the  Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said Qiao.    "The preliminary committee has been shouldering more and  more  tasks with the date for China's resumption of sovereignty over  Hong Kong drawing near," Qiao said.    The 13 new members were chosen by the NPC Standing Committee  on May 12, with eight from Hong Kong, five from the mainland.    Qiao expected the new members, together with other members,  to work in an active and steadfast way for the establishment of  the preparatory committee, under the guidance of the "one  country, two systems" policy, and by adhering to the basic law  and relevant NPC decisions.    He said the work by the preliminary committee will directly  involve the smooth transition in Hong Kong in 1997.    Qiao urged them to continue to solicit the opinions of Hong  Kong people, pay more attention to survey and research, and  enable Hong Kong people to care for and participate in preparing  for China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.    Qiao said that since its establishment in July 1993, the  preliminary committee has been well received by the public  through its hard and practical work, for which he expressed  "heart-felt" thanks to its director Qian Qichen and other staff  members.    The preliminary committee comprises 70 members, of which 32  are from the mainland and 38 from Hong Kong. The members are  mostly leading officials of relevant departments, jurists,  economists, and representatives from all walks of life in Hong  Kong.</p>

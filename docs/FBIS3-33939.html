			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Senior defense sources, headed by Chief of Staff  Ehud Baraq, told Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense  minister, that although they have "minor and marginal"  observations about the document of understandings worked out  Sunday [30 January] in Davos, they will support the document if  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat signs it, senior political sources in  Jerusalem said yesterday.    The sources said that "if 'Arafat would have signed the  document first, Rabin would have accepted it." The sources said  that during the Davos meeting, there was ongoing telephone and  facsimile contacts between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and  the prime minister, as well as between Major General 'Uzi Dayan,  a member of the Israeli delegation, and the military top brass.    Ongoing consultations were also held between Rabin, Baraq,  Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, head of intelligence Uri  Sagi, and the Shin Bet chief. They transmitted their comments  to Davos by facsimile. "The Army top brass had many  observations about the initial drafts presented to the  Palestinian delegation," the political sources said, "but they  support the final document. They said that they have comments  on several minor and noncritical points, but in principle they  feel that the PLO accepted the Israeli position."    In deliberations held prior to the foreign minister's  departure for Davos, in which the prime minister and the defense  team participated, the Army brass firmly opposed for security  reasons some of the proposals raised by Peres. They demanded  that Israel keep full control of the roads to the Gaza Strip  settlements and that it be made clear that the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] will continue to move along the traffic axes  termed "safe corridors" between Jericho and the Allenby Bridge,  al-Nabi Musa, and the Dead Sea.

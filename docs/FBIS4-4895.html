			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Tasks of Socialist Economic Construction in Adjustment </F> Period Discussed at SPA Session"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The 7th Session of the  Ninth Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK opened here is  discussing the first item on the agenda "On Successfully  Fulfilling the Tasks of Socialist Economic Construction in the  Period of Adjustment Set Forth by the Workers' Party of Korea".    In his report Deputy Kang Song-san, premier of the  Administration Council, recalled that the 21st plenary meeting  of the sixth Central Committee of the WPK held in December last  year reviewed the fulfillment of the third seven-year plan and  set a three-year period of adjustment, putting forward a  economic strategy, on the basis of a scientific analysis of the  current situation and the present condition of socialist  economic construction in the country.    The tasks of socialist economic construction in the  adjustment period, the reporter said, is to thoroughly implement  the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign  trade-first policies, give definite precedence to the coal and  power industries and railway transport, which must advance ahead  of the other sectors of the national economy, and continue to  develop the metal industry.    The revolutionary economic strategy for the period of  adjustment in socialist economic construction carries the  unshakable determination and will of the Workers' Party of Korea  to radically improve the people's living standard in the next  few years and develop the national economy to an economy strong  in independence which can walk on its own feet, remaining  unshaken under any circumstances, he said.    Turning to the tasks of socialist economic construction in  the period of adjustment, the reporter said:    The per hectare yield in paddy and non-paddy fields should  be  raised to above 8 tons on an average and gradually to more than  10 tons to produce 15 million tons of grain in the near future.    Textile output will be boosted 20 percent or more and  chemical fibre and synthetic resin more than 10 percent in the  period of adjustment.    We should expand the production bases of export commodities,  broaden economic ties with countries which have good relations  with our country and further develop trade and economic dealings  with Southeast Asian countries which are within easy reach  geographically.    Coal and power output and railway freight turnover should be  increased over 30 percent respectively in the adjustment period.</p>

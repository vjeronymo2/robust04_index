			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: HOTELS/TOURISM  </P> <P> High Occupancy: The Ramada Maingate Anaheim has ended its first year of  operations with a better-than-expected 71% occupancy level, hotel officials  recently announced.  </P> <P> The 467-room hotel had projected occupancy would reach the 60%-65% range from  August, 1988, through the end of this summer, spokesman Jeff Adler said.  Location and an aggressive marketing effort combined to push the property past  its goal, Adler said.  </P> <P> The hotel caters mostly to families, offering such unusual amenities as room  service from a nearby McDonald's restaurant. Hotel guests can have their choice  of a conventional room service menu or Big Macs, fries and other McDonald's  fare -- brought for an extra $1 charge.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEMPERS IGNITED AS CONFEREES CLAIM HOLOCAUST A HOAX  </P> <P> The Institute for Historical Review, a group that claims the Nazi Holocaust was  a hoax, ended its 3-day meeting Monday by stirring outrage among residents of  Huntington Beach's Old World Village, including one Jewish woman who was told  by a conference participant, "You need the gas chamber!"  </P> <P> Six members of the militant Jewish Defense League showed up with signs to  picket later in the day when conference participants were holding an impromptu  news conference at the end of the meeting.  </P> <P> Although there was no physical violence, several conference participants  shouted racial epithets at the protesters. Witnesses said police took away one  man in handcuffs after he tried to strike Irv Rubin, national JDL chairman. A  Huntington Beach police spokesman said late Monday that he could not confirm  that an arrest was made.  </P> <P> "We were there to make a point," Rubin said. "We want to expose these people to  the light of the day."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, conference participants exchanged angry words with several  residents of Old World Village, who said they had no idea the group was meeting  there until they read about it in the newspaper.  </P> <P> Three plainclothes police officers were keeping an eye on things during the  meeting, and several conference participants acting as security guards were  stationed outside the basement of the German Community Church, where the  meeting was held.  </P> <P> Old World Village is a condominium and commercial development built to resemble  a Bavarian village where shopkeepers live on the grounds and a homeowners'  association owns and manages the common grounds. Since 1982, however, the  development has been embroiled in legal disputes, and it has been in  receivership for the last 2 years.  </P> <P> Much of the animosity generated Monday by the Historical Review conference  appeared intertwined with the legal disputes, which essentially have pitted the  owner of the building where the meeting took place against the rest of the  shopkeepers and homeowners. The building owner agreed to allow the conferees to  meet without consulting the other village owners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expressions of Anger  </P> <P> But the mere presence of an estimated 200 people attending the Ninth  International Revisionist Conference, which was forced to move from two Costa  Mesa hotels after protests from the JDL, also sparked expressions of anger,  outrage and hurt from many of the village residents.  </P> <P> Lony Hauff, owner of the Rathskeller restaurant, said conference participants  had insulted his customers, calling them "Jews and traitors."  </P> <P> "We don't like this," Hauff said. "We don't need these kind of people here."  </P> <P> "I never was a Nazi, or a Jew," said Gene Pilz, a customer at the restaurant.  "I never was a traitor."  </P> <P> In one conversation witnessed by a reporter, Georges Theil, a conference  participant from France, told bridal shop owner Pat Weiss that the Holocaust  did not happen.  </P> <P> When Weiss told Theil that several of her relatives were killed in Nazi  concentration camps, he responded that there were no gas chambers and that  perhaps Weiss' relatives did not disappear.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You Are a Liar'  </P> <P> "You are a liar!" Weiss said.  </P> <P> "There were no gas chambers!" Theil shot back. "You need the gas chamber! You  need the gas chamber!"  </P> <P> Weiss, unable to control her anger, spat on Theil, who then turned to a  reporter and said, "They are hysterical people here."  </P> <P> Tom Marcellus, director of the Costa Mesa-based Institute for Historical  Review, said the presence of the conference at the village represented a  victory for free speech and a defeat for the JDL.  </P> <P> He said that despite the JDL's efforts to stop the meeting, which was attended  by delegates from South Africa, Sweden, Germany, Japan, France, England,  Switzerland, Canada and the United States, the group had managed to have a full  conference "by hopscotching around."  </P> <P> After both the Red Lion Inn and the Holiday Inn in Costa Mesa refused to allow  the group to meet there, Marcellus said the conference moved to the Huntington  Beach Inn and, finally, to the village.  </P> <P> When asked why he agreed to rent to the Historical Review, Joseph Bischof, a  native of Germany who designed the village, said, "Why shouldn't I?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Want to Correct History'  </P> <P> "I know that there is a lot of truth to what they say," Bischof said. "They  want to correct history. I know that they didn't even have 6 million Jews in  Europe. How could they have killed that many?"  </P> <P> As for the complaints of the other shop owners, Bischof dismissed them by  saying, "Some of the store owners are sick."  </P> <P> But Cris Cris, owner of B.M.A. Financial Services in the village, said the  presence of such a group sends a bad message to the public.  </P> <P> "I think it's a bad place to have a meeting," he said, "especially the  connotation with the German village and the Holocaust being a predominately  German thing. It is in very poor taste."  </P> <P> "If they would have brought (the matter) to the homeowners, it wouldn't be  here," added his wife, Cathy Cris. "They shouldn't be allowed anywhere,  particularly here."  </P> <P> Weiss, who was trembling after her encounter with Theil, said that a customer  who read about the conference in a newspaper called her Monday to cancel a  wedding gown she was planning to buy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I resent This'  </P> <P> "She said that under no circumstances would she ever set foot in the village  again," Weiss said. "It makes my skin have goose bumps, having these people  here. I'm a Jew, and I resent this very, very much."  </P> <P> Village employee Cecelia Baca, her eyes brimming with tears, said that nearly  all of the relatives of her Polish grandmother, who was Catholic, were killed  in the Holocaust.  </P> <P> "I don't approve of prejudice in the first place," she said. "The fact that  these people are here, my grandmother is probably turning in her grave."  </P> <P> But such sentiments did not appear to trouble the conference participants, who  said that anybody opposed to their meeting was guilty of prejudice themselves  or was ill-informed.  </P> <P> "If they were more fully informed, they would, perhaps, be less upset," said  Michael Laurence, 38, a technician who had come to the conference from Atlanta,  Ga.  </P> <P> "The point of this conference is to educate people, and our belief is that if  people are educated, they will believe as we do and all upset will be  eliminated," Laurence said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Silly Story'  </P> <P> Conference participant Gerald Domitrovic, an attorney from Wichita, Kan., said  the "real story" was that people were trying to silence the conference.  </P> <P> "The Holocaust is a silly story," he said. "It is silly on its face."  </P> <P> Jurgen Bless, a German Lutheran pastor who was opening up the German Community  Church as the conference continued in the basement below, said he was not  bothered by the presence of those who believe the Holocaust did not occur.  </P> <P> "The Holocaust is being taken too far," he said. "And these people are trying  to set the record straight. And if it is wrong, then the truth will come out.  What it looks like to me is that someone is afraid of what they have to say. .  . . I feel everybody should have the right to say what they think."  </P> <P> But Frank Emma, vice president of the homeowners' association and owner of a  frame shop in the village, said that he and other residents were offended by  the message that the conference participants bring.  </P> <P> "Most of us are hard-working, sincere people," he said. "We don't like Nazis."  </P> <P> With that, Michele Weiss, daughter of Pat Weiss, returned to her home above the  bridal shop and hung the American and the Israeli flag, which pictures the Star  of David, off the balcony.  </P> <P> "We put it out there because I am not afraid of being Jewish," Pat Weiss said.  "We are proud to be Jewish. . . . You just can't argue with these people."  </P></p>

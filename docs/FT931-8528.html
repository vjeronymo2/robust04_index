			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Brazil clinches pipeline accord BRAZIL and Bolivia yesterday finalised an accord - first mooted in 1938 - for a Dollars 3bn project to build one of the world's largest gas pipelines amid considerable uncertainty over the financing. Brazil's President Itamar Franco flew to the Bolivian town of Cochabamba to sign the protocol to begin work on the 3,400km pipeline to supply Bolivian gas to the main industrial centres of Brazil. The first large project of Mr Franco's government, it aims to reduce the country's almost total dependence on oil from the Middle East. It was hailed by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's foreign minister, as a solid achievement for the government. But it is unclear how funds will be raised for such an ambitious project. Bolivia is one of the continent's poorest countries and Brazil continues to wallow in economic crisis; its access to multilateral financing has been inhibited by the collapse of its last accord with the International Monetary Fund. Negotiations are under way with the World Bank and private sector but a Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday: 'We have not yet decided such technical points as finance.' The pipeline will transport daily 8m cubic metres, rising to 16m cu metres, of natural gas from Santa Cruz de la Sierra in southern Bolivia to the six principal cities of southern Brazil. While diversifying Brazil's energy grid it will also reduce pollution and save money; the price agreed is equivalent to Dollars 6 per barrel. The pipeline will provide an important source of new income for Bolivia, which is trying to reduce its dependence on tin and coca leaf. Previously all its gas was sold to Argentina. The signing of the accord is an important victory for the Sao Paulo business community which has long been lobbying for it against heavy opposition from Petrobras, the state oil company which fears its monopoly will be threatened. On the eve of Mr Franco's departure for Bolivia, Petrobras officials were still trying to turn him against the idea, arguing it would be better to buy from Paraguay.</p>

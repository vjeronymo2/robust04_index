			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Abbey National to act on 40m unclaimed free shares THE FATE of 40m Abbey National shares, lying unclaimed since the bank's stock market flotation in July 1989, will be announced today. The unclaimed shares are currently worth about Pounds 125m. They represent about 3 per cent of shares issued by the group to its former members when it shed building society status and became a bank, each member receiving 100 shares worth 131p each. Abbey National said yesterday that as three years had passed since the flotation, it was now able to take action. It did not indicate what the action would be but it could dispose of some of the remainder by placing them with a charity or selling them in the market. It is unlikely to favour placing a large number of its shares on the market at one time. Former members of the building society who have not already done so will be entitled to claim their shares for a further three year period.</p>

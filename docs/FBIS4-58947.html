			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Ghallab and Jihad 'Abd-al-Mun'im at the </F> People's Assembly]    [Excerpts] The People's Assembly members yesterday warned  against the increasing U.S. grants that help the government levy  more taxes on Egyptians. They demanded that these grants be  dedicated to productive services like water and electricity.    The members objected to the interference of the American  Agency for International Development in the work of artisan  associations through the extension of direct loans. They  described AID requests for detailed information about the  artisan associations involved as an attempt to obtain Egyptian  secrets and thus establish U.S. control of craftsmen.    The Assembly members pointed out that the agreement to grant  small business loans entitles AID to deal directly with any  association demanding a loan provided that association agrees to  submit its activity to inspection by AID auditors without  interference by the Egyptian Government. The members said that  the Government has thus waived its rights and created a state  within a state.    People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Fathi Surur was asked why the  Egyptian Government has relinquished its powers and left the  associations on their own with AID. Once a grant is given by  anyone, it becomes Egyptian. The Government has agreed to let  associations benefit from AID grants, he said.    State Minister for International Cooperation Dr. Yusuf  Butrus-Ghali said that the associations have requested to deal  directly with AID and they have rejected the government's  intervention on the excuse that it delays loans. [passage  omitted]    Some members expressed their fears that the U.S. side might  specify the associations that will receive loans. Dr. Surur  asked the state minister if the United States is entitled to  determine which association gets a loan. Dr. Butrus-Ghali  replied: The Egyptian Government specifies the associations  that can get loans, provided that they have a certified board of  directors. He added that 23,000 have obtained loans, averaging  2,200 Egyptian pounds. The rate of repayment is 98.5 percent, he  said.    MP Salah Tawfiq remarked that the grant in its entirety will  not even solve the problems of 4,000 craftsmen in Egypt, where  there are millions of craftsmen. He rejected U.S. patronage of  craftsmen, noting that the grant might harm Egypt through loans  that result in U.S. control of craftsmen. [passage omitted]</p>

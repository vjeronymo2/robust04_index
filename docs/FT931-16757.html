			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television No matter how many excellent documentaries they make about prisons - and there has been a fair number of them in the past five years - I suspect they make not a jot of difference to the average British citizen's conviction that sentencing is too lenient and prisons not nearly grim enough. Prisoner On the Run on ITV at 10.40 takes the case of an absconding 'lifer', and through it examines the arguments being made for reforming the life-sentence or abolishing it altogether. It may be a minority view but I find the hidden world of prisons a good deal more absorbing than hospitals. But Operation Hospital, a new series beginning tonight on C4 at 8.30, may yet change my mind. The series offers a fly-on-the-wall view of life at King's College, the inner London teaching hospital which faces particularly difficult decisions about reshaping to meet the future. For Love of Money (C4 at 9.00), the irritatingly trivial programme about antiques which used to appear as part of 'Without Walls', has now developed a life of its own. A treat tonight will be the appearance of Jeremy Paxman, explaining why he collects stuffed fish.</p>

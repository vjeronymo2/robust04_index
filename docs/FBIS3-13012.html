			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Cover for the al-Khalil Debacle"] </F>   [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.    The United States has embarked on an action in  Bosnia-Herzegovina calculated to divert world public opinion  from the catastrophe of the Hebron massacre. The U.S. F-16s  confronted the Serb fighter planes and downed four of them.    Even though this action was endorsed by NATO, it resembles  more a "willful action" on the part of Washington in order to  overshadow Israel's atrocity. The world's public is still  fiercely and categorically protesting against the Zionists'  crime--of killing fasting worshipers in the shrine of Prophet  Abraham (peace be upon him) more than ever before. In the  occupied territories, the Palestinians have also entered the  fray with all their being against the Zionist armed forces.    In such circumstances, the U.S. action against the Serbs is  more a decision to deliver Israel from the pressure of world  public opinion than a move to chastise the Serbs, in order to  defuse the importance and sensitivity of the debacle, and the  carnage of Muslims at the hands of the Zionists, by trying to  eclipse it with reports on Bosnian issues.    In addition, this will also provide Washington and NATO  members with the opportunity to project it as a decisive blow  against the Serbs and to douse the inflamed sentiments of the  world regarding the overt and covert collusion of the West and  the savage Serbs and to give the impression that it did not  remain an idle spectator. Washington's action can also be  construed as ridiculing Russia. The Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev had earlier warned the West that every action  with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina should be coordinated with  Moscow. Thus, by means of this willful act, Washington tried to  convey the impression that it reserves the right to take the  initiative in Bosnia-Herzegovina and does not need any  coordination with Moscow.    This means that the downing of some Serb planes can be  considered a multi-pronged maneuver from the vantage point of  Washington without any overt negative aspects for the United  States, especially since it could also serve to divert the  wounded sensitivities of the Islamic world from the bitter  Hebron incident toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. This would be like  saying that the United States is not the enemy of Muslims  everywhere and it has taken action at least in their favor in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    If this is the posture favored by Washington, then it is  certain that Washington will not take any more such actions and  will constantly seek to magnify this particular action from its  propaganda loudspeakers. The reason is clear. Reports received  from Bosnia-Herzegovina show that the Muslim-inhabited areas  continue to be repeatedly bombed by Serb and Croat airplanes.  Therefore, in order to preempt questions by the world public on  its taking a stance against the Serbs, it has taken this action  to prove that it can enter the fray against these crimes and if  it stops midway, naturally this would be attributed to the  European members of NATO.    In clearer terms, it means that Washington wants to show  that  it wishes to confront the Serbs, but it is the European coterie  of NATO, in which there is no consensus in this regard. This  vantage point is more in harmony with Washington's past  propaganda, as Washington has constantly sought to exonerate  itself from being accused of prevarication and indecisiveness in  its approach to Serbian crimes.    Despite all the above, the heinous atrocities of Israel in  the occupied territories should not be eclipsed by other events.  Following the pogrom in the al-Ibrahimi shrine--instead of  adopting a more peace-seeking attitude--Israel has intensified  its crimes. Israel has attributed this massacre to a demented  individual. If one such lunatic an commit such a crime, there  is no dearth of such serial madmen in the chain of command in  the Israeli armed forces and who will naturally continue to  threaten, intimidate, torture, and kill every Palestinian at  every moment in their homes, mosques, and streets.    All the facts and figures indicate that this time the  Palestinians have entered the arena with greater strength and  determination as they sense, with all their being, that their  existence and life is linked to revenge on the Zionists and only  revenge on the enemy-- with all its serious dimensions--will  make the bestial usurpers regret and refrain from greater crime  and slaughter.    It is precisely for this reason that a seething wave of  protests, strikes, and uprisings has erupted all over occupied  Palestine and without any regard for the treacherous  compromising faction, the Palestinians are prepared to tackle  the Zionists decisively. It seems highly unlikely that the  deterrent and defensive actions by Israel will prove effective  in combating this tidal wave of fury and general hatred in the  occupied territories.    The closure of the al-Ibrahimi shrine and promises of  reparations cannot heal the wounded sensitivities of the  Muslims, nor can it lessen the extent of the protest. By  pledging to pay reparations, Israel has resorted to a new ploy,  that, on the one hand it can carry out the butchery of  Palestinian Muslims, and on the other hand it can pay  reparations as blood money. In this manner, Israel is in fact  paying blood money for its own victims so that it can continue  perpetrating its crimes with a free hand. In fact, by offering  to pay compensation, the Zionists are diverting the issue from  its main path and are attempting to depict it as an accidental  and unwanted occurrence, while it is really a preplanned and  willful action in which the Israeli armed forces certainly  played the primary role.    In addition, such a proposal also indicates that pressure is  so great on Israel that it is forced to promise compensation and  naturally the Palestinians will not agree and will not settle  for anything less than the impeachment and penalizing of the  agents of this crime and by revenge on the savage Zionists.</p>

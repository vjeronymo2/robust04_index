			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BORDER LIGHTS  </P> <P> The people who wish to light up the border throw aside accusations that they  are racists by claiming that they want only to draw attention to Mexican  citizens who come across the border illegally and prompt Mexico's government  and ours to stop this flow of human traffic.  </P> <P> The debate as to whether or not they're really racists could go on and on,  without perceptions from either side of the argument changing.  </P> <P> The reality, however, is: Those who light up the border don't seem to realize  that their headlights cast long, depressing shadows on the proud human beings  who, through their hopes and dreams, seek only to better their lives and the  lives of their loved ones.  </P> <P> No matter how one feels about this social issue, be it an issue of racism or  not, no one struggling to survive deserves to have her or his dream turned into  a nightmare by beams of light shining from the vehicles of people who enjoy the  freedom and lifestyle they desire.  </P> <P> None of us has the answer, but we can't begin to solve the problems at our  border until we dim our lights and try to understand in a spirit of compassion.  </P> <P> ERNIE McCRAY  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

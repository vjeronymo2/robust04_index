			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME ENTERTAINMENT: CENTER SPEAKER IS LAST WORD IN SOUND SYSTEM  </P> <P> In this day of stereo everything, why would anyone want to buy just one  speaker? Perhaps you'd rather concentrate on Paul and John, ignoring George and  Ringo. Then again, maybe you've been contemplating adding a center-front  speaker to your surround-sound system.  </P> <P> A center-front channel adds a great deal to the enjoyment of  surround-sound-encoded movies. The addition of a center-front channel means  that the dialogue will be "locked on" to the screen, no matter where a viewer  sits in the room. In addition to dialogue, today's movie soundtracks use the  center-front channel for explosive sound effects and drama-enhancing music.  With all this work to do, quality is important -- you shouldn't use just any  old speaker.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, most high-quality speakers are sold only in pairs. To get the  speaker you want, it may be necessary to find a friend who also needs a single  speaker, and buy a pair to share -- or, buy a pair, and leave those unused  dollars languishing in a box on a shelf in the garage.  </P> <P> Yamaha, responding to the plight of surround-sound enthusiasts, is offering a  high-quality speaker designed specifically for use at the center-front  position.  </P> <P> The new speaker, designated as the NS-C70, is magnetically shielded so it can  sit directly on top of or underneath a television set without interfering with  the picture quality. (Speakers use magnets to move their cones, and so to  reproduce sound. Unshielded magnets can cause bizarre changes on the face of a  TV's picture tube, including color disturbances and the distortion of on-screen  objects.)  </P> <P> The Yamaha NS-C70 is long and low, not your typically rectangular speaker. Its  dimensions are 17.5 inches wide by 5.35 inches tall by 6.25 inches deep. The  face of the speaker is slanted at a 15-degree angle, so depending on which side  you place up, the sound can be directed down from the top of a TV or up from  under the TV screen. Because of its shape, this speaker would also be at home  mounted on the ceiling or floor.  </P> <P> The speaker contains two 4-inch, full-range drivers. It is rated at 6 ohms,  with a frequency response of 70 to 20,000 Hz. The NS-C70 is finished in black,  with a black grill cloth. Its suggested retail price is $119.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Camcorder Kit  </P> <P> If you own a full-size VHS camcorder, let me introduce you to the Scotch brand  camcorder kit, from the 3M Company. All in one box you'll find: a head-cleaning  tape, a Pro/Camera T-120 blank videocassette tape, a roll of Re-Label tape (for  marking cassettes) and a cleaning kit for camera lenses. The lens-cleaning kit  includes, in its own clear plastic box, a brush with a built-in squeeze bulb to  blow dust away, a package of lens-cleaning tissue and a one-ounce bottle of  special, lens-cleaning fluid. You'll find the Scotch camcorder care kit (for  full-size VHS camcorders only) in most stores that sell videotape. It lists for  under $30.  </P> <P> Laser Video Discs  </P> <P> Laser Video File is the name of a catalogue that announces it offers "The  Complete List of Laser Video Discs, Over 4,000 titles in all!" Without  counting, I must assume the title is accurate. At any rate, this little 5- by  8-inch paperback book contains 240 pages jammed with titles of movies, music  videos, and material catering to special interests.  </P> <P> Each page holds 18 listings. The listings include a postage-stamp-size black  and white photo of the disc's jacket, a short description of the program, the  name of its current distributor and the year of release. A coded panel gives  the following information: catalogue number, sound (mono, stereo, digital,  etc.), indication if the soundtrack is CX encoded, color or black and white,  CAV or CLV, its theatrical rating (PG, R, etc.), running time in minutes,  number of sides, and suggested retail price.  </P> <P> Laser Video File (Vol. 2, No. 1 is the current issue) includes 12-inch, 8-inch  and 5-inch (CDV) disc titles. Its cover lists a suggested retail price of  $3.50, though I'm sure many laser-disc stores will be happy to give you one  with your next laser videodisc purchase. Laser Video File is produced by New  Visions Inc. and Pioneer LDCA. For the name of a dealer near you who carries  it, write to P.O. Box 828, Westwood, NJ 07675; telephone number is (201)  712-9500.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEC Folds Its Tent  </P> <P> Last month, NEC announced it was getting out of the home entertainment  equipment business in the United States. All that will remain are the computer  and video game divisions.  </P> <P> I found it hard to believe, but I guess it's true. I suppose they weren't  making enough money; but that surprises me, because their product line of TVs,  VCRs and audio equipment was excellent. In fact, I was eagerly anticipating the  arrival of several of their recently announced units, especially a hot new  audio/video switcher.  </P> <P> With quite a few manufacturers out there producing goods of marginal quality,  it's sad to see a really good one go away. Those of you who own NEC products,  don't worry, NEC will maintain its parts/service network for some time to come.  For those of you who were considering the purchase of NEC products before you  read this, I'd buy what I could of whatever products are still on the shelves.  When those units are gone, there won't be any more.  </P></p>

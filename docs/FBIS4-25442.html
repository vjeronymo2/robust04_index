			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Chinese authorities have stepped up efforts to gag  the domestic media as the concern about defusing social unrest  becomes top priority. New orders for the Chinese press to avoid  divulging state secrets and to steer clear of "sensitive"  matters were given at an unpublicised conference on media  discipline jointly held last month by the Communist Party's  Propaganda Department and the State Bureau of Secrecy.  Instructions have also been given to all ministries and  departments to adopt precautionary measures in handling requests  for information by media other than Xinhua (the New China News  Agency). Informed sources said the conference on media  discipline was called on the instructions of President and party  General Secretary Jiang Zemin, who has for the past year taken a  hard line on propaganda.    Speaking at the conclave, Vice-Chief of Propaganda Gong  Xinhan called upon all media professionals and cadres to "do  well the work of keeping state secrets. News and publication  departments must take secrecy as a major item of discipline,"  said Mr Gong, a former propaganda official in Shanghai who is  considered a protege of Mr Jiang. "The important thing is to  take preventive measures and to provide journalists with the  proper education about keeping state secrets. They (media  workers) must also thoroughly study the regulations on secrecy."  Mr Gong repeated earlier instructions by the Propaganda  Department that the press must do its bit for the reform  enterprise, and must refrain from "making disturbing sounds and  spreading chaos".    Shen Hongying, director of the State Secrecy Bureau,  exhorted  journalists to strike a balance between normal news gathering  and safeguarding state secrets. He called upon them to work  together with their news sources, particularly government units,  to observe laws and regulations on secrecy and to avoid  disclosing state secrets through ignorance or negligence. "We  must do a thorough self-examination concerning secrecy  standards," sources quoted Mr Shen as saying. "Sample checks  must be made (of the work of different media). No stone should  be left unturned in efforts to plug leaks. Mistakes must be  rectified as soon as they are discovered."    In the past two years, Beijing has passed a State Secrecy  Law  as well as a series of Regulations on Safeguarding Secrets in  News and Publications. It is understood that units including  the Propaganda Department, the News and Publication  Administration, and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television  have conducted sessions of "criticism and self-criticism" on how  well staff in media units have obeyed the strictures.    At the same time, the party General Office and the  Propaganda  Department have recently sent directives to party and government  units asking them to be careful when handling the domestic  media. "As a general principle, government departments are  discouraged from granting interviews or providing information to  the media except Xinhua and, on specific occasions, senior media  units such as the People's Daily" said a Beijing-based editor.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNMODEST $53 MILLION  </P> <P> I enjoyed Paul Grein's May 31 article on Bette Midler and the success she and  the "Beaches" sound track album have earned. However, I do take umbrage at one  paragraph: "The smash success of the . . . album is surprising because the film  . . . was only a modest hit and has long since disappeared from movie screens."  </P> <P> The May 31 Daily Variety Film Boxoffice Report lists "Beaches" at No. 11 and  still making money with a plus 163% change and grossing well over $53 million  in 160 days since its release. There's nothing "modest" about $53 million.  </P> <P> The movie is still playing on 345 screens and just opened to good reviews in  Britain and Australia.  </P> <P> GARRY MARSHALL  </P> <P> Director, "Beaches"  </P> <P> Walt Disney Pictures  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

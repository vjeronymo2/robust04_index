			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Low interest rates bolster home sales SALES of homes in the US rose again last month, maintaining a solid recovery fuelled by low interest rates. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single family homes rose to an annual rate of 3.69m homes in June, up 1.9 per cent from May and 11.1 per cent higher than in June 1992. Mr William Chee, the association's president, said the rise reflected low mortgage rates, which have made houses more affordable. He added that sellers were asking for more realistic prices. Home sales growth was strongest in the north-east, where the number of sales rose 14 per cent in June. Sales in the north-east have risen 20 per cent in the last two months, helping to reverse a decline during cold weather earlier this year. Sales also climbed in the south, up 2.9 per cent last month, but fell slightly in the west and, more appreciably, in the Midwest. Economists predicted the strong pace would continue in the second half.</p>

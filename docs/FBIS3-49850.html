"The Muslims made certain new demands that are not in  accordance with the existing EU proposal. Talks on this subject  will resume tomorrow. However, the Serb side is adhering to the  existing proposals and insists on them, so the talks depend on  whether the Muslim side will accept the EU proposals or not,"  Koljevic said in an interview for TV Politika.    He added that "the Muslims demanded fresh territorial  concessions beyond the framework of the EU proposal, that is,  the Franco-German proposal which the Serbs had earlier agreed  to."    "I believe that tomorrow's talks will be decisive. If the  Muslim side rejects the EU proposals, the Serbs will present a  new platform," Koljevic concluded.</p>

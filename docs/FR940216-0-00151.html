			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> JP&hyph;4 production must have also constituted a significant portion of a refiner's 1990 production in order for a significant burden to exist. In its February 1993 proposal, EPA requested comment on what minimum portion of a refinery's 1990 production JP&hyph;4 should have constituted for the circumstance to be extenuating, and several different ratio options were suggested by commenters, as discussed in the RIA. As discussed in the RIA, EPA is requiring that the ratio of the refinery's 1990 JP&hyph;4 production to its 1990 gasoline production must equal or exceed 0.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the adjusted emission baselines of those approved for JP&hyph;4 adjustments are likely to be higher than their actual 1990 baselines (primarily due to increased benzene and aromatics) EPA expects minimal negative environmental affects. Because the number of refineries meeting the criteria is expected to be small and the total production of all such refineries is also small, less gasoline is affected by any baseline adjustments than if the criteria were less stringent. In this situation, EPA believes that any negative environmental effects resulting from the allowed adjustments are justifiably balanced by the reduced burden on qualifying refiners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although EPA is allowing baseline adjustments for the specific circumstances described above, it in no way means this to be a precedent to allow adjustments for actual or so-called extenuating circumstances now or in the future. The language of the Act does not allow EPA to broadly permit baseline adjustments. Additionally, a baseline is neither unrepresentative of 1990, nor incalculable, because of post-1990 changes in crude availability, fuel specifications, fuel markets, etc. Congress certainly knew that such changes could affect baseline determinations, yet in creating the anti-dumping requirements it did not require EPA to consider such factors in determining baselines. In fact, no direction was given to account for two mandated fuel changes, Phase II volatility control and lead phaseout.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is likely that circumstances for which baseline adjustments are not allowed may negatively affect some refiners. However, every refiner will be subject to future changes in markets, fuel quality requirements, etc., all of which will affect the refiner's gasoline quality and ability to comply with its anti-dumping baseline. Thus, except in extreme cases, baseline adjustments due to post-1990 changes which affect refiners would not be practical (due to the myriad circumstances which may exist) nor necessarily fair, and are definitely not supported by the language of the Act nor the intent of Congress. EPA is appropriately not providing for such adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inability to meet these requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not previously discussed, EPA realizes that many unique circumstances will arise regarding the baseline determination. As such, if a refiner or importer is unable to comply with one or more of the requirements specified for baseline determination, it may be allowed to accommodate the lack of compliance in a reasonable, technically sound manner. It must petition EPA for such a variance, and the alternative must be verified by the baseline auditor. The petition may or may not be approved by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Baseline Volume and Emissions Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Individual baseline volumes for refiners, blenders and importers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The individual baseline volume of a refiner which utilizes Methods 1, 2 and or 3-type data to determine its baseline fuel parameters shall be the larger of the total volume of gasoline produced in or shipped from the refinery in 1990, excluding volumes exported. This provision is added because 1990 shipments and production could differ. As discussed in the RIA, while 1990 gasoline shipments actually contributed to emissions, data is available (by Methods 1, 2 or 3) on 1990 gasoline production. The difference between the shipped and produced gasoline is expected to be negligible with respect to baseline determination. Volumes of oxygenates blended into gasoline at the refinery and oxygenate assumed or shown to have been blended into gasoline downstream of the refinery, as discussed in paragraph 3.b, shall be included. The baseline volume shall be determined after all adjustments, such as for work-in-progress or extenuating circumstances, have been performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The individual baseline volume of a blender utilizing only Method 1-type data or having the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline shall be also the larger of the volume of 1990 gasoline produced in or shipped from the refinery (blending facility). The individual baseline volume of an importer utilizing only Method 1 or having the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline shall be the total volume of gasoline imported into the U.S. in 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

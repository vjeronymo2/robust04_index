			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei sees year's biggest fall as Manila surges 5.5% Renewed political worries triggered a fall in the futures market, and the Nikkei average suffered its largest loss of the year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The concern surrounded a possible dissolution of the lower house if the government's political reform bill failed to be enacted during the current parliamentary session. The Nikkei, which on Friday recovered the 18,000 level for the first time in a month, dropped 647.67, or 3.6 per cent, to 17,404.24. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 43.22, or 2.9 per cent, to 1,447.25, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.52 firmer at 1,194.34. Remarks by the ruling and opposition party leaders over the weekend about the possibility of a general election discouraged investors, since that would delay decisions on economic stimulus. Volume totalled 230m shares, against 282m. Declines led rises by 947 to 124, with 103 issues unchanged. The Nikkei index opened at the day's high of 18,025.80 and fell on arbitrage unwinding, hitting a low of 17,383.44 a few minutes before the close. Some traders were discouraged by Friday's announcement that the government will postpone the flotation of Japan Tobacco, the state-owned tobacco and salt monopoly. Although good news for the overall market, traders who bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and East Japan Railway stocks on hopes that they would gain ground before the Japan Tobacco listing, liquidated their holdings. NTT lost Y38,000 to Y751,000 and JR East Y34,000 to Y421,000. Index-linked selling depressed banks. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y70 to Y2,850 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y70 to Y1,780. Brokers were also weak, with Nomura Securities down Y60 to Y1,820 and Nikko Securities off Y40 at Y1,060. In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 412.56 to 19,349.04 in volume of 39.1m shares. Roundup The Pacific Rim saw further records in some markets and heavy profit-taking in others after the strong advances of last week. Bombay remained closed for the fifth consecutive day and hopes for an end to the protest over a ban on forward trading were dashed late yesterday. MANILA saw its biggest one-day jump this year, surging 5.5 per cent to an all-time high on the back of PLDT's rally on Wall Street. The Manila index rose 146.37 to 2,808.80. PLDT hit a year's peak, climbing Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 68 7/8 in the US. On the local market it advanced 125 pesos to 2,010 pesos. HONG KONG extended its bull run with a 2.3 per cent advance to another record high. The Hang Seng index was ahead 245.92 at 10,814.78, after a day's peak of 10,824.36. Buying interest by foreign institutions and small local investors increased in the afternoon after selective demand was triggered by sharp gains in futures. KARACHI finished at another record high, with further strong demand by foreign funds overcoming lower settlement day tendencies. The KSE 100 index was 14.98 stronger at 2,043.90 at the close. NEW ZEALAND opened firmly but turned easier later in the day, still sagging under the weight of new issues and placements in recent weeks. The NZSE-40 capital index ended 7.26 down at 2,073.24. TAIWAN gave up early gains to finish mixed and turnover fell sharply as a consolidation after the recent bull run continued. The weighted index, 76 points ahead at one stage, ended only a net 1.88 higher at 5,204.02, after worries over the Finance Ministry's imminent proposal to impose a stock capital gains tax deterred buying. AUSTRALIA drifted lower in quiet conditions as investors made an early start to the holiday season. The All Ordinaries index closed 4.2 points down at 2,076.0, after peaking at 2,086.6 in early trade. SEOUL saw profit-taking after last week's bull run, leaving the market 1.8 per cent off in thin trade. The composite index slipped 15.37 to 848.63 amid modest volume of 34.11m. SINGAPORE closed easier on profit-taking after last week's continuous rally, with curbs on speculative buying by individual broking houses dampening the mood. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 2.78 at 2,277.48. after an intraday peak of 2,314.89. KUALA LUMPUR retreated in the afternoon to finish broadly lower, with the sharp fall in Tokyo prompting profit-taking. The composite index dipped below the 1,100 support level to end 11.45 down at 1,098.08. BANGKOK receded as investors cashed in profits from recent strong rises in banking, finance and securities shares. The SET index shed 17.12, or 1.1 per cent, to 1,496.71 in active turnover of Bt23.29bn.</p>

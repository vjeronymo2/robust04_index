			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["epd"-attributed report: "Schaeuble: Turkey Cannot Become </F> EU Member"]    [Text] Mainz -- Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]  Bundestag group, yesterday spoke out against Turkish European  Union [EU] membership. "We should make it clear to Turkey that  it cannot become a member of the European Union," Schaeuble told  a meeting of Christian business people in Mainz. By doing so,  one would do Turkey a favor and support the nonfundamentalist  approach in Turkish politics. In Schaeuble's view, only such  countries that are based on the Christian-Western tradition  could be considered for membership to the European Union. This  is why Russia, which apart from its European part also consists  of an Asian part, cannot join the European Union either. At the  same time, Schaeuble spoke out in favor of letting Turkey  participate in the economic advantages resulting from the  process of European unification. He also welcomed Turkish  membership in the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.    Hermann Rappe, chairman of the trade union of chemical  workers, also ruled out Turkish EU membership. In the long  term, however, membership of Central European countries would be  possible.</p>

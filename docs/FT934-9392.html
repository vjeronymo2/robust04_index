			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Euro Disney hit by Pounds 610m loss: US parent under pressure over rescue plan as leisure group's shares fall sharply EURO DISNEY, the European leisure group controlled by Walt Disney of the US, yesterday announced a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 610m) for the year to September 30, prompting a sharp fall in the company's shares on international stock markets. The scale of the losses increases the urgency of a capital restructuring at Euro Disney and puts pressure on Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, to help rescue the leisure company. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, Euro Disney's chairman, said the company would require significant funding throughout the current financial year. He said negotiations were under way with its banks and Walt Disney, and that he hoped to complete a restructuring plan soon. Industry observers said the fate of Euro Disney now rested largely in the hands of Walt Disney, which holds 49 per cent of its shares. 'It is make-your-mind-up time,' one analyst said. Walt Disney said it would provide finance for Euro Disney for a limited period to enable it to achieve a financial restructuring by spring 1994. Euro Disney's losses included a write-off of FFr3.6bn for pre-opening costs at the EuroDisneyland theme park in the eastern outskirts of Paris and for planned redundancies. The exceptional charges represent a serious blow to the company's capital base, reducing shareholders' equity to just FFr1.5bn, compared with FFr7bn at the end of September last year, using French accounting standards. Euro Disney said it had written off all of its pre-opening costs, including marketing and training expenses, to improve its future results. The French theme park has been a growing worry for Walt Disney since it opened 18 months ago. Bad weather has discouraged tourists who have sometimes found it cheaper to go to Disney World in Florida. Mr Bourguignon has taken a number of steps to encourage more visitors and to entice them to part with their money. New rides have been opened, and prices have been reduced sharply at the resort's hotels. Euro Disney reports some success from its measures. Mr Bourguignon also points to the fact that 17m visitors have come through the gates of EuroDisneyland in the first 18 months of its operation, making it, he says, Europe's largest tourist attraction. But even if visitors are being attracted, investors are still wary. Yesterday, Euro Disney's shares fell sharply in London and Paris. In London, shares fell by 72p to 436p after the results announcement. In Paris, shares were temporarily suspended and fell by FFr5.7 to FFr38. The bulk of the losses for the year to September 30 reflected the exceptional charges relating to pre-opening costs and provisions for a planned reduction in staff from 11,100 to just over 10,000. The net loss before exceptional items was FFr1.7bn, which was achieved on revenues of FFr5.7bn. In view of the uncertainty surrounding Euro Disney, Walt Disney took a Dollars 350m (Pounds 231.7m) charge against fourth-quarter earnings to establish full reserves for the temporary funding and for receivables due from the French associate. Walt Disney's charge, together with its share of Euro Disney's operating losses, meant the US company recorded a total Dollars 414.5m loss from the European venture in the quarter and Dollars 514.7m in the full year. That in turn pushed Walt Disney into a fourth quarter net loss of Dollars 77.8m, compared with net income of Dollars 223.7m in the same period of last year. After heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Walt Disney's shares finished unchanged at Dollars 41 1/8.

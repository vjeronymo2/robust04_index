			<p>BFN     [Text] Czestochowa, 30 May -- The government will not hold  bilateral talks with any trade union, Leszek Miller, labor and  social policy minister, announced at a news conference in  Czestochowa today.    According to Miller, the aim of Solidarity is not to hold  negotiations on their demands, for which the best place would be  a the tripartite commission, but to bring about negotiations  solely between the government and Solidarity. The demonstration  in Warsaw on 27 May was held in order to achieve this, among  other things.    "The government will not conduct any bilateral talks with  trade unions. First, there exists a third party, namely  employers. Second, the government cannot conduct separate  negotiations on similar demands with a different trade union  confederation on each occasion. Taking into account the number  of trade union confederations, the government would do nothing  but negotiate and would not have time to implement anything,"  the labor minister said.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Optimism costs smelters dear ALUMINIUM PRODUCERS had only themselves to blame for present excess supply, high stocks and low prices, suggested Mr Ivor Kirman, marketing director of Inco Europe, yesterday. He said metals businesses could broadly be classified into two groups - those run by optimists and those run by realists. 'Metals (industries) which were run by optimists typically have expanded capacity too fast, now have more than 30 per cent over-capacity and have built up substantial finished stocks. Examples include aluminium and charge chromium (ferrochrome). 'Metals run by realists typically have capacity only marginally over current demand and have built up limited stocks. Examples include copper and nickel,' Mr Kirman pointed out at a Canadian Mining Investment seminar in London. The aluminium industry was already heading for over-capacity before its position was further worsened by the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the sudden jump in its aluminium exports, he insisted. Mr Kirman said the 'realists' were clearly in better shape to weather the present recession and would be the first to benefit from any price recovery. 'The optimists are currently suffering and will have to wait for their reward until later in the decade.' Experience suggested that when stocks of a metal were less than about six weeks consumption there was the potential for any significant demand improvement to lead to a dramatic price rise, Mr Kirman pointed out. Conversely, if stocks exceeded three to four months consumption, there would be enough metal to meet restocking demand and prices were unlikely to flare up. 'Between the two is an interesting area where price will be most strongly influenced by the actual behaviour of producers, converters and fabricators.' At present copper stocks represented five to six weeks of consumption; nickel stocks six to eight weeks; zinc, six to eight weeks; aluminium eight to ten weeks; charge chrome 12 to 15 weeks and molybdenum 40 weeks. On this basis, 'nickel and copper are in relatively good shape, aluminium less so, charge chrome and molybdenum look like sad cases requiring a long, sustained demand boom to move prices dramatically'. Mr Kirman said that the greatest uncertainty in the metals markets was about 'distress' exports from the former Soviet Union. Confusion was likely to last at least another year. 'While it reigns, decision making in the metals industry will be even riskier than usual.' Inco, the western world's biggest nickel producer, estimated that the Commonwealth of Independent States produced about 300,000 tonnes of nickel last year and consumed domestically 160,000 tonnes. This left 30,000 tonnes for export to the former eastern bloc countries and 110,000 for export to the west. This year CIS production would be down but domestic consumption was likely to fall even further.</p>

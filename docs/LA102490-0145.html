S. Geological Survey at Menlo Park and its epicenter was 16 miles east of  Bridgeport and 5 miles north of Lee Vining in a remote section of Mono County.  </P> <P> "We have had no reports of damage yet," said Tom Flynn of the state Office of  Emergency Services.  </P> <P> The Times received calls from Fresno about the quake and news agencies and  emergency agencies in San Francisco and Sacramento areas were flooded with  calls.  </P> <P> Reports of the temblor came in from Manteca, San Francisco, Sacramento and  Stockton.  </P> <P> Karen Hodges, editor of the Manteca Bulletin, said the newspaper received six  calls within minutes after the quake.  </P> <P> "It was a rolling, strong jolt and lasted about 25 seconds," said Manteca  resident Robin Bergmann.  </P> <P> Gamblers at Lake Tahoe reported being shaken out of their chairs but no damage  was reported at the casinos there or in Reno.  </P> <P> Only two rock slides were reported in Mono County center of the quake and there  were no injuries said Sheriff's Deputy Suzanne Sturdivant.  </P> <P> "We had lots of calls," she said.  </P> <P> The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to ground motion  as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one digit represents a tenfold  increase of magnitude.  </P></p>

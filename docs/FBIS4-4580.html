			<p>BFN     [Text] Leopoldo Mabilangan, alias Comrade Hector, former  spokesman of the Merlito Glor Command [of the New People's Army]  based in Mt. Banahaw, was shot dead by unknown assailants in  Batangas yesterday [3 April]. A witness said Mabilangan was  preparing to attend a wedding ceremony in Santo Tomas Church  when he was shot. Police Chief of Staff General Percival Adiong  said the killing of Mabilangan would be thoroughly investigated.  He said the murder would affect peace talks between communist  rebels and the government. Doctors said Mabilangan had three  gunshot wounds, under his head, face, and neck.    Meantime, Malacanang [presidential office] condemned the  killing of Comrade Hector Mabilangan, saying it can set back the  government's search for peace. Press Secretary Jesus Sison said  that President Ramos, who has been informed about the killing,  was determined to see to it that the peace process will not be  adversely affected.    DILG [Department of Interior and Local Government] Secretary  Rafael Alunan III deplored the killing of Mabilangan. Alunan  said the killing was an affront to the citizenry, who upholds  the value of human life and the preeminence of civil order over  any form of criminality. He expressed the government's  determination to pursue the program of peace with the  collaboration of the enlightened leadership of the rebel groups.    House Speaker Jose De Venecia and former National  Unification  Commission member Eduardo Ermita were also saddened by  Mabilangan's killing. De Venecia has regretted that Comrade  hector had to die at the height of his efforts to improve the  lives of his people. He urged authorities to facilitate  investigation of the killing and apprehend and punish the  perpetrators of the crime. For his part, Ermita was hopeful  that the killing will not be a hindrance to the ongoing peace  process.</p>

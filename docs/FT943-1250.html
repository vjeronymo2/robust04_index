			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Brussels may act to curb bank charges for money transfers European Union banks may face increased pressure to limit double charging and hidden costs on internal cross-border payments and speed up the rate at which they are carried out. Such pressure, from the European Commission, might take the form of an EU directive. It would be aimed at easing the costs on consumers and small businesses that rely on banks to make transfer payments within the EU, and would remove an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the single market. Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirasi, commissioner responsible for the single market, told ministers at a meeting in eastern Germany that the pressure on banks to stop double charging - imposing fees at the sending and receiving end of a transfer - had to be stepped up. However, he sought to allay bank fears by emphasising that any legislation would not be 'heavy or intrusive' but the minimum necessary to improve the current situation. The need for action follows a survey, ordered by the Commission, which found that many banks were not complying with EU targets, set at the end of last year, on double charging, transparency and the time taken to complete a transfer. The targets decreed that cross-border transfers should not attract double charging and that banks had to provide clients with complete written information on the costs involved in payments. An initial report last year said charges were duplicated in 43 per cent of transactions. It found found that 'on average a 100 ecu cross-border transaction cost 20 ecus'. Banks were also required to complete the cross-border transaction on the first working day after receiving the request. Mr Vanni D'Archirasi's inclination to take legislative action is likely to lead to a row in the Commission. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner responsible for consumer affairs, believes a voluntary code of conduct for banks would be more appropriate. The banking lobby has also mounted an effective campaign against legislation, arguing that regulation might result in banks withdrawing their services altogether. They argue that tough requirements on speed might cause banks to refuse to execute payments to EU countries with less efficient payment systems. The European Community Banking Federation wrote to Mr Vanni D'Archirasi in the summer urging pragmatic joint action between banks and the Commission and objecting to a draft plan on cross-border payments. On double charging, the federation argued that the Commission should recognise the merits of offering customers a choice of charging arrangements. However, not all banks oppose legislation. Some believe that the present arrangements discriminate against banks that stick to the guidelines. They would like legislation to make standards conform.</p>

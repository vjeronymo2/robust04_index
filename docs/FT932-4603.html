			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (20): A kid on the block - Taiwan AFTER two years of courting inter- national aerospace companies with a cash pile in inverse proportion to its knowledge, Taiwan Aerospace Company has finally arranged a deal which will give Taiwan an embryo civil aviation industry by the end of 1994, writes Simon Davies. But the company has a long way to go before it can prove that money can buy anything. Mr Tsai Fen-doe, a former legislator and engineer of Taiwan's push into aerospace, admits: 'Taiwan cannot say that in 10 to 20 years it will be a major competitor in the world aerospace industry. We would be laughed at.' Taiwan's vehicle industry provides an unfortunate precedent: it remains over-protected and uncompetitive. It has failed even to develop the capability for manufacturing engines. TAC also derives from a government decision that it should evolve from its low-cost manufacturing roots. The view is that Taiwan should develop capital and technology-intensive industries. The aerospace push is being made via a company only 29 per cent owned by the government, to give it a more independent and competitive edge. Local companies were persuaded to put up the rest of TAC's TDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 30m) start-up capital. The group started with big ideas. As one aerospace expert claims: 'They were sitting on top of a pile of money. But they hadn't manufactured one single part of a plane and they were under a lot of pressure to find a deal.' The first stop was McDonnell Douglas, where Taiwan Aerospace proposed to invest Dollars 2bn to develop a new generation of super-jumbo jets. But critics argued the world was not ready for this. Legislators succeeded in blocking the deal and forcing out Mr David Huang, the TAC chairman. Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, says there has since been a change in focus. 'I have to strike a delicate balance between medium-term profitability and long-term investment. I have to walk a fine line.' He argues that even in the best-case scenario, the McDonnell deal would not have reaped profits for more than a decade. The Dollars 250m purchase of 50 per cent of British Aerospace's regional aviation business represents a more practical approach to Taiwan's ambition of an evolving aerospace industry. It appears to balance the strengths of the two partners. Taiwan has an abundance of capital, access to a booming market for short-haul transportation and expertise in aerospace assembly. British Aerospace has a product, but it lacks capital and an active marketplace. One of the keys to the link-up is the fact that now Taiwan has gained access to foreign jet fighters, it no longer has any need for its Indigenous Defence Fighters, the jets that it developed when Beijing blocked foreign arms sales to Taiwan. Mr Tsai argues: 'You cannot separate the aerospace ambitions from the defence plan. Defence was always Taiwan's priority, but now we have F16s and Mirages, we have to consider how to utilise this excess manpower from defence.' The new RJ (which stands for Regional Jet) range will be manufactured in the Aero Industry Development Centre, taking up slack from the slowdown of the fighters assembly line. Mr Ko says the Defence Ministry has already agreed to lease out part of this operation for civil production. The new production base is at the mouth of a potential goldmine of demand. Taiwan will produce its first RJ aircraft only by the end of 1994, by which time Taiwan and China may have agreed on direct flights across the Taiwan straits. Economists expect that more than 3m Taiwanese will make the short hop across the Taiwan straits to China in the first year of direct flights, creating a market for small jets, such as the RJ. Even without this, Taiwan is in the centre of one of the world's few high growth aviation centres. Mr Ko claims: 'We are still a new kid on the block, and we have to prove ourselves. For the next two years, the industry has problems and we'll take the opportunity to learn. Then people can take us seriously.' They are already doing so. Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls-Royce chairman, recently visited Taiwan to discuss setting up a jet engine manufacturing operation for the development of a twin engine addition to the RJ series, to be called the RJX. TAC has also set up a maintenance joint venture with Singapore Aerospace, and may enter the helicopter industry. Shareholders are currently being asked to increase TAC's capital base to its target of TDollars 5.2bn. The government will take up its share, but some backers have been less willing to back the venture. They have cause for scepticism. There is little precedent in Asia, where economic powerhouses such as Japan and South Korea have failed to develop a civil aviation manufacturing industry, beyond the production of individual components. Taiwan has progressed beyond that, and Mr Ko is now looking to joint venture partners to produce key components for the RJ. But it will take time and money for this basic assembly line to evolve into a vertically-integrated aerospace industry.</p>

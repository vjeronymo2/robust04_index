			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is another imminent shortage of bank notes.  The alert was given by an economic magazine, LE STANDARD. In  an article in today's issue, written by its editor and director,  Gaston Mutamba, the newspaper reported that the reservation of  bank notes has started again in certain cases.    The banks can no longer offer any liquidity at their  counters. Our colleague also stressed that people are no longer  making cash savings because, according to him, businessmen have  hurriedly reconstituted their cash stocks. Also, the  skyrocketing inflation and speculation force them to take  precautions by getting rid of the national currency for the  benefit of foreign exchange. This is a serious situation,  Gaston Mutamba revealed. He observed that the Central Bank is  no longer in a position to print new bank notes because it owes  foreign printers about $50 million.    It can also be read in LE STANDARD that the Central Bank  could remedy the situation by printing bank notes locally after  importing the necessary materials, but the problem will remain  wholly unsolved. Our colleague asked where the necessary  dollars would be obtained since the country has not got  sufficient foreign exchange. An imminent shortage of bank notes  is therefore feared in the official channels of the economy, the  LE STANDARD official said. For him, this shortage could have  occurred earlier if the two Kasais had accepted to do  transactions with the new currency.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Poverty the angel of death in Rio: A multiple murder among the street children of Brazil TWO pairs of torn canvas plimsolls with no laces and a grubby, bloodstained blanket were all that remained yesterday of seven Rio de Janeiro street children alleged to have been murdered by policemen. The boys, aged between 12 and 17, and a youth of 22 were killed on Friday morning while sleeping at the door of the Candelaria church in the heart of Rio. The spot has been marked by a makeshift shrine and a primitive wooden cross. Late on Sunday night, three policemen were taken into custody after being identified as the gunmen by Wagner dos Santos, a 22-year-old veteran of the streets of Rio and one of the survivors of the massacre. 'I will never forget that night even if I live 100 years - they must pay for what they did,' he said yesterday as he recovered from two bullet wounds. Another child is still in a critical condition. But few expect real action to be taken to improve the lot of the thousands of children living on the streets of Brazil's big cities. In 1990, the London-based human rights organisation Amnesty International ran a series of advertisements: 'Brazil has found a new way of taking its children off the streets - killing them.' Despite such pressure, the trouble has worsened since then. According to police records, in the first six months of this year 320 children were murdered in Rio - more than in the whole of 1991 - and aid agencies estimate that between two and four children are being killed in the city by death squads every night. The problem is that the very people responsible for preventing crime are involved. Mr Paulo Melo, a former street child who is now a state assemblyman, says: 'Rarely does an extermination gang not contain a policeman. Everyone knows who the murderers are and where to find them, but people are scared to give evidence.' He points out that a federal congressional commission in 1991 named policemen involved but no action was taken. More chilling still is the fact that there is considerable support for the killings in a society which has become one of the most violent in the world. Forced into the streets by poverty, the children, who are usually black, survive through petty crime, often becoming involved in drugs and prostitution. Many local people, call them 'animals' and see their deaths as 'cleansing'. Shopkeepers and hoteliers are believed to fund this 'cleansing'. After the latest massacre, the overwheming majority of people calling a phone-in on CBN national radio in Brazil approved of the killings and, at the shrine yesterday, a man who identified himself only as Jorge, said: 'These children have been sent where they belong. We should kill them all'. Poverty is at the root of the problem. According to the government, 43m Brazilians, including 18m children, live in absolute poverty with a monthly family wage the equivalent of less than Dollars 15. The trouble has been compounded by the national economic stagnation of the last 13 years and the movement since 1960 of more than 40m people from the countryside to the cities, which are now appallingly overcrowded. This is particularly clear in Rio, where a third of the population lives in slums and, at night, small bundles that are children can be seen in shop and church doorways, traffic tunnels and on the roadsides. Iron bars have been erected around public parks in the smart district of Ipanema to prevent the children entering. Mr Ronofri Cabral, a worker from Petrobras, the state oil company, who had brought his 12-year-old son to the shrine, said: 'This all comes down to the failure of the state to provide a decent wage. What we should ask is why children, many of whom have families, are living in the streets without food, clothing or shelter.' The work of those fighting to defend street children is hindered by controversy over how many there are, with estimates ranging as high as 7m for all Brazil. Mr Liborni Siqueira, a juvenile court magistrate in Rio, attacked yesterday what he calls the industria da crianca (child industry). He explains: 'There are little more than 600 children living in the streets of Rio and 302 institutions claiming to be helping them. That's crazy. These groups have no interest in taking children off the streets while they can get dollars from overseas agencies for supposedly helping them.' Amid rising international pressure Brazil's President Itamar Franco, who has been in Rio since Saturday to monitor investigations, yesterday directed the foreign ministry to assure governments, particularly in Europe where the EC has expressed its concern, that all possible action is being taken. He blamed the developed world: 'The poverty and misery that exists here is often caused by the industrialised countries, which place obstacles in the way of our search for science and technology'.</p>

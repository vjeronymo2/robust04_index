			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: Fears that self-assessment will hinder small business NEW PROPOSALS designed to allow the self-employed to assess their own tax liabilities could make life more difficult for small businesses, it was said yesterday. Under the new arrangements the self-employed would calculate their own tax liabilities on the basis of estimated profit made in their current trading year, rather than the present system under which tax paid in the current year reflects profits made in the previous year. Mr Tony Miller of the Federation of Small Businesses said: 'Under the guise of simplification, it is a way of transferring many Inland Revenue responsibilities to taxpayers.' He said the proposals would destroy the 'finality and certainty' of taxpayers' affairs, since the Inland Revenue would be able to go back over returns lodged in the previous four years in normal circumstances, or 20 years if the Revenue suspected negligence. Mr Ian Luder, vice president of the Institute of Taxation, said: 'For the self-employed, this will be a shifting of the administrative burden from the revenue to the taxpayer.' Far more self-employed people will be forced to employ accountants, although other taxpayers affected by the new measures will find them simplified. Reflecting scepticism among the accountancy profession, Mr Clive Mackintosh, tax partner with Price Waterhouse, said: 'When it comes down to it, it won't reduce your liabilities or simplify your affairs. 'I'm not a great enthusiast. I don't think the present system is too bad. It enables you to draw up and agree an assessment with the Revenue before paying tax.' Mr Mackintosh warned that the new system could leave some small businesses with cashflow problems and could lead to complicated negotiations to reconcile estimated with actual profits. 'It is all very well as long as your profits continue to rise. But if you are self-employed your profits can go up and down and it may not be possible to make accurate estimates.'</p>

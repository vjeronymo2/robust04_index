			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH speaks about  renewed U.S. support for Israel, asserting that Israeli conduct  that obstructs peace depends on continued U.S. support.    The paper urges Washington to adopt an independent policy  toward the Arab-Israeli conflict or to deal impartially with  this hot issue, so as to champion justice, international  legitimacy, and the UN Charter and resolutions, as well as its  credibility as a superpower entrusted by the Arabs and the  world, but not by Israel, to look for a political settlement.  Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 form the basis  and foundation of this settlement, as well as the spirit of the  initiative launched by the United States and the concept of  exchanging land for peace.    AL-THAWRAH says if the U.S. Administration does not champion  all of the above principles and the commitments President  Clinton reiterated at the Geneva summit with President Hafiz  al-Asad, then the least it should do is not to side with the  Israeli aggressor that has usurped rights and territory. It  should also not provide Israel with a cover by extending  military and political aid to it. This aid strengthens the  leaders of Israel in their rejection of all the obligations of  just and comprehensive peace and in continuing aggression and  crimes, adhering to their occupation of the Arab territories,  taking lightly the will of the international community, and  violating its legitimacy and laws.    The paper adds that U.S. support has been a major cause for  increasing Israeli intransigence and arrogance. It has also  encouraged Israeli practices, crimes, and attacks on Arabs.  Today, this support is a direct cause for obstructing the peace  process and Israel's not committing itself to its terms of  reference.    In conclusion, AL-THAWRAH urges the United States to support  the peace process toward achieving a just solution, without  favoritism or bias.</p>

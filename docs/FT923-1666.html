			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Brent Chemicals overcomes recession with 39% advance BRENT CHEMICALS Inter-national reported interim pre-tax profits up by 39 per cent to Pounds 6.4m in spite of continuing recessionary conditions in most of the speciality chemical group's markets. The Buckinghamshire-based group, which took heavy redundancy and reorganisation costs at its 1991 year-end, increased earnings per share 21 per cent to 5.3p (4.4p). The interim dividend is held at 1.6p. The shares closed 7p higher at 139p. Turnover, boosted by acquisitions, increased from Pounds 49.9m to Pounds 59.9m in the six months to June 30. The group said sales and profits growth were par-ticularly strong in packaging, graphic arts and aerospace activities. Business to the electronics industry had also been expanded, in spite of continuing weakness in that market. Mr Stephen Cuthbert, chief executive, said Brent's two most recent metal-finishing acquisitions - Hebro in Germany and CWC in the US - had exceeded expectations, with the former's sales and profits up by more than 15 per cent. Lord Lane of Horsell, chairman, said UK business remained under pressure but achieved increased profits on reduced volume following efficiency improvements. Overall the group continued to gain market share and maintained its gross margin. This, together with the overhead reductions achieved in 1991, increased the return on sales to more than 10 per cent. Lord Lane said: 'We believe the trading performance supports our strategy of realigning the group away from low-growth UK markets to a more broadly-based international business.' The group, which raised Pounds 15.6m in a rights issue last November, had net cash of Pounds 4m at June 30, but most of that will be paid out in deferred considerations during the second half. Lord Lane said: 'Whilst the short-term outlook remain uncertain, our geographic and market spread will enable us to benefit from the eventual market upturn.'</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY DON'T PULL PUNCHES OVER TROJAN-IRISH GAME  </P> <P> Sour grapes? Stupidity? I guess it's a little of each. Jim Murray's column on  Notre Dame really smacks of both. What is a Cadillac Catholic? Is he a BMW  atheist? What's his message? Are all Catholic schools supposed to inform all  their coaches now to lose, so they won't have a bad impression of their  schools? Come on.  </P> <P> Give Notre Dame credit, they came back in the second half and beat a good USC  team.  </P> <P> Obviously, Murray was rooting for USC. Better luck next time or maybe Notre  Dame should drop USC, not much of a challenge there anymore.  </P> <P> ANTHONY CAMARRA, Westminster  </P></p>

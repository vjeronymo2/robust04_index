			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Straw pledge on council spending MR Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, confirmed yesterday that Labour would remove the cap on spending which the government now imposes on local councils, and would no longer force local authorities to tender for the provision of services in the private sector. In a wide-ranging attack on the Conservatives' local government policies, he renewed Labour's commitment to hand control of the business rate back to local councils. He also said there should be local elections each year to improve democracy at a regional level. Mr Straw highlighted a series of recent Labour successes in metropolitan and shire elections, suggesting that the public believed the party was more committed to the provision of local services. He said: 'It is Labour councils which provide the services which people want and need: nursery places, home helps, discretionary grants for students, job creation and economic development, improved public transport.' The Conservatives have previously criticised Labour for advocating too little restraint on local government policies. There is a strong expectation that local authority spending will be targeted by the Treasury in discussions about next year's public expenditure. However, Labour believes that the public does not want to see a deterioration in the quality of these services. Mr Straw said that next May's local council elections would be a critical test of the government's record. Conference also called for policies to revitalise Britain's rural communities, including the introduction of comprehensive public transport services. Mr Straw was strongly critical of the Liberal Democrats, especially following allegations that they had issued racist leaflets during the recent council by-election in the Tower Hamlets borough of London, which was won by the far-right British National party. 'The Liberal democrats are the party who will do anything, say anything, pledge anything, print anything to get a vote,' Mr Straw said.</p>

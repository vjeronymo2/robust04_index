			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There was a strong general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Bright east Africans were mainly dearer with quality. Good mediums were the strongest feature and closed 5 to 10p higher, with lesser mediums also advancing 3 to 5p. Plainer teas met more enquiry at firm to dearer rates. Few selected bright Ceylons sold very well, others were irregular but on balance fully firm. An active market with Ceylons and brighter central Africans dearer. Plainer teas attracted more competition and sold at firm rates. Prices: quality 190p/kg, good medium 140p/kg, medium 121p/kg, low medium 90p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 254p/kg for a Rwanda pf. 1</p>

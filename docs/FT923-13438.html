			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: UK 'net book' agreement contravenes EC law The UK Publishers' Association's system of resale price maintenance (RPM) for 'net books' has been thrown into doubt by the Court of First Instance's affirmation of a 1988 EC Commission decision that the net book agreement (NBA) infringes EC competition rules. Implementation of the decision had been suspended pending the outcome of the PA's appeal. The Court's judgment will now preclude the application of the NBA to imports and re-imports from other EC member states, and also casts doubt on arguments previously used in the UK to justify the NBA. The NBA requires UK publishers to impose uniform RPM conditions on booksellers for the resale of 'net books'. The conditions also apply to net books exported to or re-imported from Ireland and other member states, and also to retail exports to other member states. The NBA had been approved in 1962 and 1968 by the UK's Restrictive Practices Court, as leading to lower prices, more stock-holding bookshops and more numerous and varied titles. The Commission held Article 85(1) applied to the agreements 'to the extent that they cover the book trade between member states'. It rejected the PA's request for an exemption under Article 85(3), as the restrictions on competition were not 'indispensable' for achieving the benefits claimed by the PA. The Court confirmed that Article 85(1) applied, rejecting the PA's argument that, for imported books, the NBA operated only after the books had been imported and thus could have no effect on inter-state trade. It also rejected the PA's complaint that the Commission had improperly changed the basis of its objections during the procedure. Significantly, the Court also specifically rejected the PA's four substantive arguments on the 'indispensability' issue. The Court did not accept that publishers would face substantial difficulties in notifying individually fixed terms of trading to booksellers and others. Nor was it established that booksellers would face an unmanageable burden if publishers had different conditions as to discounts and other departures from the NBA structure, particularly since computerisation was now widely available. Third, claims that the NBA reassured booksellers as to their competitors' conduct did not justify collective arrangements between publishers, since enforcement was in practice a matter for the individual publisher. Last, there was no necessity to allow monitoring by the PA of the common conditions. Case T-66/89, Publishers' Association v Commission, CFI 2CH, July 9 1992. Sunday trading issue to be determined by member states Clarification of Sunday trading rules and their compatability with EC law may follow Advocate-General Van Gerven's latest opinion on three preliminary references from the High Court, the Reading and Sonning Magistrates' Court and the House of Lords. The Sunday trading issue has been the subject of some considerable interest in the United Kingdom and other member states. In spite of the fact that the ECJ has ruled upon Sunday trading rules three times, there was still confusion over their compatability with EC law. The Advocate-General explained first why there was no inconsistency between Torfaen on the one hand, and Conforama and Merchandise on the other. All three cases had found that domestic provisions restricting trading on Sundays fell within the ambit of EC rules on import restrictions; the question at issue was whether such domestic provisions could be justified under EC law. In Conforama and Merchandise, the ECJ had all the necessary elements to decide the justification issue, whereas, in Torfaen, factual issues relevant to proportionality had to be dealt with by the national court. The Advocate-General then considered the criteria to be used to determine whether such provisions could be justified and whether it was for the national courts or the ECJ to apply such criteria. The issue of justification fell to be decided in two tranches. First, it had to be seen whether the measures pursued an objective consistent with EC law; this was a task for the ECJ, having had the relevant policy objectives drawn to its attention by the national courts. Second, the measures had to be relevant, essential and proportionate to the objective pursued. Generally, it was for the national court to decide these issues on the basis of criteria laid down by the ECJ. However, the ECJ could itself apply the tests where all the necessary information on the domestic measures had been provided by the national court and was not in doubt. Tested against these criteria, the Advocate-General confirmed that the UK Sunday trading rules pursued an objective justified under Community law and that, although, in his view, the restrictions were proportionate to their objectives, the issue was in principle to be determined by the national courts. Case C-306/88, Rochdale Borough Council v Stewart John Anders; Case C-304/90, Reading Borough Council v Payless DIY Limited and others; Case C-169/91, Council of the City of Stoke-on-Trent and Norwich City Council v B &amp; Q Plc. Opinion, Van Gerven, July 8 1992. Students' residence directive annulled Council Directive 90/366 on the right of residence for students has been annulled on the ground of incorrect legal base. The European Parliament had challenged the Directive, contending that the correct legal base should have been Art. 7(2) EEC, which involves the 'co-operation' procedure with Parliament. The Court however ordered that the Directive should continue to have its effects (ensuring non-discrimination for students moving within the EC) until the adoption of new legislation. Case C-295/90, Parliament v Council, ECJ FC, July 7 1992. In its final listed week before the summer vacation, the European Court delivered 11 judgments as well as two important opinions in the Woodpulp and Sunday Trading cases. This week, emphasis has been placed on the judgment by the Court of First Instance on the net book agreement and the Sunday trading opinion by Advocate-General Van Gerven. Those cases decided this week but not examined today will be covered next week.</p>

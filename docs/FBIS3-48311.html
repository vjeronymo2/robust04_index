			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- The government decided  Tuesday [25 January] to lift all remaining restrictions on  exports to South Africa in response to that country's  dismantling of apartheid.    The decision eliminates all economic sanctions against South  Africa with the exception of a blanket ban on the export of  weapons to all countries.    The decision, effective from January 28, will release for  export a range of previously restricted products including  computers and four-wheel-drive vehicles for use by the South  African military and police forces.    The government has already lifted bans on flights between  Japan and South Africa and on investment in that country.    A new South African Constitution, drawn up after two years  of  negotiations, guarantees a formal end to the legalized system of  racial discrimination known as apartheid following the nation's  first all-race elections on April 27.</p>

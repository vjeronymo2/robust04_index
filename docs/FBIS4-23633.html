			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The newspapers give full attention to political  events in Nigeria. THE GUARDIAN reports in its main headline  that suspense mounts as the police intensifies search for  Abiola. It relates this uncertainty to Chief M.K.O. Abiola who  is reported by some media houses to have declared himself  president of Nigeria at a Lagos suburb on Saturday [11 June].  Based on this, THE GUARDIAN reports that the police has  declared Chief Abiola wanted, with a 50,000- naira reward for  any information leading to his arrest, as the declaration  amounts to illegality.    On public reaction to the latest development since  yesterday,  the paper says it ranged between reticence and cautious support  for the pro-democracy cause. THE GUARDIAN further reports that  some leading members of the National Democratic Coalition,  NADECO, have called for dialogue as a means of resolving the  current political situation in Nigeria. It names the former  governor of Ondo State, Chief Michael Ajasin and Alhaji Balarabe  Musa, one time governor of Kaduna State of Nigeria, as calling  on the military government to have talks with pro-democracy  agents in the country.    THE GUARDIAN also reports that the two chapters of the  Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ -- Oyo and Lagos States --  have criticized the Federal Government for closing down two  newspaper houses, the CONCORD press and THE PUNCH, in the wake  of the political development. The paper quotes the NUJ as  stating that it will go to court to contest the closure of the  media houses.    The HERALD and the SKETCH also report on the political  situation in the country.</p>

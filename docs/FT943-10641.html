			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Gibraltar's top lawyer quits The attorney general of Gibraltar, Mr John Blackburn Gittings, has resigned 11 months before completion of his three-year term in office. The governor of Gibraltar, Field Marshal Sir John Chapple, last night announced that Mr Gittings had resigned early because of 'difference of views' between the two men. The governor said that the attorney general's decision to resign was 'unconnected with questions of legal advice or current public issues'. The resignation is likely to refuel the controversy surrounding the handling of a British and Danish police investigation into allegations of fraud linked to a major property development in Gibraltar. Four Danes are currently standing trial in Denmark after being charged with defrauding a local construction company JPC which was involved in the Gibraltar property development. The charges relate to payments totalling Pounds 5.4m. Mr Gittings has been present at police interviews with local officials in Gibraltar in connection with the alleged fraud. In recent weeks he has also requested the Swiss authorities to provide information of bank accounts related to the police investigation.</p>

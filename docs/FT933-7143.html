			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / World Trade News: UK groups in Indian spirits venture THE Indian government has approved the formation of joint ventures between UK Scotch makers Hiram Walker and Grand Metropolitan's International Distillers and Vintner's drinks division and Indian partners to market Scotch whisky in India, and to manufacture a range of indigenous spirits. After decades of warding off foreign liquor manufacturers and encouraging a thriving market for spurious 'scotch', India has opened its doors to the world's premium Scotch whisky-makers. United Distillers, the spirits arm of Guinness, received a similar approval in June, while Seagram, the Canadian liquor and foods giant, has been allowed to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary to make or blend 25,000 kilolitres of spirits a year. Hiram Walker, the UK-based subsidiary of Allied Lyons, the Canadian foods group, and makers of Teacher's and Ballantine's Scotch, has joined up with Jagatjit Industries, the Indian liquor and foods group, which commands over 25 per cent of the country's liquor market. The Rs100m (Pounds 2.2m) project in Maharashtra will import Scotch and bottle it in India for local sale and export to the Gulf countries and possibly to South East Asia. The company will bottle up to 30,000 cases of Scotch a year, and another 30,000 cases of blends with locally-made alcohol. Exports have been made mandatory to offset import costs. Grand Met said last week that its drinks division would hold a majority interest in the new company, International Distillers India, but an Indian partner and details of the joint venture are yet to be announced. The new venture will produce and market popular brands such as Smirnoff vodka, Gilbey's and Chelsea gin, Malibu coconut liqueur and Archer's schnapps. The government has not allowed foreign liquor companies to set up manufacturing capacities, and they will have to rely on the existing facilities of their joint venture partners, or purchase Indian spirits through contracts. The Canadian foods and liquor company will invest Rs250m to build a fruit juices and products facility with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes a year, and establish research and development facilities, besides making or blending Scotch. The Indian demand for Scotch is estimated at 1m cases a year, over 75 per cent of which are spurious or adulterated, and 90 per cent of which are smuggled. The Indian market for premium whiskies is wider, at 25m cases.</p>

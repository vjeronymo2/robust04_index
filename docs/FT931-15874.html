			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: Icahn hands over control of TWA to committee MR Carl Icahn, the former corporate raider who gained control of Trans World Airlines in 1986, yesterday formally relinquished his controlling interest in the carrier. Mr Icahn resigned as chairman of the bankrupt and heavily-indebted airline, and placed his entire stock interest in escrow. The financier's departure was anticipated in an agreement last month between the company's unions, its creditors, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which underpins the payment of basic pension benefits in the US. Under this deal, TWA employees are proffering wage concessions in return for a 45 per cent equity interest in the carrier, once it reorganises and emerges from bankruptcy. Creditors, meanwhile, are forgiving around Dollars 1bn of debt, and will receive the remaining 55 per cent of the shares. In the wake of Mr Icahn's departure, the company is headed by a two-man management committee, appointed by employees, unions and creditors. This week, TWA asked the bankruptcy court to extend the date for its reorganisation plan filing to be extended to February 17.</p>

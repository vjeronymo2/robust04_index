			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET ADMITS POOR ANTI-POLLUTION EFFORT  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has a poor record on combatting pollution but plans to double  environmental spending and sharply cut harmful emissions over northern Europe,  the Soviet environmental protection minister said Friday.  </P> <P> Signing a five-year environmental cooperation agreement with Sweden, Fyodor T.  Morgun sharply criticized his country's past record in the ecological field.  </P> <P> "We criticize ourselves because many European countries and the United States  allocate twice as much money as we did and do in the Soviet Union to the  environment," Morgun told a news conference. "But the time has come and the  government has taken the decision that sufficient funds will be allocated --  double what we spend now."  </P></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Drinks groups give Virgin Cola a sceptical welcome Virgin Cola, Mr Richard Branson's latest enterprise, was greeted sceptically yesterday by other soft-drink makers. They look forward to the competition but wonder how Virgin and Cott, its Canadian partner, will crack distribution and sales problems. The Virgin Cola Company is a 50-50 joint venture between Virgin Trading Company, a new Virgin subsidiary, and Cott. Virgin will be primarily responsible for marketing, promotion and advertising. Cott will develop, manufacture and distribute the drinks. 'We invented Cola wars,' PepsiCo said. 'We're very used to competition because it builds the whole cola market.' Its cola volume has grown 15 per cent this year in spite of competition from J. Sainsbury's Classic Cola, also made by Cott. Distribution will be one critical issue, PepsiCo added. 'Putting the product within arm's reach of desire' requires a complex distribution system to reach retailers. 'Physical distribution is not a problem for us,' said Mr Simon Lester, managing director of Cott Europe. On the sales side, 'the independent trade has shown an enormous amount of interest, and we've already spoken to one or two multiples,' he said. Mr Lester stressed that Cott's link with Virgin was fundamentally different from its relationship with Sainsbury. With Virgin, Cott is aiming to build from scratch a new brand, largely for independent retailers. With Sainsbury, it is supplying a supermarket own-label cola using a different formula. 'We have no objection to this,' Sainsbury said. 'We have an exclusive blend we will develop with Cott and we've got the better blend compared with Virgin's' Mr Lester said Cott was working with some half-dozen bottlers in the UK and on the Continent on its range of products besides bottling them at Ben Shaw, its Yorkshire subsidiary.

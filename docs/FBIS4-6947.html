			<p>BFN     [Text] Between 21 and 23 April, the ongoing situation in  Pailin developed rapidly as follows:    1. At Treng, Sdau, and Snoeng: The demoralized and routed  invading forces, both chiefs and rank and file, with light and  heavy guns, tanks, and armored carriers rushed precipitately by  driving or walking from Pailin toward Battambang.    2. At Kamping Puoy, Ta Kream, Krapeu, and Phnum Sampoeu:  The forces here were the positions which defended Battambang  and the base of the 196th Division and which had militarily been  reinforced for years, but were also routed. They also rushed  precipitately toward Battambang.    The cause of their unstoppable fleeing was that the 196th  Division sent by the communist Vietnamese puppet leaders to  Pailin had basically been smashed. As such, the remaining  terrified troops broke from their ranks and ran from Kamping  Puoy, Ta Kream, Krapeu, and Phnum Sampoeu toward Battambang with  the hope that they would set themselves free from the battles.    3. The chaotic situation in the town of Battambang: In the  situation where the troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets  and of the U.S. puppets, who were badly smashed and routed in  Pailin, rushed precipitately toward Battambang town -- some had  only their clothes with them -- Battambang was thrown into a  terrified, alarmed, and confused situation. This was not  because of fear of imminent attacks by the National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], but mainly because the routed  troops from Pailin and Route 10 robbed, shot at, and tossed hand  grenades killing people at market places in a tumultuous,  uncontrollable, and unpreventable manner. As both chiefs and  rank and file carried out robbery and shooting, Battambang  became a place where war erupted and where the communist  Vietnamese puppets, both military and civilian, and the U.S.  puppets, both military and civilian, murdered people according  to their fascist nature.    4. In this situation, Battambang's residents are running  about in horror. They angrily curse the base robbers and pray  that the NADK and the people will arrive immediately to ensure  security for them.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / France consumer prices rise 0.3 per cent French consumer prices rose a provisional 0.3 per cent last month, holding year-on-year inflation roughly steady at 3 per cent, according to Insee, the state statistics body, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The increase widens the gap between French and higher western German inflation rates because of a 0.6 point rise in Germany last month. Inflation in France now runs at 1.3 percentage points below western Germany - as against 1.1 points at the end of January.</p>

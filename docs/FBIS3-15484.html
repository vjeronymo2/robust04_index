			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Mar -- The management of the Russian  joint-stock company Gazprom has suspended cuts in natural gas  supplies to Ukraine pending the start of negotiations on 10  March, Sergey Tyukin, deputy head of Gazprom's central control  directorate, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent today.    This means that until the the issue of paying off debts for  fuel supplied from Russia is resolved conclusively, Ukrainian  consumers will be receiving reduced amounts of gas. At present,  consumers in Ukraine are getting about 100 million cubic meters  of gas a day from Russia.    Sergey Tyukin also said that daily supplies of gas to  Belarus  have been increased by 10 million cubic meters. After gas  supplies from Russia were reduced by 20 million cubic meters,  Belarus consumers promptly managed to start paying off their  debts and transferred 30 billion rubles into Gazprom's account.    In Sergey Tyukin's words, despite the difficult situation  Gazprom has found itself in, it managed to maintain virtually  the full volume of gas supplies to its foreign partners. The  exports of Russian gas fell by just 5 percent over the past few  days.</p>

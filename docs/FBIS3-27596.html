The president of China Southern, Yu Yanen, is likely to be  stripped of power and replaced by a manager from another Chinese  airline, according to mainland sources.    The conflict erupted in the State Council last month after a  Vice-Premier, Zou Jiahua, backed Yu in resisting attempts by  civil aviation officials to force China Southern to buy six  Airbus A-340s, the sources said. Zou's 10-character letter of  support for Yu, a copy of which was sent confidentially to Yu,  read: "He [Yu] has a point. We need to reconsider it."    But Zou's attempt to intervene on behalf of his close  associate was criticised by other senior leaders. "Mr Zou does  not speak for the whole State Council," several unidentified  state councillors said in an internal circular.    When China signed contracts for the aircraft, during a visit  to Beijing last November by the Gerrnan Chancellor Helmut Kohl,  the main motivation was to show the United States "we can do  without Boeing", the sources said.    Yu, whose China Southern flew only Boeings, argued that  individual airlines should have autonomy in making aircraft  purchase decisions. He accused the Civil Aviation  Administration of China (CAAC) of withholding approval for  long-haul flights to Europe and the U.S. unless China Southern  accepted the A-340s.    But CAAC officials cited a 1984 document which said airlines  could make decisions on "aircraft-related equipment" but did not  have the power to determine which aircraft are purchased. The  State Council decided to support the CAAC's enforcement of the  document, allowing the agency to determine which airline would  be saddled with the aircraft.    But Yu had remained defiant. "What are you dragging out this  old document for?" he reportedly demanded in a meeting with CAAC  in late January. "It was written before our airline even  existed."    China Southern was created as a regional carrier in 1988,  three years after China began breaking up its civil aviation  monopoly. "If you really want us to take the planes, then you  pay for them!" he is reported to have told officials.    Yu's outspokenness on the issue, which included drawing on  his close relationships with the Premier, Li Peng, and the  Guangdong Government, as well as Zou Jiahua, has landed him in  the CAAC's bad books. "This was the worst example of Yu's  belligerent behaviour towards the administration," a source said.    Yu will be stripped of his president's office and moved into  the newly-created symbolic position of chairman of China  Southern. The changes were being handled by CAAC's deputy  director, Shen Yuankang, who has been given the task of whipping  independently minded regional airlines into line.    This move, as well as other senior management changes within  China's main airlines, will be announced when the CAAC holds its  first national work meeting under its new director, Chen  Guangyi, at the end of this month or in early March.    Airbus officials said they are confused by the affair. "I  don't know their reasoning for signing a contract with no  airline in mind. Only the Chinese can answer that," a spokesman,  David Vellupilai, said. However, he said a decision needed to  be made this year so that peripheral equipment selections could  be made in preparation for the scheduled first delivery in 1995.    China Southern hoped to order Boeing 777-Bs, equivalent to  the A-340, to begin its long haul flights. The airline  management has been told its technical staff would have to be  doubled to service the complex and unfamiliar Airbus planes.</p>

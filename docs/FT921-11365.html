			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Scapa to pay Pounds 6m for Pirelli Italian offshoot SCAPA GROUP, the UK industrial products manufacturer, is set to expand in Italy following an agreement to buy Adenax, a producer of adhesive tapes for industrial uses, from the financially-troubled Pirelli tyres and cables group. Adenax is one of dozens of companies in the diversified products division which Pirelli put on sale following the failure of its bid for Continental, its German rival, late last year. However, Pirelli said the decision to sell Adenax, which is based near Vercelli in northern Italy, pre-dated its wider disposal programme. Scapa is paying about L13bn (Pounds 6.02m) for Adenax, which had sales of about L16bn last year. The company makes adhesive tapes, mainly used for packaging. The acquisition will fill out the range of industrial products and adhesive tapes made by Scapa's Rotunda subsidiary. Following the acquisition, Rotunda's turnover should reach more than Pounds 30m.</p>

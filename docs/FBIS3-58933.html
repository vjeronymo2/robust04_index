			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An agreement has been reached between Mario Segni's  Pact for Italy and the Northern League. Segni, who was  accompanied by [Rocco] Buttiglione, held a meeting this morning  with Northern League Deputy [Roberto] Maroni. The meeting was  described as positive and one which helped to resolve many  differences. Segni said the meeting, which lasted four hours,  was successful. A short time ago, a joint document was  released. The document says, among other things, the Italian  Republic is united and indivisible. This declaration was  demanded by Segni, and it puts an end to the many secessionist  statements made by the Northern League.    Now that the path has been smoothed over, the birth of a  moderate alliance, which should also include [Silvio] Berlusconi  and the Christian Democratic Center [Party], is set to go ahead.  Observers are now waiting for a reaction from [Mino]  Martinazzoli's Popular Party [new name of the Christian Democrat  Party].</p>

The source confirmed that Riak Machar had received a number  of letters from Mubarak al-Fadil and Umar Nur al-Da'im through  their contact, Hashim Muhammad Ali Ziyadah, expressing their  regret that they did not consult one another in Washington to  enable them to overthrow the government. They expressed their  full support for him, as the lies of John Garang had become  clear to them, as had the fact that the coup against Garang at  Nasir was not Khartoum- inspired. They said that their support  for him would be through the humanitarian organization which he  founded under the name of Medical in Need [preceding three words  in English]. They invited him and his group to attend the  national constitutional congress which the opposition is  planning to hold in Cairo, by sending his observers.</p>

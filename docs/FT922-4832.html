			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: TGWU to back Smith and Beckett THE executive of the TGWU general union yesterday decided to back Mr John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett for the leadership and deputy leadership of the Labour party. The union holds the biggest single block of Labour's electoral college, with 8 per cent of the votes, nearly one quarter of the 40 per cent union vote. The shadow chief secretary has recently faced a challenge from Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary. Mr Prescott, who has been defending Labour's traditional links with the unions, has won endorsement from Nupe, the public services union, and GPMU, the print union. But the Beckett camp was last night pointing out that Mrs Beckett had also won the endorsement of the Rhondda constituency in south Wales, a traditional Labour stronghold. Mr Gordon Brown, Mrs Beckett's campaign manager, said that she was already leading among MPs, and that her campaign had 'a strong momentum in the constituency parties and amongst trade unionists. 'Her campaign is uniting the party,' he claimed. Branches covering about 25 per cent of the TGWU's membership responded to the union's consultation exercise over the leadership. Mr Smith won about 83 per cent support for the leadership. In the deputy race Mrs Beckett won 46 per cent, Mr Prescott 39 per cent and Mr Gould 15 per cent.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegians cut salmon mountain NORWAY has sold more than 90 per cent of its frozen salmon mountain of 37,500 tonnes on the world market for about Pounds 100m. This is well above original estimates, according to Aquastar, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BP Nutrition. By the beginning of this month only about 4,000 tonnes of Norway's salmon stock remained to be sold. Aquastar was appointed last November by a consortium of Norwegian banks and the Norwegian government to sell the stock of frozen salmon left by FOS, the Norwegian fish farmers organisation, when it went bankrupt. This amounted to 20 per cent of annual Norwegian salmon production. 'We have managed to sell Norway's salmon in a controlled way,' said Mr Ingo Skulason, Aquastar's managing director, yesterday. He added: 'We have stabilised the world salmon market but maximised the price of it. The company has followed a tough trading policy with stringent (price) monitoring of the salmon where it has been sold'. The salmon has been sold to more than 30 countries, mainly in eastern Europe and the Far East. It was not sold in the US and the European Community in order to avoid allegations of dumping.</p>

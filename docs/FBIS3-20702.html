			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gy. Laszlo Toth: "Speculation on the Opposition </F> Coalition: Who Is Attacking Fidesz?"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In the history of the newest  Hungarian Republic, 1992 was the year of the far right's open  appearance. Hungarian society--including those intellectuals who  are involved in politics--was united in decisively condemning  fascist manifestations. [passage omitted] At the same time, one  part of the political opposition thought that the time had come  to discredit the whole government and coalition, and so they  tried to make it seem as if the appearance of the extreme right  were a natural consequence of the government's policies: They  tried, with the help of the leftist intellectuals who form  public opinion, to present the whole government in fascist  colors. [passage omitted]    As domestic political life developed (after the system  changed, left-wing intellectuals and leftist liberals realized  relatively quickly that the left-wing and liberal forces could  be held together only to the extent that the appearance of an  extreme right danger could be created. After all, it is the  fascist danger that legitimizes popular front politics most  effectively and most calmly. The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist  Party] benefited most from the situation that developed as a  result, because as the number of fascists "increased" more and  more according to the media, and seemingly we came ever closer  to the establishment of a fascist dictatorship, without anybody  noticing it the MSZP, along with the circles around it,  completely broke out of the spiritual ghetto into which it had  been forced as a successor party [of the communists].    The former communists and socialists, citing the fascist  danger, got ever closer to the most significant groups of the  SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) and to one part of the  intellectual community. In the meantime, they did not forget  that acting in concert more and more with the former dissidents  would give a sort of moral rehabilitation to individuals and  groups that had been compromised in the past. The self-appointed  salvation movement of the intellectuals, the Democratic Charter,  provided an excellent opportunity for this. This intellectual  popular front movement provided the organizational means for the  united action of the liberal and socialist political forces.    The idea of an opposition coalition enjoyed and still enjoys  the support of a significant part of the Budapest and the media  intellectuals. Such a coalition would make it possible for that  part of the former Communist Party's nomenklatura  that was able to "convert" its political power to economic power  in time, to return to political power in democratic  circumstances. Those who thought up the idea of creating the  appearance that a "fascist" government coalition is opposed by a  "democratic" left-wing bloc would have been able--if their plans  had succeeded--to prevent for a long time the development of the  turbulent democratic processes in Hungarian society.    It is the historical merit of the leaders of Fidesz  [Federation of Young Democrats] that they realized that creating  an opposition leftist bloc was not the most appropriate reaction  to the initiatives and atrocious acts of the far right that  erupted in 1992, because such a bloc would only serve the  interests of the MSZP. Fidesz also condemned fascist and racist  manifestations but, preserving its political common sense, it  made clear that civil democratic society in Hungary is not  threatened by any direct danger, and for that reason it would be  inappropriate and unjustified to react by taking joint action in  the framework of an antifascist popular front. By not making  common cause with the Charter or with the popular front  political activities associated with it, Fidesz essentially made  it impossible for the existing left to return easily to  political power. This was the original sin for which there is  evidently no forgiveness: since that time, Fidesz has been  constantly the target of leftist sharpshooters, who were soon  joined by angered and disappointed left-wing liberals, since  these liberals are much closer to the reform communist-socialist  forces than to the pragmatic, center-right liberals who are  devoted to the preservation of national values.    The left-wing "Charter" intellectuals never forget. Their  critical senses and their hatchets were sharpened further when  they realized that the reason Fidesz made a cooperative  agreement with the SZDSZ on 23 January 1993 was that the  agreement would prevent the formation of an MSZP-SZDSZ leftist  bloc and the further drift of the SZDSZ toward the MSZP. Since  then, hardly a day has passed that we have not been able to read  in some left-wing source, or in one that is influenced by the  SZDSZ, either an article condemning Fidesz or some negative  commentary regarding the Orban-Kover [Fidesz leaders] duo. There  is no mercy! The objectivity of the attacks is well illustrated  by the fact that not long ago they hurled accusations of  anti-Semitism against Kover, even though Kover was among the  first in parliament to condemn all forms of fascism. [passage  omitted]    It is a telling sign that even after popular front politics  lost its relevance--because the fascist danger was dropped from  the agenda of the leftists and intellectuals who form public  opinion--the anti-Fidesz campaign continued. The reason for this  is probably that in 1992 the left-wing intellectual community  came to realize that Fidesz is not a left-wing party and that,  moreover, it is trying to distance itself from the socialist  left, thereby reducing the MSZP's chances of gaining power. In  any case, it is worth thinking about the fact that those who are  discrediting Fidesz are precisely the ones who in 1992 saw  fascist storm troopers behind every bush and impatiently urged  the formation of an antifascist united front.</p>

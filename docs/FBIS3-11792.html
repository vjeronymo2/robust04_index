Attorney General Diego Valadez Rios said in a news release  that the person being held, Mario Aburto Martinez, 23,  "authorized" prison officials to shave off his moustache, which  he was wearing in the first photographs that were released.    The attorney general, who is in charge of prosecuting  federal  offenses, stressed: "Let there be no impression that there has  been any kind of switch or some sort of cover-up."    Privately owned television stations have broadcast footage  of  Aburto's arrest. At the time of his arrest, just after he had  shot Colosio, presidential candidate for the Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI), he was wearing a moustache.    On Friday, authorities presented an individual to the media  they identified as Aburto. The man was behind bullet-proof  glass at the Almoloya High Security Prison in Juarez, Mexico  State, close to the Mexican capital.    The murder occurred just as Colosio was leaving a campaign  rally in the northwestern city of Tijuana, Baja California, near  the U.S. border.    Valadez said the investigations into the Colosio murder were  being handled with the utmost clarity, honesty, seriousness,  impartiality, and respect for the law and the press to maintain  public trust in the law enforcement institutions.    Fingerprint records and all of the material regarding the  investigation have been made available to the proper authorities  and to the press to avoid speculation.    A second person, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, was arrested in  connection with the incident, but he was released later.    Valadez said that the suspect made his initial statement  yesterday before the Mexico State First District Judge, during  which he reaffirmed his original confession.    He added that there has been significant progress regarding  information about the suspect's rearing and current lifestyle.  Valadez reported that investigators have interviewed Aburto's  family and other witnesses, and he denied that there is any  other person in custody.</p>

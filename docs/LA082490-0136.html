			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> RALLY PROTESTS POLICE SWEEPS OF HOMELESS  </P> <P> A small group of protesters rallied Thursday outside Santa Ana City Hall to  complain about the Police Department's roundup of the homeless at the Civic  Center.  </P> <P> Carrying signs that read, "Compassion not harassment," about a dozen people  from the Catholic Worker organization demonstrated on behalf of the homeless.  </P> <P> But many passers-by said they support the police sweeps.  </P> <P> "They're bums," one man said of the homeless.  </P> <P> "What disturbs me the most is that there's a lashing out against the homeless,"  said Jonathan Parfrey, who organized the protest. "It's not posh or chic  anymore to help the homeless. So people think it's OK to harass them."  </P> <P> In the past 2 weeks, police have conducted two sweeps at the Civic Center,  arresting more than 90 people, most of them for municipal code infractions such  as public drunkenness, littering and urinating in public. Seven people were  arrested on outstanding warrants.  </P> <P> Homeless rights advocates have criticized the sweeps, saying they are police  harassment.  </P> <P> During an Aug. 15 sweep, police arrested 64 people and took them to Santa Ana  Stadium, where officers marked their arms with booking numbers and chained them  to benches for 6 hours. The arrestees were then cited with misdemeanors and  released. More than 30 of those arrested have sought help from Orange County's  Legal Aid Society, which is organizing a task force to defend them in court.  Legal Aid officials say they will try to seek a temporary restraining order to  stop the roundups.  </P> <P> Parfrey said Santa Ana officials were not offering alternatives to the  homeless.  </P> <P> "'I'm sympathetic with people who go to work here and, yes, maybe it smells  here because of the homeless," Parfrey said. "But is the solution really to  drive them out with harassment?"  </P> <P> Many who work at the Civic Center, such as attorney Randall Bisson, said they  support the police action.  </P> <P> "The conditions at the Civic Center have gotten worse and worse," Bisson said.  "For people who have to work here every day, it's hard to put up with people  who use the parking lots as restrooms." LILY ENG  </P></p>

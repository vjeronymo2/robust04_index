			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian wool prices wereagain firm with little change during the week. The market indicator finished at 625c/kg, just 3c lower than a week ago. Japan and Western Europe were still said to be active buyers, but an added influence was China, reported to be among the leading competitors and encouraging the view that the wool market may resume its rising trend in the season due to begin next month. For some weeks the balance has been close between those considering a period of consolidation and perhaps easier prices in the months ahead, and those convinced that the main rising trend will persist. If China is more active, and with stockpile sales soon to be resticted by a fixed disposal schedule, the more bullish approach has gained a little ground. Good rates of activity in the main wool consuming countries during recovery from recession is helpful.</p>

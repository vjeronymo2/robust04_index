			<p>BFN     [Text] Two other Iraqi suspects, Consul 'Ali Darwish and  embassy employee Hadi Hassun al-Najm, who had intended to travel  to Jordan along with the three diplomats, have been handed over  to the Internal Security Forces.    Two arrest warrants had been issued against Consul Darwish  and employee al-Najm on charges of taking part in the murder of  Shaykh Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi. Thus the number of Iraqis  arrested on charges of committing the murder or taking part in  it rises to four [as heard].</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE AND HOMOSEXUALITY  </P> <P> I found some of the implications in Judd Marmor's review of Kenneth Lewes'  "Psychoanalytic Theory of Male Homosexuality" (Book Review, Feb. 19) as  interesting as the review itself. Science should not be a hostage to politics  or the public taste. The question of whether or not homosexuality is to be  regarded as a psychiatric disorder should be left to scientists unmoved by  picketing and political acts of those who disagree with the classification.  Edmund Bergler's quoted statements do generalize from the particular and are  intemperate. However, his point was that homosexuality, impotence, and  frigidity were counterfeit sex: Sexual behavior used to express and disguise  other non-sexual needs and drives. Modern psychotherapy recognizes that the  symptom not only expresses an internal conflict, but also communicates a social  statement. Marmor wishes to ignore that possible social message by implying  that homosexuals are "born that way" due to biochemistry. Any message of  rebellion against a heterosexual society or family is then erased. More than  this, Marmor defends homosexuals by implying that their sexual object is not  chosen by homosexuals as a preference or an existential option, rather, they  are victims of conditions in utero, which determine their wants and behavior.  He thereby acknowledges that homosexuals would be heterosexual if they could.  He denies a psychiatric disorder to arrive at a biological disorder without  recognizing his own bias that homosexuality is a dysfunction of the sexual  drive.  </P> <P> RICHARD T.

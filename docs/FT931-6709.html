			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Rental revenue I OWN AN apartment in France which is let for part of the year. Tax returns are prepared for me by an agency in France and I have received tax demands from Paris, usually two years delayed. This income has been declared to the British tax inspector. My UK accountant maintains I will have to pay UK tax on the rental income, and obtain a refund if and when the French tax demand exceeds the UK demand. Is this correct? France has the prior right to tax your rental income (by virtue of article 5 of the France-UK double taxation convention) and the UK has to reduce its tax demands by the amount of the French tax, broadly speaking, under article 24(a) of the convention. It looks as though your accountant ought to have submitted repayment claims to your UK tax office each time you paid French tax. The rules are outlined in a free pamphlet, IR6 (Double taxation relief), which is obtainable from most tax offices. For the purpose of calculating the relief from UK tax to which you are entitled, each amount of French tax has to be translated to sterling at the rate of exchange for the day on which it was due for payment (regardless of when it was actually paid). This will be a quite different rate of exchange from that which was used to translate the relevant rental income, of course, so it is not simply a question of comparing the French tax rate with the rate of tax charged in the UK. It is a pity that you did not say when the letting started, as that would have enabled us to give you a simpler answer; but your remark about the French tax demands being 'usually two years delayed' indicates it started some years ago. The case V assessment for either the third UK tax year or the fourth presumably was based upon the same rent as the previous year's assessment (viz, the second or the third, as the case may be), so that your accountant will have to claim the special relief provided by section 804 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (or section 510 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, if the year in question was 1987-88 or earlier). If your accountant is concerned about having let time limits slip by, he might find comfort in section 806(2) of the Taxes Act 1988. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

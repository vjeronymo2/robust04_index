			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Fokker plans to build 130-seat airliner FOKKER, the Dutch aerospace group, aims to complete a feasibility study on developing a new 130-seat airliner by the end of 1991. The Dutch company is one of several European aircraft manufacturers to have announced its interest in entering the market for 130-seat aircraft. 'Four players in that market segment are too many, but Fokker believes that it must be one of those four,' Mr Marten Kuilman, the chairman, said at the annual report presentation. If Fokker's plans proceed as expected, its proposed 130-seater aircraft would be based largely on its 100-seater Fokker 100. Fokker is also considering the development of an 80-seat aircraft which would be a derivative of its former F28. In 1990, Fokker's net profit nearly doubled to Fl 83.4m (Dollars 42.1m) from Fl 42.4m in 1989. The sharp rise was due mainly to lower financing charges, higher contributions from associated companies, and book profits from divestments. Despite the steep increase, the company announced in March that it was postponing the resumption of dividend payments. It attributed the delay partly to the sacrifices being asked of its workforce, where jobs are being cut to reduce costs and counter the weakness of the dollar. Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, the group's finance director, said the recent strong rise in the dollar had brought it back to a more 'comfortable' level for Fokker.</p>

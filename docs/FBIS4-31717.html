			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 14 (TANJUG) -- Sporadic explosions  could still be heard at Tuesday noon from an army ammunition  dump in Lisicji Potok in Belgrade which was struck by a  lightning while a thunderstorm was raging over Belgrade on  Monday night. Military sources say that no one was killed in  the explosion, that the situation is "under control" and that  there is "no danger of the explosion spreading and endangering  civilian facilities."    Early on Tuesday, reporters and photographers were denied  access for security reasons to the underground ammunition dump  where explosives for military exercises are kept. A team of  TANJUG's reporters who managed to come near the dump situated in  the popular Belgrade picnic site of Kosutnjak say the explosions  occur at approximately 40-minute intervals. The whole area  smells of gunpowder and is covered by a cloud of whitish smoke.    The road to the dump is heavily guarded by army and [word  indistinct] forces who have advised the residents of Kosutnjak  to avoid walking in the woods for fear that some explosives  might have been blown onto the grass.    Teams of military experts who are clearing up the terrain  say  that the rain is helping them prevent the fire from spreading.    A part of the residential area near the dump was evacuated  in  the night between Monday and Tuesday. Widow of the late Yugoslav  president Josip Broz Tito, Jovanka Broz, whose residence is  located near the ammunition dump, was among them.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> COURT RULING PERILS FEDERAL DRUG TESTS  </P> <P> A federal program to test government workers suspected of off-duty drug use was  put in jeopardy by a court decision that struck down similar checks of  Agriculture Department employees. The ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said "the government has  not produced evidence that might establish a relationship between off-the-job  drug use and government efficiency . . . " The ruling is the first by a federal  appellate court on the government's use of drug tests. The court ruled also, in  a case involving White House employees, that government officials with access  to secret information may be subject to random drug testing along with  officials with top secret clearances.  </P></p>

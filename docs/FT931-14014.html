			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Betting shops allowed to open on summer evenings BETTING shops will be allowed to stay open until 10pm from April 1 until August 31, the end of the summer evening horse-racing season, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, announced yesterday. The move, extending the opening hours of 7am to 6.30pm fixed in 1986, follows persistent lobbying by some bookmakers for later opening to allow off-course punters to bet on the increasing number of race meetings held in the summer. Bigger bookmakers have argued that later opening will help increase turnover, but many independent bookmakers and some betting-shop staff have opposed the idea because of longer working hours and staffing difficulties. The exchequer, which at present collects Pounds 500m a year in duty from the betting industry, will benefit from the longer opening hours. Betting turnover should increase by at least 10 per cent with evening opening, bringing in an additional Pounds 50m or more in tax. Greyhound racing officials have opposed extending opening hours. Most greyhound race meetings are held in the evening and the officials fear many followers might be lured into betting shops instead. Mr Clarke said in a Commons written answer that evening opening would give a boost to the leisure industry and would be welcomed by many horse-racing enthusiasts. 'It will allow bookmakers to match their opening hours to the needs and wishes of their customers,' he said. He added that it was clear from responses to a government consultation document published in October 1991 that the growth in the number of evening horse-race meetings had increased consumer demand for evening opening of licensed betting offices during summer months. The government had decided there were no public interest or policy reasons to object to evening opening. The Betting Office Licensees Association said there was little doubt the decision would be welcomed by the betting public as the quantity and quality of evening racing had steadily increased and the betting industry's role was to provide a service whenever horse racing was taking place. It added: 'We understand the apprehension of the industry faced with a change of this magnitude, but off-course betting must be prepared to move with the times if it is to survive in its present form.'</p>

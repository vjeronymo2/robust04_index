			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Housing Shortage, Health Sector Problems"] </F>   [Text] It has been learned there is a shortage of 1.2  million housing units...    In less than two days, the new head of government has  conferred with officials in two sectors where the alarm bells  are already ringing.    Mr. Mokdad Sifi intends to make the health and housing  sectors important policy areas. The housing issue was discussed  yesterday at Government House, at the prime minister's meeting  with several members of the government and officials in  concerned departments.    The meeting afforded an opportunity for a diagnosis of ills  plaguing the sector.    It was disclosed there is a shortage of 1.2 million housing  units, while the rate of construction is at best 40,000 units  per year, though the pace was as high as 90,000 in the early  1980's.    Also, it was reported that the productive plant as a whole  is  in sad shape, as a result of swollen personnel ranks and a  deficit equal to 130 percent of annual turnover.    Emphasis was placed on the inadequacy and irregularity that  plague provisioning of construction materials, a commercial  sector where 55 billion centimes are siphoned off by various  intermediaries.    Also raised was the issue of insufficient land on which to  build, owing to cumbersome regulations, confusion regarding the  roles played by various administrative offices, and inconsistent  financing practices.    This review of the state of affairs led several meeting  participants to advance a number of suggestions to facilitate  implementation of the current housing program and rapid  completion of urban development plans for all urban  concentrations of more than 50,000 inhabitants.    It was decided to establish intersectoral working groups  with  a view to resolving, on an urgent basis and within a specific  timeframe, the diverse bottlenecks in land availability,  financing, construction materials, and production plant.    At the end of the meeting, the head of government also  pledged to organize a second meeting to evaluate the work  accomplished and take the most appropriate practical steps to  revive the housing sector.    Several initiatives need to be approved--and implemented--to  get the sector out of its present quagmire. These include easing  financial constraints that weigh on housing enterprises,  reforming the said enterprises, reviewing construction  standards, and--before anything else--establishing a genuine  national development policy.    Health, the other sector to which the new head of government  plans to give priority attention, was also discussed; the sector  is weighed down by innumerable problems having to do with both  human and material resources, and it undeniably suffers from  poor management of what resources are available.    The prime minister's laudable initiative to deal with two  such thorny issues as health and housing will unquestionably  need to be followed up by monitoring in the field. The alarm has  been sounded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Spokesman of the Russian  Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin said it is impossible for  foreign officials to react to the statements of the Russian  foreign minister without even seeing the full text of his speech.    "The Russian foreign minister has given a detailed enough  characteristic of the inadequate reaction of official  representatives of foreign states, including the United States  and the Baltics to his speech on January 18. It is hard to add  anything to it, however, a logical question appears: How such  hasty statements can be made even before their authors get  acquainted with the full text of the minister's speech, how does  this get into the framework of normal and generally-accepted  norms of political communication", he told TASS on Thursday.    "Reporters of ITAR-TASS and other news agencies have wired  only separate quotes taken out of the context and it is not  their fault that such a sharp response followed. All these  moments were rather fully characterised by the foreign minister  on January 19. He expressed concern that someone has not got  rid yet of the image of an enemy in the face of Russia or tries  to restore it. In any case this unfortunate incident should be  a good lesson", Karasin said.    Before Kozyrev's speech on Wednesday Karasin told INTERFAX  news agency that TASS had misconstrued Kozyrev's comments.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> PLANS FOR RESORT OVERWHELM SOME  </P> <P> Plans to build a six-acre resort complex around historic Casa Romantica are too  overwhelming for the sleepy oceanfront community, City Council members said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Although the plans say the project is 20% less dense than surrounding  neighborhoods, City Council members said the scope of the project goes beyond  what has been discussed for the site.  </P> <P> "It's a lot more intense than we are accustomed to," Mayor Candace Haggard  said.  </P> <P> Ratkovich Co., a Los Angeles developer, proposed paying the city $6 million in  cash and other considerations for the six acres of property near the San  Clemente Pier. Casa Romantica, a historic home built by city founder Ole Hanson  on bluffs overlooking the ocean, would be the resort's centerpiece.  </P> <P> More than 125 residents reviewed the plans for a 160-room hotel, 60  condominiums, a restaurant, shops and office space. The site would be 60% open  space, with garden-style landscaping winding through the project.  </P> <P> Still, several people in the audience expressed dismay at the proposal.  </P> <P> "I was shocked to see offices and condominiums," said Harold Oertle. "I do not  want Los Angeles down here."  </P> <P> Councilman Brian J. Rice said his first impression was: "Wow, that is a big  project. I don't think the council planned on anything of this size."  </P> <P> Casa Romantica would be lost among buildings totaling 275,000 square feet of  space, Councilman Thomas Lorch said.  </P> <P> Project developers Wayne and Cliff Ratkovich told the audience that the scope  of the project would benefit the city. The condominiums will add $400,000 in  property taxes to the $1.2 million the city can expect in annual tax revenue  from the complex, Cliff Ratkovich predicted.  </P> <P> The city has hired an independent accounting firm to confirm the developer's  assessment.FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

What these acts of terror threaten is the  existing communal peace between Muslim and Christian communities  in Mindanao.    The peace process is moving on its own momentum. It is  unlikely to be seriously disturbed by random terrorism.    MNLF spokesmen have come out immediately to pronounce the  peace process safe. Misuari's movement has nothing to gain and  everything to lose if the bombings precipitate an atmosphere of  communal conflict.    Secessionism has lost the luster it once enjoyed. By  maintaining a hardline position for too long, the MNLF has been  marginalized in the politics of Muslim Mindanao. Rival tribal  leaders have stolen much of Misuari's former clout. The  movement he leads has been excluded from the new framework of  factional political positioning in the south -- the autonomous  government.    The MNLF leadership wants desperately to move closer to the  mainstream. The movement seeks to recover the constituencies it  once enjoyed when it promised prosperity through nationhood to  the impoverished Muslim masses. It can begin to move out of the  political doldrums only if it helps push the peace process  forward.    Misuari understands that. His supporters among the Tausog  elite, elbowed aside in the struggle for influence over the  autonomous government, understand that. But not all of the mass  base of the obsolete secessionist movement grasp the necessity  for systematically terminating the armed struggle to the  satisfaction of all.    A new virus has entered the already chaotic politics of the  Islamic communities of the south. That virus is militant  Islamic fundamentalism.    Fundamentalism appropriated the romance that was earlier  vested in secessionism. In its more moderate mode, this  creeping fundamentalism has been expressed in the emergence of  the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) -- rival to the MNLF.    The MILF has a more pronounced Islamic identity,  distinguishing it from the distastefully secular MNLF program.  Although controlled by the traditional aristocratic elites of  the Maguindanao and Maranao communities, it has positioned  itself as the expression of Moro self-assertion in an  increasingly uncertain and fluid reality. But even the MILF  cannot absorb the more militant variants of Islamic  fundamentalism. Because of this, more militant minor sects have  emerged, such as the notorious Abu Sayaf group.    The more militant fundamentalist armed bands touch a  dangerous chord among disenchanted young Muslims. They raise  the new encroachment of Christian migrants into Muslim land as  the source of misery for the Moros. They vow to rid the Moros  of that encroachments.    While the MNLF wallowed in the political doldrums, the more  militant fundamentalist bands captured the imagination of the  discontented in a series of bold and violent acts. Among these  are the kidnappings of foreign missionaries. Note that one of  the demands put forward by the kidnappers of Charles Walton, was  the expulsion of all foreign (Christian) missionaries from  Mindanao.    For too long, however, the MNLF failed to clarify its own  position against these rabid bands. They sheltered  fundamentalist armed groups in their territories. They dealt  with them with a fraternal soft glove. In the meantime,  government forces were hesitant to deal forcefully with these  bands for fear of damaging the peace process.    Now the problem has blossomed to such an extent that the  possibility of Muslim-Christian hostilities could not be  discounted. Recall that during the kidnapping of Spanish priest  Bernardo Blanco, Christians in Basilan offered to set up  vigilante bands. That could repeat itself in Davao.    If the situation worsens, government could find itself  having  to deal with a re-run of the violence between the "barracudas  [Muslim group]" and the "ilagas [rats-Christian group]" that  happened during the late '60s and early '70s. That insane cycle  of violence was a prelude to full-scale war.    Should tensions escalate and communities find themselves  having to defend themselves with arms, the dance of peace  between government and the MNLF will be rendered academic.  There will be too many combatants in the fray to allow for  predictability.    The situation should have been nipped in the bud when the  Basilan kidnappings began happening. Now the unhealthy  situation is on the verge of bloom. The MNLF must do something  more than issue press statements -- or else continue abetting  the problem.</p>

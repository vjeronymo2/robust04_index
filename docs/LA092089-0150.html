			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUENA PARK'S PAT BRADLEY AIMS FOR GAINS ON LPGA VICTORY LIST  </P> <P> Things are back to normal this year for Pat Bradley, who has rebounded from a  disastrous 1988 to her accustomed position as one of the LPGA Tour's best  players.  </P> <P> But there's one thing wrong: Although Bradley ranks fourth on the LPGA  money-winning list with $365,902 in earnings, she's won only one tournament  this year.  </P> <P> "I'm getting tired of finishing second," said Bradley, who will compete in the  $300,000 Nippon Travel-MBS Classic starting Thursday on the 6,351-yard par-72  Los Coyotes Country Club course. "Last year, I would have given anything to  finish in the top 10."  </P> <P> Bradley, 38, played in only 17 tournaments in 1988 and earned just $15,965,  ranking her 109th on the earnings list. It was a horrible year: She was  hampered by a thyroid condition and her father died.  </P> <P> Bradley has been a standout since joining the LPGA tour in 1974. She was 14th  on the money-winning list as a rookie, then reached the top 10 every year until  1987, when she was 15th.  </P> <P> After the fall of 1988, she's back near the top.  </P></p>

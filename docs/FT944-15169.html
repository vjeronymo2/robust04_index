			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved lower on improved turnover, but traders continued to describe the market as oscillating with little real idea of direction, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract fell to 3,090 in the last hour of trading but had clawed back to 3,100 at the 4.10pm official close, down 40 on the day. At this level the premium to the cash market was 17 points, with the fair value premium around 13 points. Trading volume was healthier than on Monday, increasing to 13,429 contracts from 11,811 in the previous session. Although there were occasional flashes of institutional activity, the quality of business remained low and the December contract seldom met with any real weight of selling. Traders said the recent glimmer of institutional interest was encouraging. The current, final quarter of the year is traditionally an active one for institutions, they said. 'What this market badly needs is a genuine improvement in the quality of business,' one commented. Stock options business also improved, rising to 26,685 contracts from Monday's 22,778. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for 18,136 lots. Among individual options, Guinness was the most active at 1,322 lots dealt, followed by J. Sainsbury (1,017 lots) and Glaxo (837).</p>

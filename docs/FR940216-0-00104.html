			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In fuels enforcement programs under Title II of the Clean Air Act, EPA generally uses data obtained from its own laboratory to determine the appropriateness of any testing tolerance. At the present time, however, sufficient data needed to determine enforcement testing tolerances based on EPA laboratory data are not available. Therefore, EPA is setting initial test tolerances sufficiently large to assure that any competent laboratory testing a conforming sample could arrive at results that would indicate that the sample was not in violation. However, EPA may adopt new tolerances as data on test methods are developed, as technology changes, or as further information becomes available concerning the precision and accuracy of a particular method, whether established by EPA or by multiple testing protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The test tolerance is only to be used by EPA to determine whether an enforcement action should be brought. It is EPA's contention that any sample that is over the standard is in violation. However, no enforcement action will be brought if the sample is over the standard, but within the tolerance. Furthermore, refiners and importers may not use the tolerance to expand the applicable standard. If the refiner or importer results show the product to be above the standard, then the product is in violation regardless of whether or not it is within the tolerance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To better establish the most appropriate test tolerances, EPA proposes a joint effort between EPA and industry to develop a gasoline standard with known properties which could be used by all laboratories for calibration purposes and for detecting laboratory biases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has not included in this Preamble the enforcement tolerances for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions performance, but intends to issue guidance that includes these enforcement tolerances within the next several months. The tolerances applicable under the complex model will be applied by EPA in the manner discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following enforcement tolerances currently are applicable under the simple model:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RVP.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A tolerance of 0.30 psi will be allowed for RVP in order to be consistent with the tolerance level currently used in the gasoline volatility program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oxygen. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The oxygen tolerance will be 0.30 weight percent oxygen, which is consistent with the test tolerance currently in use in the winter oxygenate program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Benzene. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial test tolerance for benzene is 0.21 vol%, but this tolerance value will be modified through a round-robin testing process that is intended to identify a more appropriate test tolerance for benzene. Under this approach, the 0.21 vol% initial benzene tolerance will be used only until January, 1996, when the modified benzene tolerance will apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The process for identifying the new benzene tolerance will involve a round-robin testing program to be carried out cooperatively by EPA and the American Petroleum Institute (API). This testing program will involve testing by a number of laboratories selected by EPA and API, in accordance with a round-robin testing protocol that will be developed jointly by EPA and API. The purpose of the testing program is to identify the lab-to-lab reproducibility that exists among high-caliber laboratories that follow good laboratory procedures including procedures dealing with quality assurance and quality control, and where all reasonable steps have been taken to achieve high lab-to-lab correlation. The testing program generally will follow the round-robin methodology used by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM). EPA, API, and the laboratories involved also will attempt to improve lab-to-lab correlations, through use of a gasoline matrix with known, repeatable properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new tolerance will be determined from the reproducibility standard deviation resulting from the round-robin in such a way that the Agency can be 95% certain that materials tested at the standard plus the tolerance are in fact over the standard. The above calculations will be used to establish the tolerance regardless of whether the resulting value is less than or greater than 0.21 vol%, but the value will not be greater than 0.30 vol% regardless of the results of the testing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER AND FIAT RUMORED TO BE DISCUSSING DEAL  </P> <P> Officials of Chrysler Corp. and Italy's Fiat SpA are in intensive negotiations  that could result in a major deal between the two companies, industry analysts  said Monday.  </P> <P> Such a deal could be relatively routine, such as a joint development project,  or it could involve one of the auto makers buying a stake in the other.  </P> <P> "There's no question that they're talking to one another," said Shearson Lehman  Hutton analyst Joe Phillippi.  </P> <P> Phillippi, who said he has heard rumors that Fiat could seek as much as 25% of  Chrysler with an option to buy 51%, said a pact between them would make sense.  </P> <P> Neither Fiat nor Chrysler would comment on the speculation.  </P></p>

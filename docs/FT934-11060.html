			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in thin volume A STRONG warning against optimism on domestic interest rates from the chancellor of the exchequer failed to depress UK equities for long yesterday. The early part of the session saw some selling and the stock market was also upset by the temporary closure of the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) because of a fire scare. But shares rallied strongly just before the close when both sterling and government bonds appeared to steady from their early worries over base rates. However, traders stressed that sluggish trading volume presented the chief characteristic of the first session of the new equity trading account. Equity business was about 41 per cent down from Friday's level and most significant share price movements reflected individual company concerns rather than across the board investment pressures from the big fund management houses. Shares reacted quickly to the UK chancellor's comment, on a Sunday morning television programme, that he saw no need for a base rate cut at present. His remarks provided a discouraging backcloth to the stock market's interpretation of the latest predictions in the City of the likely content of the UK Budget to be presented at the end of the month. At its worst the FT-SE 100 Index was down 23.1 to just under 3,148 and remained subdued for most of the session. But at the very end of the trading day, it bounced smartly to close at 3,164.4, with the day's loss trimmed to only 6.6 points. At 3,520.5, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was off 7.6 points as the second line stocks were largely left on the sidelines. The weakest sector was again the pharmaceuticals, where last week's reaction to Wellcome's results continued to drag down share prices. Losses among retail shares, the most closely linked to base rate prospects, were minimal by the close of business. The market is expected to focus on the latest leading indicators on the US economy, due today, for evidence that the American economy is continuing to grow more strongly. 'The US booms, while Europe slumps,' commented the economics team at Yamaichi. Data on the British economy is limited this week but London analysts will be scrutinising the list of statistics from Germany. Little is expected from the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, and news of a further fall in manufacturing output and a rise in unemployment are feared. Seaq volume fell to only 465.5m shares, from 800.9m on Friday, when retail worth of Pounds 1.63bn indicated the continued underlying strength in equities. Dealers ascribed the fall-off in business to a pause in activity by managers of the multi-national funds prompted by holiday closures yesterday in several continental European financial centres. There was also some caution ahead of publication today of the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin which, some analysts fear, may express further concern that inflation prospects are deteriorating. This would add further uncertainty to the equation over prospects for both base rate cuts and tax increases in this month's Budget. 'Room for manoeuvre on rate cuts without a tight Budget is fast disappearing,' commented Mr Kevin Adams, UK bond strategist at BZW.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett smaller cos trust launch Hoare Govett is launching its second specialist smaller companies investment trust within six months. The new trust, like the first, will attempt to track the extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (excluding investment trusts). The Second HGSC Investment Trust is aiming to raise between Pounds 25m and Pounds 50m. The trust will have just one class of share and investors will have the right to vote on the wind-up of the trust after 10 years. Hoare Govett's first indexed investment trust raised Pounds 28.5m in December and has since traded at a premium to net asset value. Small company shares have tended to outperform larger companies over the long term. However, they have only recently shown signs of recovery after four years of underperformance, prompted by high interest rates and recession. The managers said that discussions with institutions indicated that they would prefer a new issue to a rights issue from the existing trust. The full prospectus is expected to be issued in the first week of June.</p>

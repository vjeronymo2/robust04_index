			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Helmut Becker editorial: "Japan's Economic Riddle"] </F>   [Text] On Wednesday of last week [6 April], Japan's  central bank governor Mieno ventured an extremely cautious  optimistic forecast for economic developments. The recession  may well have bottomed out in the last quarter of 1993, and the  recession might not get any worse. However, Mieno, whose  organization has been predicting an upswing for the past three  years, added an important footnote: One year ago, a friendly  economic climate was also discernible at the end of March,  shortly before the end of the fiscal and business year, which  was mainly the result of the widespread manipulation of the  balance sheets, and in the months that followed it turned out to  be a straw fire. Nobody can be certain that this disappointment  will not be repeated in 1994. The much less reserved Finance  Minister Fujii also made a statement on the same day. Contrary  to the usual display of confidence, he described the economy as  "unstable" and stressed that it is in an "extremely delicate  state of suspense."    The formation of the new government this week will show  whether these two analyses are still realistic after the  resignation of Prime Minister Hosokawa, which was announced two  days after the analyses were presented. A weak government that  would only be able to act as a caretaker cabinet until new  elections later this year would cause continued economic  difficulties in Japan. The big tax reform that can no longer be  postponed, the trade conflict with the United States, the  pressure for revaluation of the yen, and the tight budget  situation and the resulting recourse to the capital market that  leads to rising interest rates require a strong executive power  whose formation is extremely questionable this week. If the  stock market reacts lethargically -- not to speak of a slump --  Japan's economy is not likely to grow more in the fiscal year  that has just started than in the one just concluded and for  which the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) only  expects a real growth of 0.2 percent after a revision of the 3.3  percent predicted in the fall. One thing is clear: In 1993/94  Japan's economic development was the weakest in 20 years. Also,  there is no doubt that the EPA's predictions for economic growth  of 2.4 percent for the fiscal year that has just started are no  longer a basis for discussion after a series of spectacular  wrong official estimates.    Even the four gigantic economic emergency programs adopted  since September 1992 and involving 45.2 trillion yen (730  billion German marks) will not trigger a return to the sizable  growth rates of the second half of the 1980's of which foreign  observers of the stock market still seem to dream. The result  of the "delicate state of suspense" is fatal: If individual  economic indicators suggest a positive development even for only  a single month, private representations of interests feel the  need to announce the final turnaround. The tendency to play  down bad news grows in proportion to the length of the phase of  downward development, according to the motto that every economic  cycle must come to an end some time.    Whether this would happen before the end of 1994 was very  questionable even before Hosokawa's resignation. In fact,  private consumption continues to be overshadowed by growing  unemployment, stagnating real incomes, rising interest rates --  above all, those of mortgages -- the unabated decline in  investments in the private economy, and -- as opposed to stock  market expectations -- only moderately rising proceeds of  enterprises in the current business year. On balance, no  economic impetus can be expected from the public sector in the  new fiscal year but rather preparations for a stronger political  skimming off of surplus purchasing power. Deflation and the  fiscal consequences of attempts to curb it continue to dominate  the economic scene and ensure that Japan will not have much  reason to rejoice this fiscal year.    The official estimates of the real-estate price deflation  for  1993 published in March went practically unnoticed by the  foreign public, and their explosive impact on the economy was  underestimated. This third slump in prices in a row, as a  result of which real estate prices dropped to one-third of 1988  levels, corresponds to a loss of over 300 trillion yen (4.8  trillion German marks) last year. What is even worse: No end  is in sight to the decline of the value of commercial property  in view of the sharply increasing rate of unused space, which  currently stands at 10 percent (at over 30 percent in new  buildings). If the construction industry suffers a setback this  year, the economy will lose its driving force of the past four  years.    It goes without saying that the ongoing real estate drama  will continue to be a problem for the financial industry.  Despite value adjustments, the deterioration of the credit  portfolio is reaching dangerous levels that will force the banks  to abandon recapitalization policies based on the principle of  joint and several liability if the stock exchange boom does not  continue. The problems of the financial industry mean that the  pace at which the the recession is overcome will be painfully  slow, which also destroys the dreams of a bull market. A solid  and nearly blind optimism is needed there. If this cannot be  ensured, the search for the upswing will resume in 12 months  where it began today.</p>

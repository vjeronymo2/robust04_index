			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today  announced that the leaders of the three East African states,  including Zaire, will meet soon over the strife in Rwanda.  President Moi said neighboring states should not stand back and  watch as many innocent lives are lost through the civil strife.    The president noted that the many problems currently facing  the African continent are as a result of embracing foreign  ideals without due understanding of what they entail. He  reiterated that tribalism was an evil that had contributed to a  lot of problems in Africa.    President Moi observed that Kenya achieved a lot in various  sectors because of the peace and tranquillity that continued to  be maintained since independence. He attributed the country's  stability to the democratic principles that have continued to be  practiced since independence. President Moi was speaking at  Njumbi secondary school in Kangema Division of Murang'a  District, where he helped to raise 6,662 shillings and five  cents in aid of Kangema divisional bursary fund.

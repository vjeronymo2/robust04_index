			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2 begins another adaptation of Martin Chuzzlewit (the last was in 1964) and already we know that two things are going to be missing. First Miriam Margolyes, whose one-woman Dickens show proved that she was born to play Mrs Gamp, has not been cast in the role. The part has been given to Elizabeth Spriggs, a great actress but not even the right shape. Second, it has been decided to cut the American section altogether and consequently Dickens' famous attack on the conceit and hypocrisy of 19th century American society. Of course that still leaves enough narrative for umpteen television series, but it does make you wonder about what political correctness is doing to the BBC2 (9.00). Earlier the same network considers the way in which man-made noise is threatening the survival of whales. Horizon explains how noise can interfere with the whales' use of sonar for hunting and finding mates (8.00). The current affairs series investigate how we spend our taxes: Cutting Edge on disturbed youngsters (9.00 C4); and Panorama on the elderly (9.30 BBC1).</p>

Latest statistics show that the development zone ranks on  top  in 14 indices, including tax payment, fiscal income, number of  overseas-funded enterprises, contracted overseas investment, and  is second in the nine other indices including the export volume.    Up to the end of 1993, the zone has approved 1,709  overseas-funded enterprises, with a registered capital of 1.72  billion U.S. dollars, since it was launched in 1984 upon the  approval of the State Council.    The zone, 137 km to southeast of Beijing, also attracted  some  2,930 enterprises funded by other Chinese regions, with the  registered capital reaching 7.39 billion yuan.    At a new conference Saturday [22 January], officials from  the  development zone said that they would regard its tenth  anniversary as the starting point of a new drive for more  investment and better economic returns.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Former Italian civil servant faces charges over ingots A FORMER senior civil servant in the Italian Health Ministry is having difficulty explaining how he came to possess gold bars, coins and jewellery worth some L200bn (Pounds 83.8m). This is only part of the wealth magistrates have uncovered in the past week which Mr Duilio Poggiolini claims to have earned from 'consultancy'. Four Italian bank accounts with funds totalling L17bn, plus another one in Geneva holding SFr11m (Pounds 5m), have been traced to Mr Poggiolini and his wife. Milan and Naples magistrates investigating large-scale bribery and corruption in the Health Ministry allege that Mr Poggiolini abused his role as the official in charge of approval and distribution of pharmaceuticals to enrich himself on an unprecedented scale. This is the biggest collection of wealth unearthed by magistrates in the 18-month investigations into corruption. In one of Mr Poggiolini's flat a stockpile of 100 gold bars was found that included eight ingots of one kilo. There was also a hoard of gold sterling coins, krugerrands, and special gold mintings from countries ranging from the Soviet Union to Haiti and the Central African Republic. Mr Francesco de Lorenzo, the Liberal health minister under whom Mr Poggiolini last served, was last week protected from arrest by a parliamentary vote. But he faces charges of corruption relating to money allegedly extorted from pharmaceutical companies.</p>

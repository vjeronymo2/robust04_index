			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Italian left wants centre alliance Mr Achille Occhetto, the leader of Italy's former communist PDS party, (left) will today try to assemble a loose alliance with centre parties to counter rising electoral support for Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, writes David Marsh. Speaking in London as the election campaign opened, Mr Occhetto forecast a 'frightening future' for Italy if Mr Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia movement wins. Mr Occhetto used his visit, arranged in association with the Schroders banking group, to discuss his party's economic policies with UK-based industrialists and fund managers. He stressed yesterday that, if elected, he would continue the policies of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi aimed at cutting the budget deficit and reforming public administration.</p>

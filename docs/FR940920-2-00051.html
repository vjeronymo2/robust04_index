RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 20, 1994, New Mexico applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA has reviewed New Mexico's MSWLF application and has made a tentative determination that all portions of New Mexico's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. New Mexico's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has scheduled a public hearing on this determination and will hold the hearing if a sufficient number of people express interest in participating in the hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice. If a public hearing is held, it will take place on the date given below in the ``DATES'' section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the ``CONTACTS'' section below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments on New Mexico's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on October 20, 1994.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. State of New Mexico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 20, 1994, New Mexico submitted an application for adequacy determination. EPA has reviewed New Mexico's application and has tentatively determined that all portions of New Mexico's Subtitle D program will ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 8, 1994, the Solid Waste Management Regulations (EIB/SWMR&hyph;4) were adopted by the Environmental Improvement Board. As required by the New Mexico State Rules Act, NMSA 1978, Section 14&hyph;4&hyph;5 (1988 Repl. Pamp.), EIB/SWMR&hyph;4 was filed with the New Mexico State Records Center and Archives on July 18, 1994, and will be in effect thirty days after filing or August 17, 1994. NMSA 1978, Section 74&hyph;1&hyph;9.G. EIB/SWMR&hyph;4 was scheduled to be published in the New Mexico Register on July 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has tentatively determined that New Mexico's application is consistent with the Federal Criteria and will make a final determination of adequacy after the amended regulations become effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until October 20, 1994. Copies of New Mexico's application are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated in the ``ADDRESSES'' section of this notice. If there is sufficient public interest, the Agency will hold a public hearing on its tentative determination on November 4, 1994 at 10 a.m. at the New Mexico Environment Department in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Comments can be submitted as transcribed from the discussion of the hearing or in writing at the time of the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during the public hearing, if held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for New Mexico's program. EPA's final determination notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Mexico's solid waste program is not enforceable on Indian lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

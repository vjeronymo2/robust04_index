			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Greenspan warns on derivatives Central banks must work together to reduce the risk that financial systems will collapse as result of upsets in the trading of financial derivatives, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, warned last night. Mr Greenspan, who argued that central banks should retain responsibility for banking supervision as well as monetary policy, said derivatives trading by international banks posed challenges to the stability of financial systems. Derivatives - financial contracts whose value depends on underlying instruments such as currency exchange or interest rates - had helped to heighten the inter-dependence of financial markets and market participants. 'Disturbances in one country or sector are rapidly transmitted throughout the world economy. They pose challenges to central banks'. . . responsibility for the stability of the world's interdependent financial systems,' he said. Mr Greenspan, addressing the Bankers Club in London, said co-ordination among central banks had become essential because problems in financial markets were increasingly likely to have systemic consequences crossing borders. His remarks are the latest expression of concern by an international bank supervisor at the potential risks created by derivatives, which are predominantly used by companies and financial institutions to hedge risks. The Fed chairman emphasised that the growth of derivatives reinforced central banks' mandate 'whether written in law or not' to protect the integrity of financial systems, as well as overseeing monetary policy and payment systems. Last year Mr Greenspan attacked US Treasury plans to consolidate banking supervision, currently spread among four agencies, including the Fed, into a single Federal Banking Commission. The Fed would retain its responsibilities for monetary policy and the payments system under the proposals. The solving of financial crises often depended on central banks having a dual role, even if this was de facto, he said yesterday. 'The successful resolution of financial crises often depends upon links between the insights and expertise gained through banking supervision, and those gained from the pursuit of macroeconomic stability.' The development of derivatives and risk management had 'yielded great benefits' to financial institutions and their customers, but had generated 'an elaborate web of financial interrelationships'. He said that difficulties at internationally active banks 'could well have an impact on a wide range of other financial institutions, and through them on the economy'. Mr Greenspan said the Fed and other central banks had worked with banks 'to seek in advance improvements that could mitigate the potential for systemic disruption without destroying the benefits of these useful instruments'.</p>

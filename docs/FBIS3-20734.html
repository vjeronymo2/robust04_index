			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. Nedeljkovic: "Appeals"] </F>   [Text] The management of the Serbian Electric Power  Industry has found itself in a no-win situation. By appealing to  consumers to conserve and rationally consume electricity, it has  to destroy an age-old myth of Serbian might. In the former  Yugoslavia, and especially during its disintegration, residents  of Serbia were made to believe that the Serbian power industry  is strong, that it can satisfy domestic needs and the needs of  other consumers, and even export a surplus to European  countries. Only France was held up as an example of a country in  a better position and able to export more power than Serbia.  Since the media, together with the highest political and state  representatives, participated in the creation of this myth, it  is not surprising that it became rooted in the people's  consciousness.    Everybody thought that without Serbian energy, Slovenes,  Croats, and Macedonians would be left in darkness, that their  countries will not be able to survive. Nowadays, however, as  soon as the weather turns colder, the Electric Power Industry  appeals to consumers to conserve energy and then institutes  cut-offs. Most people suspect the utility companies of some sort  of a plot to cover up their exporting electricity and leaving  consumers without power or simply a plot by enemies or  saboteurs. All explanations by the experts, data, and appeals  are at no avail -- people obstinately believe that there is  plenty of electricity, even a surplus.    Facing the truth is painful. It obviously takes time to  destroy a myth. However, the truth is that the Electric Power  Industry of Serbia is incapable of meeting consumers' needs the  moment there is a failure in the power system or a substantial  increase in demand, which happens regularly when it gets colder.  The experts say that the system can deliver 110 million kWh per  day maximum. But consumption reached record levels last  November, December, and January. A few days ago, consumption  climbed to 114 million kWh and it will probably continue to  increase. It is also true that we import power, be it from our  neighbors or from former republics, whenever there is an upsurge  in demand. It is also an unpleasant truth that power cannot  reach consumers because the distribution system lacks the needed  capacity. Around New Year's Day, 35 transformer stations and 10  kilometers of long-distance power lines burned out, causing 3  million German marks' worth of damage. Additional problems are  caused by the lack of equipment and spare parts as well as the  lack of funds.    Why the electric power industry became impoverished and why  electricity consumption increased 60-70 percent is another  question. Without speculating, it is worthwhile mentioning that  in the opinion of experts the government deliberately "preserved  social peace with low electricity rates." If this thesis is  correct, the bill for such a policy will be too high. It must be  remembered that although industry is virtually at a standstill  -- hence not consuming much power -- this free-fall of  industrial production will have to bottom out some day, since  the crisis cannot last forever. But how to spur the economy if  there is no power?    The electricity rates are probably the main culprit for the  present situation, although prices are not the sole cause. Due  to the low rates, the electric power industry cannot even use  barter to pay its bills; a sawmill can pay its monthly bill with  a board four meters long and a cement factory with a few sacks  of cement. It does not pay for a utility company to read a meter  and send a bill since the paper costs more than the amount due.  This is absurd. Hope lies in the stabilization program. This  year, the electric power industry expects an average price of  four cents [as published], not realizing that nobody will be  able to pay it.</p>

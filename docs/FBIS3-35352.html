			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 22 Feb (AFP) -- The rebel Sudan People's  Liberation Army (SPLA) has claimed that its forces repulsed a  huge government infantry brigade between Amadi and Lui offensive  on February 12, capturing tanks, lorries and communications  equipment.    A statement issued here Tuesday by John Garang's SPLA  faction  said its forces of Maridi-Mundri, reinforced by those from  Rumbek, under the command of Gier Chuong Aluong and Jadallah  Wani, destroyed two tanks, and 16 lorries, forcing the enemy to  run in disarray.    During their flight, the government forces abandoned seven  landrovers and four Toyotas mounted with heavy machine guns,  ammunition of various categories and food, the statement said,  adding that SPLA forces also captured a radio communication set  and one of its operators, a man from the Nuba Mountains.    The Sudanese Government has persistently denied that its  forces had mounted a major offensive in southern Sudan, where a  bloody civil war has been raging since 1983 between government  forces and southern rebels seeking to end domination of the  mainly Christian and animist south by the Arabised Moslem north.  Khartoum has instead said the fighting has been between the  different faction of the SPLA, a claim that has been strongly  denied by the southern rebels.</p>

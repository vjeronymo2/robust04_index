			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Malcolm Rifkind, the defense minister  [title as received] of Great Britain, visited Sarajevo today.  The guest from Britain conveyed his government's deep concern  for the situation in Sarajevo and the whole of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Edin Nusic has the report.    [Nusic] Malcolm Rifkind and [Bosnian Prime Minister] Haris  Silajdzic gave statements following the talks. The British  defense minister conveyed the concern of the British Government  for the situation in Sarajevo, and added:    [Begin Rifkind recording, in English, fading to superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] I think that the whole world was  struck by the horror that befell the citizens of Sarajevo.    Although this is the most serious incident, we believe that  it is by no means the only one. The citizens of Sarajevo have  for a long time faced fatal agony and fear. We must consider  every possibility of improving the situation and restoring peace  to Sarajevo and the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as  possible. [end recording]    [Nusic] Prime Minister Silajdzic had the following to say  about his talks with the British defense minister:    [Begin Silajdzic recording] The visit by Mr. Rifkind, the  defense minister of Great Britain, shows Great Britain's current  new interest in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I tried to explain our  situation concerning humanitarian aid and in the field.  Humanitarian problems are huge, and they must not be forgotten  under the circumstances, although it is very difficult to speak  about humanitarian convoys after 66 deaths and 196 injuries  yesterday. We said that we believe that force should be used  against those who stop humanitarian convoys and, of course,  against those who kill civilians in the way that it was done  yesterday. We said that we have been waging a war against  fascism on our own for two years now, and that Europe surprised  us. Fascism is an issue that concerns all of us, something we  all must fight. I hope that after this visit, which is well  timed, this will no longer be so. [end recording]</p>

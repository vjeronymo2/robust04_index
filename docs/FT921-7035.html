			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Gold closed below Dollars 350 a troy ounce on the London bullion market in lethargic trading dominated by technical factors. The morning fix of Dollars 349 marked a five-month low, but the market recovered a little ground on bargain hunting and short covering. The April contract on Comex had recovered by midday from a lifetime low of Dollars 350.20 struck shortly after the opening. On the LME aluminium rose on the back of the copper market, but three-month metal met resistance around Dollars 1,340 a tonne. Dealers are expecting another increase in stocks today. London robusta coffee prices closed down sharply while New York arabicas well down at midday after the ICO indicator hit a 17-year low of 54.57 cents a lb. New York traders said there was little fresh fundamental influence in the market and prices remained weighed by abundant supply and an absence of strong demand. May scored a low of 67.20 cents a lb. 'The picture is bleak. There's a burdensome supply for the near-term and we've got a lot of new crop,' said one analyst. Robustas have fallen by about Dollars 100 a tonne since mid-January. 'With the state of the market at the moment we can see it declining further,' a London dealer said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

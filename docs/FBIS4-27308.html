			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Radio essay: "Let Us Glorify Chuche-Oriented Revolutionary </F> Tradition for All Ages to Come"]    [Text] The revolutionary tradition is the historic root of  the revolution. It is not only the blood vessel of the  revolution, but is also the cornerstone of the revolution, which  links generations into one lifeline in the course of the  revolution.    Only when the revolutionary tradition is purely carried on  can the revolution constantly advance along the straight road  designated by the leader [suryong] and all sorts of hardships  and trials be surmounted. Historic experience and the situation  shown in today's revolutionary movement have left a bitter  lesson that the revolution runs off its track, its generations  are cut off, and the precious revolutionary gains won with blood  by the preceding generations and patriotic revolutionary  forefathers are lost when it fails to firmly defend and purely  maintain its lineage. This was eloquently proven by the collapse  of socialism in East European countries.    Today our party and people are resolutely safeguarding,  defending, constantly inheriting, developing, and enriching the  anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition created by the great  leader under the wise and tested leadership of the dear comrade  leader. All successes attained by our people in their rewarding  struggle to consummate the chuche revolutionary cause are the  immortal merits attained by our dear comrade leader in the  course of brilliantly inheriting and developing the  anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition.    The revolutionary tradition of our party and people is a  most  brilliant one unprecedented in the history of the movement of  socialist, communist revolution in terms of the profoundness and  richness of its contents, in terms of its width and depth, and  in terms of its driving force and vitality.    Our revolutionary tradition is the great chuche-oriented  revolutionary tradition, the one and only tradition of this  world, which was created by the great leader and which is being  purely inherited and developed by the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    On the days of the arduous and bloody anti-Japanese  resistance the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song brilliantly  created the immortal chuche idea by embodying the demands of the  times and the aspirations of the people and pioneered the  revolution independently and creatively. On this course he  provided the glorious chuche revolutionary tradition, which is  the cornerstone for ages to come.    The chuche-oriented revolutionary cause that the great  leader  constantly developed and enriched on the days of building of a  new democratic Korea after national liberation and on the days  of leading the totally new socialist revolution and construction  to the single road of victory following the fierce fatherland  liberation war is being further deepened and developed on the  historic march road on which the dear comrade leader is modeling  the whole society after the chuche idea.    The revolution's guiding ideology, guiding theory, and  guiding method which are the guiding principle in revolutionary  struggle and construction are extensively and broadly embodied  in our revolutionary tradition and the noble revolutionary  achievements and rich struggle experience is reflected in it.  This is why our revolutionary tradition is shining as the  immortal banner which firmly ensures the consummation of the  chuche revolutionary cause and as the brilliant beacon which  opens an infinitely bright path ahead of our revolution.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Our  party  has consistently and resolutely safeguarded and defended the  glorious revolutionary tradition created by the leader [suryong]  and is extensively inheriting and developing in conformity with  the demands of modeling the whole society after the chuche idea.    The dear comrade leader defined it as an important task to  resolutely defend the chuche revolutionary tradition provided by  the great leader on the days of his anti-Japanese resistance and  takes it as an invariable iron rule to purely defend the chuche  revolutionary tradition and to apply it in the revolution and  construction.    One day in October 1964, when our party entered a new stage  in the course of its development, the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il called in a functionary and urgently told him that the  tradition that we advocate is not a tradition of mere patriotism  but a chuche revolutionary tradition, in other words, it is not  only a problem related to the historic roots of the party and  the revolution, but is also a problem related to the bloodline  which carries forward the party and the revolution.    Hearing the dear comrade leader's unique ideology and theory  on the revolutionary tradition, the functionary was deeply moved  by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's firm faith and strong  will to firmly defend the purity of the revolutionary tradition.    [Text] Also, during the days of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il's on-the-spot guidance of the revolutionary battle site  in Yanggang Province, the precious revolutionary tradition  achieved during the anti-Japanese armed struggle period was 100  percent succeeded and 100 percent fulfilled. Therefore, he once  again clearly elucidated the rock firm position and strong will  to complete the Korean revolution to the end as intended by the  great leader.    One-hundred percent succession and 100 percent fulfillment.  This is a high intention of the dear comrade leader who said  that this was a cherished desire of the many Korean communists  who passed away first after sacrificing their lives to defend  the headquarters of the revolution. When this kind of firm  faith and iron-like will of the dear comrade leader was echoing  along the mountain ridges of Mt. Paektu, this made all the  people's hearts wrapped up in a solemn feeling.    The dear comrade leader cleanly washed out all kinds of odds  and ends with Paektu's clear spirit and energy and firmly  adhered to the chuche-oriented bloodline. Therefore, he  maintained our party into a militant and iron-like party that  has vigor and our people into an invincible force who are firmly  united around the party and the leader.    What is the most beautiful song our people like to sing, and  what song do our people enjoying singing the most today? That  song is the revolutionary song highly sung by the members of the  Saenal Juvenile League of Musong during the dawning of our  revolution, and it is an immortal revolutionary song proudly  sung by the first youth vanguards of Korea on the advance road  of our revolution in admiration of the great leader.    What are the immortal towers most magnificently and most  highly rising on this land today? They are the immortal  historic revolutionary monuments which were established in each  sacred track left by the great leader during the arduous period  when our revolutionary cause was being pioneered for the first  time.    Beginning from Mt. Paektu, there are revolutionary battle  sites and historic places of revolution everywhere in our  country. In all revolutionary battle sites and historic places  of revolution including Mangyongdae, Ponghwari, Mt. Paektu,  Samjiyon, Chongbyong, Pochonbo, Popyong, Wangsejan, they are  permeated with the great leader's revolutionary history and  immortal revolutionary achievements in which he made his way  through the thorn thickets of the arduous struggle in the  forefront and led our revolution to the one road of victory and  glory.    Reflecting our people's earnest desire to convey the great  leader's immortal achievements generation after generation, the  dear comrade leader energetically led all the work in  maintaining all the country's revolutionary battle sites and  historic places of revolution. Therefore, revolutionary assets  of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle period were revived  in its original form. Thus, it was possible to advocate, adhere  to, and eternally elucidate the great leader's revolutionary  struggle history, revolutionary activities, and lofty leadership  achievements generation after generation. It was also possible  to wholly, purely, and extensively succeed and develop the  chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition achieved by the leader,  and it was possible to be elucidated as a revolutionary asset of  a far-reaching plan and a cornerstone of the revolution.    Embodying the revolutionary tradition in the revolution  and construction, and the life and work is the course of  developing and inheriting the revolutionary tradition and, on  this course, the revolutionary cause can be inherited and  consummated.    The purpose of developing and inheriting the revolutionary  tradition is consummating the revolutionary cause till the end  by thoroughly embodying it in the people's work and life, and in  every domain of the revolution and construction. If the  revolutionary tradition is not embodied, it would only remain as  a legacy or a historic fact, and lose its vitality as an origin  of the revolution development.    Accordingly, the dear comrade leader has launched the  historic march of modeling the whole society after the chuche  idea and lifted high the revolutionary slogan urging the people  to carry on their overall social life in the way the  anti-Japanese guerrilla army did. "Producing, studying, and  living in an anti-Japanese guerrilla army way," the slogan calls  on the people to inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition to  today's life and worksand, thus, fully bloom the tradition. The  slogan carries the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's resolute  faith and will to endlessly inherit and develop a revolutionary  treasure which the great leader himself achieved during the  period in which our revolutionary cause was pioneered for the  first time.    The slogan calls for inheriting and embodying the  revolutionary tradition in everyday thinking and mental  activities, not keeping it as a mere historic record or a  knowledge. The presentation of such slogan has brought about a  new landmark not only in the economic and cultural construction,  but also in the people's way of thinking and work.    How is it that the upright spirit of self-reliance and hard  struggle flutter in every domain of our country's construction  and production? How is it that the wind of speed campaign  furiously came up? How is it that the entire country turned  into an anti- Japanese guerrilla army-style learning site which  resembles the university of revolution and the studying ground  of (?Madanggou and Paeksughan)? How is it that the entire  country is filled with the ranks of forerunners of communist  virtues, hidden heroes, and hidden men of merit? How is it that  the Song of Comrade is warmly resounding from the hearts of not  only the first generation of the revolution, but also the second  and third generations?    This is because the dear comrade leader is giving upright  guidance to consolidate the glorious chuche-oriented  revolutionary tradition as an everlasting footstone of our  revolution and a durable foundation for the cause of modeling  the whole society after the chuche idea, and to embody the  tradition in everyone's work and life.    No matter how stern and dark the situation may be, we are  surmounting the imperialists' ever-aggravating maneuvers to  isolate and crush us in the way the invincible anti-Japanese  guerrilla army did -- overcoming all sorts of difficulties with  firm confidence in victory and optimism. Likewise, we are  creating a new history of endless upsurges and advancement in  the socialist construction. Because there is the dear comrade  leader, a true hero of heroes, a great commander of commanders,  and a great figure of our time, our people are accelerating the  construction and revolution in the way the people did on the  days of the anti-Japanese struggle even though so many years  have passed.    Kang Yong-sil, lecturer at the Korean Revolutionary  Museum, speaks about her impression felt during her meeting with  numerous visitors at home and abroad and foreign friends who  came to learn the chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition:    [Begin Kang recording] The chuche-oriented revolutionary  tradition which was created by the great leader and which is  being purely inherited and developed by the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong- il is a loftiest and purest revolutionary tradition  which cannot be found in elsewhere. Because the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il defends, adheres to, inherits, and enriches  our revolutionary tradition, our revolution is winning victory  after victory, unflinching even under whatever hardships and  trials as the spirit of anti-Japanese struggle and the  temperament of Mt. Paektu. Hence, we take it as honor and pride  to have such chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition which is  incomparably better than anything else in the world.    Numerous foreign friends and guests who visited the Korean  Revolutionary Museum unanimously envied the Korean people for  having the chuche revolutionary tradition and fervently extolled  the Korean revolutionary tradition as the one and only tradition  of the world. Asking who has brought the Korean revolutionary  tradition into full bloom, they then praised the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il as the greatest and the most excelled  inheritor and leader [yongdoja] of the chuche-oriented  revolutionary tradition. Whenever they praise him, we cannot  help taking greatest pride in being the Korean people who have  the great chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition.    We, as in the past, will fully unfold our revolutionary  tradition under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il. [End Kang recording]    Truly, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's lofty  achievements -- making the chuche revolutionary tradition which  was created amid the arduous anti-Japanese flame be inherited  for good without loosing its glare even if myriad years pass,  and letting boundless vitality and attraction be displayed even  in the future communist society -- will glorify for all ages to  come, and will push forward our people's revolutionary struggle  to consummate the chuche- oriented revolutionary tradition.    Today, our people have won the world-renowned fame for being  proud and glorious people who have the great chuche-oriented  revolutionary tradition. With invincible faith, our people are  fighting and living staunchly even under the situation in which  the imperialists' anti-socialist, anti-Republic maneuvers are  getting more vicious than ever. This is because there is the  wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], and the  brilliant revolutionary tradition of having smashed the  formidable evil imperialist enemy.    Our people, as in the past, will invariably defend and  adhere  to the chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition and glorify it  for all ages to come. Bearing in mind lofty meanings inscribed  on trees by anti-Japanese fighters with writing brushes, we will  fight and live in the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu as  during the days of anti-Japanese struggle without missing one  foot.    The road we are traversing now is the road of revolution  which reaches the secret camp of Mt. Paektu. On this road, we  will consummate the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause for sure  by inheriting the anti-Japanese revolutionary spirit to next  generation and faithfully upholding the leadership of the  respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Individuals must pay the cost of a civilised society Sir, David Parker eloquently puts the case for differential pricing within a privatised post office (Personal View, July 14). It is tempting to accept this argument, which is based on the demand for economic efficiency and correctly apportioned costs that are supposedly necessary in an unregulated, competitive market, and also on the inappropriateness of cross-subsidisation of one element of society - in this case rural dwellers - by another. Even in highly competitive markets, however, it is often the case that pricing is not directly related to costs in a rigid sense. Where a company wants to increase its market share it will undercut the competition, taking greater profits from areas where it is better established and more secure. This happens on a national and international basis and is cross-subsidisation of one element of society, or country, by another by business itself. To think that cross-subsidisation will cease on privatisation is wrong. As to whether one element of society should cross-subsidise another anyway, this is just an extension of the increasingly popular the-individual-pays-for-what-he-consumes argument. It appears economically efficient and fair. Taking this to extremes, however, encourages envy and creates division among members of society. This is because it does not consider the duty that individuals must assume in the maintenance of society at a given level of civilisation as payment for the benefits that individuals derive from living in such a society - these too have a cost. The attractive and obvious simplicity of the arguments advanced by economists like David Parker are contagious and increasingly common. But applying them unthinkingly to more and more services/products in isolation is dangerous. The application of a wider cost/benefit analysis in an effort to measure how society at large benefits is the real challenge. Andrew Allcock, 10 Friars Close, Tankerton, Whitstable, Kent CT5 1NU</p>

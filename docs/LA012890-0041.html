			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ANATOMY OF BULLET WOUND'  </P> <P> Your article is the first factual and objective piece of journalism that had  anything to do with firearms that I've ever seen in a major newspaper.  </P> <P> Paul Dean's writing style had little of the traditional slanted, emotional  content designed to provoke a predetermined response, telling the reader what  to think.  </P> <P> The use of deadly force is a course of last resort to protect life and  property, not a method to settle a drunken dispute (or a sober dispute for that  matter). You are to be applauded for bringing a little reality to this terribly  misunderstood issue.  </P> <P> CRAIG O. SMITH, Santa Barbara  </P></p>

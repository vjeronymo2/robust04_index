			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Base for Foreign Capital"] </F>   [Text] The country's first duty-free zone [svobodnaya  tamozhennaya zona] is to be set up in Maritime Kray near the  Russo-Chinese border.    Unlike ordinary duty-free zones, this zone will be a border  territory, where imports can be brought in and stockpiled  without payment of duty. Profit from the deal between buyer and  seller will go to the local administration budget and to the  Customs Administration account. It is also planned to organize  processing facilities within the duty-free zone. It is proposed  that the customs zone be located on the site of a loss-making  enterprise in Ussuriysk city. The zone will make it possible  for Maritime Kray to become a major staging post for foreign  capital on Russia's Pacific seaboard.</p>

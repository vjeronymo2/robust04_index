			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK must define view of EU democracy Sir, European democracy needs to be put on an open and clear footing and, as your editorial 'Agenda for Euro-reform' (September 20) argued, the 1996 inter-governmental conference will provide the occasion for this. The framework of the EU's institutional relationships needs to be defined so that every European citizen can understand them without the 'guidance' of the executive of the respective nation states. The current maze of powers, treaties, directives, institutions and interests serves only to confuse. In effect, the current EU is the pooling of executive sovereignty by the governments of the nation states and this, or better still the structure of a more democratic form, needs to be clarified by being written down. At the 1996 IGC a written European constitution will be formulated. Work on this is already going on across Europe. It will not be enough for the UK to wait on the sidelines for a European Parliament or a Commission version of a European constitution and then merely to criticise it. We must define our own principles for Europe and its institutions based on the concepts of subsidiarity, democracy and accountability, so that the European Union can develop as a set of more open and democratic organisations. In reflecting the views and wishes of all the peoples of Europe it will not only enhance its own relevance but also take its place as part of the pluralist democratic settlement in the UK itself.

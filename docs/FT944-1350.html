			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Pact defuses Gibraltar drugs trade row: Spain to ease 'intrusive frontier checks' following complaints by London Britain and Spain yesterday defused a diplomatic row over Gibraltar by agreeing to develop more formal arrangements for tackling drugs trafficking and other illicit trade between the UK colony and the Spanish mainland. A joint statement issued after talks between Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, and Mr Javier Solana, his Spanish counterpart, in London, said that both sides had recognised there was 'a problem of illegal trafficking in the Gibraltar area'. Both ministers agreed to establish a 'mechanism', which should include Gibraltarian officials, to 'improve consultation and co-operation' between all three sides. Mr Hurd said the authority would consists of 'two flags (Spain and the UK) and three voices (Spanish, British, and Gibraltarian)'; in other words, that the move would not impinge on either country's sovereignty claim over the colony. However, Spanish officials feel the proposal is a concession by the UK in that it potentially allows Madrid a greater say in Gibraltarian affairs. Spanish concerns that the UK was not doing enough to prevent Gibraltar becoming a big drugs smuggling and money laundering centre led Madrid earlier this month to step up border controls. The move fuelled resentment within Gibraltar and drew a diplomatic protest from the UK over what London claimed were 'intrusive' checks by Spanish police. Yesterday Spain agreed to lift secondary checks at the Gibraltar border to pave the way for greater diplomatic co-operation with the UK within the wider context of the EU. Mr Solana, in an interview, hailed the agreement on the illicit trade as a breakthrough in talks which underlined points of common interest on EU matters but which otherwise made little headway on long-standing differences over sovereignty in Gibraltar. 'The Gibraltarian economy has to be put on a more healthy footing. You cannot have an economy which is not sound,' he said. Mr Hurd said separately: 'I made clear to Mr Solana that intrusive frontier checks were not welcome. . . and stressed the need to build up confidence.' According to officials, both sides agreed, at least for the foreseeable future, to disagree on the issue of sovereignty rather than risk a confrontation with the Gibraltarian government. Mr Joe Bossano, Gibraltar's chief minister, has lashed out recently at both London and Madrid whom he has accused of approving a 'dirty tricks' campaign to destabilise his government. But yesterday Mr Hurd appeared to have appeased Mr Bossano by reiterating the UK commitment to a clause in Gibraltar's 1969 constitution. This guarantees that the UK will not cede the colony to Spain against the wishes of the majority of the population. Last night the Gibraltarian government issued a conciliatory statement of its 'desire to work in close co-operation' with the UK and 'in harmony with its neighbour'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On May 9 (Victory Day) former Russian Supreme Soviet  speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov met Chechen citizens in the mountain  village of Benoy (southeastern Chechnya, 100 kilometers away  from Groznyy - IF). Interfax learned that more than 20,000  people, including inhabitants of neighboring Dagestan showed up  at the rally.    Khasbulatov emphasized the necessity for normalization of  relations with Russia. He suggested that this would contribute  to stabilization of the situation in Chechnya and would bring  positive changes in the lives of the Chechen poor. He stressed  that the peoples must not suffer from the ambitions of certain  politicians.    A deputy Chechen interior minister who was present at the  rally called this an appeal to be within the composition of  Russia and urged that there be no speculation on this sensitive  issue. Khasbulatov replied that he had just expressed his  opinion. "Issues on state relations are not solved during  rallies," he remarked.    The Chechen presidential structures told Interfax that the  appeal by Khasbulatov had received practically no support.</p>

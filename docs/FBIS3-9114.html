			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The president of the Republic of Croatia forwarded a  letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on 16 March  concerning the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] mandate in  Croatia, which expires on 31 March. President Tudjman's letter  was published in New York as an official document of the  Security Council under S/1994/305. The letter is quoted in its  entirety: ``On 31 March 1994 the existing mandate of the  UNPROFOR will expire, leaving the Security Council with the  option of extending if for an additional period of six months.  The Republic of Croatia praises the UN soldiers and civilian  personnel for all of the efforts they have made in their  difficult mission of peace in Croatia. We are grateful for  their devoted humanitarian effort, which has helped many  citizens of Croatia, and we deeply regret the casualties which  the international forces have suffered in their brave task.    "The Republic of Croatia is once again ready to accept  prolongation of the UNPROFOR mandate on its territory,  considering the pivotal role of UNPROFOR in the overall process.  However, in making its final decision regarding the renewal of  the UNPROFOR mandate, the Government of Croatia must raise the  question of the necessity of improving UNPROFOR's performance.  Full implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions  remains the most essential, yet still unfulfilled, task of  UNPROFOR. With more than 16,000 UN peace-keeping troops  deployed in Croatia, and considering the precise goals inscribed  in the Vance plan (S/23280, annex III), it is difficult to  accept the inefficiency of UNPROFOR performance in Croatia. The  uncooperative and hostile behavior of militant Serbian  insurgents in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs) certainly is a  cause of considerable difficulties for UNPROFOR, but they should  not be permitted to impede the implementation of any Security  Council resolutions. Security Council Resolution No. 871 (1993)  of 4 October 1993 remains the foundation for any future UNPROFOR  action in Croatia, as well as the overall framework for  initiating the process of the peaceful reintegration of the  UNPAs into the legal and economic system of the Republic of  Croatia. Croatia stresses in particular the importance of  paragraphs 4 and 5 of Security Council Resolution No. 871  (1993).    "The full normalization of the position of the international  community toward the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and  Montenegro) must be preconditioned on the sincere cooperation of  its government in the full and prompt implementation of the UN  peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia. This includes  the provisions of the plan concerning the demilitarization of  the UNPAs, as well as the recognition of the Republic of Croatia  within its internationally recognized borders. In dealing with  the question of the UNPAs, the Republic of Croatia would like to  recall General Assembly Resolution No. 48/122 of 20 December  1993 entitled `Human Rights and Terrorism.' Actions of the  Serbian insurgents in the UNPAs can clearly be characterized as  terrorist acts, aimed at the destruction of human rights,  threatening the territorial integrity of the Republic of  Croatia, destabilizing the legitimately constituted Government  of Croatia, undermining a pluralistic civil society and having  serious consequences on the economic and social development of  Croatia. Therefore, we call upon the Security Council to  consider, in its future deliberations on the problems of the  UNPAs, the hostile actions of the Serbian insurgents to be acts  of terrorism. The Republic of Croatia remains fully committed  to the peace process, and it is ready to cooperate with UNPROFOR  in the fulfillment of its difficult mandate.    "As well as Security Council resolutions, the major  guideline  in our approach toward the achievement of a peaceful settlement  in the Republic of Croatia remains the European Union Action  Plan. Croatia is dedicated to remaining an element of stability  and security in the region, in close cooperation with the United  Nations. At the same time, I must once again emphasize the  extreme importance of successful implementation of all the  relevant Security Council resolutions for the rapid and peaceful  reintegration of the UNPAs into the legal and political system  of the Republic of Croatia. This is the only guarantee for peace  and stability in the region. In order to facilitate future  UNPROFOR performance, and considering the situation on the  ground, I am enclosing a series of goals and actions which  Croatia considers to be necessary for the success of the renewed  UNPROFOR mandate."</p>

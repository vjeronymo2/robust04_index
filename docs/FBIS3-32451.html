Attacks took place earlier today when Shining Path commandos  detonated a car-bomb in front of the Air Force General Command,  which killed two persons and injured 15 others, in addition to  causing a large amount of damage.    The evening attacks affected four bank offices, two of which  are the Banco de Credito and Interbanc. The explosions injured  six pedestrians and partially destroyed the facade of the  offices. Special police units alerted by telephone traveled  through different parts of Lima and defused packages containing  explosives near two state banks. A vehicle was found in the  populous Yerbateros neighborhood, east of Lima, with a homemade  rocket launcher inside that was about to go off. At least five  explosions were registered in the outskirt districts of San Juan  de Lurigancho and Comas, according to police reports.    Police stations increased their security in light of the  possibility of Shining Path attacks and police patrols in  strategic areas of the capital have been doubled.    The acts of violence reported Monday coincide with leaflet  advertisements, which were delivered to editorial rooms of  various Lima dailies, stating that the Shining Path is preparing  to launch a wave of attacks in February.</p>

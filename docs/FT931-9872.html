			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Holzmair &amp; Tan - Recital At the Wigmore Hall on Monday, the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair sang two dozen Romantic songs, accompanied by Melvyn Tan at a fortepiano. Their umbrella-title was 'Zwielicht' (twilight), but that placed no serious limits on the range of the programme: any song seemed to qualify so long as it mentioned the moon, the stars or both. That left room for nocturnal delights and horrors, storms and dewy calm, knights, hunters and lovers; and the whole recital gave unqualified pleasure. In a certain style of Lieder singing, Holzmair is a very model. The voice has a marked personal character, and he wields it with communicative flair. He indulges no great variety of vocal colour (and his tone is thin in the lowest register), though he likes to float soft, high-lying phrases on a cultivated head-voice. Nor does he underline or italicise key words, unlike some senior platform stars; and yet verbal sense is always foremost - every part of every song has something to say, whether vehement or sweetly reasonable. For this kind of delivery, Tan's fortepiano (quite a large one) made the perfect backing. Not only because its light, brittle tone was guaranteed never to cover the voice, nor because it resembled the instruments Mendelssohn, Schubert and Schumann knew far better than any modern grand; but also because Tan allows himself a degree of expressive licence, in impeccable period style, which is virtually unheard of among modern accompanists. Rhythms can be delicately bent (his treatment of the repeated chords on Schumann's 'Mondnacht' was marvellous), inner voices enhanced by spontaneous rubato. None of that was a distraction from the singing, since the fortepiano's scale of sound is so unthreatening; but it lent life and pretty surprises to all the music, complementing Holzmair's direct, seemingly artless manner - which by itself might have begun to seem a bit over-plain. Tan's exuberant mannerisms, in the purely visual sense, were another matter (had I been Holzmair, whose own bearing is modest and decorous, I should have been tempted to swat him); but if that kind of carrying on is what he needs to achieve such fresh results, one must not complain. Predictably, Mendelssohn's piano-parts sounded delectable on the instrument. Much less predictably, its limited capacity for sustaining sound - for Schumann, the usual pedalled richness a la Steinway was simply unavailable - inspired Tan to find all kinds of compensation in phrasing and highlights. He and Holzmair made a curious partnership, but a most successful and satisfying one.</p>

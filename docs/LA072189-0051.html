			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS' VOTING GAFFE PUSHES BILL HE FOUGHT;  </P> <P> MEASURE WOULD LIMIT MONEY FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> In a legislative mix-up, state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) inadvertently voted  for a bill he opposes, a measure that would place a cap on the amount of money  developers contribute to build schools.  </P> <P> Ironically, the prime supporter of the bill Davis accidentally supported was  partly responsible for scuttling a bill by Davis that could have forced  developers to pay more for school construction than they do now.  </P> <P> The strange sequence of events surrounding both bills offers a glimpse of the  lobbying under way in Sacramento over school funding legislation.  </P> <P> The bill Davis mistakenly supported was introduced by Leroy Greene  (D-Carmichael). The measure, backed by the California Building Industry Assn.,  would bar cities and counties from directly or indirectly charging developers  excessive fees to build schools. Under state law, developers pay school  districts $1.56 for each new square foot of construction.  </P> <P> Davis said Greene's bill was an attempt to reverse a state appeals court ruling  that has opened the door for school districts to collect more than the  established fee.  </P> <P> That ruling -- in Mira vs. San Diego -- said governments could refuse to grant  zoning changes for developments that would overburden school systems.  </P> <P> Education and building industry officials say the Mira decision indirectly gave  school districts the power to negotiate with builders, striking bargains to  withdraw their opposition to developments.  </P> <P> Greene's bill does not mention the Mira case by name, but it clearly tries to  prevent the sort of negotiations that Mira would encourage between schools and  industry, said Hunt Braly, a Davis aide.  </P> <P> But Don V. Collin, chief counsel for the building association, denied charges  that Greene's bill was deceptive. It merely reaffirms existing law, he said. He  conceded that the bill could indirectly discourage the negotiations that Mira  could produce.  </P> <P> Greene's bill did not attract any opposition from educational lobbyists and  appeared to be a routine item when presented to the State Senate on Thursday of  last week, Davis said. Like many routine bills, it passed without objection on  a 36 to 0 vote.  </P> <P> Davis said he must have been outside the Senate chamber when the vote was  recorded. He was in and out of the chamber throughout the day, and his failure  to object would have been recorded as part of a favorable vote by all members  present, he said. "I have no recollection of the bill," he said. "If I had been  aware of it, I would have raised a lot of hell -- and the bill would have  passed anyway."  </P> <P> Greene's bill could have a strong impact in Los Angeles County, Braly said.  Last month, the Los Angeles County counsel, citing the Mira decision, told the  Board of Supervisors that it could consider the effects of development on  schools when weighing building proposals. This opinion reversed a previous  county policy.  </P> <P> Last month, Davis agreed to co-sponsor a bill by Assemblyman Thomas M. Hannigan  (D-Fairfield), which said cities and counties could only approve new  developments if financing was available for schools, roads and other public  services. The bill passed the Assembly 43-34.  </P> <P> The building association, saying the bill would "accommodate every whim for a  public facility," urged its members to lobby their senators to vote against the  bill. Last month, the Senate Local Government Committee referred the  legislation to interim study, a procedural move that Davis called a "polite way  of killing the bill."  </P></p>

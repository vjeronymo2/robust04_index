			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RYPIEN RIGHTS REDSKINS' COURSE;  </P> <P> TWO 4TH-QUARTER TOUCHDOWN PASSES LIFT WASHINGTON  </P> <P> Late in the third quarter Sunday, the Redskins suddenly were a well-foiled  football machine -- and the formerly faithful at RFK Stadium had had enough.  The idea of losing to certain NFL birds, the Eagles for instance, is tolerable,  but not the flock doing all that damage.  </P> <P> The booing began as an irritated ripple, when Mark Rypien's third-down pass was  batted down, then increased in intensity when Ralf Mojsiejenko's punt wobbled a  pathetic 29 yards and the Cardinals scored almost immediately, on a 44-yard  run.  </P> <P> Having limped into this battle, the Cardinals somehow were getting better as  one after another fine player got sidelined with an injury. Their passing  actually improved after Roy Green broke his clavicle.  </P> <P> "It still wasn't like we were playing the Little Sisters of the Blind," Rypien  insisted. And as it developed, all he needed to improve on at game's end was  his cliches.  </P> <P> When matters became 21-13 ugly, when the crowd started to feel the wooziness of  a sixth straight home loss coming on, the Redskins just about drew a line near  midfield and declared: "No more."  </P> <P> It was appropriate that Rypien was mainly responsible for the Redskins'  comeback victory, with his arm and also his legs, because he'd helped set up  that predicament a couple of quarters earlier.  </P> <P> Strange team, these Redskins. They know football is a game of inches; they also  are more likely to gain 900 inches at a time than 36. On third and short, they  still come up short too often.  </P> <P> First and goal at the Phoenix 4 on the Redskins' first possession became a  chip-shot field goal by Chip Lohmiller. Next time down the field, Rypien passed  for a two-yard touchdown. But serious trouble, a probable halftime lead  crumbling into a one-point deficit, started when Rypien once more couldn't hit  Donnie Warren from about spitting distance.  </P> <P> Unlike last week, Rypien did not overthrow Warren. He was low this time,  hitting a bloated fencepost named Jim Wahler who had gotten near Warren's path  on first and 10 at the Cardinals 19.  </P> <P> Ahead by 13-7 a moment before Rypien let loose of a ball better tucked to his  chest, the Redskins soon were down 14-13 after J.T. Smith made the second and  third of at least a half-dozen spectacular Cardinals catches.  </P> <P> That may be why Rypien relied on his legs on another critical play, one that  went the Redskins' way early in the fourth quarter. He was scrambling again,  though lots of uncluttered field loomed this time.  </P> <P> There was a choice as Rypien came close to the line of scrimmage: flip the ball  about 32 inches to wide-open Earnest Byner or keep it. Byner was the more  reliable runner, but Rypien had learned his lesson about passes seemingly  impossible to miss.  </P> <P> He ordered Byner to block, which he did, flipping linebacker Ken Harvey  feathers over beak so Rypien could scamper 15 yards to the Phoenix 15. This  also ended with less than what the Redskins wanted, a field goal instead of a  touchdown, but Rypien had reestablished a positive presence.  </P> <P> Still in only his 11th start as a pro, he wanted to act as unfazed during this  rally as the grizzled guys around him in the huddle. Which he did. Down the  stretch, it was a Zippin' Rypien that riddled the Cards.  </P> <P> A pair of touchdown passes gave the Redskins' defense a lead it couldn't quite  squander in the final seconds; a 39-yard pass to Art Monk that ended short of  the end zone might have been Rypien's finest effort.  </P> <P> For ever so long, Rypien has missed on long passes down the right sideline. A  buddy has been open; the pass has been achingly close at times, though still  off target.  </P> <P> Monk had run a bit deeper into NFL history earlier, catching the 600th pass of  his career. This time, gliding along the right sideline, he had a step on  cornerback Cedric Mack. And Rypien was in his Johnny Unitas mode.  </P> <P> That hummer could not have been thrown better. From close to where Monk finally  came to earth, Rypien switched programs, this time becoming Mark The Quick.  </P> <P> Near the right sideline from the Cardinals 12, Rypien seemed about to be  grabbed by 259-pound David Galloway. What Galloway clutched was an armful of  air, Rypien sidestepping him and firing complete in the end zone to Monk.  </P> <P> As he should have, Rypien praised his blockers and runners and catchers and  added, honestly: "They (the Cardinals) made a couple more mistakes than we  did."  </P> <P> If points were given for pluck, the Cardinals would have earned a bundle. With  a remade offensive line, they still surrendered just one official sack (Charles  Mann had Gary Hogeboom on the final play, but not before he lateraled the  ball); Smith's acrobatics will linger in cornerback Brian Davis's mind nearly  as long as the Giants' Odessa Turner.  </P> <P> "Coming in," Rypien said, "We wanted to protect our own backyard." He called  letting down fans that yesterday included Vice President Dan Quayle "a  tragedy."  </P> <P> The booing, Rypien said, "doesn't bother me at all. That's what fans are for.  But we're human." Three-and-two human, sporadic, erratic and dramatic, with a  chance to join the Giants in the first-place NFC East attic by dusk next  Sunday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tim Cohen] </F>   [Text] Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials  estimate that the list of party candidates published in the  Government Gazette a fortnight ago could drop by up to one-third.    IEC spokesman Niki Moore said yesterday although political  parties had handed in their final party lists last month, a  large number of candidates had decided not to stand. It is  understood that others dropped off the list after irregularities  were discovered when details provided by the political parties  were checked against state records.    Following the closing date for the submission of candidates'  lists, the IEC had barred political parties from adding names to  their lists, she said. But the commission could not prevent  parties from withdrawing names from their lists if candidates  decided they did not intend standing.    A total of 12,610 candidates had been put forward by  political parties and their names were published in the March 31  Government Gazette. It is understood that few changes will be  made to the major parties' lists. Some smaller parties  submitted long lists, which included candidates whose chances of  being elected are slight. This has raised speculation that some  parties put forward candidates simply to ensure they had enough  canvassers.</p>

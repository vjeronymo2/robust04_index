			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons/Eldridge The deal between Allied-Lyons and Eldridge Pope neatly illustrates the dilemma facing regional brewers in the UK. Eldridge needs the marketing muscle of a large brewer such as Allied-Lyons to promote its cask ales nationally. Without that or some similar arrangement it would not make much sense to stay in brewing. But in return it is having to open up its retail network to Carlsberg and Castlemaine lagers, giving Allied's new Carlsberg-Tetley venture a toe-hold in a region where it is under-represented. Eventually that could extend to Allied's ales as well. The prospect of such additional volume serves to make more sense of Allied's Carlsberg alliance. The benefits do not, of course, accrue to just one side. Carlsberg-Tetley will have to compete on price to attract the lager drinkers - they surely cannot be louts - of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Eldridge Pope will receive Pounds 6m to invest in its retail estate as well as some additional contract brewing. In the long run, though, it is difficult to see the arrangement as a panacea. Eldridge's best hope lies in retailing, not in struggling to remain in brewing. Its Thomas Hardy and Royal Oak bitters will be guest ales under Allied's wing. There is a surplus of brands as well as brewing capacity in the beer market. Some will not survive.</p>

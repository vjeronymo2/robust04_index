			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, released, or disclosed outside the Government without the permission of the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release or disclosure that is_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use, release, or disclosure is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize others to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification of an intended release, disclosure, or use for emergency repair or overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government to release, disclose, or have others use the data subject to restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release under 227.403&hyph;5(c)(2) (i) or (ii), the intended recipient must complete the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.403&hyph;7 prior to release or disclosure of the limited rights data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Specifically negotiated license rights. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights in data in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component, or process, including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement. The Government may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept less than limited rights in such data. The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the Government has to release or disclose the data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting officer must negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. Generally, such negotiations should be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected to be obtained through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the additional rights. Prior to negotiating for additional rights in limited rights data, consider alternatives such as_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent items, components, or processes; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify additional sources and maintain adequate competition among the sources; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government inventories to contractors who request the items to facilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;227.403&hyph;6 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Contract clauses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' in solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver technical data to the Government. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are computer software or computer software documentation (see 227.5), commercial items (see 227.402&hyph;3), existing works (see 227.405), or special works (see 227.406); in Architect-Engineer and construction contracts (see 227.407); or, when contracting under the Small Business Innovative Research Program (see 227.404). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Use the clause with its Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In the interest of the Government; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf of the Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7016, ``Rights in Bid or Proposal Data'', in solicitations and contracts when the Government anticipates a need to use, subsequent to contract award, technical data included in a bid or proposal that are not required to be delivered under the contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends'', in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractors, for performance of its contract, technical data marked with another contractor's government restrictive legends. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7028, ``Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government'', in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver technical data. The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data specified in the solicitation as deliverable data items that are the same or substantially the same as data items the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

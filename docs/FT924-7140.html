			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Pounding is even harder overseas BORROWING rates in other EC states are considerably higher than those in the UK. France has among the highest real rates in Europe, with annual inflation at 2.4 per cent, against a commercial bank base rate of 9.65 per cent.

The overdraft rate for private borrowers in France is 17 per cent on average. Business customers pay around 16 per cent for loans of less than two years, falling to 11.9 per cent for loans to be repaid over a longer period. The rate paid on long-term government bonds is 8.6 per cent while the Bank of France's intervention rate, at which it does most of its lending, is 9.1 per cent. In Germany, where inflation is 3.7 per cent, the rate charged on overdrafts and secured loans is between 14 per cent and 17 per cent. Very large companies could expect to borrow at about 12 per cent. The Bundesbank's benchmark rates are the Lombard rate - at 9.5 per cent - and the discount rate, at 8.25 per cent. Short-term money market rates were 8.75 per cent yesterday with the average rate on 10-year public sector bonds at 7.35 per cent. In Italy, the commercial banks, under strong pressure from industry and the Bank of Italy, have reduced their prime rate to between 15.5 per cent and 14.5 per cent for leading customers.

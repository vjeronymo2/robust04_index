			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Kingfisher shares fall on AGM comment Shares in the Kingfisher retailing group fell a further 21p to 522p yesterday, after it said sales growth in the first quarter of this year had been slower than in 1993. Kingfisher's shares have fallen from 778p at the end of December, amid City nervousness about Kingfisher's strategy under the chairmanship of Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy. Sir Geoffrey's comments to the annual meeting yesterday did little to allay those fears. He said sales in two of Kingfisher's businesses had fallen, although gross margins were generally improving and costs were being tightly controlled. 'Overall sales have grown at a slower rate than in the same period last year, though they have shown an improving trend,' he added. Kingfisher stressed that sales growth had been strong in the first quarter of 1993, before slowing later. It said the higher gross margin did not reflect a retreat from the 'everyday low pricing' strategy, but lower levels of markdowns, discounts and shrinkage. Sir Geoffrey, who enjoyed a 36 per cent rise in total pay excluding pension contributions to Pounds 1.05m last year, said sales growth at Woolworths had remained slow. After a depressed February, there had been some recovery to show an increase of about 1 per cent for the quarter. At B&amp;Q, the DIY business, sales to the end of April were 4.9 per cent ahead. But analysts believe like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, were flat. A brighter spot was Darty, the French electricals business, where sales grew 3.1 per cent. Sir Geoffrey said there were signs of economic improvement. But sales at Comet, the UK electricals chain, fell 2.1 per cent. Analysts believe that after a healthy contribution from new stores, like-for-like sales fell even more heavily. Superdrug, the discount drug store chain, saw a 0.7 per cent decline. 'The margin news was taken as some comfort,' said one analyst. 'But the sales figures were pretty poor - especially considering sales figures for the rest of the retail industry have not been too bad.' Some of the higher City pre-tax profits forecasts for the current year were downgraded, leaving the consensus at about Pounds 350m, against Pounds 309.3m.</p>

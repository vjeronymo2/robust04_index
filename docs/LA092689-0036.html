			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> L.A. CHAMBER WINDS APPEAR AT FOUNDERS HALL IN COSTA MESA  </P> <P> Maybe it's better, after all, that musicians don't talk to the audience before  they play.  </P> <P> In introductory remarks for a program Sunday by the Los Angeles Chamber  Orchestra Winds at Founders Hall in Costa Mesa, oboist Allan Vogel got  Janacek's age wrong (by a decade) at the time he wrote "Mladi" (Youth).  </P> <P> Janacek was 70, which was miracle enough, not 80, as Vogel said.  </P> <P> In his remarks before Mozart's Serenade in E-flat, bassoonist John Steinmetz  thanked the audience for its frequent applause between movements of every  preceding work -- despite its mood-shattering effect. The musicians, Steinmetz  said glibly, were "happy to receive any applause at any time." Somehow, a few  of the 148 members of the audience subsequently managed to resist the pitch.  </P> <P> Steinmetz also described the Orange County Performing Arts Center's Founders  Hall as one of the Southland's best rooms for chamber music. Ironically, he  said this before the piece that tested the bearable upper dynamic limits of the  resonant room or, as likely, the capacity of the ensemble for well-judged light  and shade.  </P> <P> Mozart's evergreen Serenade received a surprisingly cool interpretation.  Clarinetist Gary Gray offered focused, pale, but characterless playing in the  ethereal Adagio. His colleagues skirted over Mozart's endless inventiveness,  charm and high spirits. They did not take the repeat in the first movement.  </P> <P> Gounod's "Petite Symphonie" revealed the nine-member group's most attractive  qualities: warmth, precision and sympathetic response to one another. Flutist  David Shostac and oboist Vogel were models in this regard.  </P> <P> It took two movements for the musicians to bring Janacek's abrupt, fragmentary  style into focus. But then the sextet -- Shostac, Vogel, Gray, bass clarinetist  Scott Anderson, bassoonist Kenneth Munday and horn player Steven Becknell --  found merriment and innocence in the Vivace; nostalgia, regret and, especially,  impetuous optimism in the finale.  </P> <P> Debussy's "Syrinx" flute solo began life as a death-poem for the god Pan.  Perhaps to evoke a mood of mystery and sadness, or as a tour de force for the  flutist, the house lights were kept off during the piece. Shostac played the 2  1/2-minute solo with steady, luminous tone, but took a rather lively tempo that  compromised the origins of the piece.  </P></p>

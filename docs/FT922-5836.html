			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Researchers praise Dutch education HIGHER productivity in the Netherlands than in Britain owes much to the superiority of Dutch education and training, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In this month's National Institute Review, three researchers emphasise the relative inferiority of British workers in skill levels. Comparisons of manufacturing plants found Dutch productivity at least 30 per cent higher in engineering and more than 15 per cent higher in biscuits. The researchers highlight three contrasts: higher emergency downtime in British plants, reflecting poor standards of machine maintenance and diagnostic skill; greater difficulty in maintaining product quality; and higher shopfloor manning levels in Britain because of a comparative shortage of workers able to switch between tasks. The researchers say Dutch schools place greater emphasis on 'early systematic preparation for a career'.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Sony and Matsushita discuss digital video recorder format JAPANESE consumer electronics companies, led by Matsushita and Sony, are in talks aimed at agreeing a common standard for the next generation of video tape recorders, digital VTRs, which record films from televisions or camcorders in computer language. Unlike the current generation of analogue VTRs, in which picture quality falls off sharply when copies are made, digital VTRs offer the prospect of virtually perfect pictures no matter how many copies are made. The discussions, which involve two of the fiercest rivals in the consumer electronics industry, represents a concerted effort by Japanese manufacturers to prevent a damaging standards war in an area which they believe will be important in stimulating consumer demand for new electronics products. The talks are a strong indication that with consumer demand for new electronics products at a low point - and after both Sony and Matsushita have made expensive purchases of Hollywood studios - the industry recognises it can no longer afford to fight costly format wars which only confuse consumers and could be financially crippling for the loser. 'We would like to pursue the establishment of a single format in order to gain the support of a wide range of foreign and domestic manufacturers and thereby facilitate the digital VTR's diffusion among consumers,' Matsushita said. Matsushita and Sony are currently competing with different formats for digital portable music. Matsushita has backed a digital tape format called DCC, which it co-developed with Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics group, while Sony has launched MiniDisc, which is like a miniature CD. The two rivals are also locked in competition over the camcorder market, for which they have backed two incompatible formats. Sony has an 8mm format while Matsushita manufactures camcorders in the VHS-C format. The rivalry between Matsushita and Sony reached a peak in the 1980s when the two fought over the market for video tape recorders with different formats. The defeat, on the consumer market, of Sony's Beta format, was a big blow, not only financially, but perhaps more significantly to the company's reputation.</p>

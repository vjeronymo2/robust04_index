			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (7): Airport may become competitive - Judy Dempsey previews next month's flotation and considers its impact VIENNA International Airport (VIA) is set to be the second airport group in the world to seek flotation on the public market. In joining the British Airports Authority (BAA), VIA is likely to become more competitive and will be well placed to promote itself as a potential hub. Early next month, between 5.3m and 5.5m new bearer shares, each with a nominal value of Sch100 and representing 27 per cent of the enlarged share capital, will be sold to the public. Proceeds from the issue will raise about Sch1.8bn. The flotation means that the three current shareholders - the Republic of Austria, (which holds 50 per cent), the province of Lower Austria (25 per cent) and the City of Vienna (25 per cent), will have their share capital reduced to 36.5, 18.25 and 18.25 per cent respectively. Two-thirds of the listed shares will be earmarked for the domestic market, with VIA employees having the opportunity to buy 16 per cent of those shares. The remaining third will be set aside for the international market. The VIA authorities decided to seek a flotation on the public market for two reasons. First, it requires capital to complete the expansion and modernisation of the airport, probably one of the most 'user-friendly' airports in the region. Second, it is setting its sights on becoming a key secondary hub for central Europe. Expansion is vital if VIA is to tap the potential of the two runways which can cope with 300,000 movements (landings) a year, including night-time flying for Stage 3 aircraft. Movements are currently running at approximately 130,000 a year, largely because the terminals can at present deal only with 6m passengers a year. The two runways have the potential to handle 20m passengers a year. Several investment programmes aimed at modernising the airport have recently been completed. Between 1989 and 1990, Sch1.8bn was invested on expanding the departure terminal facilities and the arrivals terminal, and building an eight-storey car park. Current investments include the extension of the passenger terminal, the check-in hall, arrival hall and transit area, to twice their capacity, or twice in size by the end of 1992. Investments for 1992 will total Sch1.7bn, and Sch1.3bn in 1993. But what is the attraction of Vienna airport? Those who have lived there and have used the airport to fly to eastern Europe, acknowledge the relatively high standard of services and the manageable size of the airport, where, unlike some European airports, passengers do not have to walk long distances to the gates. Yet, despite Vienna's proximity to central Europe, over the years VIA curiously failed to attract any significant cargo or transit passengers. Little emphasis was placed on freight traffic. With the construction of warehousing and a freight forwarding building, VIA is determined to tap this market. The decision by Austrian Airways (AUA) to operate DC9s in the late 1970s partly explains why attention to freight and cargo was minimal: DC9s have little cargo space. Moreover, VIA also failed to tap the potential of the airport as a transit airport. Between 1987 and 1991 transit traffic has remained around 250,000 a year, despite the revolutions which swept eastern Europe in 1989. Officials and bankers involved in the flotation admit that VIA - and AUA - have to adopt a much more aggressive marketing strategy to get passengers to use the airport as a transit to the capitals of eastern Europe. But the opening of eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, means that Vienna airport, including its ancillary services, will have to be more competitive. Austrian Airways, which until recently held a near monopoly in Austria and the charter-flight sector, remains expensive; duty-free is almost prohibitive, and on airport charges (including landing fees) it ranks eighth highest in the world. VIA's aeronautical activities are regulated by a pricing formula set by the Austrian Ministry of Transport. A public flotation should make VIA more competitive. In the meantime, VIA is in the process of promoting its main strengths: growth in passengers. The opening up of eastern Europe expands its catchment area - from 3m people - Vienna and its conurbations  - to 14m encompassing Budapest, Prague, Bratislava and Zagreb. Passenger volume has grown above 10 per cent every year since 1987. The Gulf war and the Yugoslav crisis in 1991 broke that growth. congestion at other major European airports. In contrast to many of Europe's major airports, airspace over Vienna, and aircraft ground handling facilities are not overloaded. development as a second-tier hub for two types of transfer traffic: traffic between east and west Europe, and long haul traffic whose ultimate destination is a secondary location in Europe (probably eastern Europe). If the flotation is coupled with a marketing strategy designed to highlight these features, and if the flotation will make the services at VIA more competitive, Vienna can hardly lose.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Argyll to withdraw from discount retailing Argyll, the UK's third-largest grocery retailer, is selling the rest of its Lo-Cost discount chain, ending its 13-year ownership of the trading name. The group has agreed to sell 101 of its remaining Lo-Cost stores, together with the trading name, and a freehold distribution depot at Queensferry, North Wales, to Co-operative Retail Services, for up to Pounds 73m. It plans to sell the remaining 50 stores and related assets 'in due course'. The deal follows the sale of 123 Lo-Cost and 28 of Argyll's smaller Presto supermarkets to a consortium of Spar companies for Pounds 19.7m in August. CRS plans to continue operating the stores as discount outlets under the Lo-Cost name, and is taking almost all of their 3,800 staff. About 60 redundancies will result from closure of Lo-Cost's head office. As well as buying the Queensferry depot, CRS is leasing Lo-Cost's other two distribution depots at Salford and Shrewsbury. Mr Colin Smith, Argyll chief executive, said the decision to withdraw from discount retailing was a result of the strategic review being conducted into the group's business. Lo-Cost made operating profits of only Pounds 6.3m on sales of Pounds 471m in the year to April 2, and Argyll had decided to focus on its Safeway superstores and Presto supermarkets. The group was hindered in its efforts to make Lo-Cost a successful discounter by the wide variation in store sizes in the chain. CRS is paying Pounds 59m for the stores, plus up to Pounds 14m more, based on the average sales of the stores in the eight weeks until completion on November 12. Argyll expects to make a total of between Pounds 86m and Pounds 100m from the two sales agreed plus the sale of the remaining stores, compared with a net asset value of about Pounds 93m. Closure and other associated costs will be about Pounds 3m. The overall effect on earnings per share is expected to be broadly neutral. Argyll admitted the sale was not being made 'without a backward glance'. Lo-Cost was originally the retail operation of Oriel Foods, acquired by Argyll in 1981 from the RCA Corporation. The original Argyll management team ran Oriel Foods at RCA between 1974 and 1977.</p>

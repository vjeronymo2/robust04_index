			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: A kindness not to be repeated Sir, Anthony de Jasay's article, 'A vicious kind of social kindness' (Personal View, April 29), asks whether democracies are 'condemned to smother the young and the long-term unemployed with their caring kindness'. The impression is that the author himself is in no doubt that this is the case, but one wonders why. His analysis does not treat the young or the long-term unemployed as special groups. This begs the question of why they in particular should be disadvantaged, as they surely are. Inadequate training, particularly of the young and the long-term unemployed, does seem to provide a relatively good explanation for rising structural unemployment. It may have been a problem 20 years ago, but this is not an adequate reason for dismissing it as an 'old chestnut'. For that matter, de Jasay's argument against social protection does not exactly break new ground. The belief that cuts in social protection could stop the rise in structural unemployment was an important part of early Thatcherism. It is fairly clear now that cuts in both taxes and social protection during the 1980s completely failed to halt the inexorable rise in the UK's structural unemployment. Failure to realise this at the time - which led to policy mistakes, and so to overheating and recession - may be regarded as unfortunate. To continue to proclaim that social spending is the prime cause (rather than a consequence) of unemployment, is less excusable. Such vicious 'kindness' should not be repeated.

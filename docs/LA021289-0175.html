			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROJANS GIVE IRISH A FIGHT, LOSE BY 9  </P> <P> USC put on a good show against Notre Dame Saturday, but still ended up losing,  83-74, before a capacity 11,418 at Notre Dame's Joyce Center.  </P> <P> "This game was a carbon copy of our season," USC Coach George Raveling said.  "This one was like so many other games we've had. We are an unusual team. We'll  give anyone a game, but we fall short in the end.  </P> <P> "We're like a salesman. We make a good presentation, but we can't make the  close."  </P> <P> Chris Moore scored 23 points and Andy Pendleton, who made 4 of 10 three-point  shots, had 20 points to keep the Trojans in the game.  </P> <P> Moore was coming off a poor performance, when he missed 7 of 10 shots, in USC's  68-65 loss to UCLA Wednesday night, and didn't start Saturday.  </P> <P> But he ended up making 10 of 15 shots in 27 minutes. Calvin Banks, who started  in place of Moore, played 17 minutes and did not score.  </P> <P> For Notre Dame, Joe Fredrick scored 23, including four free throws in the final  minute. Freshman guard Elmer Bennett came off the bench to score 19.  </P> <P> Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps was particularly pleased with Bennett, who  played 23 minutes. "He hit some key baskets, including a three-pointer after  USC had cut the margin," he said. "That's as good a performance as I've seen  here by a freshman off the bench."  </P> <P> Freshman LaPhonso Ellis was held to eight points.  </P> <P> The Irish played without starting guard Jamere Jackson, who came down with back  spasms Friday night.  </P> <P> Notre Dame is 14-4; USC is 7-16.  </P> <P> Chris Fuller brought the Trojans within three points on a 15-foot shot with 45  seconds left for USC's final score.  </P> <P> Notre Dame opened double-digit leads three times but couldn't put away the  Trojans.  </P> <P> Free-throw shooting cost the Trojans a chance to tie the game, 70-70, when  Moore missed the free throw on what could have been a three-point play, and  then Ronnie Coleman missed one of two.  </P> <P> Notre Dame opened a 12-point lead midway through the first half, but the  Trojans fought back, outscoring the Irish, 13-3, to get within one on a layup  by Alan Pollard. But the Irish scored the final three points of the half to  lead, 41-37.  </P> <P> About USC, Phelps said: "They do have some talented athletes, but they just  seem to end up in a negative with one key shot or one key play.  </P> <P> "We were fortunate today because Pendleton can hurt you when he gets going.  (Chris) Munk is a very physical player who we recruited. And Moore really  played well today."  </P> <P> Still, the Trojans once again came up short.  </P></p>

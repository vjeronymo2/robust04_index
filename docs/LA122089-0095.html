			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Former Employer Sues Defense Firm: An engineer who quit his job at a Garden  Grove defense contractor filed suit against the firm Tuesday, alleging that he  was driven out because he blew the whistle on a scheme to defraud the  government. John A. Trepl II contends that officials of Swedlow Inc. began to  pressure him last year after he refused to cooperate in the firm's alleged  scheme to cover up flaws in windshields it manufactured for the B-1B bomber.  Trepl also said he alerted the FBI to the case. Swedlow and a vice president,  Norman Gene Nixon, 53, have been indicted on four counts of making false  statements to the government.  </P></p>

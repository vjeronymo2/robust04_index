They claim the Yugoslav Government's decision to make  outgoing citizens pay a personal duty of ten German marks and a  car duty of thirty German marks from January 1, violates the UN  Human Rights Declaration and the Yugoslav Constitution. They  believe the measure is in part cynically designed to deprive  ethnic Hungarians in the Yugoslav region of Vojvodina of the  link with their parent country they need to preserve their  national identity.    The movement's petition was not accepted by embassy staff,  but was read out by executives Pal Gyorgy Gado and Istvan Farkas.    Free passage through the border means survival for many  Yugoslav citizens in the economic crisis caused by the UN  sanctions, as many basic food products, agricultural fuels, and  medicines are only available abroad. However, most people are  unable to pay the 10 and 30 DM duties, reads the statement.</p>

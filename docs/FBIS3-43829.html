Reacting to reports that police had  warned him of an ultra-rightwing plot to assassinate him, Gen  Viljoen said he had not been given any specific information  about such a threat.    He conceded though, that times were becoming dangerous, and  that some sources said there was a threat from the African  National Congress [ANC] side, others said from  ultra-rightwingers, while others said it was government  information which should be treated with circumspection. He  knew of no specific threat against him, and his security  arrangements remained on a normal level.    Turning to suggestions of rightwing disenchantment with his  leadership, and talk that he was a government agent to moderate  the rightwing, Gen Viljoen said he had long been aware of such  talk, and saw it as part of a campaign to discredit him. "They  will do anything to alienate me."    Gen Viljoen also dismissed suggestions that he may be on the  verge of stepping down from his AVF position, saying he was  committed to establishing a volkstaat [nation state] for his  people. He said he had become disenchanted with the political  vacillations of the National Party and the ANC, which made  about- turns during negotiations for a volkstaat.    Gen Viljoen said he had never been expected to provide  political leadership for the AVF, but strategic guidance.    If the government decided not to accommodate the Freedom  Alliance [FA], the FA should discuss its future options. Asked  what these options would be, he said: "Your guess is as good as  mine."</p>

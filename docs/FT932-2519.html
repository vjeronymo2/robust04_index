			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping conference costs in check Californian video compression company Compression Labs (CLI), of San Jose, has entered the market for low-cost videoconferencing equipment with the Eclipse, including everything from graphics to the cabinet for less than Pounds 18,000. The price breakthrough has been achieved by developing a chip set which is also being used in video phones and PCs, and thus is produced in high volumes. The Eclipse, sold in the UK by Internet Videocommunications, has a 20-inch screen and works on digital ISDN phone lines, transmitting data at 128 kbit/s. CLI says the system can be installed in 10 minutes and takes the user a further 10 minutes to learn how to use it. CLI: US, 408 922 5429. Internet: UK, 0454 201000.</p>

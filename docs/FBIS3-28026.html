Hailing  the January 31 statement of a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign  Ministry in connection with the fact that the process of a  peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  is facing a grave challenge owing to the base perfidy of the  United States, the analyst says:    The DPRK's stand stems from the unshakable will and faith of  the Korean people who defend national dignity and sovereignty to  the end, regarding it as their life and soul and do not yield to  any pressure and blackmail.    If the United States intend to go back on its promise to us,  we will no longer be bound by the promise we made to the United  States. It is a gangster-like logic that one side may reverse  the promise between the two sides and the other side must keep  it. We cannot sit back and watch the manoeuvers of the United  States to isolate and stifle us.    If the United States stick to its attitude as today, we  cannot but reconsider our promises to the United States such as  the unilateral suspension of the effectuation of the withdrawal  from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, freeze of all the  nuclear activities and renunciation of the graphite-moderated  reactor system.    We have never considered that the DPRK-U.S. talks is a  present of the United States to us. Neither have we wanted  something from it. And we are not ignorant of its ulterior  intention. We have only wanted that the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula would be resolved in a peaceful way as the  Korean people and the world peaceloving people hoped for. This  is why we have consistently insisted on negotiations with the  United States.    If the United States is unwilling to settle the nuclear  issue  on the Korean peninsula through talks, we have no intention to  have talks. We are not indebted to the United States for  anything and will be able to get on without its favor. The  United States is too ridiculous, if it considers that we will  beg for talks.    It is not the United States alone that has the expedient and  the option is not open only for a big power. We have an  expedient to counter any other option of the United States.    We do not like to utter empty words. It is our invariable  will to mean what we say. It is the unshakable determination of  the Korean people and the People's Army to defend the  sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation to the  end and we are fully prepared politically and ideologically,  militarily and materially to cope with any event of contingency.    The United States must not miscalculate our will and  determination nor underestimate our might. It had better behave  with discretion, knowing well of our people and People's Army.</p>

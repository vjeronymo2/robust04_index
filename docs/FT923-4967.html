			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures squeezed A BEAR trap was sprung in the sterling futures market yesterday. Traders who had been persistent sellers of futures contracts in the expectation of higher UK base rates were caught out by glimmers of returning confidence, triggered by the  1/2 pfennig strengthening of the pound against the D-Mark to DM2.7875. Meanwhile, in the cash market the Bank of England's large offer of assistance was coolly received as easier interbank rates, especially short-term rates, discouraged the clearing banks. Sterling futures saw unusually high turnover yesterday, with December trading more than 30,000 contracts by the official close. The squeeze began around midday with the publication of opinion polls indicating the possibility of a 'Yes' vote in the September 20 French referendum on Maastricht. There was a rush to buy short sterling, and the December contract leapt from 89.16 to 89.46, an abnormally wide spread of 30 basis points. That indicates slightly lower expectations that base rates, now 10 per cent, will rise in the near future. The key three-month interbank rate, a good guide to market thinking about the direction of base rates, eased from about 10 9/16 per cent to 10 7/16 per cent. The one-year rate also dipped slightly, from about 10 13/16 per cent to around 10 5/8 per cent. The September contract, which expires before the French Maastricht vote, was also heavily traded and moved up 18 basis points to 89.45. Earlier in the day, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m, later revised to Pounds 1bn. This was far higher than expected. However, most banks were unprepared to take up the shortage and only Pounds 585m was provided, much of it in late assistance. Initially, the Bank bought Pounds 56m in Band 3 bills at 9 3/4 per cent and Pounds 24m of Band 4 bills at 9 per cent. In the afternoon the Bank purchased Pounds 130m of Band 1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Finally it provided late assistance of around Pounds 375m. One dealer said the Bank's help on Tuesday had taken the market comfortably into surplus. As a result, aggressive trading yesterday morning brought the overnight rate down and left the rates offered by the Bank of England unattractive.</p>

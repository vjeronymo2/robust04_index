			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIZONA WINS OVER CLEMSON IN VICTORY  </P> <P> By the reckoning of Clemson Coach Cliff Ellis, a season in the Atlantic Coast  Conference was preparation aplenty for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  tournament.  </P> <P> Could there be anything on the road to the Final Four that the Tigers hadn't  seen along Tobacco Road this season? Politely begging your pardon, Ellis and  his players doubted it.  </P> <P> They had seen Duke and North Carolina and N.C. State. They had beaten Duke and  North Carolina.  </P> <P> And they met Arizona Saturday.  </P> <P> After a 94-68 Arizona victory before a crowd of 12,428 in the second round of  the NCAA West Regional at the Boise State Pavilion, they were about ready to  grant the Wildcats admission to the ACC, travel arrangements be darned.  </P> <P> "That," Ellis said pointedly, "is a great basketball team."  </P> <P> Yes, admitted Tiger center Elden Campbell, "they would fit in real well in the  league."  </P> <P> Clemson (19-11) stayed with top-seeded and top-ranked Arizona (29-3) for 10  minutes, last leading at 25-23.  </P> <P> Then came a Wildcat strike. Arizona would score the next 15 points. And Clemson  would go 9 minutes 22 seconds without a basket, committing 12 turnovers along  the way -- including 10 in a row.  </P> <P> Before Derrick Forest broke Clemson's drought with two free throws with 1:49  left in the half, Arizona had a 39-25 lead.  </P> <P> That held up, meaning that Arizona was going to Denver for a West Regional  semifinal game against Nevada Las Vegas Thursday, and Clemson was going back to  South Carolina.  </P> <P> "I just like that team," Ellis said, still shaking his head. "I don't see any  reason they can't win it all."  </P> <P> He stopped short of calling Arizona the best team he has seen all season --  that kind of quote would be a yellowed clipping on ACC bulletin boards next  season -- but termed the game "the best performance" he has seen.  </P> <P> "Their pressure surprised me," he said. "Their defense is the whole key to it."  </P> <P> Clemson's plan against Arizona centered on its own defense. The idea was to  keep close tabs on Sean Elliott and Anthony Cook with a box-and-one or a  triangle-and-two.  </P> <P> "The role players -- we were going to make them beat us," Ellis said. "Well,  they did a pretty good job."  </P> <P> Matt Muehlebach, at the request of Elliott and Coach Lute Olson, started  shooting from outside to force Clemson to play a less fudging defense. He ended  up with a career-high 19 points, including four three-pointers.  </P> <P> Two of them came in the game's only crucial moments after the first 10 minutes.  Early in the second half, Clemson cut the lead to four points after two  three-pointers by Forrest and a dunk by Campbell.  </P> <P> Muehlebach lined up and knocked down back-to-back three-pointers, pushing the  lead back to 10. It was never single digits again.  </P> <P> "What everybody calls their role players are darn good players," Ellis said.  </P> <P> Jud Buechler, the other "role player" scored 15 points. Cook scored 14.  </P> <P> Elliott, special defense and all, had 25 points. "A quiet 25," Ellis called it.  </P> <P> Trailing by nine at halftime, Clemson thought it could come back.  </P> <P> "We felt comfortable," Ellis said. "We've been in that position a lot. Arizona  simply did not let up. I want to say this. I am overly impressed with that  basketball team."  </P> <P> Olson did not argue.  </P> <P> "Anytime we go in up at the half, we feel confident," he said. "As long as we  play hard defensively, I don't worry. We're an offensively explosive enough  team."  </P> <P> Defensively, Arizona kept Campbell reasonably contained. He had 24 points, but  15 came in the second half when the issue already had been decided.  </P> <P> Forrest scored 21.  </P> <P> The crucial defensive effort belonged to Buechler, who helped hold Dale Davis  to two points, 12 below his average.  </P> <P> The game over, Ellis reconsidered the question he had pondered since winning  the first-round game Thursday: How to beat Arizona?  </P> <P> "That's a good question," he said. "They run extremely well, and you have to  get back on transition defense. You have to help out on Elliott. But when you  do, you have to recover on the other guys. Their inside game is awesome and  they can hit from the outside."  </P></p>

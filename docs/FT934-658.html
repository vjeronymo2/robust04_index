			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: ERF cuts loss to Pounds 0.48m but shares fall ERF, the last remaining publicly-quoted UK truck maker, cut its pre-tax deficit substantially in the six months to the end of September 1993, from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 479,000. The loss last time was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 945,000. The shares closed 19p down at 295p. The company has been in loss for the last three-and-a-half years during the deep recession in the UK commercial vehicle industry, but is expected to return to profit in the second half of the year, helped by the growing recovery in heavy truck demand. Group turnover rose by 22 per cent, from Pounds 54.6m to Pounds 66.9m. Mr Peter Foden, chairman and chief executive, said that the UK heavy truck market had increased by 24 per cent during 1993, but there was continuing heavy pressure on margins due to stiff competition from European manufacturers. The UK is one of the few markets in Europe where truck sales have grown this year, and European truck makers have concentrated intense marketing efforts on the UK market. Mr Foden said that the deepening recession in Europe and in many parts of the world had affected the group's export business and sales into the Spanish and French markets had been difficult. Prospects for 1994 for ERF were 'more encouraging', he said, and the company was continuing to lower its cost base and improve its competitiveness. Despite the improved trading position there is still no interim dividend. The level of a final distribution would depend on 'trading circumstances' in the second half of the year, said Mr Foden.</p>

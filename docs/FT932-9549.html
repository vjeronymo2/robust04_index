			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: J. Sainsbury In the real world of groceries, J. Sainsbury maintained its serene progress last year, registering a 17 per cent advance in annual profits. In the unreal world of finance, Sainsbury's shares have fallen by a similar percentage since the start of the year, making it the sixth worst performing FT-SE 100 stock. The company's de-rating owes much to the normal turn of the investment cycle. At this stage of the game, defensive food retailing stocks go out of fashion as investors chase recovery situations and overseas earners. Much the same happened in 1982 when the UK last emerged from recession. The important question this time round, though, is whether something more than cyclical forces are at play. Does the aggressive growth of the discounters and the maturity of the superstore operators' development programmes presage an end to the sector's remarkable earnings gains? Although such concerns may be pressing by the end of the decade, Sainsbury's latest figures suggest a pessimistic conclusion would be premature. Respectable sales volume growth, continuing productivity gains and the addition of new space at an annual rate of around 8 per cent points to maintained earnings momentum for the next few years at least. The retailer's best friend - inflation - may also return to lend a hand. The market may soon warm again to the sector's virtues of steady earnings increases and solid dividends, especially if the broader recovery disappoints. By the second half of the decade, the big food retailers' ratings may depend upon their success in diversifying. Sainsbury's efforts may then have to be on a far grander scale if it is to sustain a premium status.</p>

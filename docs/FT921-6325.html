			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Scotland's recession shallower THE RECESSION in Scotland is less severe than in the UK as a whole but recovery north of the border is likely to be weaker, according to economists from the Scottish Office writing in the latest Scottish Economic Bulletin. Surveys of business and consumer confidence in the autumn and the fall in unemployment for two successive months in that period, are cited as evidence of the shallowness of the recession compared with the UK as a whole. This is reinforced by evidence from production and construction indices to date, showing the recession to be less severe than that of 1979-81. Although the Scottish economy grew faster than that of the UK as a whole between 1988 and last year, recovery will be weaker this year. Job losses are likely to be lower in Scotland this year, but forecasters expect sluggish employment growth in the medium term. Scottish Economic Bulletin No 44 Winter 1991. HMSO. Pounds 11.50.</p>

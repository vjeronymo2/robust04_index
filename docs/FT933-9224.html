			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Nigeria urged to name civilian interim leader NIGERIA'S military government may be preparing to name a civilian as interim head of state next week amid growing demands for an end to army rule. Vice-President Augustus Aikhomu, speaking on state radio, said the committee considering the powers and composition of the interim government had recommended that the appointee should also be chairman of an interim national government and should be named next week. But it remains unclear whether effective power will be transferred to the civilian leader due to be installed by August 27, the date President Ibrahim Babangida was supposed to surrender office to an elected president. Yesterday in Lagos armed soldiers were deployed at strategic bridges amid fears that a planned protest against the military government would prompt a renewal of riots that have killed dozens of people. The Campaign for Democracy, the coalition that called last month's protest against Gen Babangida's decision to annul the June 12 presidential election, has called on people to stay away from work and take to the streets from tomorrow until Saturday. Backing came yesterday from a group of retired generals and prominent civilians, led by the ex-military leader, retired Gen Olusegun Obasanjo. 'We urge all Nigerians to embark upon peaceful and non-violent means of expressing their disapproval. . . if Nigeria is to be saved from violent upheavals with disastrous socio-economic and political consequences,' said the Association for Democracy and Good Governance. Unofficial returns in the June poll gave a comfortable victory to Mr Moshood Abiola, now in Washington lobbying for support for his claim to the presidency. Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, voted heavily in favour of Mr Abiola and any stay-away is likely to paralyse the city. Businessmen yesterday started closing down offices, banks and supermarkets. However, Mr Aikhomu said the military government would declare a state of emergency if there was a breakdown of law and order.</p>

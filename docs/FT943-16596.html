			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Buses offer route for news dispute: Raymond Snoddy on why media moguls should heed precedents set in the public transport field Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, and Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Telegraph group, should be urgently looking into the economics of bus operation  - and in particular route 242 in Bognor Regis. As the two newspaper proprietors glower across the battlelines of a weekday Times at 20p and a Daily Telegraph at 30p, and the Office of Fair Trading starts inquiries on price-cutting, bus wars offer precedents. Last year the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that Southdown Motor Services had acted anti-competitively and against the public interest by in effect forcing the withdrawal of Easy Rider Minicoaches on route 242. The OFT's main precedent on predatory behaviour also has wheels  - a decision that Fife Scottish Omnibuses had tried to remove a competitor. How far findings from the bus industry apply to alleged predatory pricing of national newspapers is still uncertain. They do suggest, however, that both the OFT and the commission, with the agreement of the trade and industry secretary, have the power to intervene directly to change newspaper price structures if they find breaches of competition and fair-trading legislation. Proving predatory pricing and attempts to drive rivals out of business are never easy. A commission official said: 'It's like the difference between murder and manslaughter. To establish murder you have to prove intent and intent at the time the murder was committed.' The Independent believes there is clear evidence of 'murder' rather than 'manslaughter'  - that Mr Murdoch's News International subsidiary is indulging in predatory pricing with the intent of trying to drive it out of business. The Independent argues that at 20p Mr Murdoch will lose more money for every extra copy of The Times he sells unless there is a large rise in advertising revenue. It believes that there is no evidence of any such rise. Last year the OFT found that selling The Times at 30p did not represent predatory pricing. This time the OFT has two main options if it finds a full investigation is needed. It can carry out its own investigation under the Competition Act 1980 on any business activity which has, or is likely to have, the effect of 'restricting, distorting or preventing competition in connection with the production, supply or acquisition of goods'. A formal investigation might take up to six months and Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, could seek undertakings that could lead to a newspaper's cover price rising. If the undertaking were not accepted or not implemented correctly, Sir Bryan could call in the commission, which can take a year to complete an investigation. The other route would be for Sir Bryan to use the Fair Trading Act 1973 to make a reference to the commission if he considers a monopoly exists  - although any remedial action is in the hands of the trade and industry secretary. The Daily Telegraph, which sees itself as fellow victim with The Independent rather than potential predator, believes that although an investigation under the Competition Act might be both neater and relatively faster, a commission inquiry might make more sense. Telegraph executives have been advised that the commission could look at the broader issues of public interest and cross-ownership and how one part of a media empire can cross-subsidise another. When looking at the route 242 precedent The Independent will see that the remedy for Easy Rider Minicoaches came after its forced withdrawal. For that reason The Independent is considering going to the European Commission. European investigations can make the monopolies commission look positively speedy  - but the complainant can seek injunctions to stop the alleged abuse until the issue is settled.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MULLIGAN IS KEY ADDITION TO PALOS VERDES' LINEUP  </P> <P> The new player who will probably help the Palos Verdes High girls' basketball  team the most this season is Kristen Mulligan. She transferred from Rancho  Santa Margarita after a sophomore season in which she averaged 23 points a  game, was named Olympic League most valuable player and was a first-team  All-CIF selection.  </P> <P> Mulligan, a point guard, will fill the scoring role vacated by Lisa Humphreys,  who graduated.  </P> <P> The Sea Kings have another set of twin towers this season in Monique Morehouse,  a 6-foot-3 junior, and transfer Jeffra Gausepohl. Two seasons ago, it was the  6-5 Burge twins -- Heather and Heidi -- who gave Coach Wendell Yoshida a unique  inside combination.  </P> <P> Gausepohl, a 6-5 junior who moved from Kennett Square, Pa., a small town 20  miles outside of Philadelphia, was an all-district performer last season and  will give the Sea Kings added scoring (14.5 points) and rebounding (10  rebounds).  </P> <P> Mimi McKinney, a 5-9 freshman, is the type of player coaches wish they had time  to develop. Fortunately, Yoshida does have time to work with McKinney, who was  a member of a second-place Amateur Athletic Union 13-and-under team and was  named an All-American.  </P> <P> McKinney moved into the Palos Verdes district from San Pedro, where she would  have still been in the junior high system because of the three-year high school  system in San Pedro.  </P> <P> Yoshida got a strong, experienced inside player when Nicole Dietel, a 6-1  senior, transferred from Westminster High, where she had played on the varsity  team for three seasons.  </P></p>

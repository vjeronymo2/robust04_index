			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chong Chong-uk, senior secretary for Foreign </F> and National Security Affairs of the Presidential Secretariat,  by unidentified presidential office reporters at Chongwadae on  16 February]    [Text] [Reporter] What is the content and scope of the  facilities to which North Korea has decided to accept  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection?    [Chong Chong-uk] Apart from the five facilities,  including the eight megawatt-class atomic reactor; critical  reactor [imgyero]; semi-critical reactor [chunimgyero]; the  plant producing nuclear fuel rods; and the storehouse for  nuclear fuel rods that have received regular [chonggi]  inspection; and two other facilities, including the five  megawatt atomic reactor and the radio-chemistry laboratory,  which have aroused doubts concerning it being a nuclear  reprocessing facility by Western countries, are to be inspected.  In particular, an agreement for supplementing inspection of  each facility will be concluded for the two facilities that did  not receive regular inspection.    [Reporter] How do you assess the North's acceptance of the  nuclear inspection?    [Chong] It is fortunate that North Korea made such a  decision. If an agreement for inspection had not been reached,  North Korea's nuclear issue would have been handed over to the  UN Security Council. Also, regardless of our side's position to  continue dialogue, the situation would have moved toward  sanctions against North Korea. It is fortunate that the  possibility of handing over North Korea's nuclear issue to the  UN Security Council has been eliminated. However, this does not  mean that nuclear transparency will be guaranteed through the  upcoming inspection.    [Reporter] What are the remaining problems?    [Chong] Working-level contacts for the exchange of  special envoys will take place with the inspection team's visit  to the North. Through the inspections, the continuity of  safeguards that the facilities had not been transformed for  military use should be proven and working-level contacts should  successfully develop so meaningful dialogue can be exchanged.  After that, the rest of the problems, including the guarantee  of transparency of undeclared facilities, will be discussed at  the third round of the U.S.-North Korea talks.    [Reporter] Do you think the acceptance of inspection  constitutes a great sea change in North Korea's external policy?    [Chong] I think it is neither a great sea change nor a  minor change. There are still many problems and obstacles that  we have to overcome. Nevertheless, I think a meaningful  breakthrough has been made for the resolution of the nuclear  issue. We have avoided the stage of sanctions and the special  envoy exchange between South and North Korea is now possible.  The scope of dialogue is wide open.    [Reporter] What do you think North Korea has gained by  accepting inspection?    [Chong] It has avoided being referred to the UN Security  Council. I think the policy was adjusted on the occasion of Kim  Chong-il's birthday. (On this point, other Chongwadae  authorities feel it is because North Korea could not explain to  its people that international sanctions were imposed on Kim  Il-song, the hero of the chuche idea, of which North Korea was  most afraid).    [Reporter] What will happen to the Team Spirit exercise?    [Chong] The question of its suspension will be decided in  connection with the IAEA nuclear inspection and the discussion  between South and North Korea regarding the exchange of special  envoys. The timing of the announcement could be somehow  different.    [Reporter] What is the president's opinion?    [Chong] The talks between the IAEA and North Korea began  at 6 pm in Vienna on 15 February. More than one round of talks  were held. The president received continuous reports in the  evening and early morning. The president has thoroughly and  concretely taken care of the nuclear issue.    [Reporter] Did Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's activities  during his U.S. visit help the resolution of the issue?    [Chong] It was very timely. Judging that the rumor of  the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula was agitating  North Korea, the president had the foreign minister visit the  United States on 9 February, earlier than the 13 February  original schedule. Minister Han's persuasion of U.S.  journalists and coordination of positions with high-ranking  policymakers was very helpful.    [Reporter] Kim Il-song reportedly proposed a meeting with  President Clinton through Reverend Billy Graham, who recently  visited the North.    [Chong] We are well aware of the contents through close  consultation with the United States. The reports are not  exactly true. I cannot reveal further.    [Reporter] What do you think of the visit to North Korea by  Representative Ronald Dellums, chairman of the U.S. House Armed  Services Committee?    [Chong] He received the invitation from North Korea last  year. He may convey a verbal message from President Clinton, but  there will be no personal letter as far as I know. He is not a  government official so he will not negotiate, but will convey  the existing U.S. position.    [Reporter] Were there any signs that North Korea would  accept nuclear inspections?    [Chong] The remarks by a spokesman of North Korean  Foreign Ministry last week said the nuclear issue would be  resolved through dialogue. From that point we could interpret  that the previous stance on inspections would be changed. In  addition, there had been indirect communication between the  United States and North Korea, and the IAEA and North Korea,  although I cannot give further details.</p>

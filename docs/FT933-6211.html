			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Dramatic happenings in court - Radio A REFRESHING line was taken in Radio 4's Monday play, The Chicago Conspiracy Trial. It was a dramatised version, by Peter Goodchild, of the transcripts of a real trial - a notably colourful trial, too, with noisy disputes between both sides' lawyers, witnesses and the public. Directed by the BBC's Martin Jenkins and John Theocharis and produced jointly by the BBC, Los Angeles Theatre Works and WFMT of Chicago, it was very exciting. In 1968, the Democrats held their Convention in Chicago; the Peace Lobby was active, and there were protests about Vietnam war. They led inevitably to riots, and eight selected defendants were tried before Judge Hoffman and a jury of eight women (two black) and two men - who were kept sequestered for six months. The charges seem trivial today, matters like crossing state-lines and unauthorised sleeping in public places. Defendant Bobby Seal, leader of the Black Panthers, had to be bound and gagged to keep him quiet, though this made his supporters less quiet than ever. Interruptions ranged from the serious to the trivial - an attempt was made to disqualify the judge (the one individual to retain his dignity throughout) and to give his Seale a birthday cake. The participants' names are mostly forgotten today, apart from the poet Allan Ginsberg, and the able American players are unfamiliar to us. The production was genuinely memorable. Wednesday's The World Tonight on Radio 4 contained an alarming report of sexual harassment in the police. A 19-year old WPC said her bottom was forcibly date-stamped as an initiation ceremony; a sergeant driving her home behaved disgustingly in the car; when she complained, she was invited to resign. The London Police Federation was alleged to refuse funds to women for legal advice for an industrial tribunal, but not to men; and the production of evidence was obstructed. The Federation's general secretary admitted that the police could behave like anyone else (and indeed male apprentices in industry can have similar experiences); but he denied the matter of funds. Hertfordshire's Chief Constable reckoned education would clear up such problems, and had written to every individual in his force to point out that their behaviour must be as firmly controlled as the general public's. A distressing report, all the same. Radio 3 last night gave A Sorceress of Her Time compiled by Michael Bakewell from Alma Mahler's letters and diaries. She has become a kind of heroine on the basis of her liaisons. Almost engaged to Klimt, she married Mahler instead, although he was 'a rickety, degenerate Jew' and 20 years older than she. No case of compulsive love, though; they had three daughters, but she was soon close to pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch. Mahler died in 1911, then she was famously courted by Kokoschka, but she set her sights on architect Walter Gropius and married him. They had a son but were soon divorced - leaving her free to marry the writer Franz Werfel in 1929. Her affaire with a priest naturally came to nothing. Manon, her youngest daughter by Mahler, died in 1935, and Alban Berg dedicated his violin concerto to her memory. Alma was a firm pro-Nazi who thought Hitler a 'genuine idealist', but she had had two Jewish husbands, so they fled to New York in 1940. There Werefel died, but Alma lived to be 86, devoted in her way to Mahler's memory. She at least must have felt that she had lived a distinguished life. I heard some of the young people's stories on Radio 5; this week, Is Anybody There? a serial by Eric Pringle. Little Christine (Moir Leslie), lives with her father in an old house, where his dead mother once lived. In the attic, Christine hears the voice of an unseen little girl. Instead of being scared, she plays verbal games with her. Later, from the attic window she sees a strange family in the garden, but does not ask who they are. It all ends happily.</p>

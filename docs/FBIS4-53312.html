			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Wednesday [18 May] Japan will maintain its easier  credit policy to bolster the weak economy, brushing aside any  possible policy changes in response to overnight U.S. rate hikes.    "Monetary policy must reflect that nation's economic  conditions," Fujii told reporters and noted he had heard the  U.S. rate hikes were "part of measures to prevent inflation."    Citing Japan's yet-weak economy, Fujii said that he  "believes  the Bank of Japan will continue spreading (the effects) of low  interest rates."    The central bank has been guiding the key overnight call  rate  over past weeks to record lows through ample funding operations.    The U.S. Federal Reserve board raised the official discount  rate and its target federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage points  Tuesday.    The Fed in a statement said the hikes were "designed to  maintain favorable trends in inflation and thereby sustain the  economic expansion."    Regarding currency rates, Fujii declined to comment on  exchange levels, saying he is "quietly watching."    The dollar remained lower despite the U.S. rate hike, with  Tokyo dealers saying that the move was already factored in by  the market.    Speculation surfaced last week in exchange markets that the  leading industrialized nations have made a secret accord to  cooperate on credit policy in line with market interventions to  boost the dollar.    Germany's Bundesbank cut the key rate last week with other  European central banks following suit, and the Bank of Japan  continued sending short-term market rates lower. As expected,  the U.S. Fed raised the key rate.    Higher U.S. rates and lower rates in other countries help  the  dollar rise.</p>

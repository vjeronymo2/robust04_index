			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Exchange group faces difficulty THE contraction in the London insurance market could pose particular problems for Market Building, the consortium of 24 insurance companies which has spearheaded the development of an insurance exchange for companies, the London Underwriting Centre. Market Building (MBL) has a 25-year lease on custom-built premises at 3 Minster Court in the City, which it is hoping to sub-let to several dozen London market companies. The project, conceived in the booming market of the late 1980s, has been dogged with difficulty. A fire in August 1991 devastated the building's interior forcing an expensive refit and an 18-month delay in its opening. The collapse of the property market has led many prospective tenants to rethink their original commitments, while others have withdrawn from the market or folded. As a result, when the LUC opens in October, Mr David Trace, MBL company secretary, expects the building to be only 70 per cent let, with consortium members themselves occupying about half the space. Before the fire, the LUC had let 94 per cent of the building's 300,000 sq ft of available space. So far MBL has been unable to persuade the Institute of London Underwriters, which provides an exchange and back-up facilities for just under 100 marine and aviation companies, to move from its premises on Leadenhall Street to Minster Court. Worse still, LUC is now in direct competition with Lloyd's, which over the past few months has begun to invite companies to share its headquarters with the underwriting syndicates which already transact business there. Five companies - Anglo American, AIG, QBE, Liberty Mutual and National Reliance - are already operating there. Up to 30 other companies have shown interest. In 1992 MBL reduced its rental charges twice in a move to retain interest from sub-tenants. It will now cost tenants Pounds 40 per sq ft (including service charges), a cut of about a third from the original asking price. That is still higher than market rents of Pounds 22 per square foot available for office space within a stone's throw of the Lloyd's market.</p>

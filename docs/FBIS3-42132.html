			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 [date as received] (KCNA) --  The United States and the South Korean authorities are  reportedly having consultations to hasten the projected  deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea.    It is an unpardonable grave military challenge of keying up  the tensions on the Korean peninsula to scheme to introduce  Patriot missiles in South Korea at a time when DPRK-U.S.  contacts have taken place and the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks  are expected for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula.    The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean  puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is  to "counter the threat of missile attack from North Korea." But  this is no more than a plea to justify their dangerous  introduction of lethal weapons.    The real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot  missiles into South Korea under the pretext of "threat of  missile attack" is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks  for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for "nuclear  inspection" on the DPRK through pressure and threat.    If the United States and its followers think they can subdue  the DPRK with pressure and threat, it is a big mistake. That  method may lead the situation to a hopeless phase, far from  resolving the problem.</p>

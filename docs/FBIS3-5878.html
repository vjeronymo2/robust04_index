Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki told  a  news conference that the two firms involved, Nippon Idou Tsushin  Corp. (IDO) and Motorola Inc., are putting the final touches to  their deal.    "It's possible a formal agreement will be reached today," he  said.    The administration of President Bill Clinton has threatened  to impose trade sanctions against Japan if Tokyo does not open  its market to U.S. companies.    Kanzaki said it would not take long for the Japanese and  U.S.  governments to strike a deal to end their dispute over cellular  phones if the private companies reached agreement.    In the dispute, Washington complains Japan has not abided by  a 1989 agreement in which it promised to provide "comparable"  market access to its cellular phone market.    Motorola insists it should be given more cellular phone  relay  stations and channels in Japan.</p>

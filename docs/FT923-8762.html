			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: An Irish month in the country BRIAN FRIEL adapted Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons for the stage in 1987, and now turns his hand to the master's five-act classic. Although written in 1850, 10 years before Chekhov was born, A Month in the Country is, in essence, a Chekhovian drama, and its merits were not fully recognised until Stanislasky's production in 1909. Friel's starting point was a literal translation especially commissioned from Christopher Heaney, and he has remained broadly faithful to the original, retaining its Russian setting and leisurely pace but rendering the text in Irish idiom and adding a few jokes. The theatre-going world divides into those who thrive on five-act Chekhovian 'comedies', and those who do not. I admit to being among the latter. I had hoped that Brian Friel might take a brisk approach to Turgenev. Instead, he displays the reverence of the true devotee, giving us too much Turgenev and not enough Friel. The problem is the central drama of Natalya's infatuation with her young son's tutor, the penniless student, Aleksey. In her confusion at this sudden strong emotion, she alienates her long-standing admirer Rakitin, precipitates her ward, Vera, into a loveless marriage, and very nearly loses the devotion of her mild, ineffectual husband. Friel has chosen to take Natalya very seriously indeed, while heightening the comedy of the other three couples' courtships. The result is a play that works brilliantly around the edges. But it lacks the ironic approach to the rather ridiculous Natalya which would make the central predicament sympathetic to the modern mind. It must be said that, in spite of the rather grey set, the cast works so hard that a long evening's theatre holds hardly a dull moment. Catherine Byrne does her best to make the infuriating Natalya convincing, and Lorcan Cranitch plays her admirer Rakitin with suitable dignity. But it is the rest of the characters that supply the laughs or engage the emotions: Karen Ardiss's Vera, forced to grow up overnight and accept the proposal of the buffoon-like neighbour, Bolshintsov; J D Kellerher's energetic and boyish Aleksey; the engaging young Anoine Byrne as the servant Katya; and John Kavanagh as the lecherous German tutor whose every utterance is a malapropism. But the great hit of the evening was Donal McCann's doctor - one minute, as he says himself, 'the laughing, fawning, ingratiating Shpigelsky', the next 'the bitter, angry, cunning peasant'. Not only does he have all the best lines, he delivers them with exactly the right amount of brio. It did not seem strange that the Russian cast were speaking with Irish accents, and using Irish idioms, but a perhaps unintended side effect was to highlight the similarities between the Russian and Irish peasantry. The result was that the audience immediately felt at home with the lower orders, making the play's minor characters more successful than its more serious central ones.</p>

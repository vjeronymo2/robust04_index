			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Life of Great Happiness Upholding the </F> Great Leader [widaehan yongdoja] at the Head of the Party"]    [Text] Our party members and working people are  vigorously accelerating the revolution and construction,  upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the father of  the people [inminui oboi] and helping and encouraging each  other, like real brothers and sisters. It is the foremost glory  and pride for our people to fully enjoy the happiness in which  they find nothing to envy in the world while upholding the great  father as one large family.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: I am very  glad that Comrade Kim Chong-il commands people's respect, love,  and admiration as a leader who inherits the cause of the  revolution.    There is no happiness for the people greater than living and  carrying out the revolution upholding the great leader [widaehan  yongdoja] as their father. Our people boundlessly trust and  follow the dear comrade leader as father now. Here lies our  people's noble feeling of ideological resolve to  enthusiastically adore and follow to the end of the world the  great leader who takes total responsibility for all their  destiny and future and tenderly cares for and leads them.    Traversing the long and glorious road of the revolution  under  the leadership of the dear comrade leader, our people have  learned deep in their hearts the leader's greatness, his love  for the people, and his noble communist virtue. For our people,  the dear comrade leader is a great teacher and benevolent father  who takes total responsibility for their destiny and blooms it.    The dear comrade leader not only commended our people as  masters of the revolution and good teachers [as heard], but  granted them the noblest political life and continuously gives  them familial love to be acclaimed generation after generation.  It is the firm conviction of the dear comrade leader that  without the people, the leader, the revolution, the party, and  sovereignty would lose the significance of their existence.    Thanks to the fatherly love of the dear comrade leader, all  the working people in our country not only participate in  political life freely today but carry out their duty for society  and group honorably. In the loving bosom of the dear comrade  leader, mistreated workers, peasants, and intellectuals and  their sons and daughters have been brought up today to be cadres  of the party and the state, guiding functionaries of plants and  enterprises, deputies of power organs of various levels who  discuss the political affairs of the country, heroes,  professors, and doctors, thereby making their creative wisdom  and talents flourish.    There have been a number of proud statesmen and great men  who  made a name for themselves, but we do not know of any great  statesman and people's benevolent father like the dear comrade  leader who embraces all the people of the country in his bosom  and brings them up to be true revolutionaries. The song "There  is no fatherland without you" sung by all the people of the  country from the bottom of their hearts reveals the infinite  gratitude and boundless extolment to the people's benevolent  father [inminui chaaeroun oboi] who takes total responsibility  for and blooms their destiny and future.    Our people's great pride in upholding the great father  consists in all the people fully enjoying infinitely rewarding,  happy lives. The dear comrade leader whose natural disposition  consists of love for and trust in the people, worked out and put  forth the lines and policies for the people so that all the  activities of the party and the state may consistently serve the  people.    Today, all policies and considerations for people worked  out and taken in our country and the deep concern and scrupulous  care extended evenly to each individual household and each  individual person by our party and state are precious fruits  brought about by the great father's noble politics of  benevolence. The dear comrade leader has designated the  promotion of people's welfare the supreme principle in our  party's activities, and with the improvement in people's lives,  has given all kinds of consideration to provide them with  greater joy and happiness.    The dear comrade leader's firm position is that there can  never be satisfaction in the struggle to improve people's  livelihood and that greater happiness for the people should be  achieved by all means by even seeing to it that mountains are  leveled off or oceans reclaimed.    Through modern streets and numerous monumental  structures--the Kwangbok Street, the Chongchun Street, the  Tongil Street, the West Sea Floodgate, and the 1 May  Stadium--which have been built in recent years, our people are  warmly cherishing the dear comrade leader's fatherly love for  the people and his energetic leadership.    Today, our people firmly believe that tomorrow will be  better  than today with our party's revolutionary economic strategies  implemented by the great leader [yondoja]. The noble intention  of the dear comrade leader--who is solving the question of  improving people's livelihood while regarding it not as a simple  economic task, but as both a strategic question for socialist  construction and as an important matter linked with the future  of the fatherland and people--is reflected in our party's  revolutionary economic strategies for thoroughly implementing  the agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy,  and the trade-first policy.    Under today's difficult circumstances in which we need to  achieve socialist construction in the midst of acute  confrontation with the imperialists, formulation and  implementation of grand economic strategies aimed at providing  our people with a more affluent and happier life is by no means  a simple question. This is a great idea and great project which  can be worked out and implemented only by the dear comrade  leader who is endlessly sparing no pains for the people.    The boundless happiness of our people holding the great  father in esteem also lies in everyone helping and guiding one  another, and living harmoniously in one large revolutionary  household.    Today, our country has become one large revolutionary  household thanks entirely to the brilliant embodiment of the  dear comrade leader's noble politics of benevolence. Regarding  the idea of valuing the people as heaven as his personal motto,  the dear comrade leader spares nothing for the people's  happiness and future. Our society is literally becoming one  large revolutionary household because the dear comrade leader's  politics of benevolence is brilliantly being embodied and  because the revolutionary sense of obligation and camaraderie  are coming into bloom throughout the country.    Though they have been born in different places, have  different revolutionary duties, and have different personalities  and tastes, our party members and workers are living today while  holding each other dear in a genuine relationship of comradeship.    There is no country anywhere in the world as our country, a  society in which all people throughout the country share life  and death by helping and guiding each other, vigorously march  forward by upholding the leader's [yongdojaui] intentions and  ideas with singlehearted loyalty, can see his own hope and  talent realized and brought into full bloom without worrying  whatsoever about daily life, and are most thoroughly guaranteed  of their dignity and rights, because they are holding the great  leader [yongdoja] in esteem as the father.    Our people's firm belief and will are to show complete  loyalty and filial piety, upholding the dear comrade leader who  is taking full responsibility for their fate and future and  bringing them into blossom. There are no people in the world  like our dignified and happy people who are living in the most  glorious era and carrying out the revolution, while holding the  dear comrade leader in esteem as the father.</p>

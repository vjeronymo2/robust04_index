			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Observer: Tunnel vision Why on earth wasn't London's Aldwych tube station closed before now if only 450 people a day were using it? London Underground says it cost more than Pounds 200,000 a year to operate the station and the spur line from Holborn, and yet the station only took Pounds 53,000 a year in ticket sales. Leaving aside the fact that most tickets would have been sold whether or not this particular station was open, it seems that London Underground was happy to bear the losses. A fleet of taxis could have conveyed the regulars the few hundred metres down Kingsway more cheaply and probably more quickly, too. If London Underground knew that these were the costs, why did they wait until the present funding crisis to end this ludicrous subsidy to a few office workers in the Temple and Covent Garden? Sir Wilfrid Newton, the Underground's newly knighted chairman, has some explaining to do.</p>

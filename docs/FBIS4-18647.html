			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Antonio Martino, Forza Italia economic </F> expert, by Dino Vaiano; place and date not given: "Martino:  Italy Divided in Counties"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Antonio Martino, Forza Italia's  economic expert, continues working on the government program  despite [League Secretary] Bossi's broadsides. Moreover, he is  holding a trump card to make the duelists agree. A sort of  compromise between federalism and decentralization, i.e., to  divide Italy in 25 or 50 counties to which the exclusive right  to levy taxes is granted. In addition, he wants to put a  ceiling to revenue tax pressure, a superministry of economy, and  a reform of IRPEF [personal income tax].    And what if the pole for freedom wrecks? Would Ciampi remain  prime minister? The professor has no doubts. "I believe that  these elections have a clear political significance. The fact  of Ciampi remaining in his seat would become a problem only if a  majority cannot be established. However, this would be bad  luck, not for Ciampi, who is a trustworthy person and who has  been working well as governor of the Bank of Italy, but because  the new parliament is unable to guarantee a government majority."    [Vaiano] How can a joint program be worked out between both  duelists?    [Martino] The element which can bring them together is the  willingness to hold the flood of taxes in check. If we hold on  to the present rate, in the year 2000 we will have an average  taxation level of 60 percent, with public expenditure nearing 75  percent of national income. We want -- and I do not know  whether we will introduce it at once or in two phases -- a sole  33-percent personal income tax rate and a significant increase  in personal tax allowances, in order to exonerate the have-nots  and protect the big families.    [Vaiano] The big obstacle seems federalism, however...    [Martino] If I interpret the issue correctly, the majority  of  League voters considers federalism a restraint to the unbridled  expansion of a wasting and corrupt state.    [Vaiano] And what will Forza Italia propose?    [Martino] The local government levels are too numerous.  There are about 350,000 city councillors; this is a real army  of employees. It should be possible to create one local body  covering a sufficiently large territory to allow the financing  of its own governing level, but which would also be small enough  to maintain the population's control over the functioning of the  local government. It would be a kind of county.    [Vaiano] How many could there be?    [Martino] Between 25 and 50. Their dimension should be  somewhat smaller than a region and larger than a present  province.    [Vaiano] Will taxes be paid at the central level or the  county level?    [Martino] The authority to impose taxes could be taken away  from the central government and transferred to the local level.  On two conditions, however: There should be a balance and a  certain percentage of the yields should be transferred to the  central government.    [Vaiano] Will the new government proceed to antideficit  measures soon?    [Martino] I am against mending measures like the ones we  have  seen over the last few years. The system needs to be changed,  and expenses should be cut. We will not use tax squeezing  methods. Privatizations can be carried through gradually. And  we will stay alert not to incite inflationist flares.    [Vaiano] Are you thinking of setting up a superministry of  economy?    [Martino] Yes, although there is also another hypothesis:  the merger of the Finance and Budget Ministries, which would be  the easiest solution.    [Vaiano] What will happen to taxing treasury bills and stock  exchange transactions?    [Martino] Government stock cannot be affected at all: for  moral reasons, because the state has made a contract with the  saver, and for economic reasons, because panic would emerge  among savers. Also in the field of capital gain I do not see any  new taxes.    [Vaiano] Will there be a major purge at the top of the state  and government bodies?    [Martino] We will follow a third path, between the model of  an immovable bureaucracy, which gradually becomes too powerful,  and the American model, which replaces 2,000 civil servants  following a change in the administration.    [Vaiano] However, there are many headhunters, especially for  RAI [state broadcasting company].    [Martino] The statements about RAI can easily be explained  by  the -- justified -- resentment about the way in which some  election programs were conducted.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Leading Article: China's next revolution There can be no turning back. After a 15-year roller-coaster of market-led economic growth, China is set on a path which will change it from a largely agrarian society to an urban one. The report prepared for the government by the National Academy of Social Sciences makes that aspect of China's future clear enough. What the country's rulers appear to see less clearly is that they must change with it. Many of the changes in China which the Academy expects to occur over the next few decades are already well under way. By 2010, the study predicts that half the population will live in towns, compared to 28 per cent today. Twelve years ago, the proportion was barely 10 per cent. It was the poverty afflicting the remainder, in the countryside, which drove the government's first moves towards liberalisation in 1979, when it freed most of the rural goods markets. Yet the steady marketisation of the rest of the economy in the years which followed is still causing mass migration which the country's rulers struggle vainly to control. With urban incomes some two and a half times rural ones in 1992, it is not hard to see why. The mushrooming of the towns and cities has made the cracks in China's new economic structure worryingly apparent. The current distribution network ill serves the cities' growing demand for basic staples. A large part of the 22.7 per cent increase in urban consumer prices in the year to July was due to rising food prices. These, in turn, were the natural consequence of the government's erratic attempts to lift its last remaining price controls on essential foodstuffs. Rapid urbanisation Conclusively lifting the restrictions on food prices is a necessary, but by no means sufficient, element of any attempt to manage China's rapid urbanisation. Artificially low food prices can only fuel faster migration, thus adding to the strains on the system. Agricultural prices fell by more than a third relative to industrial ones over the period 1988-93; the recent rise is a necessary correction. Unfortunately for the government, it is not a popular one: rising food prices and shortages threaten to cause considerable urban unrest, not least because traders, both wholesalers and retailers, exploit the situation with capitalist ingenuity. The problem is symptomatic of China's structural growing pains as it continues a second decade of double-digit economic growth. So, too, is the government's reaction. At the root of the disquiet in the cities is the fact that the distribution system which takes food to the cities is grossly under-developed, while the zeal for profit at different stages of the chain is rather more mature. Reference prices In addition to sporadic injections of extra food supplies, the government has tried to address the issue by re-introducing 'reference prices' for staple food items, with penalties for those who charge more. An official statement this week promised to monitor retailers even more vigorously. At the same time, officials have declared that the government will henceforth take a stronger role in distributing food from country to town, in order to improve supplies and stabilise prices. Both policies are misguided. The government cannot prevent traders from taking advantage of goods shortages in the cities. Nor can it hope to mimic the market efficiently if it takes a more active role in the wholesale sector. A deeper, more competitive market in the distribution of food and other goods is less, not more, likely to develop while government intervention is so unpredictably heavy-handed. Such a command and control manner of regulating economic problems is ill-suited to China today. The government's role in the market economy which China is rapidly becoming may have to be more laisser faire, but this does not leave it nothing to do. Markets must operate, not according to 'reference prices', but a framework of legal rules. Ultimately, it is the lack of such a framework which fuels the micro-economic resentment of profiteering and the macroeconomic instability which trouble China today. This is the challenge of the future which China's government must face: using yesterday's methods to tackle the symptoms is no solution.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Accountancy Column: Where charity does not begin or end at home - The growing links between the accountancy world and voluntary organisations THE ARCHAIC practices of the livery companies of the City of London may seem far removed from the deprivation of the boroughs just a little further east, but a new scheme has been forging some powerful links between these two worlds. Chartered Accountants in the Community, launched by the Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales at the start of the year, has placed senior accountants onto the management committees of charities around the country, including a number in London. As thoughts turn to charity at Christmas, other accountancy firms, organisations and individual professionals might do well to copy its lead in providing constructive help to organisations beyond their own workplace or normal client base. Bringing together accountants with local charities has not been entirely straightforward. Mr Alma Munson, chief accountant for the life division of Guardian Royal Exchange, was not quite sure what to expect earlier this year when he joined the board of Hackney Youth Workforce, which provides training and work experience for unemployed people with special needs. 'It's no good standing on your high horse,' he says. 'Some people might think it's all rather left-wing, having to call the chairman 'chair'. The people are not financially oriented, and don't see it as a business. It's another part of the world.' Mr Graham Finegold, manager of the organisation, also had his doubts. 'I was very worried how the staff would react when this City gent walked through the door in his three-piece suit,' he said. But Munson showed tact and a willingness to learn about the organisation which has gradually earned him respect. He has helped provide financial advice, including co-ordinating the introduction of a computerised accounting system, and in persuading the charity to transfer money from a current account to one paying interest. He has also advised on changing the management structure, by reducing the length of the one unwieldy monthly committee meeting which lasted from 6-11pm, and creating instead a series of specialist sub-committees to help spread the work. 'Alma had very real, identifiable skills at a time when we needed them,' says Finegold. 'We are trying to buy a property and need to raise Pounds 500,000. It is useful to be able to talk to someone who is dealing with that kind of money every day.' The same pattern emerged when Mr Bill Packer, retired national tax director with Touche Ross, linked up with Tower Hamlets Co-operative Development Agency, which provides advice and support to business start-ups. 'I went in with a little apprehension, not quite knowing what I was going to meet,' he says. 'But they made me welcome. I feel I've been able to make a contribution to this community.' He helped introduce a regular staff appraisal system, and says he has 'brought them to address financial problems rather earlier than they might have done before - when the crisis hit'. Mr Gregory Cohn, co-ordinator of the agency, says: 'None of the three professional staff has much financial experience, so it was useful to have someone on the management committee who can discuss finance and act as a support mechanism. Just having someone from outside is constructive.' The original idea for the chartered accountants in the community scheme came from the Action Resource Centre, based in London, which helped launch a similar programme called lawyers in the community about two years ago. ARC matches a large number of potential volunteers each year with charities in need of secondees or other assistance. Mr Richard Wilkes, immediate past master of the worshipful company, concedes that the idea of the livery body may seem arcane. But he places importance on its role as an organisation with charitable objectives. It was only founded in 1976, and now numbers 100 members, including Sir Brian Jenkins, last year's Lord Mayor of London. 'We do not have a large endowment,' says Wilkes. 'Instead of money, we've got talent.' Previously it had donated money to help support training overseas and reward achievement in student examinations in England and Wales. Wilkes says the chartered accountants in the community scheme seemed an ideal way to apply the company's members' own skills more directly. While the lawyers in the community placements tend to be focused in London and use younger staff from law firms, the accountants scheme is designed to cover England and Wales, and uses what Wilkes calls 'the mature chaps' from the livery. About 12 have so far been linked with charities and a number are waiting to be found suitable placements. Mr David Shaw, almoner or the livery officer responsible for charitable giving, stresses that the scheme is also focused around offering professional, advisory skills, not providing time-consuming day-to-day activities such as doing the bookkeeping. Some initial delays came less in finding volunteers than identifying suitable placements for them. Now the plan is to expand the scheme until it offers 20 to 30 attachments a year. It will also then be widened beyond the livery company to include other chartered accountants, through the firms and the district societies. Mr David Hemsworth of the Action Resource Centre stresses a number of ground rules for successful placements. He emphasises that the benefits are two-way, with the charity gaining expert assistance, and the accountant learning about voluntary organisations and giving something back to the community. 'Accountants should not go in with pre-conceived ideas thinking it is just about parachuting people in with a bag of solutions,' he says. 'There is learning to be done. Most voluntary organisations are well run but have a rather different ethos.' On the other hand, charities need to take time on the induction of new committee members. They should not simply use them to provide narrow technical skills, but rather think of the process as a transfer of expertise so the contribution lasts after any individual's commitment. Graham Finegold adds that charities should be honest about the commitment expected from a committee member and be flexible to accommodate their availability. The idea of charitable work by accountants is not a monopoly held by the livery company, of course. The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants offers a charity helpline (071-917-9204) to link up local charities with willing, trained volunteers. Many business and firms are beginning to offer their staff on secondments, as well as offering resources or donating money directly. Few of the accountancy firms are so eager to offer on-going professional advice free to charities, which are increasingly offer substantial prospects for paid work. Mr George Westropp of Touche Ross says that pro bono work tends not to attract the best staff: 'If you want something to be badly done, you do it for free.' Nevertheless, Mr Pesh Framjee, head of the charity unit at BDO Binder Hamlyn, says that he actively encourages his staff to serve on management committees in their spare time. That helps them learn about voluntary organisations from the inside, and gives them skills which can be applied to other clients of the firm. Volunteerism can clearly make sound economic sense.</p>

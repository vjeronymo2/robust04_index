			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Reloj Newscast"] </F>   [Excerpt] The CPT [Permanent Workers' Council] presented  six points to President-elect Jose Figueres and Labor  Minister-designate Farid Ayales. The national union leadership  met with them for the first time in (Sitrosimec).    In an atmosphere of cordiality, open-mindedness, and defined  visions looking at national interest issues, the CPT presented  to President-elect Figueres six points that are very important  to Costa Rican workers.    CPT Coordinator Gerardo Chavez said that among the key  points  the labor movement presented to Figueres are: a salary policy  for the next four years, respect for the right to strike,  approval of the unemployment [cesantia] law, and granting of  labor rights to private sector workers. Chavez also urged them  to honor the country's commitments with other governments.    The workers requested the establishment of specific  guidelines on the free trade treaty [not further specified],  state modernization, and how the social and economic life of  Costa Ricans will change in the next four years.    President-elect Figueres said that the views of the labor  sector will be taken into account. He added, however, that no  decision will be made for the time being, because the new  government will not be in office until 8 May.    Meanwhile, Labor Minister-designate Ayales said that these  points deal with issues that are of interest to all Costa Ricans  and added that they are willing to hold talks to settle specific  problems that might come up in the future.

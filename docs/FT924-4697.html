			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Asprey rises to Pounds 11.2m on lower margins ASPREY, the USM-quoted jewellery group which has expanded rapidly through acquisition in the last couple of years, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 11.2m in the six months to September 30, writes Peter Pearse. Mr Naim Attallah, previously joint managing director and chief executive since the beginning of September when the group reorganised its management structure, said he had no intention of going down the Ratners route. He said the group's accounting was 'very conservative', explaining that with acquisitions - the most recent of which was Watches of Switzerland for Pounds 23.2m in June - the group assessed stocks 'for the worst possible circumstances'. He had expected WoS to be a drain on Asprey's resources, but it was servicing the loan taken out for the acquisition, and making a profit. Group turnover rose to Pounds 60.2m (Pounds 49.2m), with a contribution of about Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m from WoS. Although margins had slipped, Mr Attallah said the rise in sales was important to absorb the increased overhead. Earnings rose by 0.1p to 6.97p and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.1p.</p>

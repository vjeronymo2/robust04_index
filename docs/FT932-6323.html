			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Increased hopes of rate cuts boost bunds A MORE resilient D-Mark and increased hopes of interest rate cuts lay behind a strong advance in the German government bond market. Although recent Bundesbank signals had damped hopes of cuts in key rates at next Thursday's council meeting, reductions of up to  1/4 point in the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria were regarded as improving prospects of German cuts. Worries about the German economy pointed in the same direction. A leak of GDP figures, due to be released on the morning the Bundesbank council meets, showed a 1 per cent fall quarter on quarter and a 3 per cent slide year on year. The June futures contract rose to 94.47 from a 94.08 low. The Dutch rate cuts led to further widening of the 10-year yield spread below German bunds to 17 basis points. RAMPANT talk of interest rate cuts in Spain, which faces a general election on June 6, led to a rally in the government bond market. The peseta at one point fell through its central level in the ERM but managed some recovery to help stave off rumours that the currency might leave the ERM. The rally drove down the yield on 10-year stock to less than 11 per cent. THE UK government bond market largely shrugged off the replacement of Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor, although it did register small losses after a bright opening in the wake of Wednesday's successful gilt auction. While the pound was weakened by talk of a cut in interest rates by the incoming chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke, gilts ended little changed. Economists expressed scepticism about an imminent cut in rates, although some already had one pencilled in for later in the summer. US Treasuries eased slightly across the board as investors and dealers digested the big gains earned at the long end of the market. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 102- 17/32 , yielding 6.919 per cent. At the short end the two-year note was down  5/32 at 99- 25/32 , to yield 4.224 per cent. The day's only economic data, a flat weekly jobless claims report, had no effect on sentiment. Later in the day, shorter-dated securities lost a little more ground on reports that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee had voted unanimously at its meeting last week to shift the emphasis of monetary policy towards a tightening. THE yen's record high against the dollar gave the Japanese government bond market a flying start in Tokyo, which was later undone by profit-taking. This ended a sharp two-day rally which had reduced the yield on the cash benchmark No 145 due 2002 from 4.70 per cent to 4.52 per cent at one stage yesterday. The close in Tokyo was 4.575 per cent. In London trading, intervention by the Federal Reserve to support the dollar provided a setback for the JGB market, but it recovered later. The Liffe futures contract opened at 107.02 and closed 5 basis points higher after hitting a low of 106.78.</p>

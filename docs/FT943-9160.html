			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Gap recovery gains momentum Gap, the US casual wear retailer, yesterday continued the strong recovery it made in the first quarter by reporting a 55 per cent increase in net profits to Dollars 44.4m from Dollars 28.7m in the second quarter to July. The second-quarter earnings figure - a record for the company - came on a 12 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 773m from the comparable period's Dollars 693m. Earnings per share rose from 20 cents to 30 cents. The result more than outweighed Gap's profits fall in last year's second quarter. Then its results were hit by expansion costs, weak consumer demand and competition from other groups imitating Gap's basic clothing formula. Since then Gap has shifted its product mix away from simple unisex clothing, such as T-shirts and jeans, to more fashionable merchandise, particularly for women. Net income for the first half of 1994 rose by 54 per cent to Dollars 107.8m from Dollars 70.2m. Turnover rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 1.53bn from Dollars 1.34bn and earnings per share from 49 cents to 74 cents. Gap said store-for-store sales increased by 1 per cent in the second quarter. Better stock control had reduced the need for price cutting on surplus goods, and this, coupled with with an increased emphasis on fashion merchandise, led to higher margins in all divisions.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (15): Many bridges to be crossed - Multimedia / Multimedia has been the victim of its own promotion, but that's no reason to write it off entirely The cynical tags, 'vapourware' and 'real soon now' are commonly associated more with computing than telecommunications, but multimedia could change this. Vendors who traditionally shunned the hyping of products seem to have lost their inhibitions with multimedia, even though its most dynamic aspect appears to be the extravagance of the claims made. For many observers, despair and disinterest have replaced early enthusiasm, as the multimedia concept is successively redefined and relaunched. On the other hand, according to the 'real soon now' merchants, the promises and predictions for multimedia are, after an agonising wait, starting to turn into products. Indeed, multimedia communication is believed by industry pundits to be the growth market of the 1990s and is set to repeat for manufacturers the commercial bonanza of the fax revolution of the eighties. Multimedia is defined as the integration of a variety of audio-visual presentation methods into a single framework, using a personal computer as the 'platform' or basis. The technique is well established as a presentation medium and is now being advocated as the universal answer to business communications, as well. The problem is that multimedia may be adopted for the wrong reasons. 'The corporate world always has a tendency to grasp at the newest advance in technology as a panacea for all their problems,' comments Judy Roland, director of Mouse Power Presentations, a multimedia creative studio based in Box, Wiltshire. 'Like any other communications tool, multimedia is appropriate for achieving some business objectives - but not all,' she asserts. 'We have a major education problem, not to get management to accept multimedia - they do so, already - but to show them it's not always the most appropriate technique nor is it some miracle means where you just press a button and it revolutionises your work. 'Multimedia has a serious role to play - it's already used much more maturely in the US - but it shouldn't be chosen purely for faddish reasons.' Identifying the kind of productivity improvements that multimedia is expected to achieve is even harder, according to Jeff Goldberg, an analyst with technology research consultancy, Dataquest. 'The truth is that multimedia is a completely abused topic, one which has been described incorrectly by industry and misunderstood by users,' he explains. 'Multimedia is not a technique or goal in isolation but rather one single element of a much broader discipline. Anyone who promotes multimedia for its own sake is heading for trouble.' To date, he says, the most successful applications for multimedia have been in presentation and these have been adopted and accepted, not because they were touted as multimedia but rather because no-one even mentioned the 'M' word. Whereas the average business presentation a year ago used simple black and white transparencies and an overhead projector, today you see computer graphics in colour and motion on a video projector. This, he asserts, is an appropriate and practical application for multimedia, even if other people do not class it as such. According to Goldberg, multimedia's chief achievement - so far - is in its use as a 'fix' to correct the inadequacies of the basic PC computer. To fill in the gaps in the original PC specification, suppliers have come up with improved sound and vision capabilities, together with the ability to play CD-ROM disks, turning the humble PC into a powerful tool for training, video-conferencing, distance-learning and, inevitably, computer games. Nevertheless, he concedes that this early incarnation that we currently call multimedia is insignificant in terms of market share and cannot be said to fulfil the ambitious claims made for the concept. Other parties are pinning their faith in the home TV set as the agent of the multimedia revolution. This autumn, hundreds of homes in Cambridge will take part in interactive multimedia trials and will be offered personalised news services, video-on-demand, games, education and armchair shopping. Large companies are involved, including Cambridge Cable, News International, Anglia Television, Acorn Computers and Olivetti. To some observers, however, the trial sounds suspiciously like a repeat of BT's encounters of the expensive kind with Prestel, dial-up computer games and movies by cable a decade ago, which proved minimal user demand. Probably the most valuable information that the trial will generate is that the home TV is not the most appropriate platform for multimedia. So perhaps multimedia belongs in the office after all; certainly that's where the larger informatics companies see its future. Companies such as Alcatel, Philips, IBM and Olivetti, as well as telecoms players such as BT envisage multimedia as a unified total communication system: unlike the telephones, fax machines, computers and even videophones we have today, multimedia combines all these capabilities and more in one single desktop terminal. Now, they say, the common desktop computer has been transformed into something much more powerful, in fact a real tool for business. Soon we could be seeing the person we are phoning in a corner of our PC screen, with this image then replaced by sight of a document we are discussing jointly. Researchers could examine pictures in a photographic library at any time, without leaving their desk, then extract the images required and use them in a new presentation of their own. Significant problems remain before this can come to pass. Setting aside the lack of apparent user applications and easy-to-use connectivity, there are big bridges to cross in terms of workplace culture and user training. According to a senior executive of one of the companies just mentioned, multimedia offers the office automation industry a Iicence to print money - users are keen to adopt leading-edge technology and are probably prepared to pay for it - 'but,' he confesses in the same breath, 'the tragedy is that we'll probably blow the opportunity . . . simply because all this technology is too complicated to use. 'If people cannot even program their video recorders at home, how on earth will they relate to a Pentium PC, a CD-ROM player and two video cameras to drive?' His dilemma may be not be so imminent, though: according to Dataquest's Goldberg, the multimedia revolution can only take place with an adequate communications infrastructure and this has not been fully defined or developed yet. Existing technologies are too expensive and take-off will depend on further progress with data compression or the deployment of an affordable universal broadband network. Until then, it will remain an effective technique for specialist applications, but hardly the all-embracing cure-all portrayed up to now.</p>

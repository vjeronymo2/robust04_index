			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Smear Campaign Seeking </F> Insidious Purpose"]    [Text] Lately a new smear anticommunist campaign against  our Republic is being viciously carried out in South Korea and  Japan.    According to a report, the South Korean puppets, on the  premise that a missing military secret document might be handed  over to the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  [Chongnyon] through South Korean students studying in Japan,  launched an investigation.    Timed to coincide with this, the Japanese reactionaries  loudly talk about the export of a spectrum analyzer that can be  converted to military use, including upgrading the precision of  hitting targets and the possibility of using it in our missiles.  They also spread a rumor through the media that the Japanese  Police Department suspects that a Kanagawa Prefecture-based  trading company, specializing in deals between Tokyo and  Pyongyang, exported the spectrum analyzer.    This is another premeditated and intentional fabrication of  the South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries, who are  experts in smear campaigns and who say black is white and report  what is not existent as existent.    Claiming that a military secret document that was sent to a  national assemblyman of the United People's Party disappeared,  the puppets launched an investigation of relevant figures.  During a press interview, however, this assemblyman said that he  did not know that such a document was sent from the Ministry of  National Defense [MND] nor was he aware of a request to return  the document. He noted that when the Defense Security Command  requested his signature on the document of conclusion of  investigation, he refused to sign because there was no reason  for this. He added that the MND's hasty announcement of the  incident is suspicious.    Assuming that the lost document might be handed over to  Chongnyon, the puppets preposterously attempted to link this  with us. This fact alone shows how foolish and ugly this smear  campaign is.    That the Japanese reactionaries slandered us and Chongnyon  by  talking about the export of a spectrum analyzer and a  possibility of its use is indeed ridiculous.    The fact illustrates that the South Korean puppets and  Japanese reactionaries, just as they frantically ran amok with  anti-Republic commotions on the pretext of our fictitious  so-called nuclear problem, conspired the current smear campaign  in collusion.    Then, why did the South Korean puppets and Japanese  reactionaries spread a new rumor on suspicion, which can  convince no one, by slandering us and Chongnyonm who have  nothing to do with this?    As is known to all, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique and  Japanese reactionaries have persistently maneuvered to block the  progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks by spreading a rumor on  suspicion of our fictitious nuclear weapons development. On the  pretext of suspicion of our nuclear development, they also  pursue an aim to accelerate their own nuclear armament.    Our peaceful nuclear policy has been proven to be innocent  as  time passes, while the criminal nature of their anticommunist  smear campaign has been more clearly revealed. In particular,  in the DPRK-U.S. contact held in New York at the end of 1993,  the two sides agreed to hold the third round of talks and to  settle in a package [ilgwal tagyol] the issues for essential  solution of the nuclear issue. As a result, a breakthrough was  opened for progress in the talks that were deadlocked.    Embarrassed by this, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique and  Japanese reactionaries are attempting to block the third round  of DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost by bringing forward a nuclear and  missile threat and by fabricating a rumor on a new suspicion.    In addition, they are pursuing a sinister purpose of  alienating Chongnyon from us and of working out a new pretext  for repression of Chongnyon.    Such a foolish fabrication drama cannot convince anyone.  Rather, this will only reveal their ugly nature more clearly.  The rascals can gain nothing from an anti-Republic smear  campaign.    The South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries should  abandon sinister aims and immediately stop this anti-Republic  smear campaign.</p>

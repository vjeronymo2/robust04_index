			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (15): Where to dance the night away - Parisian nightclubs slide in and out of fashion IN the early hours of every morning a gaggle of people gathers on rue du Bourg-l'Abbe, a narrow street among the fashion showrooms and sweat shops of Sentier, the rag trade area of central Paris. They queue there morning after morning, whatever the weather, to try to get into Les Bains, the night club that has for years dominated the Parisian night scene. Any truly fashionable Parisian will roll their eyes at the mention of Les Bains, mutter something about it being passe and advise you to go to one of the mercurial one-nighters that are held in different venues all over the city. Passe or not, other clubs open and close in Paris, but Les Bains goes on. It is still the place that Chanel chooses for its fashion parties, where the fashion industry holds the Venus awards (the fashion designers' own prizes for each season's collections) and where Roman Polanski, and almost every other fashionable film director, hold their post-premiere parties. No-one with any sense would go to Les Bains to dance. The dancefloor is tiny with a distractingly low ceiling and Parisians, who tend to be as aggressive about staking their claim on the dance floor as about poaching parking spaces, have very sharp elbows. The music at Les Bains is satisfactory, but not sensational. The Folies Pigalle, the hastily converted music hall on place Pigalle, has a bigger and better dance floor as does la Locomotive, the triple-storey club on boulevard de Clichy, which also has far funkier music. Nor would anyone choose Les Bains for its food, its drink (both predictably over-priced) or even its decor, which, with its video monitors and shabby chic seats looks like any one of half a dozen Manhattan night clubs. Although Les Bains does score high aesthetic points for the ceiling of its (unisex) toilets upstairs, a sea of pink plastic roses, tres Jeff Koons. But Les Bains, like all really long-lasting night clubs, comes top of the class for voyeurism. It is probably still the only place in Paris where you are virtually guaranteed to see a sprinkling of super-models, fashion designers, film directors and visiting American movie stars (Sylvester Stallone turned up with a posse of black leather-clad body guards) on any one night among the army of suburbanites on the dancefloor. OTHER clubs flicker in and out of fashion. Niel's, which opened last autumn on avenue des Ternes, is popular with the film crowd, as is Le Comptoir on rue Vauvilliers beside Les Halles centre with the fashion scene. But people still queue on rue Bourg-l'Abee. The only hitch is getting in. One of the ruses with which Les Bains, like all really longlasting night clubs, has protected its reputation is by operating a supremely snobby door policy. Night after night, or, more accurately morning after morning, there are humiliating scenes as people plead with Marilyn, the formidable door person, to be allowed in. There is a simple solution. If your idea of a fun night out in Paris does not include shivering on the pavement outside a night club that you may or may not eventually be allowed to go in to, then telephone Les Bains on 4887 0180, and book a table at the restaurant. You can then sail past Marilyn and eat your meal before fighting for a few spare square inches on the Les Bains dance floor.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the SPD </F> Bundestag group, by Rolf Kleine: "Is the SPD a Bad Loser, Mr.  Klose?"]    [Text] [Kleine] Roman Herzog achieved a convincing  victory in the presidential election. Why is the Social  Democratic Party [SPD] continuing its criticism? Are the Social  Democrats bad losers?    [Klose] No. The new federal president has been  democratically elected. The discussion must now end even though  our candidate has lost. We will cooperate loyally with the new  president. The SPD respects the result. It reflects the  current situation of political forces, which we have to change  in the upcoming election. That is all.    [Kleine] Nevertheless, the leading SPD officials continue to  criticize the electoral process and Roman Herzog....    [Klose] We should stop it. Even though there was some  irritation after the speech of the future president, we must now  stop criticism. Our political opponent is Helmut Kohl and not  Roman Herzog.    [Kleine] Was the SPD not too sure that its candidate would  win the election?    [Klose] Due to the majority situation I was always convinced  that we would have a fair chance as an outsider -- but not more.    [Kleine] SPD Chairman Scharping regards the Free Democratic  Party [FDP] as superfluous after its recent behavior in the  federal convention. Does this end the speculation about an  SPD-FDP coalition after the Bundestag election?    [Klose] Scharping meant that in a political sense -- and he  was being polemical. Of course we were upset about the FDP's  behavior. Yet the next elections have to show how much the FDP  is worth. Right now, the FDP is not in a good shape, it is a  political lightweight.    [Kleine] Herzog was hardly elected when voices were raised  in the SPD calling for a direct election of the president. Does  the SPD now really want to change the electoral procedure?    [Klose] No. We will not simply change a longstanding SPD  position two days after the election. The discussion was a  result of the initial, understandable disappointment about the  defeat.    [Kleine] The Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian  Social Union [CSU] now has the right to nominate a new judge to  the Federal Constitutional Court as a successor to Roman Herzog,  and the SPD has to agree. Will you now pay back the CDU for its  rejection of Herta Daeubler-Gmelin last year?    [Klose] The CDU/CSU will indeed have to ask the SPD's  support for its candidate. We had to experience the same last  year the other way round. In the past the CDU/CSU did not  always accept each candidate, and we will not do so, either.</p>

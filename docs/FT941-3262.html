			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Swedish health row deepens A row over healthcare reforms and pay which has led to a series of strikes by Swedish doctors deepened yesterday as the Swedish Medical Association called 2,600 doctors out on a two-and-a-half day stoppage next week in the north, centre and south-west of the country. With talks deadlocked, it is set to be the third action of its kind in recent weeks in selected hospitals and health centres that have led to hundreds of postponed operations. The medical association, which represents 95 per cent of Sweden's doctors and surgeons, is objecting to proposals to sack doctors who are not selected by at least 1,000 patients.</p>

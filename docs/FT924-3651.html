			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Danish deal on treaty at risk DENMARK'S national compromise on resubmitting the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum is in jeopardy because of disagreement over Britain's proposals to resolve the Danish problem. If the national compromise disintegrates it is widely believed the chances of persuading the electorate to approve the treaty will be seriously reduced. Three opposition parties, which hold the key to the compromise, meet today to thrash out differences over the national stance, supported by seven of the eight parties in the Folketing (parliament). The three are the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Radical Liberals and the left-wing Socialist People's Party (SPP). They hold a majority in the Folketing and jointly wrote the draft of the national compromise, which was subsequently accepted as the official Danish position. The compromise is under attack by the SPP, whose leader, Mr Holger K Nielsen, says the British proposals do not respect the electorate's rejection of the treaty last June. He says the electorate rejected European union, and therefore any agreement between Denmark and the 11 other EC countries must clearly dissociate Denmark from the aim of European union, which the British text does not do. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, has warned the opposition that the SPP's demand would face rejection by other EC governments. He called on the party not to start a 'religious war' over the issue of European union.</p>

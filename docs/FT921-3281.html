			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Volvo winds up import deal with Lex VOLVO, the Swedish car maker, is ending its exclusive import agreement with Lex Service four years early to take direct control over the distribution of its vehicles in the UK. The premature termination of a relationship that goes back 33 years will cost Volvo more than Pounds 100m. In the heyday of Volvo imports in 1988-89, more than 80,000 cars a year were sold in the UK - Volvo's second most important market. Last year, in a UK car market that was 30 per cent down on its 1989 record of 2.3m units, Volvo's figure was 47,000 - a share of just under 3 per cent. Volvo said the ending of the agreement reflected no disappointment in Lex. It followed the creation of a European marketing section in Brussels. The Swedish group is following Nissan and Toyota, the Japanese manufacturers, which have set out to acquire control of their importer/distributor operations from independent franchises. Volkswagen also seems determined to take control of VW/Audi in the UK from Lonrho. Last year Volvo Concessionaires contributed a Pounds 13m operating profit to Lex's total of Pounds 16.2m. Profit peaked for the import business at about Pounds 50m in the late 1980s. Lex's results, announced yesterday, showed a slide in pre-tax profit, after Pounds 16.5m of interest payments, to Pounds 500,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.32bn. Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman, blamed 'appalling conditions in the UK motor industry'. He said that after receiving the Volvo cash and selling its European electronics components business, the group could have Pounds 70m cash by the end of this year, on top of an investment worth about Pounds 60m in Arrow Electronics, an international distribution business. Lex's share price dropped 30p yesterday to close at 205p, giving the group a market value of about Pounds 191m. Results, Page 12 London stocks, Page 17</p>

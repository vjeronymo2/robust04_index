			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Feature by reporter Sun Yong (1327 0516): "Li Ruihuan Gives </F> the Green Light to Reporters"]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Consultative  Conference [CPPCC], participated in discussions held by Hong  Kong and Macao CPPCC members at the Guest Hall this afternoon,  which became the focus of reporters covering the ongoing CPPCC  session.    When Chairman Li Ruihuan left the group of Macao CPPCC  members for the conference room of the Hong Kong CPPCC members,  many reporters had been waiting for him outside the door of the  room for some time. With the snapping of camera shutters, Li  Ruihuan entered the conference room while reporters from Hong  Kong and Macao remained outside.    Upon taking a seat, Li Ruihuan found no Hong Kong and Macao  reporters in the room and said to people working there: "How  come Hong Kong and Macao reporters did not come in. This is a  discussion held by the group of Hong Kong CPPCC members, and we  should invite them in."    When a person working there went to invite Hong Kong and  Macao reporters in, Li Ruihuan saw Mr. Xu Simin, member of the  Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee and director  of the Hong Kong paper CHING PAO. He then humorously said:  "Standing Committee Member Xu Simin is a reporter running a  newspaper. Such an important reporter is let in, why not other  reporters?" This provoked laughter among the people in the room.    Given the green light by Li Ruihuan, the anxiously waiting  reporters joyfully entered the room.    At the group discussion, attendees spoke one after another.  Li Ruihuan's remarks were humorous yet profound, which were  punctuated with applause and laughters. Hong Kong and Macao  reporters recorded the scene with regular and video cameras as  well as with pens.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Arjo predicts SKr141m loss ARJO, the international healthcare group based in Sweden which is coming to the market early next month, has forecast pre-tax losses of SKr140.9m (Pounds 11.5m) for the year to September 30 1993 in its pathfinder prospectus. The group is seeking a listing on both the London and Stockholm Stock Exchanges. The loss was struck after interest and dividend costs of SKr127.1m and foreign exchange losses of SKr189m. At the operating level profits are estimated at SKr175.2m on turnover of SKr1.1bn, compared with operating profits of SKr120.6m on turnover of SKr809.1m in the previous year, when pre-tax profit were SKr15.3m. The group estimated pre-tax profits this time would have been SKr166.9m without the interest and foreign exchange costs related to its net borrowings of SKr1.43bn. The offering is intended to clear the debt, incurred in the 1990 management buy-out from Malmros International, by raising between SKr1.5bn and SKr1.7bn. The price is expected to be in the range of SKr105 and SKr115 per share, implying an initial market capitalisation of SKr2.2bn to SKr2.4bn. Mr Hans Lindstrom, chief executive, said the offering would leave the group with a strong balance sheet and cashflow, enabling it to expand and invest in new products. The group claims to be a leader in lifting systems for elderly and disabled patients.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: French takeover reforms approved MR MICHEL SAPIN, the French finance minister, has approved a reform of takeover rules, obliging companies to offer to buy all the shares of companies they are bidding for, instead of just 66 per cent as previously. The long expected change, which brings France more in line with UK takeover practice, comes in response to repeated complaints from minority investors that they were often left with small amounts of worthless shares in companies subject to two-thirds bids. Their frustration became a national issue late last year, when Pinault, the diversified timber to retailing group, provoked an outcry by obtaining control of Au Printemps, the department stores group, by launching an offer for two thirds of the shares. The plight of minorities won full support from stock exchange authorities, who argued that clearer takeover rules would help stem the flow of investment away from Paris to other European stock markets. The reform is therefore no surprise. Indeed, some investors have already started to launch full bids, once passing the 33.3 per cent stake at which an offer must be triggered, instead of making old-style partial offers.</p>

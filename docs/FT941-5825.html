			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Open universities Britain's higher education system lurches from feast to famine. After several years in which student numbers have soared, expansion was yesterday brought to a sudden halt. Such wild swings in policy do not simply conspire against good university management. They are also symptoms of an over-centralised higher education system. The number of students who go into higher education, the fees charged and, in large measure, the budgets of individual universities are all set by a centralised quango. The result is not merely that many school-leavers will be unable to find university places this autumn. The squeeze in government spending per student - it has fallen by a third in real terms over the past two decades - is endangering quality. Meanwhile, centralised capping of student numbers blunts the incentive for universities to compete to attract students. It is widely accepted that the proportion of school-leavers who go into higher education should rise. The figure is already nearly one in three and the government would like to see it go higher. The snag is that the public-sector deficit will not permit the state to pay for such expansion. So far, ministers' attempts to square the circle have been timid. The main initiative has been to increase the proportion of student maintenance financed through loans rather than state grants. But a more radical policy is needed if higher education is to expand again in 1997, as ministers intend, without an unacceptable decline in quality. To achieve this, most students should be required to pay for the bulk of their tuition. This is quite reasonable, since they benefit from university education in the form of higher lifetime earnings. The key is to allow students to borrow against their human capital to finance their education, while repaying the loans over a long period of time as their income increases. The best way of structuring such a loan scheme is still a matter of debate. But a recent study by the London School of Economics makes a powerful case for repaying loans through the national insurance contribution system. This would be administratively simple and ensure that loan repayments were linked to ability to pay. A new financing mechanism would not merely be a way of bringing extra funds into higher education. It could pave the way for freeing universities from the shackles of central government. If students ultimately paid for their own education, there would be little need for a quango to fix student numbers or set fees. These could be set in the market, as individual students sought out the best courses for their needs. One consequence is that universities would have to compete on price and quality to flourish. Such a competitive spur would help put Britain's generally admired higher education in better shape for the next century.</p>

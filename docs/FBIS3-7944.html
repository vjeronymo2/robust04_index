			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Miller, Polish labor and social </F> policy minister, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet  studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Labor  Minister Leszek Miller. Good morning to you.    [Miller] Good morning to you, and to you, Ladies and  Gentlemen.    [Woyciechowski] Are you afraid of strikes?    [Miller, hesitating] Naturally, a strike is not a pleasant  thing to happen, and my assessment is that there are certainly  reasons to have these protests and this turmoil. I reject the  notion of a double-face morality which is about the fact that in  the previous term Sejm, when we were in the opposition, we  thought for instance that the protests by the All-Polish Trade  Unions Agreement [OPZZ] were justified, whereas today, under the  type of moral standards I mentioned, I would have to say that  the protests by Solidarity are unjustified. The fact is though  that these protests are indeed justified since the situation of  many thousands of Polish families is difficult without a doubt,  and in many cases it is even outright tragic. And when I hear,  or read on lists of demands, that [hesitating] unemployment must  be reduced, then of course I agree with that proposition, except  I would like to remind you that it is not Waldemar Pawlak's  cabinet that caused this unemployment of 3 million people. And  when I read for instance that retirement pensions and other  kinds of pensions must be raised, then I agree with that, as  well, except that it is not Waldemar Pawlak's cabinet that  reduced the so-called fundamental amount from 100 percent to 91  percent. I could go on and on like this, citing similar  examples. So, it would be hard to expect that after three  months of the government's term, these painful problems will be  immediately resolved as if by some magical trick. So while  agreeing that there are indeed reasons for the protests, I  disagree with the way there problems are being resolved--that is  to say, we are proposing negotiations, peaceful talks regarding  specific measures, and we are proposing to leave protests and  strikes as a last resort, not as the first one.    [Woyciechowski] What is the story with the negotiations?  Solidarity keeps accusing you, saying that it wants to negotiate  while the government refuses to do so. Recently, the miners'  Solidarity said that if the government does not begin  negotiations by 7 March, then the miners will go on strike. So  who wants to negotiate and who does not?    [Miller] You know, at the same time as these statements are  [hesitating] being conveyed to the public, six working groups  including 17 trade union centers, two employer organizations,  and also representatives of territorial self-governments, are  negotiating with each other on the topic of citizens' social  rights, I mean citizens' social guarantees. On some of these  issues, agreement has already been reached--for instance,  regarding the directions of amendments to [hesitating] the  family-benefits system. Yesterday, a very interesting idea  emerged, to initiate work on a law on family benefits--the idea  is to accumulate all benefits for children and families in just  one legal document. Of course this will have to be done by  modernizing the law. In my view, that is the way to solve the  many problems of Polish families.    With regard to the accusation of not negotiating, [Industry  and Trade] Minister Pol conducts many different kinds of  negotiations every single day. I think that....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But who should be involved in  the negotiations: the industry minister, or the labor minister?    [Miller] Exactly. I think that the industry minister should  definitely negotiate these issues. But you know, I think the  essence of the misunderstanding is that many trade union  activists seem to think that ministers continue to be the right  partners for negotiations, and not the president of a company or  the manager of an enterprise. Well, this is no longer 1989, and  even less is it 1980. Deep changes have occurred in the Polish  economy since then. Fortunately, these changes were geared  toward decentralization. That is why ever fewer decisions are up  to Minister Pol for instance, and more and more decisions are up  to the president of a company, the manager of an enterprise, or  to managers or chairmen of economic units.    [Woyciechowski] Does it mean Minister Pol is not empowered  to decide on salary hikes for miners, but the decision has to be  made by the mine's manager?    [Miller] That is the way it is, more or less.    [Woyciechowski] And are you empowered to make a decision  on a raise for anybody, I mean you, the labor minister?    [Miller] I am not, because what I deal with professionally  is [hesitating] lessening the pain of the systemwide and  economic transformations, but my main concern is assistance to  the very poorest and protection to those who are suffering the  most. But my feeling is that within these requests for talks  and negotiations, or within the demands being made, there is a  kind of, you know, a nostalgic tone ....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do you mean it is a nostalgia  for communism?    [Miller] Not so much for communism as for measures that are  characteristic of a centralized economic system, where there is  just one manager--this could be for instance the industry  minister--who is in charge of thousands of different kinds of  companies and who makes the most important decisions, along with  the chief of the Planning Commission. But in reality, we have  thousands of managers in Poland right now who have to make their  decisions based on the state of their individual units.    [Woyciechowski] What you just said was a tribute to  capitalism.    [Miller, hesitating] I am not sure whether it is capitalism.  It was rather a tribute to a certain way of managing the  economy. You know, my view is that ....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Tell me, three months passed  since you took up the post of labor minister, and, during the  three months, you never met face-to-face with [Solidarity  Chairman] Krzaklewski. Was it him or you that did not want to  meet?    [Miller] I did meet with him. We even had a live television  debate recently; we debated for half an hour. We meet with many  representatives of Solidarity. Yesterday, for instance--I think  this is worth putting on record--a very important event took  place, namely the prime minister awarded [hesitating] the  official appointments to new members of a trilateral commission  for social and economic affairs. As the name itself indicates,  this trilateral commission consists of employers, trade unions,  and government representatives. Within the trade union  group--let us say it this way--there are four Solidarity  representatives who received appointments yesterday. You know,  the reason I am stressing this fact is because for the first  time in these transformation achievements of ours, a trilateral  commission was established officially and on the basis of a  resolution by the government. By the way, I must also praise  here the negotiators involved in the Agreement on State-Owned  Enterprises, since the commission was set up kind of as a result  of the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises--and that trilateral  commission consists of representatives of employers, trade  unions, and the government. The commission has quite  considerable powers regarding issuing opinions and it will  gather at a single table representatives of different trade  unions and also representatives whose social and economic  interests vary so much. So that commission will be an area for  coming to an agreement regarding very significant  decisions--against the background of what is happening in Poland  today, that fact is important to the extent that it is proof of  the direction of seeking social peace.    [Woyciechowski] But let us return for a moment to the  strikes: Is it your impression today--now that Solidarity  initiated a wide-scale strike operation, today the miners in  Rybnik will be on strike for two hours--is it your impression  that these strikes are politically motivated, that is to say  that they are being conducted against the cabinet?    [Miller, hesitating] You know, I try not to deal with such  easy-sounding suspicions or descriptions. I always try to  answer the question of whether there are economic, social, and  standard-of-living related reasons. So in this case, my answer  is: Yes, there are reasons. So to a large extent, these  protests and strikes are a result of these social reasons. But  judging from the nature of some demands being made, one can kind  of conclude that these strikes are political in nature.    [Woyciechowski] But if there are economic reasons, then why  is it that Solidarity is on strike but OPZZ is not?    [Miller] Because that is exactly the issue of the choice of  [hesitating] the way to resolve these economic hardships:  Either at a negotiating table where we would draft new laws or  improve the existing ones, or else by protests and by using  primarily emotions. And since you asked me about this, I will  tell you honestly--I think these protests and strikes are  undoubtedly a response to the existing reality, but they do not  change that reality.    [Woyciechowski] Are they a reaction to the reality or to  the leftist government?    [Miller] Well, a reaction to the reality understood mainly  as the material situation of large social groups; also,  partially, a reaction to the leftist government. However, I  think that the reality changes at negotiation tables. In a  centralized economy, in an economy that you have called  communist, there was one partner on one side, and another  partner on the other. Now there are many partners. There are  many interests as well. Therefore, the only reasonable thing to  do in such situations are negotiations during which the  participants want to find more or less common points of view.    [Woyciechowski] Recently, a few days ago, President Walesa  declared that he would soon start the process of file-checking  and decommunization. Do you fear that the president will  decommunize you?    [Miller, laughs] Well, our president says various things.  Sometimes they border on a kind of a black humor. Poles have  managed to get used to this; some get irritated, look at their  wristwatches, and look forward to the end of this term of  office; others are delighted. I would personally compare the  president's recent statements to some kind of a black humor.  You know, it is difficult to say that I am delighted with Mr.  Kaczynski, for instance. He is not one of my favorite  politicians. However, when Mr. Kaczynski says that if the  president wants to start decommunization and file-checking, he  should begin with his own office, then I must say that I really  liked this statement by Mr. Kaczynski.    [Woyciechowski] Did you get the impression that the  president declared war on the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]?  Can this be defined in such terms?    [Miller] We could hear such overtones. He will not come to  the parliament, he rejects the possibility of cooperation, and  so on and so forth. However, the president often changes his  mind and we should wait; perhaps in a week or two, when the  emotions are not so high, the president will say something  reconciliatory. Well, many words were spoken unnecessarily.  Incidentally, I think that nothing much would have happened if  the Sejm had forwarded the constitution bill....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What did you vote for?    [Miller] Unfortunately, I was not there when the ballot was  held....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What if you had been there?    [Miller] I would have voted for forwarding the bill to the  committees. You know, I remember something that happened in the  previous Sejm. The SLD Deputies' Club tried to place on the  Sejm agenda an initiative that was very important from our point  of view; it was the passing of the Socioeconomic Charter. It  was supposed to be kind of a supplement to the Constitution, a  supplement concerning social issues, related to the living  standard. At that time our initiative was rejected in the first  reading. It was obviously rejected for political reasons. We  felt really bad about; we felt like people who were....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] I remember that moment.  However, now this Sejm actually did a very similar thing.    [Miller] And they were slapped hard in the face. Now,  unfortunately, the situation was similar. Therefore, I try not  to forget the bad feeling we felt to prevent other people from  feeling the same way. Thus, I do not think that something bad  would have happened if this draft constitution had been  forwarded to Sejm committees. However, we must make up our  minds to it; what is done cannot be undone. Now we should not  escalate this conflict.    [Woyciechowski] Today's press has published the results of  an opinion poll conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center.  Poles were asked who is their best candidate for the post of  the president. You must have seen these results. Kwasniewski  comes first, with 17 percent; far behind him is Pawlak, with 11  percent; Lech Walesa has 9 percent. Is Kwasniewski the best  candidate of SLD for the post of the president?    [Miller] He definitely is the best candidate and I am really  glad that Olek [diminutive of Aleksander] occupies such a  position. You know, I have known Mr. Kwasniewski for many  years. I must admit that I do not know a better expert in  resolving conflict situations; I do not know anyone who has  greater abilities as far as reconciliating various views is  concerned. Now, if we add his brilliance and intelligence to  that, then it becomes clear that he is our best candidate for  that post.    [Woyciechowski] Of course, what I wanted to ask you about...  [Woyciechowski pauses] You understood the allusion. What about  the rumors that within SLD there are other candidates for the  post of the president as well? Is there a conflict there? The  name of Cimoszewicz is often mentioned. Is it merely a gossip  or not?    [Miller] You know, SLD is very rich in outstanding persons.  There is no doubt about that. However, among those outstanding  figures, the star of Kwasniewski is shining the brightest.    [Woyciechowski] Do you already know the name of the future  deputy prime minister and finance minister?    [Miller] No, unfortunately I do not.    [Woyciechowski] What about the names of the candidates?    [Miller] I know several candidates, at least. I have heard  various names. However, due to the fact that Mr. Kwasniewski  asked us not to discuss these matters in greater detail...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In other words, you know, but  you will not tell us...    [Miller, interrupting] Let us not discuss this in detail,  then.    [Woyciechowski] Yesterday you won the lawsuit with ZYCIE  WARSZAWY. It was a precedent. For the first time a politician  managed to win a classical, as it were, lawsuit for libel.  Could you say a few words about that?    [Miller] Yes, I am very pleased with that, because this was  a long story; it lasted two years, beginning in December 1991.  At that time and even later on, ZYCIE WARSZAWY published  made-up stories about my participation in the so-called Moscow  loan, that is, the loan of the Communist Party of the Soviet  Union for the Polish United Workers' Party. I decided that all  acceptable norms had been violated in those lies and slanders.  I instituted legal proceedings. Only after two years,  yesterday the case was brought to the end. ZYCIE WARSZWY is  obliged to apologize to me and pay 25 million zlotys [Z] to the  bank account of the Polish Red Cross in Lodz. In Lodz because I  come from Lodz. I am also very happy....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does it, then, pay to sue  newspapers?    [Miller] It does pay for those who have a lot of patience.  Now, when I recall that two years have passed, that over those  two years ZYCIE WARSZAWY... [Miller pauses] You know, this is  interesting. I have often made statements on these issues; I  have organized many press conferences; I have written all kinds  of corrections. I thought that the editors, knowing that they  are being sued, would be more moderate However, what happened  was just to the contrary. Over those two years the intensity of  those slanders did not wane at all. Therefore, I believe that  it is good to do this in drastic cases; however, one must  realize right at the beginning that this is going take a lot of  time and that the compensation, especially in the financial  sense, will be very insignificant, and that it may happen that  the people will eventually forget what it was all really  about....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And just like today, only one  newspaper published a report on that court verdict--a short  report consisting of six lines, whereas at that time newspapers  carried big headlines.    [Miller] This is typical. When this case began, all....  [Miller pauses] Most of the press as well as radio and  television newscasts, began with this information: Miller did  this or did that. Now that this case has finally been finished,  there is only silence. Thus, this is a reflection for me, and  maybe not only for me but also for the listeners, perhaps, about  the objectivity and impartiality of the mass media.  Incidentally, I would like to inform you that I have also begun  another trial, concerning the same, with GAZETA WYBORCZA. In  this case things are far less advanced, so it will probably last  not two years, but perhaps two and a half, or even three.  However, I think that it will end up very similarly, because it  is exactly the same problem.    [Woyciechowski] Do you think the government members should  get generous awards of the order of Z100 or 142 million?    [Miller] Well, you know....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Have you received any award  yet?    [Miller] If I say no, then some of my government colleagues  may resent it; if I say yes, then probably the listeners will  resent it; they will say: well, what does this Miller think he  is? I will simply tell you how much I earn. I earn Z17 million  before tax and my net earnings amount to approximately 15  million.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, you should go on strike.    [Miller, laughs] I receive 15 million. Now, this is a  matter of evaluation whether this is a sufficient salary for a  minister or not. I certainly realize that there are many Poles  who earn much less. There is no doubt about that. However,  there are many who make much more money. I have received one  award so far; it was an award for the fourth quarter; I received  it just before Christmas. It was Z20 million, I think. It  really helped me organize Christmas and New Year's Eve.    [Woyciechowski] These are the awards that today's press  mentions. It indicates that Pawlak also probably used some of  the money left by Suchocka.    [Miller] These are legal regulations. It all results from  concrete legal acts. Well, it is difficult to imagine a prime  minister who can pay this money to his civil servants, but does  not want to do that. I think that there is only one problem  here: none of this should be secret. This should not be  enshrouded in a strange mist of secret. Let us speak about this  bluntly and let the public opinion form a certain view on that.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview.    [Miller] Thank you.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "tl": "Dasa Turnover To Grow to DM2.5 Billion </F> in the Civilian Sector"]    [Text] Bonn, 12-13 Mar -- Deutsche Aerospace AG (Dasa),  Munich, has appealed to the Federal Government to improve during  the first half of this year the possibilities for German  companies to participate in international cooperation projects  in the armament sector. Otherwise, 4,000 jobs will be lost,  Werner Heinzmann, member of the Dasa Executive Committee and  chairman of the company branches space flight, defense, and  civilian systems, told journalists in Bonn.    Dasa is trying to put the entire field of guided weapons  into  Euromissile -- a joint subsidiary with the French Aerospatiale.  The seat is to be in France. Heinzmann reported "very positive  signals" from the Federal Government, which is to facilitate  armament cooperation projects in line with the so-called  Schmidt-Debre Agreement in the next few weeks. This agreement  refers to government cooperation projects and says one partner  country must inform the other but the partner country does not  have the right to veto the export intentions of the other  partner. According to Heinzmann, France has been able to export  the Milan and Roland weapons systems to areas, which would have  been taboo for German companies because of the tighter export  control. The Dasa Executive Committee demands from the Federal  Government that this agreement should not just apply to  government cooperation projects but also for industrial  cooperation. The FRG Economics Ministry has confirmed that  corresponding talks are taking place, but no details were  revealed.    According to Heinzmann, the joint subsidiary Euromissile  would have a turnover of about 3 billion German marks [DM], to  which Dasa contributes about DM1 billion. Heinzmann justified  the French interest in cooperation by pointing to the fact that  the German market continues to be interesting and that the  Germans have complementary skills, which are indispensable for  the French.    According to Heinzmann, pure program cooperation is no  longer  sufficient, since the capacities have become undercriticial in  many fields because of drastic cutbacks in the defense budgets,  Heinzman said. Preservation is possible only in "full-step"  European companies with a bundling of the resources and mutual  dependence and supplies (single-sourcing). Heinzmann: "Basic  military business can survive only in European companies in the  future." Nevertheless, there remains defending the central  business of Dasa. For this purpose, however, the company needs  planning security provided by the Federal Government.    According to Heinzmann, basic military business is the  precondition for growth in civilian markets. Heinzmann  announced "considerable efforts" to develop new civilian  business and to expand existing markets. Here he cited in  particular communications and information technology,  environmental technology, and satellite-based navigation  systems. Turnover in the civilian sector should rise from about  DM700 million to up to DM2.5 billion. Since 1990 Dasa has  created about 1,300 new jobs in the civilian area and it plans  to create another 1,500 new jobs there by 1998, Heinzmann said.  Dasa will leave research and development investments at the  former high level of DM1.5 billion in five years to finance  entering new fields of growth. Heinzmann warned Bonn against  ending activities in manned space flight.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> NYRO FIDDLES WITH SLOGANS, BUZZWORDS  </P> <P> During the late '60s and early '70s, Laura Nyro was a Garbo-like figurine,  caught in a maelstrom of self-obsessed imagery that rode on a helter-skelter  melange of classic R&amp;B, pop, jazz and show-tune melodies. She was the dark  urban madonna playing stream-of-consciousness art/soul. Today's Madonna was  among Nyro's worshipful audience on Friday at the Wiltern Theatre, and the  object of adoration was a calmer, less melodramatic performer as she followed  up on her surprising comeback of last year after a decade of performance  inactivity.  </P> <P> In her new songs, Nyro has replaced a personal mythology with slogans and  buzzwords about Indian issues, ecology, animal rights and radical feminism.  Arrangements of her older songs were tailored to avoid the high notes of her  youth, and her idiosyncratic stops, starts and tempo shifts were smoothed out  by her crackerjack quartet. But Nyro's vocals are warmer and less strident, and  when she encored, alone at the piano, with songs from her youth like an  achingly poignant "Dedicated to the One I Love," one heard the passion and the  poetry that inspires cults. Nyro appears at the Coach House in San Juan  Capistrano tonight. CRAIG LEE  </P></p>

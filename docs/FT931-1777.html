			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Sixteen arrested after clashes with police outside Timex plant BRITAIN'S worst picket line violence for seven years erupted yesterday outside the Timex plant in Dundee as an increasingly bitter strike entered its fifth week. Sixteen people were arrested when up to 600 demonstrators battled with police as replacement workers were taken by bus through picket lines into the plant, which makes printed circuit boards. Angry strike supporters sat down in front of the gates to try to stop the bus. Some union officials accused the police of over-reacting and losing control. Timex last night deplored the violence and said the demonstrators were trying to intimidate its workforce. The dispute is rapidly becoming a cause celebre in Scotland. Last Saturday, more than 7,000 people marched through Dundee in support of the striking workers, who were dismissed for refusing to accept cuts in benefits. The sackings went ahead despite the fact that the workers had agreed to return under protest. More and more supporters from organisations including Militant Tendency and the Socialist Workers' party are turning up at Timex to demonstrate their solidarity with the strikers. Britain has not witnessed such violent scenes in an industrial dispute since the 1986 siege of News International's plant at Wapping in east London by print workers. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering union, said yesterday his union had become 'ensnared in the draconian labour laws that did not help to solve industrial disputes'. He added the AEEU was ready at any time to talk with Timex about the dispute and prepared to use the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service to settle the strike. Yesterday's escalation in the dispute followed the legal victory gained by the AEEU in the Court of Session in Edinburgh last Friday, when Timex failed to secure the extension of an existing interdict - or injunction - which would have banned all meetings, marches and demonstrations held by the union within 50 yards of the plant. Timex was also ordered to pay the union's legal costs. Union officials believe the company has already spent up to Pounds 70,000 in legal expenses since the dispute began. On Friday, a further confrontation will take place in the Court of Session when the AEEU will appeal against the original injunction secured by the company to limit pickets to six at the main gate. Union officials claim the strike is having a severe impact on Timex's business. The US-owned company has recruited up to 190 workers to replace the 320 it dismissed but the AEEU said yesterday the newcomers were not skilled enough to do their jobs.

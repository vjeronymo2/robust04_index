			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Nymex seeks overnight success with Access - The race to round-the-clock electronic trading of energy futures NYMEX, the world's largest energy futures market, will this year join the ranks of exchanges using electronic trading systems. By doing so, some traders on the New York-based exchange foresee that more business will be concentrated at Nymex, possibly robbing London's International Petroleum Exchange of trading volume. Nymex recently unveiled details of its plan to create a round-the-clock screen trading system which will be known as Access - standing for American computerised commodity exchange system and services. The system has been developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph together with Task Management, a software company. Among its features will be a unique risk and credit control check. Despite the doubts of floor traders who fear they may be gradually replaced by computer trading, the exchange believes that with 20 per cent of all world trade devoted to oil and energy, it must increase access to its market in off hours. Trading volume at Mymex has risen dramatically over the past five years, from just 14.7m contracts in 1986 to 42.4m last year. In the first week of November this year, volume was running somewhat below last year's record pace at 34.7m contracts. The jump in trading volume has increasingly brought pressure on the exchange to provide greater access to its markets. Mr Lou Guttman, Nymex's chairman, said the exchange believed it had to either extend floor trading hours to triple shifts or develop a screen trading system. So more than two years ago Nymex became the first exchange to seriously consider becoming a partner in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Globex electronic trading system. 'We knew what our needs were,' said Mr Guttman. But Nymex officials were much chagrined when the CME suspended talks with them in 1990 to bring in as a partner the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange and the CME's traditional rival. Instead of waiting for the Chicago exchanges to return to negotiations with Nymex, the New York exchange decided early last year to cut a path on its own. It now regards that decision as an especially wise one given the repeated postponement of Globex. Nymex intends to have its own Access system up and running by the end of 1992 with contracts listed for crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and platinum. Current plans are for the system to operate from 5pm to 8am the next day, New York time. Nymex's normal market hours are from 8.20am to 3.10pm. Because energy traders will be able to enter or exit the market overnight in the US, open interest in Nymex contracts, or the number of contracts outstanding, is expected to increase. And some traders believe that fewer will resort to London's IPE if they can do all of their business on a 24-hour basis in the US. Speculators who normally would not wish to hold any position overnight, now will be able to in the knowledge that if they must unwind their positions they can do so. The Access system's special real time credit and risk checking feature will in addition provide futures commission merchants control that not even Globex can yet offer. FCMs will be able to set limits by contracts or by a dollar figure on the customers that clear through them, each of whom will have a identification number. If that limit should be exceeded, the Access system will not accept the trade. This is expected to help eliminate the criticism by FCMs that they will be disenfranchised by electronic trading systems, said Mr Guttman. It allows them in essence to be in control of their customer base. Nymex estimates that if 7,000 to 8,000 contracts are traded per night, it will break even financially. It would not yet disclose how fees would be set except to say that these would be 'commensurate with the level of trading activity and the costs of maintaining the system'. For the moment, Globex plans a credit control system that entails actions only after a trade is executed. While this improves the current human monitoring of trades, it does not offer a pre-order entry screening. Globex is expected to begin testing at the end of January and officials say they hope to be able to launch the system by the second quarter of next year. But with the rate of postponements of Globex, Access may have a chance to beat it to the launch pad.</p>

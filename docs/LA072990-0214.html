			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEEN LOST IN ROUGH SURF AT HUNTINGTON  </P> <P> A search resumed Saturday for a 13-year-old Compton boy who disappeared in  rough surf Friday afternoon as lifeguards tried to rescue him and his two  sisters off Huntington State Beach.  </P> <P> The youth was lost and presumed drowned about 5:15 p.m. Friday after he became  separated from his sisters in choppy waters in front of lifeguard tower 15 near  Beach Boulevard.  </P> <P> His name was not released.  </P> <P> Rescuers saved the two girls, ages 8 and 10, but their brother apparently  slipped beneath the surface before he could be reached, lifeguards said.  Earlier, the girls had clung to the boy for a while when they became panicky in  the rough water about 50 to 100 yards offshore.  </P> <P> The search, which involved a rescue boat, a police helicopter and 10  lifeguards, began about 5:30 p.m. Friday, but was called off at nightfall  except for patrols along the shoreline.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the condition of an 18-year-old Lake Elsinore youth who broke his  neck in the surf off San Clemente on Friday has improved, according to Mission  Hospital Regional Medical Center.  </P> <P> Curtis Swann was listed in serious condition Saturday. He had been reported in  critical condition Friday evening in Mission Hospital's intensive care unit  after being airlifted from a beach near the exclusive Cypress Shores  neighborhood. Swann dived head-first into the ocean about 5 p.m. Friday and hit  the bottom.  </P></p>

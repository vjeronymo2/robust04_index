			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar </F> Velayati by al-Sayyid al-Mallah and Ahmad al-Suyufi in  Cairo--date not given]    [Excerpts] [AL-SHA'B] The question citizens in both Cairo  and Tehran must hear is what happened in your talks with  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa? [passage omitted]    Velayati: If you mean the establishment of  official diplomatic ties, this was not discussed during the  meeting, which lasted one whole hour. However, what was  discussed during the meeting was everything that has to do with  joint cooperation between the two countries in international  forums. In addition, we discussed all the international issues  of interest to the two countries, such as Palestine, the war in  Yemen, and the future of the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic  Conference Organization. [passage omitted]    AL-SHA'B: Now we come to the most thorny issue,  the long- standing accusation that the Islamic Republic of Iran  is exporting terrorism to the Islamic World, and even around the  world. What do you have to say about this accusation?    Velayati: This is not new; Iran is not the first  country to be accused of such things. During the 'Abd-al-Nasir  era, Egypt itself was subjected to such accusations.    This is an old weapon the West uses to put pressure on  countries, especially those who refuse to submit to the control  of the Western powers. None of those who have leveled this  accusation can actually prove it. It is no more than dangling  the sword of Damocles over the heads of those who go against  Western and Zionist views. [passage omitted]    AL-SHA'B: You have good ties with Syria, so what  would you do if Syria concluded a peace agreement with Israel?  Would this affect your relations?    Velayati: We are against any agreement with Israel  by any party. This does not mean that we are not aware of the  kind of pressure to which Syria is being subjected by all sides.  Suffice it to mention here the numerous campaigns directed  against Lebanon, Syria's closest neighbor. If such agreements  were signed, naturally it would affect our bilateral relations.  We still consider Syria the only major country left to confront  Israeli domination. [passage omitted]    AL-SHA'B: Undoubtedly, you have made  contributions on the Bosnia issue. But the Islamic world  expected you in particular to take a more effective and  influential stand than you have taken so far. Why have you  taken such a stand?    Velayati: I was in Sarajevo last month. I do not  wish to tell you what we did there, but I will quote public  statements by President Alija Izetbegovic to correspondents:  All aspects of the Iranian role in Bosnia will go down in  history. Had it not been for Iran, Bosnia would not be in the  condition we see it in today. Iran has so far provided many  forms of aid. It has also made a proposal to give military aid.    Velayati then added: A few days ago, THE WASHINGTON POST  published an article in which it confirmed that Iranian planes  had transported shipments of arms to Bosnia. Irrespective of  the truth of this report, we do is not rule out this kind of  undertaking in dealing with Bosnia, where we have seen forms of  ugliness unknown to us before.    AL-SHA'B: Before we end this dialogue, we wish to  learn about your stand on what you call the state of the "great  Satan?"    Velayati: [passage missing] It is the same old  stand. There is nothing new in it. We have no objections to  establishing cordial relations with any party on condition that  that party respects our causes and does not support our enemies.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, seafood trade associations, university Sea  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grant extension offices, and others have already developed work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sheets and other aids to facilitate HACCP planning for seafood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry members are encouraged to contact their trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations and state universities or Sea Grant extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices on such matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even with these forms of assistance, however, FDA recognizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that HACCP plans cannot be written and implemented overnight. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has already been discussed, the HACCP system of controls can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve new ways of thinking and performing on a routine basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, FDA is proposing that these regulations will become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective 1 year after issuance of the final rule in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding. The agency has tentatively concluded that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time is sufficient to permit the development and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of HACCP plans by the industry. FDA specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites comment on whether 1 year will be adequate. The agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective is to provide enough time to permit processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers to understand HACCP, analyze the relevant hazards, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop an appropriate HACCP plan, but also to avoid unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the proposed effective date, inspection of HACCP plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will occur as part of routine, mandatory plant inspections and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> import examinations. FDA is not proposing to require that HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans be submitted to FDA in advance, or that preapproval by FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a condition of their adoption or implementation. FDA is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring preapproval for two reasons. First, HACCP plans can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only properly be judged in the context of the facility itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, while FDA investigators will consider the adequacy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan during their inspections, preapproval does not seem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted. Second, the agency simply does not have the resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make preapproval a requirement. Given the protections that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are built into the HACCP approach, FDA tentatively finds that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preapproval is not necessary to ensure that fish and fishery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products are not produced under conditions whereby they may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Location and Product Type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing in &sect;123.6(a) to require that every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor and importer have and implement an HACCP plan that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific both to each location where that processor engages in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing and to each kind of fish and fishery product being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processed. A plan should be specific to each location because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the likely hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring procedures can vary from one facility to the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on such factors as type of equipment, conditions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, and location. A plan also should be specific to each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of fish and fishery product for the same kinds of reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hazards can vary depending on species, location of catch, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA does not intend, however, to require a processor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer to write a separate plan, or separate part of a plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each fish and fishery product it handles if the likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures are identical for each of them. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventive controls necessary to ensure safety for most deep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water species of finfish from the north Atlantic may be virtually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical. The agency has tentatively concluded that, in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, a processor or importer may group the fish or fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products together in an HACCP plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Safety Hazards Only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.6(b)(1) that HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans identify the human food safety hazards that must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled for each fish and fishery product being processed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor or importer. There exists a range of opinion on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether HACCP should apply solely to safety hazards, as this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision proposes to require, or whether HACCP should apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other types of hazards, such as decomposition not normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with illness in humans. One school of thought holds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that HACCP should apply to safety hazards only in order to keep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it focused and to not overwhelm operators with an unnecessarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large number of critical control points that have no bearing on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the primary concern of safety. Another view holds that, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood at least, HACCP-type controls can be applied to various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer risks without generating an excessive number of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control points. The Codex Committee on Food Hygiene came to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latter conclusion (Ref. 46), as did NOAA as a result of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiences during the MSSP (Ref. 35, p. 70). Partly for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason, the FDA/NOAA HACCP pilot programs involved HACCP controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for safety and HACCP-type controls for other hazards as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of these proposed regulations, however, FDA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of HACCP is intended for the efficient enforcement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 402(a)(1) and 402(a)(4) of the act, which applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products that contain substances that may render the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injurious to health and to processing conditions that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insanitary and that could render a product injurious to health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that HACCP plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include identification of hazards that could affect human food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety only. To facilitate the production of such plans, FDA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1) the types of hazards that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been associated with seafood (see section II.C. of this document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a discussion of these hazards). All of these hazards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified and discussed in the NAS report on seafood safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Life side helps M&amp;G edge ahead to Pounds 39.4m A STRONG showing by its life insurance subsidiary helped M&amp;G, the fund management group, record a marginal increase in pre-tax profits in the year to September 30. Profits for the year were Pounds 39.41m (Pounds 39.24m). But the annual figures masked a 7 per cent fall in second half profits year-on-year. M&amp;G said that the first half figures had benefited from the launch of two investment trusts, Recovery and Income. The launches were net revenue earners, although they did cause a 78 per cent increase in marketing and commissions expenditure. In the second half, the company shed 67 staff, including its former marketing director, Mr Tim Miller, resulting in total costs of Pounds 600,000. Offices were closed in Cardiff, Exeter and Southampton as part of a restructuring programme. Insurance income rose from Pounds 8.16m to Pounds 10.19m, outweighing a fall in earnings from institutional fund management (down from Pounds 2.15m to Pounds 1.93m), and retail fund management (down from Pounds 22.44m to Pounds 21.06m). Sir David Money-Coutts, chairman, said that unit trust sales fell from Pounds 468m to Pounds 295m, while redemptions rose from Pounds 345m to Pounds 404m. Funds under management were Pounds 8.59bn at the end of September, down from Pounds 9.01bn at the end of the 1990-91 financial year. However, these figures reflect some double-counting because of unit holdings by life and pension funds. The 'clean' figure for the end of September was Pounds 7.47bn. Earnings per share came to 36.37p (36.1p). The final dividend was increased 2.3 per cent to 11p (10.75p), making a total for the year of 20p (19p). COMMENT The results of fund management groups are always geared to the health of the stock market, but this may be even more the case with M&amp;G this year. Its stock-picking investment style has been out of favour in the recession; an economic recovery should bring its portfolios back into fashion. If that happens, and performance improves, then M&amp;G can reverse last year's pattern of net redemptions. If the stock market slips back, and private investors switch from cash to bonds, other groups have better reputations in the fixed interest field than M&amp;G. The departure of Tim Miller may also have made some wonder whether all is well within the management team. Assuming a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 44m, the shares, down 4p to 560p yesterday, are on a prospective p/e of 14. Given the doubts, that rating looks high enough.</p>

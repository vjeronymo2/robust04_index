			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Architects urge policy change for housing BRITAIN'S architects say that the country faces a dramatic housing crisis and that its transport system is in chaos. The Royal Institute of British Architects urges changes in government policies on housing, transport and the environment in its paper An Agenda for the Nineties, published today. 'The housing needs of many members of society are not being met,' it says. The paper says public expenditure on housing has fallen 60 per cent in real terms over the past 10 years. Local authority house-building has fallen from 86,000 units in 1980 to 13,000 units last year. Housing associations built 17,000 houses last year compared with 21,000 in 1980. It calls for a national housing policy to establish the extent of housing shortages, the areas where new housing is required, and the type of housing needed. Local authorities should be allowed to spend a far greater proportion of capital receipts from the sale of housing and land on building new homes, it says. Leading financial institutions should be encouraged to play a part in the private-rented sector. 'Adequate standards of housing for all sectors of the community are an essential human right. It should not be left to the market to determine the nation's housing mix on the basis of the best possible return on site value.' The paper says that a balance must be struck within the next generation between private and public transport, and road and rail. 'More road building is not the solution to the problem of traffic in town and cities. Without efficient public transport towns and cities will be condemned to terminal decline,' it says. Some further selective investment will be needed in motorways and trunk roads but there is no case for introducing toll roads, it argues. Railways are the most effective means of mass transportation and a target should be set for the transfer of freight from road to rail, the paper says. But more public investment and subsidy will be needed to maintain and improve rail services. 'Privatisation will not ensure an improved railway network.' The paper, which says that architectural competitions should be held for all major buildings, attacks government proposals to introduce compulsory competitive tendering for local authority architects' departments, deriding the 'assumption that the cheapest architect will provide taxpayers with the best value'.

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Just junk the jeito: A look at a Brazilian habit that is part inducement, part consideration, part bribe There is a word newcomers to Brazil learn quickly. It makes them flinch at first; later it triggers a bead of sweat, and then it brings on a nervous laugh. It is used sparingly, even by long-term residents, because they sense its ability to strip away an outsider's defences and launch him, naked, into the cauldron of Brazilian culture. The word is jeito and, like a formula for poison it is harmless unless you know what it means. It is a way or scheme to get around (rather than confront) a problem in Brazil. It can involve exchanging favours or outright bribery. And in Brazil there are a lot of problems. Assume you have arrived in Brazil and want a telephone line. If you approach the local telephone company, its officials will merely laugh. The waiting list is a couple of years long, by which time your posting will have ended. Your options are to keep your sanctity but go without a telephone or, you are told, there is a jeito - you can 'buy' a black market line for about Dollars 3,000. The next problem is to get the service working. Your local telephone company is happy to activate the line - for the payment of a small jeito. But to install the actual telephone, the best jeito is to use a private company, which usually means an off-duty phone engineer. Now comes the tricky bit. The off-duty engineer who installed the telephone is not allowed to link your telephone to the activated line. The only way to get it linked is to call another, on-duty engineer and to pay him a jeito to go off duty momentarily while he overlooks the fact that your line is black market and makes the connection. If this scenario seems unlikely, let's just say it happened to a friend. The jeito operates in almost every field of Brazilian life and often crosses into nepotism or corruption. Those in government dispense jeitos to friends and relatives, helping them find ways around the bureaucracy and to get jobs. Some argue Brazil's entire political system, based on regional alliances, would be paralysed without the flows of favour and patronage between the capital, Brasilia, and the provinces. No one knows how it started. Some say the jeito was travelling below deck when the Portuguese arrived nearly 500 years ago. Others argue it grew up in Brazil, where circumventing colonial law was crucial, given the size of the country and the many weeks it took central government to relay decisions. A third school sees the jeito as a Brazilian cultural icon, a fusion of the Portuguese and west African affinity for compromise. The jeito may appear harmless abroad, from where it can be shrugged off as an endearing, faintly exotic aspect of Brazilian life. And it has many supporters in Brazil who argue it would be a less interesting country if it emulated northern European morality. Even the most sanctimonious foreigner soon learns that jeitos seem less naughty the more they are used. But the time has come to abolish the jeito. This is partly because it is out of date. Since Brazil's return to democracy 10 years ago, the population has been demanding more transparency from public officials. Both the front-running candidates for this year's presidential elections have, for example, had to dump their running mates over allegations that they used one jeito too many for personal profit while members of the senate. But the main reason to ban the jeito is that it, together with high inflation, forms part of a way of life which has corroded Brazil's social fabric for decades. Indeed, one particular jeito can be seen as a leading cause of Brazilian inflation. Successive generations of politicians abrogated their responsibility to control spending and price rises. They did so by, among others, trying to protect wages through the jeito of raising pay in line with inflation indices. As the rise in the indices accelerated, increases in wages and other prices became bigger and more frequent, exacerbating the inflationary mess. In June this year, the monthly inflation rate exceeded 50 per cent. Brazil is now tackling its inflationary legacy. A new currency launched in July, called the Real and linked to the US dollar, has led to a sharp drop in price rises. Much remains to be done, including overhauls of the tax and social security systems. But the start has been made, and Brazil finally appears ready to cast off the stigma of being the last large Latin American economy to bring inflation under control. It will only succeed, however, if it sticks to the difficult task of limiting spending and punishing corruption. It must also refrain from the temptation to get round today's problems by finding another jeito.</p>

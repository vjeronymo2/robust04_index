			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER MEASURE TIES U.S. FUNDS TO AIDS REPORTS  </P> <P> In a move condemned by homosexual activists, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer  (R-Fullerton) introduced legislation Thursday that would bar federal funds to  states that do not require clinics and doctors to confidentially report to  public health officials the names of patients who test positive for the virus  that causes AIDS.  </P> <P> The measure, similar to a defeated California ballot initiative that Dannemeyer  sponsored last year, would also bar distribution of federal public health funds  to states that do not require tracing of sexual partners of those found to be  infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, known as HIV.  </P> <P> The legislation faces tough sledding in the House Energy and Commerce  subcommittee on health and the environment, which is headed by Rep. Henry A.  Waxman (D-Los Angeles). Several congressional aides said Thursday that they  expect no major AIDS legislation to emerge from Congress at least until next  year, and the prospects even then are uncertain because there is no consensus  on what such a bill should include.  </P> <P> At a Capitol press conference, Dannemeyer asserted: "What we are proposing . .  . in this act is nothing more than the procedure our society has traditionally  followed through our history to control a communicable disease.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately for all of us, we have set aside this traditional response, the  cornerstone of which is reportability (of infected patients) to public health  (officials) in confidence, and contact-tracing to control this epidemic in  America."  </P> <P> To support his view, Dannemeyer presented six physicians who represent medical  organizations that advocate mandatory, confidential reporting. Also expressing  support were an official of the Congress of Racial Equality, a black  civil-rights group, and three other Republican congressmen -- Dan Burton of  Indiana, Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia and Norman F. Lent of New York. Lent  is the ranking minority member on the Energy and Commerce Committee and also  serves on the health subcommittee with Dannemeyer and Bliley.  </P> <P> However, the executive director of the nation's oldest homosexual rights  organization immediately condemned Dannemeyer's plan, and Orange County's AIDS  coordinator expressed serious reservations.  </P> <P> "These individuals and organizations are promoting a particular ideological  agenda in the false guise of protecting public health," said Thomas B.  Stoddard, executive director of the New York-based Lambda Legal Defense and  Education Fund.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Measures Called Intimidating  </P> <P> "Mandatory measures frighten and intimidate populations that need to be  encouraged to come forward for help, treatment and information," he added.  "This isn't the subjective opinion of Tom Stoddard, this is the nearly  universal view of the public health community in the United States. I would  point out that doctors are not (necessarily) public health experts."  </P> <P> Penny Weismuller, Orange County's AIDS coordinator, said: "At this point, I  believe . . . that (Dannemeyer's bill) would be a hindrance to us because there  will be many people who will avoid care and treatment until very late in their  illness. . . .  </P> <P> "To the extent that mandatory confidential reporting and the fear of  discrimination . . . keep people from voluntarily entering the (health care)  system early, it will adversely affect our ability to control the epidemic."  </P> <P> In addition to mandating reporting and tracing procedures, Dannemeyer's bill  would also require states receiving federal public health funds to:  </P> <P> * Impose civil and criminal penalties for those who knowingly transmit HIV  through sexual contact, the sharing of hypodermic needles, or the donation of  blood, semen, breast milk or a body organ.  </P> <P> * Institute routine, voluntary testing for HIV at hospitals for couples seeking  marriage licenses and at clinics for family planning, drug abuse, sexually  transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.  </P> <P> * Implement mandatory HIV testing for convicts sentenced to state prison.  </P> <P> At the federal level, the legislation would require the secretary of health and  human services to treat HIV infection as a communicable or sexually transmitted  disease for the purposes of federal law.  </P></p>

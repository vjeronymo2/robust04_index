			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Further Establish Banks' Good Image"] </F>   [Text] Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized in his report to the  14th CPC Congress: "All sectors and businesses should emphasize  the construction of professional ethics, gradually formulate  norms of professional ethics which are appropriate in view of  their own characteristics, and resolutely rectify the erroneous  tendency in various sectors and businesses toward seeking  personal gain through using one's position." In the critical  period of efforts to accelerate the reform of the financial  system so as to meet the demands of the construction of a system  of socialist market economy, the vigorous promoting of the  construction of socialist spiritual civilization in the  financial sector, especially the enhancement of the construction  of banks' professional ethics, the strengthening of the  cohesiveness of the ranks of financial workers, the  encouragement of the valuable spirit of hard pioneering work,  selfless sacrifice, and honesty and self-discipline, and further  establishing banks' good image, is of great significance for  accomplishing the difficult but glorious task given by the state  to the financial sector.    The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have  repeatedly emphasized that in the course of reform and opening  up, it is absolutely necessary to persist in fighting corruption  for a long time. Banks are special enterprises which engage in  the business of money, and the main channels through which  enterprises get funds. Under the current situation where legal  supervision and internal constraining mechanisms are not fully  developed, corruption is also prone to happen and spread in the  financial sector. The big and major embezzlement and  bribe-taking cases revealed recently by the news media have  sounded the alarm for the people: Fighting corruption and  promoting honesty in the financial sector are a difficult and  long-term task in the course of reform and opening up.    As Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out, clean government  construction depends first on education and second, on the legal  system. Focusing on prevention through doing a good job of  carrying out education on banks' professional ethics in an  expeditious manner so as to improve the overall quality of  financial personnel is of especially critical importance. The  existence of a good habit of observing professional ethics and a  strong sense of professional ethics not only affects a person's  code of conduct, but is also the precondition for establishing  banks' good image and improving their reputation.    Currently we must carry out further efforts to establish  banks' good image in society and improve banks' reputation.  Banks' reputation is the basis for banks' survival, and the most  important way to improve banks' reputation is to enhance banks'  self-construction so as to win the trust of enterprises at large  and the social public. We must proceed with the enhancement of  the construction of banks' professional ethics by doing three  things: First, advocate devotion to one's duties,  trustworthiness, self-discipline and self-respect, diligence,  and being responsible; establish the idea of collectivism;  heighten the sense of responsibility and sense of mission on the  part of cadres and workers; and overcome the tendency to be  passive. Second, advocate doing hard and pioneering work, acting  in accordance with the public interest and being honest,  refraining from the pursuit of personal interests, and making  selfless sacrifices; establish the idea of serving the people  whole-heartedly; raise cadres' and workers' conscientiousness in  being honest and exercising self-discipline; restore banks'  "three iron things" (iron funds, iron accounts, and an iron  abacus) reputation; and resist the corruptive and corrosive  effects of money worship, hedonism, and ultraselfishness; and  third, promote the sense of competition and sense of efficiency  entailing an eagerness to carry out reform, explorations, and  creative work; and raise cadres' and workers' enthusiasm for  financial reform.    As should be pointed out, in the course of reform and  opening  up in the past 15 years, most financial institutions have  adhered to the policy of "doing two jobs" and "being tough on  two fronts," and given emphasis to enhancing the work of  educating employees on ideological and political matters and on  professional ethics. Most financial workers are honest, have  self-discipline, are devoted to their duties, work hard, and  provide friendly service, thereby making contributions to the  efforts to manage well the financial work, to promote the  construction of socialist spiritual civilization, and to reform  the financial system. In February this year, three grass-roots  financial units and one employee were gloriously named learning  from Lei Feng advanced groups and one individual, by four  organizations including the CPC Central Propaganda Department  and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League; in  March 33 units and 39 comrades of the financial system were  gloriously named "advanced groups in activities of learning from  Lei Feng" and "advanced individuals in activities of learning  from Lei Feng" respectively by the People's Bank of China and  the Chinese Union of Financial Workers; of the 119 "advanced  individuals of the nation who have acted bravely for a just  cause" commended jointly by the CPC Central Propaganda  Department and the Ministry of Public Security in August, 13  were workers on the financial front; eight comrades of the  financial system were gloriously named "March Eighth red flag  holders of the nation" by the All-China Women's Federation...  These advanced groups and individuals who have been commended  only constitute a small proportion of the advanced models in the  financial system. Over the several years, in addition to  "financial guards" of the "Er Lan type" who fought bad elements  bravely in order to protect the state's and people's property  from being lost when bad elements were robbing banks, the  financial sector has also seen many comrades who, working in the  front line of financial work, are silently making selfless  sacrifices; models of resisting corruption, remaining always  uncorrupted, and honesty and self-discipline; and advanced  groups and individuals who are engaged in hard pioneering work,  who make vigorous efforts to produce improvements, who are eager  to carry out reform, and who conduct bold explorations. Even  amidst the disorder regarding financial discipline in the  previous period, there also emerged a large number of advanced  models who remained sober-minded, who refused to engage in  inter-bank lending in violation of regulations, who did not use  credit funds for trading in real estate and stocks, and who did  a good job of managing well funds, the employees, and  themselves. They are models for us in the financial system and  the elite elements of our financial system.    The current task facing us with regard to financial work is  very difficult and heavy. The Decision of the CPC Central  Committee on Several Issues Relating to the Establishment of a  System of Socialist Market Economy points out that large steps  will be taken to reform the fiscal and taxation, financial,  investment, and planning systems in a coordinated manner. Doing  a good job of carrying out the reform of the financial system  requires a united and stable team of financial cadres and  employees who have a high fighting spirit and high morale, and  calls for the creation of an atmosphere conducive to vigorous  efforts to make improvements, to energetic efforts to pursue  lofty goals, and to bold explorations. Therefore, in conjunction  with implementing the spirit of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC  Central Committee and the National Economic Work Conference,  with studying the third volume of Deng Xiaoping Wenxuan  (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping) and the work of fighting  corruption and promoting clean government, with enhancing  ideological and political work and professional ethics  education, and with implementing the spirit of the recently held  conference of presidents of branches of the People's Bank  nationwide and based on consideration of the actual situation of  financial work, the financial system should publicize the  national advanced models in a big way, so that everyone has  examples to emulate and target entities to catch up with.  Through utilizing the power of examples, promote the activities  of learning from the advanced and of competing in making  contributions in the entire system, so as to stimulate the  fighting spirit, inspire people, heighten morale, enhance the  cohesiveness and centripetal tendency of the financial system as  a whole, and promote further establishing banks' good image,  thereby making the construction of socialist spiritual  civilization in the financial system reach a new level.</p>

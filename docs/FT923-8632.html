			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Abbey National house sales plan has flawed basis, ignores realities and is likely to fuel inflation (7) Sir, Compared with West Germany, France, the US and Switzerland, the UK has an unhealthy proportion of properties in owner occupation. In the last 20 years, the government's stance on home ownership - not to mention its attempt to turn Britain into a nation of speculators in stocks and shares - has been responsible for helping fuel inflation and encouraging a something-for-nothing mentality. Although it is difficult to see an easy short-term answer to the problems in the housing market, a healthy private rented sector is clearly vital to the long-term financial health of the UK. Via the business Expansion Scheme, the government has addressed the supply side of the problem by giving generous tax incentives to encourage private landlords. But there has been little positive action to try and make long-term renting more socially acceptable and via 'right to buy' and 'rent to mortgage schemes', the government still encourages the damaging Thatcherite ethos of home ownership for all - at all costs. Encouraging more people to become capitalists may be a sound ideological concept for a Conservative government - but the long-term effect of this policy can only be the erosion of the work ethic. A nation of Sids may look good on the drawing board - but I have my doubts about what it will do for the balance of payments. Steven Rowe, 63 Curson Street, London W1Y 7PE</p>

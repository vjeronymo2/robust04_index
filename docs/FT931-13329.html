			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Hawks and Handsaws: A few unpalatable facts UNTIL Tuesday, there was not a lot I knew about the European single market. Without exaggeration, the quantity or mass of what I did not know about the European single market was in danger of collapsing, under its own gravity, into a black hole, to go with all the other black holes that astronomers are discovering. On Tuesday, however, there was an FT survey - The European Single Market - which set everything to rights. Wittily and authoritatively, it plugged the black hole of my ignorance with analysis, graphs and matter. One of the articles I enjoyed was a piece by David Marsh that sought to dispel anxieties about life in the new Europe. It was couched in the form of 'assertions' and 'facts.' For example: 'ASSERTION: A Commission directive will oblige fishermen to wear hairnets aboard their boats. FACT: Untrue.' The writer (he happens to be a twin: a fact resonant with disconnectedness) then explained why this was untrue. All that is wanted is strict hygiene conditions at fish-processing plants, including the wearing of head-covers. Similarly, he gave the lie to the assertion that EC regulations require Christmas trees to sport regularly-spaced needles, or that the EC wants to outlaw the dye that gives smoked haddock its 'distinctive golden hue.' All extremely jolly. Not to be outgunned, I decided to employ the astounding resources available to this column in such a way as to put the Marsh formula of assertion and counter-fact to global and cosmological use: ASSERTION: Readiness by the world's central banks, which hold 35,000 tonnes of gold, to sell some of this metal, is a bleak pointer for the gold price, currently rolling drunkenly at around Dollars 330 an ounce. FACT: Untrue. Two months ago I sold Pounds 3,250 worth of gold shares. This important market indicator should loom as large on all graphs as Pheidias's chryselephantine statue of Zeus loomed at Olympia, before its removal to Constantinople, for it signals an imminent recovery in the gold price, perhaps of some magnitude. ASSERTION: Italy's crack-down on the Mafia, plus efforts by the Rome government to control the budget deficit, overhaul the economy, eliminate corruption and initiate constitutional reform, mean that prospects are looking rosy for Europe's most stupid country. FACT: Untrue. Italy cannot be salvaged. The barbarians are at the gate. Book your holiday now, before it disintegrates entirely. ASSERTION: The French are becoming less selfish and more neighbourly. FACT: Untrue. ASSERTION: The arts are not in terminal decay. FACT: Untrue. The arts are all washed up. Good music ended with Rahkmaninov. Picasso had his moments, but no one will ever paint a better picture than Botticelli's Primavera. Literature and architecture are sculling round in circles. From now on, the only worthwhile art will be that produced by computers. ASSERTION: The eclipse of Soviet communism heralded the end of totalitarianism. FACT: Untrue. With world population growth spiralling out of control, nations will indeed coalesce into Orwell's Eurasia, Eastasia and Oceania, with the apparatus of government in each of these blocs shared between the four great ministries of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv and Miniplenty. ASSERTION: Nasa's Seti programme - its Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence - is proving a damp and costly squib. No alien radio transmissions have been detected and none can be expected, because Man is alone in the universe. FACT: Untrue. Nasa has eavesdropped on thousands of alien conversations since Seti's launch last October, but is too terrified to admit it. The reason for Nasa's dread is its discovery that Earth is regarded as the pariah of the galaxy. Reason: Earth is the only planet in the Milky Way on which a warring, cannibalistic, drug-crazed, pig-ignorant and irredeemably criminal species devoted to xenophobic mass killing and the destruction of its own environment has ever reached the summit of the food chain. Anxious to help out, a group of alien civilisations has attempted to provide Earth with better leaders. John Major is a robot. But there are problems with his circuitry. Some of his wires are crossed. These civilisations have fonder hopes of the model installed in the White House this week.</p>

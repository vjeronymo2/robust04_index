			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / 'Bankers shuttle' airline service to be launched in the spring A 'bankers shuttle' airline service between London and Frankfurt is to be launched in the spring, Paul Betts writes. Business Air, a small Aberdeen-based carrier, plans to start operating the shuttle from London City Airport in Docklands with three flights a day using a British Aerospace 146 regional jet. The services are a further boost to the airport, which is trying to establish itself as a business airport with connections to the other European business centres. Since the recent extension of the runway, BAe 146 jet services have been launched this year to destinations including Zurich and Berlin. Mr Ian Woodley, Business Air's managing director, said yesterday that his airline was considering services between Aberdeen and London City.</p>

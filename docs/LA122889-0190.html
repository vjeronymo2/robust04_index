			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FAMILY GROUP ACTS TO SELL 17% OF CAMPBELL'S  </P> <P> A group of Dorrance family members that controls 17.4% of Campbell Soup Co.  said today it is filing notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission to  sell its holdings.  </P> <P> The group said in the filing that it seeks to sell the shares at a price per  share "significantly in excess of current market value."  </P> <P> Campbell's share soared $4.25 to $57.25 after the announcement, indicating that  the market expects the group's move to bolster any attempt to take over the  company.  </P> <P> Camden, N.J.-based Campbell's has been the object of buyout rumors since the  death in April of John Dorrance Jr., a former Campbell chairman who was  dedicated to the 120-year-old company's independence.  </P> <P> Dorrance's three children said a week ago that they were committed to keeping  Campbell's independent. They control 31% of the world's largest soup maker.  </P> <P> In today's filing, the group -- consisting of nephews and nieces of Dorrance --  said it would prefer the sale of its stock to be part of a tax-free  transaction, although it said such a deal would not be a necessity. It also  said it will explore methods of advancing the prospect of such a transaction  and will support others who are likely to advance its objectives.  </P> <P> The group said it will oppose any attempt by the company to block moves that  would push up the stock price.  </P> <P> It said that if the board takes action to oppose a sale at a price the group  believes "reflects fairly the full value of the company," the group will  consider pressing for changes in the board of directors.  </P> <P> The family group making the filing consists of Dorrance Hamilton and Samuel  Hamilton, Hope van Beuren and John van Beuren, Diana Norris and Charles Norris  Jr.  </P> <P> Dorrance Hamilton is a member of Campbell's board. John van Beuren and Charles  Norris were trustees of Campbell's recently dissolved major shareholders voting  trust, which represented about 27% of Campbell's outstanding shares, including  those owned by the family group making the filing.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kenichiro Hirano] </F>   [Text] Manila, 19 Jun -- A plan for a "Southeast Asian  Community" [SAC] consisting of 10 nations -- the six ASEAN  member states plus Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma -- is  beginning to take shape. According to a copy of the written  agreement of these 10 Southeast Asian countries on an unofficial  meeting (held in Manila in late May) obtained by NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN's Manila Bureau, this was the first time the promotion  of regional integration similar to the European Union (EU)  through the early membership of Vietnam and the three other  countries in ASEAN, and political cooperation, has been written  into a formal document.    While the meeting was an unofficial one, participants  included senior government officials acting as personal  representatives of each nation's leader, and academicians. The  fact that a blueprint for the region's future has been clearly  stated in an agreement is considered highly significant.    The preamble of this document entitled "A Vision for  Southeast Asia After the Year 2000," which was signed by  representatives of the 10 nations, points out that: "Southeast  Asia is one single community. In the 21st Century, this  community will play a major political, economic, cultural and  moral role." It argues strongly for the need to strengthen  regionalism in Southeast Asia, modelled after the EU.    The basic principles affirmed for the "Southeast Asian  Community" concept are: 1) national and regional resilience; 2)  harmony in diversity; 3) common national interests; and 4) open  regionalism. At the same time, a multifaceted strategy is deemed  necessary to realize the community. In the political and  security aspect, the strengthening of bilateral relations  between the 10 Southeast Asian countries, membership of the  three Indochinese states and Burma in the Southeast Asian Treaty  of Friendship and Cooperation (Bali Treaty, signed in 1976) and  ASEAN, and their participation in the ASEAN regional forum are  also sought.    In terms of economics and technology, the document seeks to  advance the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA),  and the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) to the year  2000, and proposes the promotion of various forms of social and  cultural cooperation, such as encouraging personnel traffic, and  launching an ASEAN satellite.    To materialize the "Southeast Asian Community" concept, the  document suggests the following steps: early convening of a  summit meeting of the 10 nations, taking the initiative to  create a consensus among the 10 nations on lasting peace in  Cambodia and the Nansha [Spratly] Islands issue, joint  management of borders between the 10 nations, and assistance to  the Mekong River Valley development project.    The 10 Southeast Asian nations plan to hold their second  unofficial meeting in Bangkok before the end of 1994. While the  materialization of the Southeast Asian community concept "will  be a slow process taking 20 to 25 years," (according to  Philippine President Fidel Ramos), a summit meeting may add  momentum to the process.</p>

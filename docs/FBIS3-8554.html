Janos Deak, commander and  chief-of-staff of the Hungarian Army, told a press conference in  Bucharest today. Deak has been the head of a delegation to  Bucharest since Sunday.    This is one of the regular official meetings between the two  armies, Deak added. Lieut.-Gen. Dumitru Cioflina, Romanian  chief- of-staff and Deak's host, led a delegation to Hungary in  1992. Since then several other meetings have taken place at the  level of generals and troop officers.    The Hungarian delegation held talks with Cioflina and  visited  an artillery unit in Ploesti. Gheorghe Tinca, inaugurated as  defence minister on Tuesday, is to meet the delegation today.  The commander of the Hungarian Army said that the change in  Romania's defence leadership would not effect the presently  fair, unbroken and wide- ranging cooperation between the staffs  and units of the two armies, which has been capped by the "Open  Skies" agreement.    The discussions touched upon possible cooperation within the  framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace scheme, which both  countries have supported, Deak said.    The Romanian partners provided in-depth information  concerning the ongoing transformation of Romanian armed forces,  including the forthcoming withdrawal of tactical and operational  missiles, which the Hungarian delegation welcomed.</p>

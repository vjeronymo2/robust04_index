			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Henlys switches broker HENLYS GROUP has changed its stockbroker, two days after becoming the subject of a Pounds 27.1m hostile takeover bid from rival motor dealer T Cowie. Mr Robert Wood, Henlys' chief executive, said he had switched from Hoare Govett because 35 redundancies at the broker, following its recent takeover by ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, had left it 'short on overall resources.' Henlys has gone to Panmure Gordon, which took on five corporate finance staff from Hoare Govett, including the three most familiar with Henlys. Mr Wood said he wanted to work with people he knew and who were familiar with the company in what was likely to be a tough takeover battle. Henlys had two banks as advisers, Charterhouse and Hill Samuel, and had decided that Charterhouse would conduct its defence. T Cowie has agreed to buy Walker Jackson, the main Ford dealer in Swindon, for an undisclosed sum.</p>

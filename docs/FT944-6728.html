			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (12): Keen for competition / Profile of Atlas Group When, more than four decades ago, a young reporter with leftist leanings resigned from his job in protest after his editor was arrested in an anti-left clampdown, he began a journey which has made him one of Pakistan's most successful businessmen. Mr Yusuf Shirazi, chairman of the Karachi-based Atlas group which owns seven companies listed on the stock market, now wants his country to make a similar sharp turn around away from years of government-backed industrial growth to one driven by its own competitive edge. He is convinced that Pakistan's acceptance of International Monetary Fund conditionalities and the government's decision to reduce tariffs in line with the new global trade agreement, will force businesses to prepare for stronger international competition - 'the entrepreneurialism should now begin, led by competitiveness, rather than state subsidy. Only the fittest will survive,' he says. Mr Shirazi claims that Atlas group has succeeded in keeping up with changing times. Starting with an initial investment of Rs500,000 in 1962, Atlas has now emerged as one of the leading companies on Pakistan's business horizon. Some of its more visible interests include insurance, investment banking and leasing, as well as a Honda car plant which opened this year in Lahore, a Honda motor-cycle factory, an engineering spares company and a vehicle battery production plant. Results for its listed companies last year saw profits rise to Rs437.5m and paid-up capital at Rs1.1bn (Dollars 35m). Fixed assets stood at Rs5bn (Dollars 160m) and sales reached Rs8bn (Dollars 255m). Earnings per share for the entire group were Rs4.37, or roughly 40 per cent of paid-up capital. On the back of that success, the group's plans include exporting motorcycles to Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Ghana and the Middle East. The Atlas investment bank and leasing companies are also examining prospects for opening branches in the UK, Middle East and south-east Asia. Mr Shirazi concedes, however, that doing business is not always easy. Policies pursued by successive Pakistani governments, for example, exempted from tax under-developed parts of the country, giving these areas large incentives to encourage industrial growth. This placed areas of developed industry at a severe disadvantage, denting profit margins. Mr Shirazi also criticises the taxation system - he is well placed to do so, having served as a tax official for almost eight years). One of the biggest problems faced by many businesses is the growing practice of deducting tax at source, rather than allowing businesses to pay at the end of the year, he says. As a result, the system is abused with some employees of the tax department allegedly demanding up to 38 per cent of the refunds in bribes. Mr Shirazi retains a strong belief in Pakistan's future, even if some problems make the country look 'unpromising' in the short term.</p>

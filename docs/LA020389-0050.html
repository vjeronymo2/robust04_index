			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  TRAILERS OFFERED TO CITY FOR HOMELESS  </P> <P> Santa Monica may receive 10 trailers to serve as shelters for homeless people  -- if officials can find a place to park them.  </P> <P> Santa Monica City Councilman David Finkel said the trailers will be supplied by  Los Angeles, which acquired the portable shelters last year but ran into  neighborhood opposition in trying to place them.  </P> <P> Finkel said he anticipates similar resistance once Santa Monica pinpoints a  place for the trailers.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he said the plan represents a "wonderful opportunity" for the  city to help the homeless, including some of the transients who live in  Palisades Park.  </P> <P> Members of the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce are helping Finkel in his  search for a site where the trailers can be parked.  </P></p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (8): Madrid investors pack flights to Rabat - Relations with Spain SPANISH interest in Morocco may be measured by the fact that business class passengers often outnumber those travelling economy on Iberia's usually packed daily Madrid-Rabat flight. Mr Alvaro Renfigo, the commercial attache at the Spanish embassy in Rabat, knows all about the extra space that the airline has had to set aside for Morocco-bound business people. At least 1,000 Spanish executives have passed through his overstretched department so far this year and more than 400 have made appointments to see him. Mr Renfigo says he faces an 'avalanche' of potential Spanish investors in Morocco. The Spanish press regularly reports travellers, in just as many numbers, moving in the opposite direction and under very different conditions. Hardly a day goes by without a news story of illegal immigrants being arrested on arrival from Morocco aboard tiny fishing smacks. Frequently, the news is of bodies washed up on on a southern Spanish beach in the vicinity of Gibraltar. The Mediterranean 'wetback' saga has all the elements of a North-South drama, mixing exploitation and futility. The Madrid-Rabat flights, which are not nearly so fully reported, tell a tale of intriguing dollar-laden developments shaped by enterprise and focused on a clear future plan. Over the past four years, direct Spanish investment in Morocco has moved between the Dollars 40m posted in 1990 to the Dollars 100m forecast for this year. Direct investment already topped the Dollars 100m mark in 1991, largely due to the outlay that year by the Insituto Nacional de Industria, Spain's public sector holding, in Morocco's Fosbucraa phosphate group and it will be back to the Dollars 100m level this year, having slipped to Dollars 40m again in 1992, thanks in part to a recent investment by Banco Central Hispano (BCH), Spain's largest private bank, in Banque Commerciale du Maroc. These figures should be compared with those of the second half of the 1980s when direct Spanish investment in Morocco was in the Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m range. Spain's business invasion of Morocco is comparable only to the one it is waging in Portugal. What is most revealing is that new investment by Spain in Morocco has now outstripped that by France. Whereas French finance entering Morocco is mostly aimed at consolidating existing positions, Spanish capital is fresh and acquisitive. By Mr Renfigo's reckoning, the evidence of Spain's investment drive is to be found in more than 500 Moroccan companies which now have Spanish partners. Madrid's stamp on Morocco has been emphasised by the trickle-down effect of a 1991 bilateral friendship agreement that has lured major Spanish companies into big Moroccan civil engineering projects on the back of soft credit lines worth Dollars 70-80m a year. Meanwhile, it is estimated that this year Spain's quota of Morocco's foreign trade will rise from 8 to 12 per cent while France's will fall from 23 to 21 per cent. Mr Alfonso de Pedro, the representative of the savings bank Caja de Madrid in Casablanca, echoes a widely shared opinion among the expatriate Spanish business community when he claims there is a specific local interest in 'redressing the French weighting in the Moroccan economy'. In the main, Spanish business finds itself on familiar territory in Morocco. The present state of Morocco's development, as well as its regulatory environment, is not unlike that of Spain in the 1950s and 1960s. There are similarities in the bid to have foreign investment fuel a great leap forward. Mr de Pedro is at present building up a consultancy and venture capital business on behalf of Caja de Madrid and in partnership with Banque Commerciale du Maroc. He has recently given the green light to five investment projects that deal mostly with hotel, hypermarket and office developments and he has a further 12 under study, encompassing potential businesses in the agriculture and textile sectors. Spanish investment falls broadly under two groups. The first seeks a low cost production base for goods aimed at the Spanish and the European markets, while the second is looking for openings in the domestic Moroccan market. The two investment models are present in most sectors. Spanish agricultural groups are developing strawberry plantations south of Larache which will get the first crops of the fruit across to Northern Europe before Christmas, two to three months ahead of the early strawberry harvests in southern Spain. Other groups, in contrast, have imported Spanish rice transformation technology to supply the Moroccan market with improved and competitive products. In the textile sector the Madrid-based Cortefiel group has begun manufacturing in Morocco in order to supply its large retail network in Spain. Algodoneras San Antonio, the denim material producer, one of the prestige Spanish investments in Morocco, has however ignored the cheap labour possibilities and established a highly automated plant which services the local clothing industries. The clearest indicator to date of the potential of Spanish investment in Morocco came in July when Banco Central Hispano invested Dollars 43.3m to raise its equity in Banque Commerciale du Maroc from 5 to 20 per cent and a further Dollars 6.9m to acquire 2.5 per cent of ONA, the Moroccan financial holding group that also owns 20 per cent of Banque Commerciale du Maroc. The Spanish bank's new relationship with ONA, and its joint interest with the financial holding in Banque Commerciale du Maroc, will allow the strategic penetration of Morocco by the wide-ranging industrial interests that come under Central Hispano's umbrella. Some Central Hispano companies, such as the construction firm Dragados, are already well installed in Morocco but others, such as those in the energy, the agribusiness and the communications sectors will assuredly soon be booking their executives onto the Madrid-Rabat flight.</p>

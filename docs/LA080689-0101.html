			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTLOOSE: TORONTO CHANGES LIFE STYLE  </P> <P> This vibrant, cosmopolitan city was once known as "Toronto the Good."  </P> <P> Founded in the 17th Century by French fur traders who lost it to Britain with  the fall of New France in the next century, it was christened "York" and soon  after was nicknamed "Muddy York" because of its swamplike terrain.  </P> <P> While Montreal and Quebec City tripped lightly along with their Gallic ways,  Anglo-Saxon Toronto became so conservative that department stores not only  didn't open on Sundays, they drew curtains over their windows so that righteous  citizens wouldn't be tempted by earthly cravings on the Sabbath.  </P> <P> And so it went until the end of World War II when Toronto, which had been 80%  Anglo-Saxon, suddenly experienced an influx of immigrants who brought new life  styles and cultures from throughout the world.  </P> <P> Getting here: Fly Air Canada, Wardair American, Northwest, Eastern or Canadian  International.  </P> <P> How long/how much? Three days should do it, unless you want to make forays into  other interesting towns and regions of Ontario. Lodging and dining prices are  moderate for a big city.  </P> <P> A few fast facts: Canada's dollar was recently worth 85 cents U.S., a plus for  American visitors. Visit any time between late spring and late fall. For winter  visits, bring a parka.  </P> <P> Getting settled: Venture Inn (89 Avenue Road; $77-$82 double B&amp;B) sits  downtown in the trendy Yorkville area. It's a nondescript modern building but  comfortable and a real value. Inside decor is Early American, with bedrooms  featuring huge maple beds, excellent baths and lobby hutches, giving it a  country feeling. Breakfast only.  </P> <P> The Windsor Arms (22 St. Thomas St.; $89-$153 double) has been our Toronto  favorite, resembling a vine-covered English country manor with a very clublike  interior. The antiques are real, the feeling warm.  </P> <P> Dining facilities at Windsor Arms are known collectively as Three Small Rooms,  which give you a choice of grills or more fancy fare to go with a superb wine  selection. Windsor Arms, a step from Toronto's finest shopping, is a member of  the worldwide Relais &amp; Chateaux group of hotels.  </P> <P> The Westbury (475 Yonge St.; $89-$119 double) also is near the center of  things. It's a large and lively place with good dining and most of the big city  hotel amenities. Bedrooms are bright and comfortable, lots of business types in  residence.  </P> <P> Regional food and drink: Although their city is without its own recognizable  cuisine, Toronto natives are justifiably proud of its restaurants. The reason  is that they have the best of the world's foods right at home, and the dining  business continues to boom.  </P> <P> The streets of Yorkville are chock-a-block with chic restaurants. Danford  Avenue looks like a linear version of Athens' Plaka with its Greek cafes and  tavernas. You'll also find Szechuan, Thai, French, Indian tandoori and Tony  Roma's ribs. And Canadian beer is super.  </P> <P> Good dining: Centro (2472 Yonge St.) in little more than a year has carved a  reputation for turning out an upscale, imaginative northern Italian menu. It is  bright, cheerful and contemporary.  </P> <P> Try the Tuscan white-bean soup with sun-dried tomato and eggplant relish, or  the penne with tomatoes, basil, olives and roasted chiles.  </P> <P> Main courses such as grilled veal chop with sage aioli (sage-flavored  mayonnaise), fried artichokes and pepper squash fall in the $14 to $18 range.  Hot appetizers and pastas go for about $7.  </P> <P> Bangkok Garden (18 Elm St.) is the most beautiful Thai restaurant we've seen.  Elaborate use of wood, slate, brass, green plants and ponds create a truly  opulent and serene setting.  </P> <P> As curries are a Thai staple and to get them right takes a bit of doing,  Bangkok Garden flies the curry paste and other exotic seasonings in from  Thailand. Each dish carries a five-level, scale-of-heat symbol as a warning to  diners, level four being described as a "raging fire," level five for  "masochists only."  </P> <P> An eight-page menu takes you through many of Thailand's finest dishes. The Gang  Kiaw Waan Gai curried chicken kicks in with a five-alarm rating on the first  bite.  </P> <P> Bellair Cafe (100 Cumberland St.) stands in the middle of Yorkville and is the  chic stop for Toronto's beautiful people at lunch or dinner.  </P> <P> Decor is minimal, with dramatic contemporary art on stark white walls. You can  dine on a terrace in good weather. A menu offers sage-Brie fritters with a plum  conserve, salad of grilled chicken with pancetta and chives vinaigrette,  fuselli with crab meat and asparagus in a light dill cream.  </P> <P> Going first-class: The King Edward (37 King St. East; $183-$242 double) is a  deluxe hotel. A traditional facade and elegant lobby give way to more  contemporary bedrooms with every possible comfort and amenity. Dine beneath  baroque ceilings and the pastel surroundings of Cafe Victoria any time of day,  or more formally in Chiaro's for dinners of French cuisine and fine wines.  </P> <P> On your own: Toronto is a city of ethnic enclaves, each with its own color and  character. Try to visit Little Italy ("Moonstruck" was filmed there), which  centers around St. Clair Avenue West. Chinatown, Kensington Market near the  Portuguese neighborhood and Cabbagetown (Victorian-Gothic architecture and very  gentrified) are all worthy of your time.  </P> <P> Many visitors head for the Eaton Centre arcade to shop or dine in one of  Toronto's major tourist attractions. It's enormous and even has a waterfall to  delight strollers. The Toronto underground is the world's largest subterranean  complex of stores and restaurants, a weatherproof city where the temperature  never falls below 70 degrees.  </P> <P> The Art Gallery of Ontario has a respectable collection of works by Renoir,  Rembrandt, Monet, Van Gogh and Picasso, with sculptures by Degas, Rodin,  Matisse and the largest Henry Moore collection anywhere.  </P> <P> Drive or take public transportation to nearby Kleinburg for a visit to the  McMichael Canadian Collection, built around the landscape paintings of Canada's  Group of Seven artists. In this beautiful log-and-fieldstone gallery you'll  also find exhibits of Canadian Indian art, masks and giant totems. You may also  have lunch in the gallery.  </P> <P> For more information: Call the Ontario Ministry of Tourism at (213) 622-4302,  or write to 700 S.

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / A critical naira adds to Lagos transition woes: Exchange rate strategy is called into question IF THE results of Nigeria's weekly foreign exchange auctions were expressed as medical bulletins, the condition of the naira would be described as critical and consultants summoned to the bedside. Exchange rate management is the acid test of the credibility - and competence - of the Transitional Council appointed at the end of last year by President Ibrahim Babangida to govern the country until an elected president takes over on August 28. After the 40 per cent devaluation of the naira a year ago, Nigeria's central bank maintained a stable official exchange rate, pumping an average of Dollars 120m into the market weekly at an average rate of N19 to the dollar. By December there were signs that this strategy was in trouble. Not only had the country's gross foreign reserves fallen from Dollars 3.7bn in August 1992, to little more than Dollars 1bn, reflecting the debt buy-back operation with the London Club of commercial banks as well as the cost of supporting the naira, but the gap between the official and bureau-de-change rates had widened to 20 per cent from 5 per cent in mid-year. Only one auction was held during December and by the time sales resumed on January 12, the rate had slipped to N20.5 to the dollar while demand had increased to more than Dollars 200m a week. After two January sales, the central bank, blaming the delayed presentation of the budget, cancelled weekly auctions until mid-February while also delaying the delivery of dollars to buyers at the two January sales for nearly three weeks, ostensibly to allow time for it to scrutinise import documentation submitted by the banks. Then astonishingly, given mounting demand pressures, the central bank opted for a Dutch auction system at the February 18 sale. It supplied Dollars 80m in the face of demands for Dollars 337m, with the result that only 17 of the 80 participating banks were successful, and the auction rate fell from N20.55 in January to N24.99 to the dollar, while in the parallel market the 'free rate' declined to N27.60. A week later the central bank again cancelled the auction, describing bank bids of between N31 and N33 as 'outrageous'. At last week's and yesterday's auctions the rate was pegged at N24.99, but with demand of more than Dollars 720m and the central bank selling just Dollars 150m, the banks received only 21 per cent of their requirements. Chief Ernest Shonekan, leader of the Transitional Council, is being told - in the very bluntest terms - by his many supporters in the business community that this is not what they expected from a 'businessman's government'. In the words of one, the Abuja economic summit 'dream' has, within a few weeks, become a nightmare. With virtually no room for manoeuvre, the TC will find it difficult to satisfy its supporters. There is simply no quick fix solution to the overhang of liquidity from last year's 56 per cent increase in the money supply, while any attempt to peg the exchange rate is destined to fail as the premium widens in the parallel market, where the rate is now N35 to the dollar - a 36 per cent gap against the official rate. Some bankers believe that a further tranche of stabilisation securities that takes another N7bn or N8bn out of the market would stabilise the rate around N30 to the dollar. But the combination of escalating inflation - unofficially put at 60 per cent and rising - higher interest rates, the already-programmed interruption to imports and the planned phasing out of the petroleum subsidy, will have a devastating impact on the economy and potentially on the political transition due to culminate in presidential elections in June. As the soon to retire President Bagangida told the Abuja economic summit last month: 'It is a rare feat for a country to make a successful transition to democracy with a declining economy'.</p>

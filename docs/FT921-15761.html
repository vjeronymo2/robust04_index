			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / PLO backs peace talks after UN resolution THE Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday that following a final round of consultations with its Arab allies it would give the go-ahead for the resumption of Middle East peace talks in Washington later this week. The Palestinians, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon had suspended their departure for Washington in protest at Israel's decision to expel 12 Palestinians from the occupied territories, an action that was unanimously condemned by the UN Security Council on Monday night. The other Arab delegations said last night they would leave for Washington in two days. Israel's delegation has been in Washington since Monday. 'The Security Council has saved the peace process, and we can only express our appreciation of its efforts and those of all the countries which contributed (to the decision),' Mr Ahmed Abderrahman, the PLO spokesman, said in Tunis. The UN resolution condemning Israel's plans to expel 12 Palestinians drew harsh criticism in Jerusalem. Israel said it was set to go ahead with the expulsion plans, despite the worldwide condemnation. Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, had announced the expulsions last week following the murder of a Jewish settler in the occupied territories, the fourth to be killed there since Middle East peace talks opened in Madrid in October. 'We are very disappointed by the unjust and one-sided decision of the Security Council. It ignores completely the acts of murder against Israeli citizens,' said Mr Ehud Gol, spokesman to Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister. The UN security council resolution, which received full US backing, was passed by a vote of 15-0. The 12 Palestinians ordered expelled by Israel - most of them relatively unknown - are suspected of activism in Palestinian nationalist organisations. Israel has expelled 66 Arabs since the start of the Palestinian uprising in 1987. Mr Shimon Peres, leader of the opposition Labour party, hinted yesterday that the timing of the move had been inappropriate. 'They should have considered very carefully whether the expulsions were appropriate at this time and whether they would in fact achieve their aims,' he said. Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian and wounded 20 in Gaza yesterday in a clash with hundreds of youngsters protesting at Israel's decision to expel the 12 Palestinian activists, Palestinian sources said, Reuter writes from Jerusalem.</p>

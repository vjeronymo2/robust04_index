			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- To further arouse the  enthusiasm of people of all nationalities throughout the country  in promoting reform, opening up, and the construction of  socialism for better fulfillment of the various tasks forwarded  by the 14th CPC National Congress, the State Council has decided  to hold a rally on the eve of "1 May," international Labor Day,  1995 to commend national model and advanced workers who have  made outstanding contributions in various fields and fronts amid  reform and construction. The State Council issued a circular to  this effect today to the people's governments of various  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under  the central government; and various ministries, commissions, and  organs directly under the State Council.    According to the State Council circular, 3,000 national  model  and advanced workers will be commended, covering workers,  peasants, professionals, technicians, management personnel,  government workers, and others who have made outstanding  contributions toward reform, opening up, economic construction,  industrial and agricultural production, and various social  undertakings since 1989.    The circular stated that the State Council has decided to  form the National Model and Advanced Workers Recognition Rally  Organizing Committee to lead preparations for the occasion, with  Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general of the State  Council, as chairman and the following as vice chairmen: Zhang  Dinghua, vice president of the All-China Federation of Trade  Unions and first secretary of its secretariat; Song Defu,  personnel minister; Li Boyong, labor minister; Wang Zhongyu,  minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission;  Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State Education  Commission; Zhu Lilan, vice minister in charge of the State  Science and Technology Commission; Liu Jiang, agriculture  minister; Hu Guangbao, deputy director of the CPC Central  Committee General Office; and Li Shuwen, deputy secretary  general of the State Council. An organizing committee office  will be set up with Li Shuwen, deputy secretary general of the  State Council, serving concurrently as director.    The State Council circular pointed out that selecting and  commending national model and advanced workers will be a major  event in the political lives of the Chinese people of all  nationalities. To ensure success, the people's governments of  various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities  directly under the central government as well as relevant  departments must strengthen leadership and be conscientious in  organizing the recognition rally. Grass-root level and front  lines of economic construction will be the main focus for  selecting national model workers and advanced work personnel.  Advanced figures known for their persistence in upholding the  party's basic line, in consistently working hard without being  upset by criticism, and in promoting reform with new creations  and outstanding deeds should be selected. Minority women and  people should be selected according to fixed proportions.  Through selection activities, we should widely publicize the  exemplary deeds and lofty spirit of advanced individuals from  various trades and professions, in a bid to mobilize the broad  masses to take them as example when striving for new success in  reform, opening up, and modernization drive.    Meanwhile, the National Model and Advanced Workers  Recognition Rally Organizing Committee held its first meeting in  the afternoon of 27 April, presided over by its chairman, Luo  Gan.</p>

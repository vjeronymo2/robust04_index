			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Triple aim within Matra's European target - The French group is pinning its recovery hopes on a shift in strategy MR FREDERIC d'Allest, the chief executive of Matra, wants to accelerate what he calls the 'Europeanisation' of the French diversified missiles and electronics group while focusing it on three principal core businesses. 'We are no longer looking for diversification. Indeed, we intend to sell some of the business moves made in the past which no longer fit with our strategy,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Matra was originally exclusively a defence group specialising in missiles to equip essentially French Dassault military aircraft. It embarked on a sweeping diversification programme in the 1970s which turned it into a defence to watches, electronics and cars conglomerate. Mr d'Allest now wants the group to concentrate on the three sectors in which it has gained a leading market position: defence and space; telecommunications; transport systems and the Espace family vans it has pioneered in Europe with Renault. He confirmed Matra intended to withdraw from the electronics car components business by selling its 35 per cent stake in Ufima, the loss-making joint venture 65 per cent controlled by the Italian Fiat group. The French company is also looking for a new partner to join its telecommunications activities, whose heavy development costs led it to show a loss in the first half of last year. Mr d'Allest said Matra was particularly anxious to negotiate alliances to strengthen activities in the development of equipment for a pan-European digital mobile telephone network. Matra wants to expand its telecommunications activities in Europe. But Europe has also become the prime target, together with the Far East, of the company's traditional defence business. Defence still accounts for a quarter of annual sales of nearly FFr25bn (Dollars 4.6bn). However, Matra has had to contend with a reduction in French government defence spending and a shrinking market for Dassault military aircraft. 'Our strategy is to look for alliances which will strengthen our market access. Our traditional markets have been France and the Middle East. Now we want to be more active in Europe and in the Pacific Rim,' Mr d'Allest explained. The Matra chief executive believed the missiles business would grow in Europe because the market for new fighters would become tighter, putting greater pressure on refitting existing aircraft with more sophisticated weapons. Mr d'Allest is opposed to suggestions that Matra's missiles activities be merged with those of Aerospatiale, the state-owned aerospace group, as part of a rationalisation of the French aerospace sector. 'This would not provide us with access to new markets and I don't see it improving productivity significantly,' he said. Instead, Matra hopes to expand its market base by co-operating with defence companies in other European countries. It has already formed close links with GEC, and is competing with the UK company for the Ministry of Defence's contract for short-range, air-to-air missiles. The satellite space business is another area of growth for Matra. Mr d'Allest, the former head of the European Ariane space consortium, confirmed talks to link British Aerospace's space activities with those of the recently-constituted Matra-Marconi Space joint venture between the French company and GEC. Matra is also negotiating with Robert Bosch of Germany to join the new space company. One of Matra's biggest recent success stories has been the development of the Espace family van with Renault. Matra is currently producing 300 vans a day and in a depressed car market has seen Espace sales increase by 20 per cent last year. Matra's current agreement with Renault runs until the middle 1990s. But the company has already agreed with the French state-owned car-maker to design and produce a new generation of car later in the decade. Mr d'Allest said Matra also wanted to address other car market segments. 'We are looking for one or two other niches,' he added. Matra's car operations are currently the most profitable component of the group and account for about 20 per cent of total turnover. In the mass transit sector, Matra has a strong position with its Val automated urban rail system which the company developed from aerospace-derived engineering. However, the Val has not been profitable up to now although it has sold in France, the US and Taiwan. Mr d'Allest said the Val business broke even last year but Matra is now looking for a more sustained level of profitability from this sector. At the same time, the company is seeking to develop alliances with civil engineering groups to make the Val more profitable. After a difficult 12 months, Matra expects to see profits recover this year. Operating profits fell from FFr719m to FFr 317m in the first half of 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 110 (600): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] Sergey Tereshchenko's government will receive "a  carte blanche" from the head of the state for the near 15 months  to implement a tough program of anti-crisis measures, President  Nursultan Nazarbayev declared to the parliament Friday and  stressed that he does not support the demand of the deputies  corps on the Cabinet's resignation.    IF Note: Late May the Kazakh parliament voiced a statement  on non-confidence in the social-economic and legal policy of the  government. The document said that while declaring the course  for the market economy, the Cabinet actually blocks it and this  has resulted in an economic chaos in Kazakhstan. The Supreme  Soviet also believes that until now the government failed to  work out a national program for consolidation of the society.  Commenting the demarche of the Supreme Soviet in his interview  with INTERFAX, head of the Cabinet called the parliament's  statement "unconstitutional." He emphasized that in accordance  with the Constitution, the government is responsible only in the  face of the president.    Nazarbayev reported to deputies that in the near term he  intends to confirm a renewed program of anti-crisis measures  prepared by the government.    He said that the country confronts the hardest economic and  social crisis. In his opinion, reformation of the credit and  bank system is the major direction which will ensure an optimal  development of the economy, "stoppage of the running inflation  and strengthening of the national currency" is the key task of  the present moment.    Nazarbayev underlined that inflation should not exceed 10  pct  a month in order the state could implement its investment  policy. He deems it possible to lower inflation rate this  autumn to 9-10 percent under a tough credit policy.    According to available information, inflation rate in  Kazakhstan this March was 17 percent and in April it raised to  31 percent.    Nazarbayev insists to reduce all expenditures of the state  "excluding the vitally important ones," to stop direct and  indirect donations to the enterprises. He believes that it is  necessary to recognize bankrupts the republic's unprofitable  enterprises and to speed up privatization process.    In his opinion, it is also necessary to release prices for  all kinds of goods and services and for bread.    "The budget should be tough in implementation," Nazarbayev  underlined.    Nazarbayev commissioned the government to prepare a special  program to stop migration from Kazakhstan due to national  reasons. As he said, it is necessary to adopt a new decree on  languages and to revise the status of the Russian language (in  Kazakhstan it is the language for inter-ethnic association but  not the second state language), and to remove drawbacks in the  staff policy.    As Nazarbayev said, the issue on citizenship is as pressing  as before. He thinks that it is necessary to remove all  restrictions for citizenship in case of a transfer from one  country to another one.    At the same time he reiterated that the dual citizenship is  unacceptable for Kazakhstan because its introduction can make  inter-ethnic relations in Kazakhstan more difficult.    Speaking about his idea to create the Euro-Asian Union,  Nazarbayev pointed out that he deems it necessary to transform  the CIS into a more efficient association -- "from an old form  of integration to a qualitatively new union." He indicated that  all peoples of CIS countries strive for this but the political  elite prevents integration.    Nazarbayev believes that the Euro-Asian Union will assist in  surmounting the economic crisis and will become the guarantor of  outer security for the members of the union against the  background of instability on CIS southern boundaries.    Nazarbayev specially emphasized that cessation of  hostilities  between members of the union and creation of common peacekeeping  forces are among obligatory conditions providing for entering  the Euro-Asian union.    Nazarbayev proposed to create a coalition of reforms  supporters which will unite all branches of power and  public-political movements. Nazarbayev emphasized that it is  necessary to create an atmosphere of stability and national and  civil accord in order to implement the scheduled reforms.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Danish budget to bolster jobs THE Danish government yesterday presented the most expansive budget in decades in an attempt to shave a percentage point off the unemployment rate of 12.1 per cent by the end of next year. The draft 1994 budget will pump an extra DKr12bn (Pounds 1.1bn), equivalent to about 1.4 per cent of 1993 GDP, into the economy through a combination of tax cuts and increased expenditure. The government predicts its fiscal policy will contribute to an increase in real GDP of 2.9 per cent in 1994, compared with growth of only 0.2 per cent this year. But the move will boost inflation, according to forecasts, with the average rise in consumer prices increasing from 1.3 per cent in 1993 to 3 per cent next year. Mr Mogens Lykketoft, Social Democratic finance minister in the centre-left coalition, said the budget represented 'a responsible policy'. The government of Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was determined to cut unemployment. Mr Lykketoft, who was presenting his first budget to the media yesterday (the Folketing does not reassemble until October), described the easing of fiscal policy as 'temporary'. 'Under no circumstances will we start out on a slide which can put the surplus on the current balance of payments in danger or threaten the stability of the exchange rate,' he said. The current account returned to surplus in 1990 after 26 consecutive years of deficit. The estimated surplus of DKr27bn this year equals 3.1 per cent of GDP. Referring to the importance of lower interest rates to stimulate employment, Mr Lykketoft called for a return to a stable monetary system in Europe following the recent chaos in the European exchange rate mechanism. Private consumption next year is expected by the government to increase by 3.9 per cent and business investment, which has declined for three consecutive years, by 6.5 per cent. The government hopes this will bring unemployment down for the first time since 1986 from a 1993 average of 12.1 per cent, up from 11.1 per cent last year. The stimulus elements of the budget package arise from a cut in net taxes and social insurance revenue by DKr6bn, including a reduction of DKr19.3bn in income taxes, following reform which went through the Folketing this summer. New expenditure of DKr6.3bn includes DKr3bn for infrastructure investments. Total budget expenditure will increase by 7 per cent to DKr388.9bn from DKr363.3bn this year, while revenue will increase by 8 per cent to DKr333.2bn from DKr307.5bn, leaving the deficit virtually unchanged at DKr55.7bn, about 6 per cent of GDP. The total government sector financial deficit, including local government, is increasing, rising from 22.1 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 38.2 per cent this year and a government-forecast 44.6 per cent of GDP in 1994.</p>

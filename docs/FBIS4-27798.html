			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in three installments by editorial staff writer </F> Hiroyuki Kubo: "The Heisei Era's Big Derangement"]  <H5>  [28 Apr 94 Evening Edition p 1] </H5>   [Excerpts] "Now we have had more than enough of this."  Since Prime Minister Hosokawa resigned a half month ago, there  have been a series of events such as the nomination of new Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata to succeed him, the secession of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition  regime, and then the formation of a minority ruling coalition  cabinet. Gradually, the people in the spectators' seats are  beginning to raise boos at this slapstick play. Yet I would like  to advise the spectators not to take their eyes off the  "reality" now unfolding under their noses. This is because the  slapstick play, when viewed from a different angle, may  unexpectedly remind them of Wagner's opera The Ring of  the Nibelung whose performance takes as long as four days.    For example, in this drama Ichiro Ozawa, the strongman and  secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], was made  an out-and-out villain, and when the SDPJ at last "exhausted its  stock of patience" (SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama) and seceded  from the government, the party headquarters reportedly received  a flood of encouraging calls saying that "I feel refreshed for  the first time in a long while." However, with the secession as  an impetus, there has burst forth all at once the "political  change in June theory"--a view that a no-confidence motion  against the cabinet will be presented by the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] and the SDPJ and that through its passage, the Lower  House will be dissolved. What on earth does this theory mean?    First, it is clear among others that the "parallel  combination formula coupling the small electoral district system  with proportional representation," which was approved in the  former Hosokawa cabinet, will not be ready for use in June  because rezoning is not to be finalized by then, thereby leaving  no option but to carry out the general election under the  present midsize constituency system. However, what matters here  is not simply the use of such a temporary expedient. Let us  suppose that lawmakers are elected by winning the people's trust  anew under the present medium-size constituency system. Will  they ever try to complete the "parallel combination formula"  which has been neglected and left unfinished since before the  house dissolution?    In Nagata-cho people are now openly expressing "the view  that  the parallel combination formula will have the same fate as the  green card [tax identification card]." That is, in the Yasuhiro  Nakasone cabinet era, a green card system bill was enacted into  law, but it was never enforced and repealed in the face of  strong opposition within the LDP. Those people are saying that  the "parallel combination formula" will have the same fate.  "Political reform" has reached the present stage at length  through five years of effort under three regimes--if we begin  counting from the Toshiki Kaifu cabinet. It is clear that a  heinous scenario designed to bring this achievement to nothing  at a stroke has been drawn up by a group aspiring for the return  of the "1955 order" [the party system realized in 1955] on the  initiative of the LDP and the SDPJ. [passage omitted on Wagner's  aforementioned opera and the dramatic end of the Weimar  Constitution through Hitler's emergence]    What will come next if we leave this "slapstick  drama"--filled with insincerity and betrayal and being performed  recklessly in total disregard of the people--to take its own  course? It is feared that someday these three dramas [the  current Japanese political situation, Wagner's opera, and the  end of the Weimar Constitution], transcending their different  time and space frames, might overlap one another, proving that  they have the same catastrophe. Who can guarantee that such a  day will never come?    The possibility of a joint struggle by the LDP and the SDPJ  under a "strategy seeking parliamentary dissolution [and the  general election] on the basis of the medium-size constituency"  is getting stronger as days go by, although SDPJ Chairman  Murayama is hotly denying it. Apart from what he has in mind  politically, Rengo [National Confederation of Trade Unions]  Chairman Akira Yamagishi, who has actively wrestled with  political reform, makes the following remarks: "The SDPJ is  saying that it is not bound to items agreed on regarding the  coalition government. When occasion demands, it might put  forward a no-confidence motion against the cabinet." He has  thus begun expressing eagerly the view that it is possible to  hold a general election under the medium-size constituency  system.    Some in the LDP are already predicting the results of the  election to be held under the current medium-size constituency.  It is said that, according to the predicted election returns,  the LDP is certain to secure the current 220 seats and the SDPJ  and Shinseito will gain 10 to 20 seats, while the Japan New  Party [JNP] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] will suffer  a decrease.    To be sure, as LDP President Yohei Kono says, former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's individual scandal related to the  Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm poses a problem. As SDPJ Chairman  Murayama says, the position of "monopolizing politics by the  force of numbers" should not be taken lightly. Such a position  was symbolized in the formation of "Kaishin" [Innovation], a new  parliamentary group, which was forcibly carried out by Shinseito  Secretary General Ozawa and others in the current "slapstick  drama." However, a far more serious concern is the actual  situation marked by "political retrogression" in which the  sloppy old structural attributes--which may be linked to the  revival of the "1955 order" through the LDP-SDPJ tie-up--have  burst forth at a stroke.    The Weimar system's collapse was not caused only by the  appearance of Hitler. It is pointed out that the largest problem  was the posture of intellectuals and others belonging to the  political elite who evaded assuming the governing responsibility  by solely avoiding "power" or by trying to stand "against power."    The SDPJ Diet members are even showing a look of relief  because they have returned to their original position as a  perpetual opposition where it only has to raise a voice of  opposition.    When the Hata minority coalition government was inaugurated,  LDP President Yohei Kono said: "The coalition government  virtually collapsed. It failed in the game of power, and we will  not extend a helping hand. A failure is a failure, and we will  make a strong protest against the failure." Is there really no  problem in such a clumsy manner?  <H5>  [1 May 94 Evening Edition p 1] </H5>   [Text] Commenting on Jiyuto [Liberal Party] Chairman Koji  Kakizawa, who got the post of foreign minister only 10 days  after he bolted from the LDP, LDP President Yohei Kono spoke  viciously as follows: "He is a man who criticized the coalition  government just one month ago at a plenary session of the Diet  as an LDP delegate. What is he thinking of the criticism he  leveled thus far? I would like to hear his answer to this  question." He said this because it was only 7 March that Mr.  Kakizawa, in his lower house interpellation, denounced the  coalition severely, asking, "How about dissolving the coalition  and turning over power to the LDP?"    On the same issue, former LDP Secretary General Keizo Obuchi  (chairman of the Obuchi faction) made the following cynical  remarks: "I will not criticize. It is because they are the kind  of people who will return again when the LDP captures power."  There is a "difference of temperature in the languages" used by  the two. This difference cannot be brushed off as simply the  outcome of two different positions--the position of a party  president who has to tie up the party in a bundle and the post  of a faction chief who is rather carefree. It would have been  better if Mr. Kono had not responded and passed the matter with  silence.    It appears that Mr. Kono does not have a favorable  impression  of Prime Minister Hata either. Regarding Mr. Hata, who supported  the no-confidence motion against the Miyazawa cabinet when a  political change took place in the summer of last year, Mr. Kono  reportedly says repeatedly that "the person who had served even  as finance minister in the Miyazawa cabinet betrayed Prime  Minister Miyazawa before his eyes." Mr. Kono stressed a position  of confrontation with the new government, saying: "We will not  extend a helping hand. A failure is a failure, and we will make  a strong protest against the failure." When he said this, I  think that his mind was overshadowed by his personal feelings,  was it not?    Commenting on Mr. Kono's capacity as a leader, former LDP  Executive Council Chairman Raizo Matsuno once said: "In hunting  wild boars, we need a beater; however, if a man who is supposed  to draw a bow plays the role of the beater, we will never get  any game." Mr. Kono's seriousness is valuable, but he is hung up  on minor details and very suspicious and harbors a grudge  against any act of betrayal in the past. With such a character,  he would be unable to work as a leader in such turbulent times.  This is because he cannot compete favorably with Mr. Ichiro  Ozawa of Shinseito who has the clear view that "the politics of  the era of coalition and alliance is the work of seizing power  by obtaining the number of persons required, regardless of their  being a little strange or betrayers."    At a press conference he held after his inauguration, new  Prime Minister Hata, who was compelled to start a minority  ruling coalition government due to the SDPJ's secession,  touching on the LDP, said that "I would like to ask for  cooperation in the policy field." Mr. Kono probably thought that  Mr. Hata "sure does take a lot for granted." However, the  question is not simply how the ordinary people feel; the  seriousness of the situation has been assuming far greater  proportions.    For example, the new Hata government is now faced with "tax  system reform" whose centerpiece is a consumption tax hike. As  for this reform, there is utterly no prospect of its legislation  even if its bill gets finalized within the ruling camp by June.  The Hata government aims to reopen the Japan-U.S. new economic  consultations by the time when the summit meeting of advanced  countries (the Naples summit) are held in July. However, the  U.S. side is insisting on the "continuation of a large tax  reduction" as a prerequisite, and rough sailing is inevitable  with regard to the talks. In addition, concerning North Korea's  nuclear development issue to which Prime Minister Hata and his  followers attach the utmost importance, there is no assurance  that the Japanese Government can respond swiftly if the  situation makes a sudden move toward sanctions by the United  Nations.    Tax system reform and the North Korean nuclear development  issue are questions related exceedingly to the "sovereignty of  our state." The deadlock into which the new government fell is  not the kind of problem that we can dispose of by simply  charging Mr. Ozawa that the deadlock is totally the "natural  consequence of misdeeds" stemming from his thoughtlessness. We  see herein the irresponsibility of Mr. Ozawa, who plunged the  situation straight into confusion without giving deep thought to  what will happen if the new parliamentary group "Kaishin" is  formed with the SDPJ excluded. However, to put it the other way  around, we can note the same irresponsibility by Mr. Kono. What  we see here is a lack of "ruling ability and ruling  responsibility."    The tragedy of Japan at present is the fact that the two  major opposition parties called the LDP and the SDPJ, which take  pride in their influences as the first and second parties by  comparison, are both fallen into a state devoid of "ruling  ability and responsibility."    Former Chancellor Schmidt who was the leader of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] once made the following  remarks to the SDPJ on the basis of his experiences: 1) the SPD  which shifted to a "realistic policy line" in 1959 "acquired  compromising techniques" through "coalition" with the then  ruling party Christian Democratic Union; 2) "a step-by-step  response for the recognition of the actual status is necessary  as an immediate measure in carrying out reform"; and 3) "we must  learn the profound art of the international power game between  the U.S. and Soviet superpowers."    The SDPJ achieved "coalition"; however, without learning  from  Mr. Schmidt's advice, it seceded from the coalition government  after eight months. The inside of the SDPJ is overflowing with  smiling faces from the refreshing feeling that the party has  been released from the "eight-month-long hardship" and "has  returned to the seat of opposition." From what has the party  escaped?    Mr. Masayoshi Takemura (leader of Sakigake [Harbinger]), who  left the cabinet a little earlier, expressed his desire to unite  all forces within the LDP which are dovish and opposed to  constitutional amendments, claiming that he has the "same views"  with Mr. Kiichi Miyazawa, Mr. Masaharu Gotoda, and Mr. Kono on  the Constitution and the nation. It is needless to say that he  gave yells to the SDPJ's secession from the government.    The political situation has shifted its axis from the "LDP  versus non-LDP" to the "Ichiro Ozawa versus non-Ozawa." However,  what on earth is it that is being concealed under the anti-Ozawa  banner which asserts that "insincere and high-handed political  methods" (party president Kono) and "the fascist way of doing  things" (Chairman Tomiichi Murayama) are intolerable?    Following the end of the ideological confrontation, groups  within the SDPJ such as the citizens' faction and the  left-leaning group, trendy leftists, and the faction for  pacifism and constitutional defense are forming a congeries of  families like a stagnant pool of drifters across the existing  political parties. Shaping a large "cold water mass" devoid of  the ruling responsibility, they are now going to strike roots in  the ground prior to the nation's important decision-making which  concerns Japan's survival... with their own "lack of ability to  become responsible authorities" concealed....  <H5>  [2 May 94 Evening Edition p 1] </H5>   [Text] Commenting on former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka  about the time when he was wielding his power as the kingmaker,  former Justice Minister Osamu Inaba once told: "Pushkin said  that the people who are led by an uncultured politician are  unfortunate."    If Mr. Inaba were still alive, he would express the same  feeling about Shinseito strongman Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa, Mr. Tanaka's onetime favorite disciple, who uttered wild  words that "it makes no matter which woman one goes to bed with"  when the SDPJ stood against the formation of the new  parliamentary group "Kaishin."    Among ongoing criticisms against Ozawa are "insincere and  high-handed political methods," "a straightforward way of  thinking devoid of prudence and consideration for the outcome,"  "the way he does things is bold, but his political technique is  immature, resulting in a continuation of failures," and "a lack  of grace due to a contempt for women." Each of them is generally  right. Yet they are still insufficient to depict the whole image  (the reason for existence) of the unique personality of "Ichiro  Ozawa," who has appeared at a huge turning point like our  present era.    Former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru, called the  "foster parent" of the politician Ichiro Ozawa, used the  following expression in describing his own exquisite political  skill (quintessence): "It should be used in such a way that when  you look like your are beating, you are in fact rubbing, and  when you look like you are rubbing, you are indeed beating."    This method was crystalized into an "adjustment-oriented  careful politics" of former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, a  sworn friend of Mr. Kanemaru's. In retrospect, the method  represented the Tanaka faction's traditional family art  originating in Mr. Tanaka. Then, why has a mutant species or a  heterogeneous "devil" like Mr. Ozawa appeared in the chain of  people connected with the Tanaka lineage.    In the midst of the effort to choose former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's successor, Mr. Ozawa told with a touch of  excitement: "The tide of the times cannot be checked. It is  flowing faster than I expect." What Mr. Ozawa calls "the tide of  the times" is a major prerequisite to turning Japan into "an  ordinary nation." The tide means the great political  restructuring involving the LDP. Mr. Ozawa was probably excited  by the self-awareness that he would have to "lead the tide of  the times." Such an "obsession with an idea" is a valuable thing  for a political leader at a turning point in history; however,  it is also accompanied with a danger in case the political  leader mishandles the situation.    Nevertheless, I would like to pay attention to Mr. Ozawa's  "obsession with an idea" because I can use it as a "coordinate  axis" in studying the politician "Ichiro Ozawa" in this article.  It is because, when viewed from this angle, "a continuation of  failures and the immaturity of political technique" as noted in  the Ozawa criticisms may not have great significance for Mr.  Ozawa. I say this on the ground that, if necessary for the  attainment of the ultimate goal, Mr. Ozawa would possibly opt  for "a continuation of failures" rather than for "small  achievements."    In this sense, Mr. Ozawa's "political immaturity" resembles  the "immaturity" peculiar to fundamentalism. This immaturity is  also common to fundamentalist Shoin Yoshida who switched the  course of a historic turnabout toward the Meiji Restoration.    What is interesting about Mr. Ozawa's apparent  "fundamentalism" is that it thoroughly pits the image of "a  president-type (top-down) leader"--as once advocated by former  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone--against the image of "an  adjustment-oriented (bottom-up) leader," which was in line with  Japan's political principle and upheld by Shin Kanemaru and  Noboru Takeshita. This "Japanese political principle versus  American rationalism" diagram is a characteristic of all  policies and ideals envisaged in Mr. Ozawa's "ordinary nation"  theory. That is, fundamental portions of a prescription for  realizing the ordinary nation, in fact, overlap the arguments by  American rationalists or fundamentalists who are engaged in  Japan bashing.    The secrets of the politician Ichiro Ozawa's "strongness"  lie  in his possession by the spirit of rationalism identified with  American fundamentalism. Therefore, as long as the United States  tenaciously asks Japan to "open its market" and "abolish  collusive politics " (finance ministry-led politics), Mr.  Ozawa's tenacity for reforming the present status will remain  unchanged. Moreover, the reason why Mr. Ozawa can revive each  time despite "a continuation of failures" is that international  frictions symbolically shown between Japan and the United States  constitute an incessant source of energy supply to the type of  "fundamentalism" seen in Ichiro Ozawa.    However, Mr. Ozawa being viewed as a "fundamentalist" is, of  course, not simply because he speaks for European and U.S.  rationalism as past modernists did. It is also because he is  concealing in his inmost heart the desire to "surpass"  rationalism sooner or later. This is why Washington does not  stop keeping a vigilant eye on Mr. Ozawa.    Among Japanese politicians, no one will perceive with a  greater sense of strain than Mr. Ichiro Ozawa the great changes  in international politics since the collapse of the Berlin Wall  and the Gulf war, whether they are favorable or unfavorable  changes. Concerning such political methods by Mr. Ozawa, Former  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (leader of Sakigake)  criticizes that "he is a hard-boiled man and does things too  hastily." Then, what is Mr. Takemura's view of the times?    Mr. Takemura called Mr. Ozawa the advocate of "national  rights theory," while calling himself the advocate of "civil  rights theory." In a recent television program, there was a  scene in which political scientist Masataka Takasaka severely  reproved Mr. Takemura for this comparison, saying that "you  should not make an ambiguous comparison by using historic  conceptions." Mr. Takasaka, perhaps, felt like asking Mr.  Takemura if he could understand mental confusions Yukichi  Fukuzawa underwent when he had to move from the position of  "civil rights theory" to that of "national rights theory" in the  face of the Sino-Japanese War. The two ideas should not be  grasped merely as static, mutually opposing ones; instead,  politicians should live together with the touch-and-go strains  created between the two ideas. By so doing, politicians will see  the birth of their realism and their idealist reality.    The North Korean nuclear and missile development issue and  the improvement of Japan's system for emergency are important  test cases in which Japanese politicians--a little crazed from  the long peacetime--can outgrow their former selves and become  true political realists. It is not the "ideas smacking of Ichiro  Ozawa" that is dangerous. Dangerous are the politicians who well  never be able to possess dynamism with which to live amid  strained relations between "national rights" and "civil  rights"--though this inability is characteristic of factions  calling for the defense of the Constitution and postwar pacifist  groups. What is worse, such politicians are squatting across the  LDP and the SDPJ.</p>

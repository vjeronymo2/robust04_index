			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Tsukanova, economic expert of the </F> Russian Privatization Center, State Committee on the  Administration of State Property, under the rubric "Draft Law,"  with introduction by Olga Samarina, DELOVOY MIR: "Monopolies in  the Market Will Get a `Record' If the Law `On Natural and State  Monopolies' Is Passed"]    [Text] A market economy in our country is being born  in torment; as a consequence, appeals by some economists and  politicians to reinforce direct methods for regulating the  economy and controlling prices have been voiced with increasing  frequency. However, it has not been refined what specifically  they propose to regulate. Is it the entire economy or just  certain sectors and groups of commodities? Which specific  methods do they propose to use to this end?    As the experience of past years testifies, state  regulation of the operation of monopoly enterprises has turned  out to be inefficient. Hopes for privatization have been dashed.  Sectoral lobbies have again reconstituted monopoly enterprises  behind the facade of various joint-stock companies. It is  necessary to influence this process by civilized methods rather  than by a straightforward fight by the state against such  enterprises. The developers of the draft Law "On Natural and  State Monopolies" from the Antimonopoly Committee and the  Russian Privatization Center of the State Committee on the  Administration of State Property are convinced of this.    Within several days the federal government of the  Russian Federation will review the draft of this law. Last week  it already gained approval at a conference of the Ministry of  the Economy. In a word, the government has made the first  attempt to restrict state regulation of enterprises to a legal  framework. The objective of legal provisions in the draft law is  to strike a balance between the interests of consumers and  monopoly producers, as well as to standardize relations between  sectoral committees and enterprises. The latter may make it  possible to reduce the influence of subjective factors on  economic policy as a whole.    At the request of a DELOVOY MIR commentator, Natalya  Tsukanova, economic expert of the Russian Privatization Center,  State Committee on the Administration of State Property, and one  of the authors of the draft law, comments on it.    In any economy there are spheres in which the setting of  prices by the market is not optimal. Natural  monopolies, i.e., sectors in which the development of  competition is impossible or ineffective, are the foremost of  such areas. The task of the state with regard to a small number  of these sectors is not to put an end to monopoly operations but  rather to provide conditions for the regulation of their  operation on a permanent basis. What are natural  monopolies? These are sectors or spheres of operation of which  two main features are characteristic.    First, the manufacturing of products in such sectors is more  effective in an environment of absence of competition. This is  associated with the fact that, due to certain technological  peculiarities, production in these sectors exhibits a  substantial reduction in specific cost as the volume of  production grows. This is, as a rule, a result of considerable  economies on the scale of production and high fixed costs which  makes monopoly production more effective. Pipeline  transportation, water supply systems, and railroads are among  such sectors. Indeed, it does not occur to anyone to build two  sets of water mains or two sewer systems. Fixed costs entailed  by building such structures are so high that a parallel system  which performs the same functions would hardly pay for itself.  The more people who use one and the same water supply system,  the lower the outlays are for serving each one of them. In the  same way, the more people travel by railway, the lower the  outlays on carrying one passenger by rail.    Second, the demand for products or services generated by  natural monopoly entities is less dependent on changes in prices  than the demand for other types of products (services), because  products (services) generated by natural monopoly entities  cannot be replaced with other goods to be consumed. The products  in question meet the most significant needs of the population or  are irreplaceable for other industries. Such products include,  for example, electricity, telephone communication services, and  railway transportation. Let us assume that an increase in car  prices forces many consumers to give up the purchase of their  own cars and to use public transit or, at least, postpone the  purchase, whereas even a significant increase in the price of  electricity will hardly bring about discontinuation of its  use--we are not used to living without light; besides,  refrigerators, TV sets, and washing machines are operated in  many apartments. It is quite difficult to substitute for the  consumption of electricity.    Under the circumstances, an enterprise generating such  products (services), that is, a "natural monopoly," gets an  opportunity to set prices well above the actual cost of  production. This is precisely why in all countries "natural  monopoly" enterprises are either owned by the state or regulated  by the state on a permanent basis. As a rule, "natural  monopolies" are regulated by special independent agencies whose  operation is governed by relevant legislative acts. For example,  telephone communications enterprises are regulated by the  Federal Communications Commission in the United States, by the  Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL) in Great Britain, and by  the Canadian Television and Telecommunications Commission in  Canada.    What methods are used to regulate natural monopolies? Since  natural monopoly entities have an opportunity to dictate their  prices to customers, as well as to deny services to them, the  regulatory organs obligate the natural monopoly entities to  supply the goods produced by them to certain groups of consumers  and resort to price regulation methods, i.e., they specify the  level and structure of prices for groups of consumers or the  profit margin, and control the structure and composition of  costs. Since natural monopoly entities may try to overstate  their actual costs by allocating too much funding to develop  their main line of production, as well as to develop the  manufacturing of products for which prices are not regulated,  the regulatory organs approve investment plans with a view to  developing the production of natural monopoly goods, authorize  the natural monopoly entities to issue stock and bonds and to  attract borrowed funds, and also authorize investment to develop  the production of goods on which there is no monopoly. Finally,  effective regulation is only possible on the condition that  complete and authentic information is available to the  regulatory organs. For this reason, the natural monopoly  entities have the obligation to provide information on financial  and production operations in a format developed by the  regulatory organ and inform consumers about changes in prices  for products. The regulatory organs approve rules for accounting  and statistical reporting.    Such careful control over natural monopolies is due to the  fact that a conflict is unavoidable in this area between the  interests of "natural monopoly" producers and consumers, with  the market mechanism being "inadequate" to resolve it. This is  precisely why the need emerges for an "arbiter," or an  independent regulatory organ which, having taken into account  the interests and information provided by both parties, makes  decisions on the basis of a professional expert review.  Therefore, the natural monopolies amount to the areas of  operation in which the attention of the state should indeed be  focused on the development of a regulatory system using methods  that are unacceptable in other sectors, in particular, the  regulation of prices. As we see it, it is precisely the  direction on which to concentrate the efforts to create a system  of active state regulation that is adequate in a market  environment.    In the process of the application of specific regulatory  methods (the setting of maximum profit margins or prices, the  consideration of the issue of a merger between a natural  monopoly entity and another enterprise, and so on), the organs  which it is proposed to charge with regulating the natural  monopolies must take into account information and views of all  interested parties, that is, the natural monopoly entities, the  Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and  Support of New Economic Structures and its territorial  administrations, consumers, sectoral ministries, and other  organs of power and government. The regulatory organs must  inform the public through the mass media about their decisions  with regard to the methods used to regulate the operation of  natural monopoly entities, as well as about specific indicators  and requirements for the natural monopoly entities.    At the same time, the law grants considerable independence  and freedom to the regulatory organs. They do not report to any  state structure and make their decisions on the basis of a  professional expert review of the situation in a sector. If a  regulatory organ exceeds its authority or fails to perform the  functions assigned to it, the natural monopoly entities,  consumers (personally or through a public organization of  consumers), as well as the Committee for Antimonopoly Policy,  may appeal to the Court of Arbitration, which may cancel the  unlawful decision.</p>

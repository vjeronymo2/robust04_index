			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RYAN MANIA;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: TEXAS RANGER PITCHER HANDCUFFS 5,000 PLUS, HURLS SIX NO-HITTERS, NOW  GOES FOR HIS 300TH CAREER VICTORY.  </P> <P> When Nolan Ryan signed with the Texas Rangers as a free agent in December,  1988, three numbers swirled in his head.  </P> <P> Five thousand. Six and 300.  </P> <P> "Those are the only numbers that really mean something to me," Ryan said.  </P> <P> Ryan, the all-time strikeout leader, struck out Rickey Henderson for No. 5,000  last summer and has added 202 since. His sixth no-hitter, against Oakland last  month, came after several close calls since his record fifth in 1981.  </P> <P> On Wednesday night, Ryan goes for his 300th victory against the New York  Yankees.  </P> <P> Ryan declined to discuss going for No. 300 until last Friday night, when he  beat Detroit 5-3 for No. 299.  </P> <P> "Now I can start thinking about it," he said. "I don't think about no-hitters  until the ninth or so, I didn't think about 5,000 until I was close and I  didn't think about 300 until I had 299."  </P> <P> Just about everyone else has been thinking about it all season. And now,  Ryanmania has struck again. Even Ryan is caught up in it, agreeing to a news  conference today to accommodate the hundreds of interview requests.  </P> <P> Unlike some 300-win pitchers, Ryan is on a hot streak as he approaches the  coveted number. Despite nagging back problems, Ryan is 5-0 with an 2.63 ERA in  his last six starts.  </P> <P> "I feel good," Ryan said. "My back won't keep me from starting Wednesday, but  it's just one of those things that'll need five weeks of rest to completely  heal."  </P> <P> Wednesday night's game was sold out on July 20, the earliest sellout in Rangers  history, said Tanja Burgdorf in the team's public relations office.  </P> <P> One fan in the Dallas suburb of Plano bought six tickets to take his family to  the game, but got an unexpected collectible when his wife chose not to go.  </P> <P> The $8.50 unused ticket would be worth at least $50 if Ryan wins, said Jim  Milholland of Dick's Dugout sports collectibles shop in Dallas.  </P> <P> "But I think they're crazy for not going to the game if they have a ticket," he  said.  </P> <P> Some examples of Ryanmania:  </P> <P>  -- Local newspapers are running daily updates on Ryan remaining calm as the  pressure mounts, and radio stations are giving fans up-to-the-minute reports on  Ryan's ailing back.  </P> <P>  -- The razor company for which Ryan does TV commercials is poised for the  Texas pitcher's 300th career victory. Since Ryan is 43, BIC said when Ryan wins  No. 300, all 43-year-old men in the United States will be offered a free trial  pack of BIC Metal Shavers.  </P> <P>  -- Ryan memorabilia was a hot item at the 11th National Sports Collectors  convention in Arlington earlier this month. Rangers Manager Bobby Valentine  even doled out hundreds of dollars for a Ryan rookie card.  </P> <P> A mint 1968 Topps rookie card of Ryan recently sold for $3,900 at a Florida  auction.  </P> <P>  -- Five hundred people entered a Ft. Worth Star-Telegram contest titled "Ryan  Expressions," in which they wrote in 25 words or less just how special the  Rangers pitcher is to their lives.  </P> <P> The winner, James Fleschener of Arlington, wrote: "Nolan brings back memories  of days gone by. Playing ball during the endless summer days with childhood  friends. Nolan is my personalized fountain of youth."  </P></p>

Obviously, Moroccans and Europeans do not have the  same approach to their joint future. The vice president of the  European Commission, Mr. Manuel Marin's visit to Rabat in  mid-December illustrated the differences arising from the  renegotiation of the Euro-Moroccan cooperation agreement. "We  expected the Moroccans to have reservations on a number of  points, but we never expected such a shock," people at the  Commission pointed out. Actually, Mr. Marin came up against a  polite but firm "niet" from his Moroccan counterpart, Mr.  Abdellatif Filali, minister of foreign affairs. The latter said  that the concessions made by the Europeans to his country,  especially as far as agriculture is concerned, were markedly  "inadequate."    In fact, the Twelve agreed only to a few improvements of the  conditions covering Moroccan agricultural exports, providing a  3-percent annual increase for the first five years of  application of the agreement, but only for products enjoying  special access conditions, such as fruit and vegetables which,  as a result, will have to be "communitized" [considered on a  community scale]. At present, with 51 percent of imports, France  remains Morocco's largest European customer. But the Moroccans  keep recalling that "for the past 10 years, current agreements  essentially benefited Europe" and that "the trade deficit keeps  getting worse." From 1987 to 1992, it rose from 350 to 650  million ECUs [European currency units]. Moroccan exports to the  former EEC account for only 0.12 percent of all Community  imports. Sales of citrus fruit and tomatoes have not increased  since the seventies.    According to Mr. Allal Sijelmassi, in charge of bilateral  relations at the Foreign Trade Ministry, "exchange terms are  quite out of balance: Morocco no longer expects assistance but  real partnership and the creation of a free-trade zone." But  that question was not even discussed. The proposed agreement is  a mere association agreement, like the one between the twelve  European countries and East European countries. Morocco rejects  it; what it wants is to be totally docked to Europe. This in  spite of the reluctance displayed by Moroccan economic circles,  who are worried at seeing their markets wide open to European  industrial and agrifood products. They fear the disappearance of  entire sectors of their industry and the massive arrival of  European staple agricultural products (milk, meat, grains) at  very competitive (because often subsidized) prices.  <H5>  Internal Resistance </H5>   To explain this relative failure, people in Brussels stress  the role played by the government opposition, led by the  (nationalist) Istiqlal and the (socialist) USFP [Socialist Union  of Popular Forces], in denouncing this negotiation mandate "that  brings grist to the mill of Morocco's most conservative pillars,  including some in the government in particular at the Ministry  of Interior, although the king and his closest advisors are  ardent supporters of the agreement."    The European negotiators, however, acknowledge that their  proposals "lacked scope" because they were dictated by the  recession that is affecting Europe. "As member States have no  money left and have problems with their agriculture, the  negotiation could not have come at a worst time," Mrs. Le  Dantec, one of the Commission's people in charge of the  negotiation mandate, deplored. The thorny problem of immigration  also had something to do with the Europeans' reluctance, as part  of their public opinion is increasingly xenophobic. These delays  exasperate the Moroccans who feel that they are doing their best  to no avail. "We pay an exorbitant social cost for the  structural adjustment program dictated by the IMF, the State and  agricultural producers are making a constant effort, but in  recent years the quantities exported per hectare have kept  decreasing. These ridiculous proposals are no match for the  challenges of the 21st century," an economist at the Hassan-II  Institute protested.    Faced with Europe's increasing tendency to  "de-Mediterranize"  its trade flows (they now account for only 5 percent of all  European trade) and with the endemic weakness of inter-Maghreb  trade (6 percent of the global trade volume), Morocco is losing  patience. And it is distressed at getting so little in return  for opening its market to investors from the North ($800 million  projected for 1994, compared with $60 million in 1986). European  experts, for their part, point out that "this mandate represents  an important qualitative jump, because it provides a forum for  political dialogue at the highest level prior to any subsequent  progress, which also answers the Moroccan's initial request."    The access door to Europe is barely half-open. The two  parties still have two years to find an area of agreement before  the renegotiation of the agreements linking the two  Mediterranean shores is completed. The crucial year will be  1996, with the deadline for the implementation of the PAC  (common agricultural policy) and the new U.S. farm bill.</p>

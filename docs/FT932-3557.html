			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / CBI presses over relocation THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry is putting renewed pressure on the government to amend its proposed changes to the taxation of relocation expenses. Mr Howard Davies, director-general, has written to Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, asking for a higher cap on expenses or a delay in implementation of the new arrangements. Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor, proposed in the March Budget a ceiling of Pounds 8,000 on tax relief to employees for relocation expenses.</p>

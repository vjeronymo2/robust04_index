			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Corporate Japan frets about profits: A wave of cost cuts THE list reads like an honour roll of Japan's post-war industrial success stories: the Fujitsu computer group, the NEC electronics group, Minebea, the world's leading maker of miniature bearings, and Nissan Motor. Instead, it is part of the list of companies likely to report embarrassing losses in coming weeks. As companies own up to dismal results for the six months to September, they will also be announcing more staff cuts, pared product lines, and trimmed executive salaries, as manufacturers attempt to respond to recession by restructuring. One in 10 Japanese listed companies is likely to report a loss for the period and only a few of those will get out of the red during the second half. Japanese executives have begun to concede that poor profitability is not merely an inevitable result of recession. Many companies had recognised in the mid-1980s, after the yen's rapid appreciation and the maturing of core markets, that profits were in long-term decline and a restructuring was necessary. But the easy money era of the late 1980s inspired unwise expansion of domestic production capacity and a rapid increase in staff, making the present crisis more acute and the need for restructuring more urgent. The expansion was made in expectation of a continuing increase in sales, a forecast inspired, for example, by the 12 per cent jump in orders received for industrial machinery in 1988, and the 21 per cent rise a year later. While corporate investment in fixed assets rose 66 per cent over the past seven years, revenues rose only 29 per cent. Nikko Research estimates that the operating profit margin for manufacturers this calendar year will be 3.1 per cent, down from 3.2 per cent in 1986, and from the oil shock-affected 4.5 per cent of 1975. Meanwhile, Nikkei, the financial information company, estimated that the asset turnover ratio of listed manufacturers fell from 1.19 in 1984 to 0.97 in the last fiscal year. There are two causes common to the plight of many manufacturers: the changing nature of the domestic market, and inefficient use of assets and personnel. In the past, companies were able to pay for their international expansion with profits earned from the domestic market, where price competition was often a matter of consensus. Market-opening measures and a more aggressive approach by the Fair Trade Commission stimulated competition, but another important factor was the entry of old manufacturers into new markets during the past few years. Nippon Steel began making personal computers, Minolta, the camera company, ventured into office equipment, and Minebea, the bearings maker, went into cosmetics. Komatsu, the construction machinery producer, started manufacturing silicon wafers and established a distribution network for Norwegian pleasure boats. One result was increased crowding of already congested markets. When 11 semiconductor makers or nine television set producers squeeze into a shrinking domestic market, price-cutting leads to falling profits. Apart from entering new markets, companies expanded their product lines in existing markets, as the flow of low-cost funds encouraged investments that should not have been made. Companies were feeling wealthy, sales were rising, and the surge in stock and land prices gave them a seemingly everlasting financial cushion. Now the present economic downturn has left manufacturers stranded in new markets, either desperately trying to justify their investments by cutting prices or about to announce an embarrassing retreat. Mr Masanobu Takahashi, director of corporate research at Sanyo Investment Research, said the difficulties highlight the 'excessively competitive nature of Japanese business'. He argues that companies are 'restructuring for their survival', and predicts 'an inevitable' consolidation in the next few years. Companies must be prepared to withdraw from unprofitable markets, and not just prune the product lines. The character of the average manufacturing company also plays its part in the crisis. While the country's shopfloors are rightly famous for lean production techniques, the company itself is often remarkably bloated. A manager at a cosmetics maker estimated that '25 per cent of our workforce is unemployed', and Mitsubishi Motors, whose profits have risen against the trend, says a reason for its success is that 'we entered the business late, and kept a leaner administrative workforce'. During the late 1980s, as companies rushed labour-saving technology into the factories, the typical head office was over-staffed. This has become a heavy burden on profits. The finance ministry reckons labour costs as a percentage of sales were 16.1 per cent in the second quarter this year, compared with 15.7 per cent in 1986, and 15 per cent in 1975, the other crisis years. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew estimates manufacturing unit labour costs will rise 10 per cent this year, but productivity will fall 6.5 per cent. Another aspect of the corporate character working against higher profits is the asset profile. Mr John Baldwin, strategist at Jardine Fleming Securities, said 21 per cent of listed companies' assets are securities or land, up from 14 per cent in 1980. Neither are likely to produce high yields for the next few years. 'The asset base is being used very inefficiently, and this is a bigger factor in dragging down profitability than falling margins,' Mr Baldwin said. Most of the stocks are cross-holdings in suppliers or financial institutions and are not easily offloaded without rupturing that relationship. In studying corporate profitability from the mid-1960s, Wako Research Institute found that in the late 1980s, frustrated companies turned to financial engineering. Using a profit index, the institute calculated that pre-tax profits grew by almost 80 per cent between 1986 and 1989, while operating profits were about 20 per cent higher - much of the difference was due to financial engineering. Instead of counting gains on stock portfolios, companies are now booking losses, and interest income has fallen in tandem with their cash cushion. Japanese manufacturers are having to go back to the future - resuming a restructuring begun in the mid-1980s and halted prematurely.</p>

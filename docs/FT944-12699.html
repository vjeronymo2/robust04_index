			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Pressure grows for partial sale of Post Office Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is under pressure from senior ministers to accept compromise proposals for Post Office commercialisation within the public sector. They hope to agree a plan in time for a bill to be included in the Queen's speech on November 16 setting out the government's legislative programme for the coming parliamentary session. The cabinet's industry committee is expected to meet tomorrow to decide how to give the Post Office greater freedom without risking defeat at the hands of backbench Conservative rebels opposed to privatisation. Ministers hope the cabinet will on Thursday be able to approve a partial sale. But a decision may be put off until Thursday next week if the committee fails to thrash out a compromise. Mr John Major is understood to have told ministers that, if necessary, the Post Office bill could be omitted from the Queen's speech and introduced later in the session. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, remains committed to the sale of 51 per cent of the Post Office, which he believes would send a powerful signal of the government's continuing commitment to economic reform. But the government's business managers have warned ministers that privatisation would be opposed by up to eight Tory backbenchers, implying certain defeat for the bill unless some of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs abstained. Mr Heseltine will meet the rebels tonight in a final effort to persuade them that fears for the future of rural post offices and the universal pricing system have been overstated. The compromise proposals focus on the sale of a minority shareholding combined with freedom from government borrowing controls. Such a structure would keep the Post Office in the public sector while satisfying management demands for greater freedom to compete. There is substantial support for a compromise among senior ministers, many of whom doubt the wisdom of risking a parliamentary defeat in pursuit of privatisation. However, the option of commercial freedom within the public sector has been vigorously opposed by Mr Clarke on the grounds that state-owned companies cannot be excluded from the public sector borrowing requirement. Other compromises being discussed include a phased sale of a majority holding, which would give ministers time to convince backbenchers that privatisation need not threaten rural services. Rebel backbenchers said they would vote for a minority sale. 'My main concern is to keep the Royal Mail in the public sector,' said Mr Stephen Day, Conservative MP for Cheadle. Heseltine has to deliver the back benches, Page 13</p>

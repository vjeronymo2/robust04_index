			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / SIB proposes fresh rules on client funds EXTENSIVE changes to rules covering how investment firms handle clients' money were proposed yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief investment regulator. The board did not suggest significant changes of principle in spite of concern expressed after the collapse of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the financial services group that went into administration last year. The changes, on which comments should be made by June 28, include: If clients of an investment firm specify a bank where they want their cash to be held, the money will not be 'pooled' with that of other investors if another bank used by the same investment firm collapses. Investment firms will have to warn clients if at any time in the future they might put money into a bank owned by the group to which the firm belongs. Firms will have to notify professional investors if their money is not held separately from the firms' own funds. Proposals for Amended Client Money Regulations. SIB, Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8RA. Pounds 20 (free to subscribers to SIB rule book).</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Taiwan generals are impeached Taiwan's top government watchdog impeached eight generals yesterday for allegedly wasting taxpayers' money in an arms scandal involving upgrading of 32 anti-submarine aircraft, Reuter reports from Taipei. One four-star general, two three-star generals, two major-generals and three lieutenant-generals formed the largest group of military officials ever impeached by the watchdog, the Control Yuan. The eight, who included Gen Kuo Ju-lin and Gen Chen Hsing-ling, former air force commanders-in-chief, were impeached because 'the upgrading of S2T propeller planes lacked thorough planning and the negotiated price did not meet regulations', an official said. 'Delivery was delayed but there was no stipulation in the agreement for any penalty. Payment was made even before the upgrading was completed, wasting taxpayers' money and delaying upgrading of combat capability.' The Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries will decide what action to take against the generals. They could be dismissed if still in office but will not face criminal proceedings unless prosecutors decide on an inquiry. The impeachment could stop Gen Kuo, 73, a national policy adviser to President Lee Teng-hui, and Gen Chen, 69, a strategic adviser to the president, returning to office.</p>

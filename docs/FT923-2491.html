			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Bundesbank warning on needs of east THE Bundesbank yesterday accused German public authorities and wage negotiators of failing to take enough account of the continuing high financing needs of east Germany. It also warned the government against being too ready to seek fresh sources of revenue to finance east German reconstruction, without first reining back spending. Warnings against inflation, generous fiscal policies, and high pay settlements have been a constant refrain of the Bundesbank since unification, with currently high interest rates resulting from its attempt to hammer home its message. In its monthly report, written before the upheavals on currency markets, the central bank said west Germany would have to get used to the fact that high transfer payments to the east would be needed for longer than first thought. The restructuring of east Germany's economy was proving more time-consuming and costly than expected. While the west German economy had weakened, but was not showing recessionary tendencies, that in the east had still not begun a self-sustaining upswing. Unemployment in east Germany was still the most severe problem, even though incomes of most households had improved considerably since unity. The gap between sinking output and rising incomes was being financed by high transfers from the west. The Bundesbank expressed continued concern about wage trends in east and west Germany. It was especially worried about the planned rise in public sector pay in the east to 80 per cent of west German levels next July. This would add to the financial burdens of the east German states, already striving to make new infrastructure investments. The bank urged strict restraint on the public sector in view of the steady flow of new proposals for raising extra finance. 'The tapping of new sources of revenue cannot be a substitute for continued savings efforts.' This applied also to new borrowing instruments. The Bundesbank said the high wage rises of the past two years, as the gap with west Germany has been narrowed, had harmed the competitiveness of many east German companies. These were already suffering from the shift to the free market, and from the collapse of eastern European markets. However, the bank saw some hope for the east German economy in the fact that unemployment had remained lower than feared. The figure of 1.2m jobless in the east at the end of August was 175,000 less than at the start of 1992. The number on short-time working fell by 235,000 to 285,000.</p>

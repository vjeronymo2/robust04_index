			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: CAN PETER GABRIEL VANQUISH THE BOX?  </P> <P> It's finally showdown time in the record business over the controversial CD  longbox.  </P> <P> If longbox foes and supporters agree on anything, it's that the true test of  the longbox's future would come when a major rock star put out a CD without its  bulky 6x12-inch package.  </P> <P> The future is now. Two of rock's top stars, Peter Gabriel and Sting, are about  to release albums that either ditch the longbox entirely or offer a replacement  package that cuts down on paperboard waste, which has made the longbox such an  ecological eyesore.  </P> <P> A major force behind the recent series of Amnesty International concert tours,  Gabriel puts out his Geffen Records album "Shaking the Tree: 16 Golden Greats"  on Dec. 4. He'll be followed by Sting, another Amnesty participant and a  longtime environmental activist, who'll release his new A&amp;M album "The Soul  Cages" on Jan. 22.  </P> <P> Gabriel's CD simply comes in a jewelbox. Sting's album uses a proposed longbox  replacement, the Digitrak. It's a multi-paneled 5x11-inch paperboard package  that is displayed in removable -- and potentially recyclable -- plastic  holders, which allows it to fit in current CD retail bins but fold up to  jewel-box size for use at home.  </P> <P> The Gabriel CD poses the biggest test of anti-longbox fervor. Many retailers,  most notably Show Industries chief Lou Fogelman, who runs several major  record-store chains including Music Plus, have vowed not to stock or sell CDs  distributed without a longbox.  </P> <P> "When Peter came to us a few weeks ago and said he wanted to put this out  without a longbox, I told him of all the consequences," said Geffen president  Eddie Rosenblatt. "He knows this means he's going to lose a lot of sales, but  he's willing to take the punishment. It's difficult to quantify, but judging  from our discussions with our sales and distribution people, it could cost us  40% of the records we'd normally ship to our accounts."  </P> <P> (Rosenblatt would not provide specific figures, but gauging from past release  patterns of superstar-hits packages, it's probable that Geffen is shipping  about 100,000 less records than its normal 250,000.)  </P> <P> Rosenblatt isn't eager to antagonize retailers, saying he believes they're  willing to phase out longboxes "in an orderly" fashion. But he says his label  wants to ban the box entirely, not settle for one of the many proposed  alternatives now being touted by retailers.  </P> <P> "The halfway measures don't solve the problem -- they simply continue it,"  Rosenblatt said. "You're still having to throw away or recycle a lot of  material."  </P> <P> THE STING: A&amp;M's upcoming Sting CD package has already stirred a noisy  debate, especially among longbox foes. They say the pop star, who's been an  outspoken environmental activist and has the commercial clout to influence  label decisions, hasn't practiced what he's preached.  </P> <P> "We're very disappointed to see Sting, who's been so vocal about other  environmental issues, making so many obvious compromises when it came to his  record," says Rykodisc president Robert Simonds, who runs the Ban the Box  Coalition, which has the support of dozens of major pop artists. "It's  frustrating to see an artist with his environmental consciousness not taking a  stronger stand -- as Peter Gabriel has with his record."  </P> <P> Still, A&amp;M is proud of launching a longbox alternative. Al Carfaro, A&amp;M  senior vice president and general manager, says that the label has taken "a  step in the right direction" with its Digitrak experiment, which he calls "a  potential solution to the problem."  </P> <P> Asked why A&amp;M is using a 5x11 replacement package instead of simply going  with a jewel box, Carfaro acknowledged that the label was responding to retail  pressures. "We simply couldn't run the risk of not having this record  everywhere. A label our size can't dictate to the marketplace, which just isn't  equipped to stock CDs without some kind of packaging."  </P> <P> But what has peeved activists is that A&amp;M is shipping up to 300,000 initial  copies of the Sting album with a longbox. The label says that's because the  record is being released 10 days before AGI Inc., the company which makes  Digitrak, can begin mass production of the package.  </P> <P> Which begs the question -- if A&amp;M and Sting are such ardent  environmentalists, why couldn't they wait 10 days? "From a marketing  standpoint, we just had to get the record out," Carfaro says. "We had to have  the album out by Feb. 1, which is when Sting's tour starts, and the dates are  booked and couldn't be changed."  </P> <P> The Digitrak's other drawback is its throwaway plastic holders. A&amp;M says  they are recyclable -- but only if there's a system to collect and return the  plastic. Carfaro says it's up to the retailers to provide such a system and  admits that "we don't have any assurances yet that they're ready to set one  up."  </P> <P> So far the artists are letting the packages speak for themselves. Peter  Gabriel's manager said he was in the studio and "too busy" to comment. Sting's  label reps said he was in London and was unavailable for comment.  (Incidentally, Rykodisc's Simonds acknowledged that his label's CDs are  distributed in longboxes.)  </P></p>

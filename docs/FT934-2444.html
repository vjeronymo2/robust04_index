			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Ritual Fragment', Mahler's Tenth - Concert On Sunday Mark Wigglesworth conducted the London Philharmonic - except in Harrison Birtwistle's Ritual Fragment, which needs no conductor. That was one of the many elegies, or 'in memoriams', composed for the late Michael Vyner, artistic director of the London Sinfonietta, and it has worn well. All of the performers whose instruments are portable take their turns at a central music-stand, one by one, laying their own melodic wreaths over soft background commentary and funereal thwacks on a bass drum. If the LPO players are less used than the Sinfonietta team to playing while processing, they went through their paces with unruffled gravity. The piece wrought its proper spell. Birtwistle is now the LPO's 'composer in residence', and the Ritual Fragment had been used in an Education Project. Before the concert proper, we heard three school groups delivering pre-improvised music inspired by it - or so we were told: except for one excursion into jazz, it seemed shapeless stuff. Birtwistle's ideas are inimitable, least of all by children. In Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante K364, the great violin-and-viola one, there was no special creative input from the orchestra, though Wigglesworth handled it with an agreeably light touch. That was enough, for Thomas Zehetmair and Tabea Zimmermann were a winning pair of soloists, his subtle, fine-drawn line beautifully answered by her broad, mellifluous tone. Their partnership was seamless; probably it hardly matters to them what the accompanying orchestra does, as long as it doesn't get in the way. As his own showpiece, however, Wigglesworth had chosen the Tenth Symphony of Mahler, in Deryck Cooke's reconstruction. It sounded well-studied, at least  -indeed, it might have served as a kind of study-performance: all the notes were there, efficiently regimented and clear. There was nothing else to recommend it. Rigor mortis set in almost from the start, with the conductor's extraordinarily unyielding tempi denying Mahler's long, anguished lines any room to breathe. New thematic material arrived as if on a conveyor belt, with no sense of event or fresh feeling. As an experiment in playing Mahler without expressive, idiomatic rubato, one hopes never to hear it repeated. Even the scherzo-movements were stiff, and the Adagios at the start and the close were frigid. The famous outcries were loud, but empty of dramatic force. Surely it must be a mistake for any conductor to essay this fragmented Tenth before mastering a lot of earlier Mahler? It made a weirdly dispiriting experience.</p>

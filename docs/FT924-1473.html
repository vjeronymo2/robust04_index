			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs to proceed on Lamont probe THE cross-party Commons committee on MPs' interests has decided to press ahead with an inquiry into whether Mr Norman Lamont should have declared the payment by an anonymous Tory benefactor of most of his legal bill for removing an unwelcome tenant. The committee received a complaint from two Labour MPs that, under the rules requiring MPs to publish any gift or business interest that might be thought to affect their judgment, Mr Lamont should have registered the Pounds 18,000 payment. It also received written evidence from the Treasury. A draft report will be considered when the committee meets again in January.</p>

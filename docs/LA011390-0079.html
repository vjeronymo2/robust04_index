			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRONKO NAGURSKI A REAL ALL-TIMER  </P> <P> Allan Malamud's column of Jan. 10 includes comments to the effect that the  legendary Bronko Nagurski could not play defensive tackle today. Bronko played  60 years ago and his talent has stood the test of time.  </P> <P> In 1982, the Sporting News selected an all-time college football team and  Bronko was a first-team defensive tackle along with fellow Golden Gopher Leo  Nomellini. George Halas said he was the greatest football player who ever  lived.  </P> <P> If he were in his youth today, he undoubtedly would be into weight training and  would be the all-pro nose tackle. He could have been another Dick Butkus as an  inside linebacker as well as an all-pro at tight end. I saw Bronko wrestle many  times when I was a boy out in Minnesota. He was pushing 40, but had great  agility even then.  </P> <P> JOHN HOLMES, Northridge  </P></p>

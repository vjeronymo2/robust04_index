Members of government and Parliament were present, plus  Budapest diplomats. A speech by Prime Minister Peter Boross  recalled turning points of Hungarian history from the conquest  to the present.    He cited the historical importance of the 1848-49 revolution  and freedom fight, the ideas of March 15, freedom, national  independence, and social modernisation.    Boross said distorted, alien ideas ruled the Hungarian  people  after World War Two. "The message of the March flame was there  on October 23, 1956, when people fought for indestructible  Hungarian freedom and overthrew a distorted system of ideas."    "This is the fourth year that we have celebrated March 15  freely, and the third year that there are no foreign soldiers in  the country," the prime minister continued. Boross said the  tough years of change and recent traumas all point in one  direction, that of the March ideal: To survive, and to make the  life of the nation better, more secure and free.    "We have not solved everything, there is unfinished  business,  unsolved problems, but we are on the way, as we are fulfilling  the order to survive and to prosper. Let us promise not to  struggle with our daily problems today or engage in politics,  but to bow our heads to the great figures of the nation. The  spirit of March should refresh our public life, should give  faith and courage so that we can cover the road ahead of us,"  the prime minister said.</p>

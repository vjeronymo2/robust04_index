			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Dancing amid the ruins WE HAVE never seen anything like it before. Not the disorder in the currency markets, for that is an oft-told tale; but the spectacle of the stock market mounting a champagne celebration to mark the discomfiture of a Conservative government. In economic terms, this judgment may well prove apt. The cost to the UK of trying to achieve monetary convergence had become unacceptably high, and its departure from the system is a potential economic liberation. But the political cost of the crisis, not just to Mr John Major but to the whole of the European community  - including those still waiting for admission  - is incalculable. The market reaction shows not just the devaluation of a group of currencies, but of the whole idea of an integrated Europe. This is not a gain of any kind. There is no alternative vision on offer, nor any political leader strong enough to impose one even on his own electorate, let alone his partners. Market disillusion with the project for economic union has been evident for many months. The first signs appeared even before the Maastricht treaty was signed. Bond yield differentials, which had been narrowing for some time in the hope of lasting economic convergence, started to widen just as the convergence plan was being officially ratified. Then came the collapse of the ECU bond market, which had been seen as the commercial precursor of monetary union: there were not enough interested investors to constitute a workable market. They were not impressed with visions of 1993, let alone 1997 (the hoped for Maastricht date for a single currency). Red meat All the same, the currency markets remained calm. The world banking system has been so debilitated by bad judgment and bad lending that nearly all banks had forbidden their dealers to take speculative positions for more than an hour or two. Exchange markets responded not only to light central bank intervention, but even to veiled hints from those in authority. Only a few weeks ago, the idea that dealers might suddenly eat red meat, and turn to defy concerted intervention across Europe, looked far-fetched. British hopes that firm official words could control the financial tide look silly now, but must have seemed quite plausible then. In the event it was not sterling or the lira, but the US dollar which fell first. This seemed at first to have official blessing, as the Administration took a public position which was very near benign neglect. But the telling moment came when the combined central banks made a quite obviously half-hearted attempt to check the fall. For the first time in many months, dealers who kept an open position against their central banks during a trading day closed their books in the evening with useful profits, and at a time when banking profits were hard indeed to earn. The sharks were freed to hunt; the lira devaluation a week ago poured blood into the water. Popular doubts European leaders would no doubt be blaming the whole crisis on the dealers, if they were not so busy blaming each other; but this would put cause and effect the wrong way round. What we have seen is not politicians struggling with markets, but markets responding to politics. The Danish vote, the strength of French popular doubts about Maastricht, and ever louder criticism of Mr Major's policies from his own back benches were all known before the markets ran out of control. A vacuous meeting of Group of Seven officials deepened the general scepticism, and reports of a furious shouting match when Europe's finance ministers met in Bath set the timing. By Monday, a French 'Oui' to Maastricht may reset the direction of European development, though now on a long, two-speed route. This should restore some calm, but it will do next to nothing to calm fears of world depression, to meet the hopes of the ex-Communist countries of Europe, or to end the threat posed by revived populist nationalism. It would be easy to urge the Group of Seven or the whole membership of the IMF, whose meetings are just about to begin, to set a new lead. Such an effort would be difficult in economically lean times, which always inspire national selfishness. While the US is in mid-campaign, and Anglo-German insults are being rallied across the North Sea, it would be futile. Any attempted solution will have to wait on the election of new leaders to replace the tired and discredited men of the moment  - a group which Mr John Major has at least temporarily joined. The world leaders could, however, aim for an important second best. They should agree to refrain from competitive devaluation, and to tackle the Uruguay round of trade talks with a new sense of urgency. Such a pact should be achievable, even through clenched teeth. It accords with everyone's stated aims, and would counter a short-term setback with some long term hope.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: MCC's 75% holding in Nimbus Records bought by US merchant bank AN AMERICAN merchant bank is buying Maxwell Communication Corporation's 75.1 per cent stake in Nimbus Records, the classical music label and manufacturer of compact discs The stake in the Wales-based company founded by Count Labinsky, a professional singer who wanted to improve music recording quality, is being bought by DLJ Merchant Banking, a wholly owned subsidiary of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York investment banker. Nimbus, which employs 650 people, has an annual turnover of about Pounds 50m and presses 70m CDs a year in the UK and the US. Pre-tax profits in 1991 were about Pounds 500,000, or Pounds 2m before interest charges. No price was disclosed for the sale, which was organised by Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC following the collapse of the Maxwell empire. It is expected to be completed by the end of this month. There was considerable international interest in Nimbus, which began pressing CDs in Monmouth in 1984 and later won a Queen's Award for Technological Achievement. Count Labinsky, president of Nimbus Records, said the company had been 'looking for the investor with the strongest commitment to the future of CD technology in all its audio and multimedia applications'. He added that he felt that with DLJ's support, the company was structured for growth in all areas of its business internationally. Apart from music, Nimbus is a specialist in CD-ROM technology which uses compact discs to store information on a wide range of activities including computerised mapping and technical documentation for aerospace and vehicle manufacturers.</p>

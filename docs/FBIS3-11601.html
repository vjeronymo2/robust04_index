			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the  Institutional Revolutionary Party, commented in Culiacan on 22  March on the statement by Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner  for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas.    [Begin Colosio recording] Many of you have asked me for my  reaction to today's public statement by Manuel Camacho Solis, so  I have written a communique that I want to read to you. I will  begin by saying that Camacho Solis' public statement confirms  his absolute devotion to the tasks of conciliation and  pacification with which the president entrusted him, thus  confirming that our government has undertaken in earnest the  construction of a lasting peace in Chiapas. It also recalls  that the path to creating the conditions necessary to uproot the  problem is still a complex one. The problem has caused so much  suffering for Mexicans that handling it allows no room for  distractions, as the commendable work by Camacho demonstrates.  In my opinion, unity among Mexicans must prevail to  successfully face the Chiapas problem. Everyone must act in  solidarity with those who are striving to achieve that purpose.  As I have said on other occasions and as I reiterate today,  Camacho Solis is the best man to build a just peace in Chiapas  because of his convictions, sensitivity, and negotiating  ability. Camacho Solis is a man of great ability and political  commitment who has performed outstanding services for the  country and will continue to do so. I am certain that all  Mexicans will widely commend the successful conclusion of the  negotiations in Chiapas, as we regard national unity and peace  as the nation's path to progress.    As for us, we will continue onward with our proposal for  unity, the future, renewal, and the hope of a freer and more  just Mexico. The options are clear: Ours consists of a proposal  for a broad center, for the future, for democracy, and for  greater justice for all regions of our country, in all its  diversity and pluralism, so we can advance in the change the  people truly want. The other proposals belong to the past: a  past of statism, bureaucracy, inefficiency, irresponsibility,  populism, pessimism, acrimony, and resentment. Other proposals  represent an even more remote past, a past of privilege. They  only manage to offer government by the few for the few.  Because Mexico has changed and continues to change, we will  lead the country to the future it deserves by recognizing the  state's new role: the power of reform, strengthening federalism  and the balance of power with stability, and, most of all, with  the priority objective of bringing more justice and welfare to  the nation. In view of the above, I am today calling on all  Mexicans who support my proposal to join the campaign. I call on  you to join with conviction and enthusiasm. I am particularly  calling on those who hold a strong conviction for democratic  change and wish to promote a new consensus to transform the  country. I call on you to unite and join this program I have  proposed for the nation.    There is room for you in this campaign for the future. There  will be room, opportunities, and tasks to help reinforce the  nation for you in the government that we will win  democratically. The new organizations of society, the citizen  who is now seeking to contribute to the actions of a new  constructive and tolerant policy, should know that you will find  in me the firmest support now and in the years of toil we have  ahead to make Mexico great. Thank you. [end recording]</p>

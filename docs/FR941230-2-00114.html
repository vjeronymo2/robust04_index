			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By way of background, Phlx Rule 1014(g)(i), in conjunction with Rules 119 and 120, governs priority and parity in the execution of orders on the Phlx's equity and index options floor. When bids/offers are deemed simultaneous, such bid/offers are at ``parity,'' and subject to division among eligible participants in accordance with Exchange rules and procedures. The Commission recently approved two provisions to afford a specialist on parity with an enhanced participation in parity trades (``enhanced split''). <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34109 (May 25, 1994), 59 FR 28570 (June 2, 1994) (providing an enhanced parity split for new specialist units trading newly listed equity option classes) (``Exchange Act Release No. 34109''), and 34606 (August 26, 1994), 59 FR 45741 (September 2, 1994) (providing an enhanced parity split applying to specialists, other than new specialist units, for certain assigned equity option classes) (``Exchange Act Release No. 34606''). These provision were subsequently expanded to also include index option specialists. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 35028 (November 30, 1994), 59 FR 63151 (December 7, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One provision applies to ``new'' specialist units trading new option classes, and affords the specialist with a 40% split of parity trades for up to one year following the listing of each new class; except, where there is only one other ROT on parity, in which case, the specialist then receives a 50% split (``new unit/new option enhanced split''). <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The provision ensures, however, that no customer order on parity will be restricted to a smaller participation than any other crowd participant, including the specialist. The new unit/new option enhanced split is reflected in Commentary .17 to Rule 1014. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Exchange Act Release No. 34109, supra note 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second provision established an enhanced split for specialists, other than new specialists, on a one-year pilot basis, in certain option classes, whereby the specialist would be counted as two crowd participants in parity situations (``two-for-one enhanced split''). <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Similar to the new unit/new option split, no customer order on parity will be restricted to smaller participation than any other crowd participant, including the specialist. The two-for-one enhanced split only applies to orders for more than five contracts. Additionally, it applies to all option classes listed after adoption of the provision and to 50% of each specialist unit's pre-existing listed issues. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Exchange Act Release No. 34606, supra note 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, each specialist unit's issues are divided into quartiles based on the most recent quarterly contract volume; the specialist unit may choose one-half of the issues in each quartile, as long as the total number of issues does not exceed 50% of the unit's issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At this time, the Exchange proposes to amend the two-for-one split in situations where there are, in addition to the specialist, less than three controlled accounts on parity with the specialist. The term ``controlled account'' includes accounts controlled by or under common control with a member broker-dealers. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Thus, the proposal clarifies that all controlled account orders are subject to the enhanced split, not just ROT orders. The proposal retains the requirement that the enhanced split only applies to orders for more than five contracts. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See supra note 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telephone conversation between Michele Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, and Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, on December 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current language of Rule 1014(g)(i) and Commentary .17 thereto discuss the treatment of customer, ROT, and specialist orders in applying the enhance split. The purpose of this change is to clarify that ``firm'' orders are distinguishable from customer orders with respect to the enhanced split calculation. The Exchange represents that customer orders on parity will continue to be ensured their pro rata split in parity situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence </F> Movement, by David Megyeri; place and date not given:  "Slovak-Hungarian Chances"]    [Excerpt] Something has "moved" in Slovakia; we could  already sense this at the end of February and the beginning of  March while listening to statements of leading politicians. And  then the change came about: the fall of the Meciar government  and the establishment of the new Moravcik government, which let  it be felt from the first moment that it would like to implement  different politics, in a European spirit. We asked Miklos Duray  to analyze and assess the situation and the prospects for the  region. We first asked him about the chances of the Balladur  plan.    [Duray] Hungarians, especially those living outside Hungary,  have been particularly interested in the Balladur plan, which  now, since the summer of 1993, has the name of European  Stability Agreement in international politics. There are two  major reasons for this. One is that this plan carries the  possibility of a new peace treaty, which would actually mean  making peace after the Cold War. The other possibility is that,  through this, Hungarians living in their place of birth but  being stuck outside Hungary could receive some kind of  international settlement and guarantee. It is this second  possibility that particularly interests us, mainly because we  feel that, as a community, we were left out of the preparation  of this document. To remedy this, we turned to the then  Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall in the fall of 1993 and  informed him about our reservations. We mainly turned to him  because, at that time, both Romania and Slovakia completely  rejected the plan. In fact, in Slovakia, there was no dialogue  between the government and the Hungarians. Even then we thought  that this plan should be changed in such a way that the national  minorities would also be given an active role in it, or perhaps  in such a way that, within the given country, an agreement  should be arrived at between the government and the legitimate  representatives of the Hungarian communities on how the  situation of the Hungarians would be settled. However, another  way could be that the legitimate representatives of the  Hungarian communities participate in the bilateral talks between  the neighboring countries and in the preparation of bilateral  agreements. Antall's government promised that it would identify  with these proposals and [Prime Minister] Peter Boross's  government confirmed this.    [Megyeri] Do the international political forces support your  ideas?    [Duray] At the end of March, I held talks in Paris with a  number of French Government and Foreign Ministry experts, and  with politicians of the biggest government party, the Rally for  the Republic (RPR, Jacques Chirac's party). My impression is  that the solution that contains the agreement between the  government of the given party and the legitimate representatives  of the Hungarian communities may receive support. I also held  talks on this in Switzerland with the government in Bern. The  same solution was found to be acceptable here. Therefore, if  our suggestion is successful, huge possibilities will be opened  for us in connection with the Balladur plan--significantly  bigger possibilities than ever before in the past 75 years.    [Megyeri] What if you do not achieve the change of the plan?    [Duray] If our efforts are not successful, I openly admit  that it would be better not to have this plan at all. In that  case, a worse situation might be created than what emerged as a  result of the agreement on the protection of national  minorities, which was made in Saint Germain after World War I.    [Megyeri] I feel that what you have said about your talks  abroad gives grounds for cautious optimism. Can we also use the  term "cautious optimism" in connection with the statements of  the new Slovak Government?    [Duray] It is a fact that the current government cannot be  compared with the previous one, neither in a political sense nor  in terms of its human quality. There seems to be a huge  difference, and this is clearly in favor of the current  government. They are willing to hold talks with us. However,  it has to be known that they were not willing to include us in  the government. At the same time, it is also true that we are  having talks and we are invited members of the coalition  council. Before the government was established, we had agreed  with them on a set of demands laid down in eight points, as a  condition for our support of the current government. It seems  that, in many respects, the government is willing to implement  these. Talks are under way on the implementation of these  points. The government program will be submitted to parliament  for discussion on 12 April, and we hope there will be no reason  for us not to vote for it.    [Megyeri] In your view, what are the possibilities and  chances for the Moravcik government?    [Duray] Their possibilities are limited from two points of  view. One is the length of the government's mandate, and the  other is that the government is politically divided. In  addition to this, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia,  Meciar's party, which has fallen out of government, and its  partner, the Slovak National Party, and the Matica Slovenska  behind it, do everything they can to make any possible positive  steps of this government in our direction very difficult.

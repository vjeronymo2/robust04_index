			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Porsche family take step down TWO senior members of the Porsche family are to stand down from leading roles on the supervisory board of the troubled sports car maker to make way for 'an outstanding entrepreneurial personality' from the chemicals industry. Mr Helmut Sihler, former chairman of the management board at Henkel, was yesterday nominated as head of the Porsche supervisory board in succession to Mr Ferdinand 'FA' Porsche, who remains a full member of the board. Mr Sihler will also take over the board seat occupied by Mr Ferdinand 'Ferry' Porsche, the 83-year-old son of the company's founder, who will retain a role as honorary chairman. The changes mark a further development in the management culture at the group, which last year plunged into loss for the first time. Four months ago, Mr Arno Bohn was replaced as chief executive of the management board by Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, former production chief. They are likely to generate further speculation about Porsche's future. Mr 'Ferry' Porsche is regarded as one of the old guard, insisting Porsche remains independent. However, the group is tightly controlled by the founding family and the Piech family, related by marriage, which control 100 per cent of the voting shares and 40 per cent of the preference stocks.</p>

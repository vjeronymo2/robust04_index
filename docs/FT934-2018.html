			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Dumping accord proved a watershed - Clearer guidelines for deciding whether injury has been caused / Anti-Dumping Settlement last Sunday of a fiercely fought row over a US attempt to dilute international restraint on the use of anti-dumping laws was a watershed for the Round, and a clear signal the critical compromises were at last being made on all sides. Negotiators then realised that if disagreements as apparently intractable as those over anti-dumping could be resolved, the way was clear for other out-tanding disagreements to be settled. The gavel began falling almost immediately on the great majority of the Uruguay Round agreement. The new anti-dumping agreement provides for greater clarity and more detailed rules for deciding whether a product is dumped. It provides clearer guidelines for deciding whether injury is caused, and the procedures for anti-dumping invest-igation. It sets rules on how long anti-dumping actions can remain in force. On deciding whether a product is dumped, the agreement sets new rules for comparing the normal price of a product with the export price. It aims to curb practices of arbitrarily creating or inflating dumping margins. Among the new procedures, it will be easier for interested parties to present evidence in investigations. Preliminary and final findings in anti-dumping actions will be notified to interested parties promptly and in detail. This was in answer to complaints that Gatt panels were too secretive, and never revealed how they reached a conclusion. Labour unions as well as companies will be able to bring complaints to the attention of governments. But investigations will be terminated immediately if a dumping margin is found to be de minimis (defined as less than 2 per cent of the export price of the product) or if the volume of dumped goods is negligible - generally when the volume of dumped goods from an individual country account for less than 3 per cent of the imports of the product in question. Gatt panels estab-lished to examine the results of a dumping investigation will not be allowed to re-examine the facts of the case - the US was adamantly opposed to this power - but will be able to look at how the case was handled. Careful fudges have been needed to ensure that lobbies back home see the gains, rather than losses, that have been involved in the process. Of the changes demanded by the US to the text of the Uruguay round anti-dumping agreement, US negotiators will tell their domestic audience that it has scored eight out of 11. Its key 'victory' has been to win agreement over 'standards of review', where the US had been protesting at proposed new Gatt powers to re-examine not just the handling of a dumping case, but the facts presented to it. For opponents of the US proposals, there will be relief that demands for stricter anti-circumvention rules have been rejected, and that the 'sunset' clause forcing a dumping duty to expire after a certain number of years would be protected. The US will no longer be able to retain dumping duties indefinitely. Over 10 per cent of US dumping duties have been in place for more than 20 years. 'Trying to read this agreement is rather like reading goat's entrails,' one dumping negotiator commented. 'We will all be looking at the same thing, but the US will tell its domestic audience one thing, and others will tell their domestic lobbies another. He insisted that the compromise outcome 'is at least less ambiguous than the original US proposals'. For Gatt negotiators, the compromise is historic: 'Every previous deal has had to be imposed on countries with unreconciled disagreements,' he said: 'This is the first agreed text ever achieved in the area of anti-dumping,' one said.</p>

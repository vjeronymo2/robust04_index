			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State submitted a modeling demonstration using the EPA computer model, MOBILE5a, showing that the enhanced performance standard will be met in the area. The impact of the allowed program exemptions (for example, street rods and stock race cars) has been incorporated into the estimate of the program's effectiveness. In addition, in its May 26, 1994 and July 21, 1994 submittals, the DEP provided a commitment to maintain the level of compliance and waivers assumed in the modeling. The DEP also provided additional detail on this modeling effort, including justification for the modeling inputs assumed in the revised submittal. The effect of the ``low mileage'' waiver (LMW) was not evaluated in this modeling effort. One reason this action is a conditional approval is to allow the State to demonstrate that the effect of the LMW is negligible, or to fulfill its commitment to make necessary legislative and regulatory changes if such LMW affects the ability of the State to meet the performance standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Network Type and Program Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Act and EPA's I/M rule the SIP must include a description of the network to be employed, the required legal authority, and, in the case of areas making claims for case-by-case equivalency, the required demonstration. Also, for enhanced I/M areas, the SIP needs to include a description of the evaluation schedule and protocol, the sampling methodology, the data collection and analysis system, the resources and personnel for evaluation and related details of the evaluation program, as well as the legal authority establishing the evaluation program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maine has chosen to implement a test-only I/M network program design utilizing contractors to implement the inspection portion of the program. The State has chosen not to make a demonstration for case-by-case equivalency for a different network design, and has provided evidence that precludes conflicts of interest by the contractor, as described in the ``test-only'' requirements in the I/M rule. In its July 21, 1994 letter, the Maine DEP states, in its SIP revision narrative, that it will institute a continuous ongoing evaluation program consistent with the federal I/M rule. The results of the evaluation program will be reported to EPA on a biennial basis (40 CFR 51.353). In addition, Maine commits to developing and submitting the annual reports described by 40 CFR 51.366. Legal authority, already contained in Maine state law, authorizes the DEP to implement this contractor operated, test-only program and conduct the program evaluation, as necessary, to implement I/M consistent with federal requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. Adequate Tools and Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Act and EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of the resources that will be used for program operation and must discuss how the performance standard will be met, including: (1) A detailed budget plan describing the source of funds for personnel, program administration, program enforcement, purchase of necessary equipment (such as vehicles for undercover audits), and for other requirements discussed throughout the I/M rule, for the period prior to the next biennial self-evaluation required by the federal I/M rule, and (2) a description of personnel resources, the number of personnel dedicated to overt and covert auditing, data analysis, program administration, enforcement, and other necessary functions, and the training attendant to each function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current Maine legislation was effective July 12, 1993. The legislation authorizes the DEP to collect a fee from the I/M contractors to cover the costs of administrating, overseeing, and enforcing the I/M program, and provides for allocation of certain highway funds for implementation. As Maine committed in the May 28, 1994 letter, the July 21, 1994 submittal includes additional detail on the funding and description of resources to be used for implementation of the enhanced I/M program. This narrative describes the budget, staffing support, and equipment needed to implement the program. The revised regulations provide between a $2.00 and $4.00 fee per inspection to be used to administer the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

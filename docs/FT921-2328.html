			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: The smoke clears at BAT 26.5) Not too many UK composite insurers boosted their payout by 8 per cent last year, which raises the question of whether the London stock market needs to look at BAT Industries in a fresh light. The obsession with Eagle Star, after all, has twice wrong footed investors, initially in the first part of last year when the shares raced ahead on misplaced hopes of a turn in the insurance cycle, latterly as panic set in that Royal's horrendous mortgage guarantee losses might prise open a new can of worms at the ill fated BAT subsidiary. Tobacco and insurance may not be everyone's idea of solid long term businesses. But with signs that the worst is over for Eagle Star, and tobacco as defiant as ever in the face of the obituarists, BAT's simultaneous ambition to increase dividends ahead of inflation and rebuild cover looks eminently feasible, a 7 per cent prospective yield hardly demanding. Eagle Star's losses may be enormous  - and even Pounds 300m is an understatement were the company to report its figures like the composites  - but at least there is a chance of break even by the end of this year and a return to profitability in 1993. The recovery in earnings will be all the greater for stemming the write offs in ACT. BAT may still be hiding its blushes, but when the insurance shake-out is complete the company will make much more money than its financially weakened competitors. BAT's relative balance sheet strength, of course, stems from the tobacco cash flow, which last year benefited from an improved US market share, the relaxation of price controls in Brazil, and galloping exports from the UK. The US Supreme Court's pending ruling on product liability is a genuine puff of smoke over the shares  - but on the not unreasonable assumption this goes the industry's way, US investors would again become serious buyers.</p>

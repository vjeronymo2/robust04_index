			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (9): Wider still and wider - More countries are queueing to join THE deepening of the European Community brought about by the single market also marks a step towards its enlargement. During the second half of the 1980s, the EC became an attractive magnet for applicants outside its borders. Three members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) - Austria, Sweden and Finland - are due to start EC entry negotiations during the next few weeks, with a fourth country, Norway, getting down to talks this spring. Their aim is to become full EC members by 1995. These four states, together with the other three Efta members - Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein - were due from January 1 to have formed with the EC the European Economic Area (EEA) - a free trade entity seen now as encompassing a waiting room for full EC membership. The start of the EEA has been delayed until the second half of the year. This follows Switzerland's referendum rejection of the EEA last month - a decision motivated by Swiss voters' fears that the EEA would bring a dilution of their prosperity and stability. Assuming the other Efta states go ahead with ratification, the EEA will now link only 18 states, rather than the 19 (including Switzerland) originally planned. Under the EEA, the regulatory framework of the single market is to be transferred practically wholesale to Efta - which is to adopt EC rules on competition, company law, consumer protection, education, the environment, research and development and social policies. The Efta countries are to set up their own enforcement body with powers over Efta territory. The Swiss 'No,' by a small majority of the electorate and a larger majority of cantons, was not unexpected. In view of Switzerland's entrenched neutrality and its unique system of direct democracy, there was even some quiet relief among some Brussels officials,who feared that Switzerland's special features might have made it the cuckoo in the EEA nest. The No necessitates a time-consuming revision of the EC-EEA treaty meant to have come into force this month. Efta states will have to renegotiate funding of Ecu2bn over five years due to be channelled to the EC's poorer regions under the terms of the EEA accord. According to initial indications, the six Efta states still in favour of the EEA are asking the EC to accept a simple reduction of the Swiss contribution. This has sparked hostility, above all from Spain. Other Efta countries have also, like Switzerland, witnessed a cooling of electoral enthusiasm about EC membership. Because these Efta members will themselves be holding EC referendums during the next few years, further Swiss-style setbacks cannot be ruled out. Public opinion in Sweden and Finland, both in the grip of severe recession, has become less keen on the EC - reluctance which has probably been increased by the European currency turbulence in the closing months of 1992 which led to large devaluations of the Swedish krona and the Finnish markka. There are also considerable doubts whether the Norwegian electorate will give its blessing to the EC link-up. Memories are still strong of the Norwegian referendum rejection of EC membership in 1972. However, if neighbouring Denmark surmounts its problems over Maastricht with a Yes to the treaty in the new referendum being held this spring, this will ease some of the public opinion obstacles confronting the other Nordic states. Despite the Swiss vote, the momentum towards EC enlargement is now unstoppable. The main reason behind Efta's desire for full membership is political rather than economic. The EEA confronts Efta states with EC legislation over which they have no control. In a narrow financial sense, full EC membership will bring the Efta countries additional burdens. Because their per capita income is well above the EC average, all current EC applicants among the Efta states would be large net contributors to the Community budget. But the wish to play a full part in the political development of the Community - possible only if they are fully within it - appears to be paramount. Even for Switzerland, which in the words of EC officials opted for 'isolation' last month, the door to EC membership is not closed for all time. Mr Helmut Kohl, the perennially optimistic German Chancellor, believes that the Swiss electorate will eventually come round to accepting that joining the EC is in their country's best interests. For several reasons, the Nordic and Alpine countries on the EC fringes generally believe they would suffer disadvantages if the EC forged ahead without them towards greater political and economic integration. The inconveniences include the prospect of lower economic growth, as well as the likelihood that investments and jobs would flow towards the EC core. The London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research last autumn estimated that membership of the EEA was likely to boost growth in Efta by 5 per cent over the next few years. Most Efta nations - especially those with the status of neutral countries - are much more wary about the idea of Europe moving towards full-scale political union, involving pooling of powers in areas such as defence or criminal law. But there is considerable sympathy for the concept of greater political co-operation in fields such as immigration policy. And the Nordic states - in spite of, and partly because of, the autumn turbulence - are among Europe's most fervent devotees of monetary union. This enthusiasm is not shared in Switzerland. In view of the Swiss franc's habitual hard currency status, the Swiss are no more eager to give it up for a single European currency than the Germans are their D-Mark. With the anticipated entry of the Efta states in the mid-1990s, the EC's enlargement process will still be a long way from complete. Hungary, Poland, the Czech lands and Slovakia are waiting in the wings, while Malta, Cyprus and Turkey have longer-standing applications. However, all these states in the ante-room will certainly have to wait until the next century before they can accede to full membership. In the meantime, they have little choice but to persist along the hard path of restructuring their economies and overhauling their political institutions. The non-Efta applicants see the EC above all as a means of bolstering their economies and encouraging financial transfers from the wealthier countries of Europe. The EC, however, views membership chiefly as a reward for economic achievement, rather than as a precondition for it. All these poorer states face an uncomfortable, somewhat paradoxical, truth. Before they can join Europe's rich man's club, they will have to become richer themselves - by registering up to a decade of higher-than-average growth.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: GA gains on broker upgrade A CHANGE of heart by one securities house led to a good showing by insurer General Accident against the generally weak market, the stock rising 9 before ending a net 4 up at 472p. Smith New Court upgraded its stance on the stock to a short-term buy from a hold and improved its forecast for this year to break-even from a previously predicted loss of Pounds 30m. Mr Steven Bird, Smith's insurance analyst, said: 'We think that, ahead of interims on August 11, the composites will see further strength, in particular General Accident. The market has underestimated the speed of recovery, particularly in the UK, and with GA's yield being 7.6 per cent investors will be increasingly confident that the dividend will be maintained.' Elsewhere in the sector, Commercial Union was firm at 499p and Sun Alliance hardened a penny to 319p. Dixons firm Dixons, up a penny at 253p, failed to gain much advantage from news that its Belgian property subsidiary had refinanced an office development in Brussels for Pounds 93m. The group cannot make any profit from the deal until the building is sold, because of a recent preliminary accounting standards draft, but its subsidiary, Codic, can book a profit immediately. Mr Andy Hughes, analyst at Nomura, said the net contribution to Dixons was likely to be less than hoped, however, and could produce a downgrading in profits forecasts. He has cut the estimate for 1992/93 to Pounds 97.5m from Pounds 108m. Holiday groups hit A gloomy prognosis of overcapacity and tight margins in the holiday industry hit the two leading listed package tour groups. Threats of an all-out price war have been simmering for some time, with market leader Thomson promising to protect its market share in the face of possible discounting by its nearest rivals, Airtours and Owners Abroad. Yesterday, industry figures showing 1.5m spare places unlikely to be filled this summer sent shivers through the sector, with nervous investors only too aware of the industry's reputation for fallen operators. Airtours weakened 18 to 274p and Owners 7 to 81p. Notepaper and labels producer Porter Chadburn was the most heavily traded stock on the London market yesterday as company broker SG Warburg Securities crossed more than 12m shares between one institution and a number of others. The shares were traded at 30p each in two blocks of 9m apiece and two blocks of 3.3m shortly before the market closed. Porter's two biggest shareholders are Gartmore Investment and Equitable Life. Traders said 12m shares would represent about 13 per cent of the company's equity and added that a large stake had been overhanging the market for some time. Over the past week Porter has slipped from 45p and yesterday, before the trade was carried out, the shares lost 5 to 32p. Figures from Cable and Wireless ahead of expectations and an impressive analysts meeting with management lifted the shares 20 to 560p. Mr Robert Millington at BZW liked the trend in Mercury margins, although he expressed disappointment at the slow growth in the business customer base. He has left his pre-tax profits forecast at Pounds 740m for next year, while Mr Jim Ross at Hoare Govett has raised his figure by Pounds 10m to Pounds 770m, pointing to 'the particularly strong growth potential in Mercury's residential market'. Dividend worries returned to British Aerospace and the shares gave up some of Tuesday's rally to finish 9 down at 293p. The announcement of a new chief executive at APV, after a six-month period without one, helped the shares firm 2 to 122p. News of recovery in its spares business continued to boost Rolls-Royce, which put on 3 to 169p. Bargain hunters were seen in Lep Group, 2 higher at 6 1/4 p. A 62 per cent interim profits fall to Pounds 8.2m at office and photographic equipment distributor Gestetner sent the shares retreating 6 to 133p. BET moved ahead 10 to 154p after broker SG Warburg reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. NFC gained 10 to 251p after reporting interim figures static at Pounds 39.5m and holding a positive analysts meeting. Mr Dan White at County NatWest said: 'These are good results in a soft economy.' However, he trimmed his full-year forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 95m. County also downgraded a number of other stocks in the sector. These included Associated British Ports, in which the broker cut its estimate by Pounds 11m to Pounds 55m, and the shares fell 10 to 329p. A sizeable line of stock was also reported to be overhanging ABP. Boots rose 12 to 447p as analysts decided that the recent weakness had overestimated the effect of promotion costs involving the Manoplax drug, and did not take sufficient account of Boot's confidence in its prospects. County NatWest said it was satisfied that some cost increases expressed in the company's recent results had appeared distorted. A rise of 5 1/2 to 95 1/2 p in Next prompted some speculation about a possible bid. Turnover was a hefty 5.1m shares. A decline of 14 to 583p for Guinness, on above-average turnover of 2.9m shares, and of 11 to 658p for Allied-Lyons, in relatively thin trading, were the main features in the drinks sector. An analysts meeting in France with LVMH, involved in a 24 per cent joint share agreement with Guinness, indicated concern about the level of spirit sales in Japan, while Allied was said to be soft after a recent good rise. Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham were depressed in late trading by a profits warning from US pharmaceutical group Upjohn. The former retreated 25 to 710p and SmithKline was 18 lower at 871p. Mining company RTZ gained in a weaker market in response to a rise in copper prices and a stoppage at Poland's big state-owned KGHM copper mine. A technical squeeze also pushed the shares higher, finally 7 up at 630p. A presentation by ICI today encouraged the shares to recover 5 to 1271p. A weak dollar and some US selling was blamed for a poor performance by the oil majors. BP continued its downward trend to end 4 1/2 off at 253 1/2 p, but where, said traders, it was beginning to see support. Shell declined 5 to 510p. Rumours of a downgrade left Forte 4 cheaper at 214p. Thorn EMI suffered a fall of 8 to 825p on the back of a profits warning by Philips, the Dutch electronics group. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (32).

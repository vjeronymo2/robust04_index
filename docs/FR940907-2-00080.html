Box 1233, Charleston, West Virginia 25324 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its Tygart River Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;03805) located in Marion County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating conditions in certain areas of the return air course, traveling the affected area in its entirety would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to establish five evaluation check points; to have a certified person monitor for hazardous conditions, the volume and direction of airflow, and the methane and oxygen concentrations in the affected area at each check point on a weekly basis; to record the results in a manner similar to that required by the mandatory standard; and to locate a date board at each evaluation point which the examiner would initial and record the date and time of the examination. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> INDONESIA;  </P> <P> POPE VISITS REMOTE ISLAND OF FLORES  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II received a tumultuous welcome in the Roman Catholic heartland  of Muslim-dominated Indonesia as he took his pilgrimage to the remote island of  Flores, where 85% of the 633,000 residents are Catholic. Cheering  schoolchildren lined the road from the airport to the soccer stadium where the  Pope celebrated Mass before more than 100,000 people. The crowd repeatedly  chanted in Indonesian "Hidup bapok Pauk" or "Long live the Pope." John Paul is  on the third day of his six-day visit to Indonesia. His next stop is the island  of East Timor.  </P></p>

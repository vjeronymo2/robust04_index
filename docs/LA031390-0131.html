			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COSBYS SEEKING TRUSTEE OVER DISPUTED FUNDS;  </P> <P> LAW: ATTORNEYS FOR COMEDIAN AND HIS WIFE WILL BE IN COURT TODAY TRYING TO WREST  CONTROL OF $10 MILLION IN ASSETS HELD BY THEIR FORMER BUSINESS MANAGER.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles federal bankruptcy judge is expected to hear arguments today from  attorneys for comedian Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille, on a motion to appoint  a trustee to oversee $10 million in assets held by the Cosbys' ex-business  manager.  </P> <P> The Cosbys sued their longtime manager, Mary Waller, last fall for allegedly  embezzling more than $8.5 million from the Cosbys during her eight-year tenure  as chief financial officer of SAH Enterprises, the Cosbys' Santa Monica-based  personal services corporation.  </P> <P> In November, Waller filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code. The Cosbys then filed a motion with bankruptcy Judge Arthur  Greenwald to declare Waller incompetent to manage her finances on grounds that  she uses cocaine and that she misappropriated the Cosbys' money.  </P> <P> Waller has denied using cocaine and maintains that all money, property and  tangible goods she received from the Cosbys over the last decade were  rightfully earned.  </P> <P> According to court records, it was nearly a year ago that Camille Cosby phoned  ahead to ready the Cosbys' private airplane for a trip, only to discover that  Waller had used it to fly to New York.  </P> <P> It was that incident, according to documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court  last week, that launched the Cosbys' investigation, suspension and -- as of  last July -- dismissal of the 46-year-old Waller.  </P> <P> "She commissioned the investigation of Waller because if Waller could do  something as terrible (Ms. Cosby's description) as taking the airplane without  Ms. Cosby's consent, she could only imagine what other terrible things Waller  may have done," Waller's attorney, Richard Pachulski, said in court documents.  </P> <P> He maintained that Waller, who was a close family friend as well as a trusted  employee, was an unwitting victim, caught in the middle of an intrigue between  a husband and wife who consistently kept secrets from each other.  </P> <P> "Ironically, Ms. Cosby believed the airplane had been used by Waller for  personal reasons when, in fact, the airplane had been used . . . to perform  services for Mr. Cosby on a home that was to be a surprise for Ms. Cosby,"  Pachulski said. Waller couldn't defend herself "because Mr. Cosby had sworn her  to secrecy regarding the house," he said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, an investigation was launched, culminating in Waller's dismissal.  </P> <P> "Over the past seven years, Waller engaged in a consistent pattern of  conversion, misappropriation and embezzlement," Cosby attorney David Dykhouse  wrote in his own summary of the case, filed in bankruptcy court three months  ago.  </P> <P> Because the Cosbys traveled extensively, they maintained a "California Exchange  Account" at Wells Fargo Bank and gave Waller check-signing authority, said  Dykhouse. Over the last decade, the Cosbys contend in their lawsuit that Waller  "spent approximately $5 million on her own personal affairs without (their)  consent."  </P> <P> All told, the Cosbys estimated her alleged misappropriation in cash and goods  at more than $8.5 million.  </P> <P> In a declaration filed last Dec. 5, the 52-year-old star of NBC's "The Cosby  Show" detailed a list of suspect canceled checks and petty cash receipts listed  in Waller's books on the refurbishing of Camille's "surprise" brownstone at 18  E. 71st St. in New York City's affluent upper eastside.  </P> <P> According to Cosby, money earmarked for the brownstone went instead for such  things as:  </P> <P>  -- Remodeling Waller's $3-million home at 620 Round Hill Road in Greenwich,  Ct. ($61,280 paid to Archtype Studios);  </P> <P>  -- Waller's cook ($385);  </P> <P>  -- Tickets to a dinner/dance at the Greenwich Polo Club ($550) and a "gala  benefit" for the Islamic Cultural Society, held at New York's Plaza Hotel  ($300);  </P> <P>  -- An electric clothes rack for Waller's house ($1,129).  </P> <P> Waller also spent $140,650 out of "petty cash" between February and November,  1988, on business-related expenses, such as a $300 tip for the pilot of the  Cosbys' airplane, according to Cosby's court statement.  </P> <P> Non-business-related "petty cash" expenditures totaled $17,340.61, according to  the declaration, and included payments to manicurists, dry cleaners,  pharmacists and veterinarians along with purchases of lingerie, bird and dog  toys, fish, and playthings for Waller's son, Emon.  </P> <P> But, according to Waller's attorneys, at least a significant portion of those  expenditures was part of her regular compensation as the Cosbys' financial  manager, confidante and business partner.  </P> <P> "As a consequence of the significant position that Waller held with the Cosbys  . . . Waller received compensation levels, including bonus, of approximately $1  million each year," Pachulski said.  </P> <P> During a hearing last week before Judge Greenwald, the Cosbys' attorneys  maintained that Waller's W-2 forms for the past two years showed that her  annual salary was $700,000.  </P> <P> But according to Pachulski, the Cosbys also paid many of Waller's personal  expenses because she worked out of her homes in Connecticut and Malibu.  </P> <P> "To further acknowledge the Cosbys' dependence on and satisfaction with  Waller's service during the period of her employment," wrote Pachulski, the  Cosbys:  </P> <P>  -- Paid off Waller's $570,000 mortgage on her residence at 29441 Pacific Coast  Highway in Malibu;  </P> <P>  -- Guaranteed a $3.2-million unsecured line of credit for her with City  National Bank;  </P> <P>  -- Loaned her $70,000 per month from December, 1988, through May, 1989, "with  no evidencing promissory note or discussion of terms or interest rate on the  loan," said Pachulski. Further, he said, Waller maintains that the monthly  loans were part of her compensation, not money to be paid back.  </P> <P> Waller also had to use her own money to help cover the Cosbys' lavish spending  habits, "because the Cosbys were notorious for having their bank accounts  overdrawn in as much as seven figure amounts," Pachulski wrote.  </P> <P> In her own deposition, according to Pachulski, Camille Cosby admitted to having  discovered an overdraw of $1.4 million at one time, but added that she was not  aware that it had happened until after the fact.  </P> <P> With regard to the Cosbys' charges that Waller uses cocaine, the former  business manager has submitted to drug testing, but the findings have been  disputed.  </P> <P> "The conclusion that Waller is an abuser of cocaine is not far-fetched since  most everyone who has had some contact with her describes her as a volatile,  extremely emotional, overanxious, irritable and irrational person -- traits  that are frequently applied to users of cocaine," the Cosbys' attorneys wrote  in a request for Judge Greenwald to order chemical testing to see if Waller  used drugs.  </P> <P> In a sworn declaration, Laura Walker, the office manager for the Cosbys' law  firm -- Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler -- told of how she had come across a  "white, powdery substance" secreted in an intricately folded piece of paper  among the financial records that the law firm confiscated from Waller's home  last fall. When Walker took it to the police to have it tested, she was told  that a test could not be conducted without charges having been filed. The  police then disposed of the substance, Walker testified.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Greenwald ordered Waller to submit hair and urine samples to  the Cosbys' attorneys for drug testing, and to undergo a psychological  evaluation to determine her competence in managing her financial affairs during  her bankruptcy reorganization. She complied with the drug testing and the  results were negative.  </P> <P> But Cosby lawyer Eugene Galernter complained to Greenwald last Thursday that  Waller had dyed and cut her hair shortly before providing the hair sample,  possibly affecting the results. He asked that she be re-tested. Greenwald has  not yet responded to that request.  </P> <P> Galernter also said that Waller has lied on credit card applications about such  basic personal information as her Social Security number, place of birth and  age.  </P> <P> Eli Chiu, the controller for SAH Enterprises, said in a sworn statement to the  court that Waller was often angry, subject to wild mood swings and very  difficult to work with.  </P> <P> During last Thursday's hearing, Pachulski called the Cosbys' attempt to  discredit Waller "a witch hunt" whose real intent was to keep Waller from  revealing the Cosbys' "bizarre" financial dealings.  </P> <P> "Apparently, these people paid out millions of dollars without contracts,"  Pachulski said. "Many of (the transactions) Mr. Cosby kept secret from Mrs.  Cosby for reasons unknown to me."  </P></p>

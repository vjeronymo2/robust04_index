			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Losses at Dwyer surge to Pounds 6.9m DWYER, a property invest-ment company, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.94m for the year to September 30, compared with a Pounds 3.89m deficit the previous year. Last month Mr Desmond Bloom, chairman and chief executive, resigned to cut the company's overheads. Mr Joey Esfandi and Mr Peter Andrews, director of Winglaw Group which owns 15.5 per cent of Dwyer, became chief executive and property director, respectively. Mr Anthony Kirwan became non-executive chairman. The increased loss was largely due to a Pounds 5.39m exceptional item, which included a Pounds 4.78m provision against the falling value of its investment properties. The results were also depressed by a rise in interest costs from Pounds 4.89m to Pounds 5.49m which helped offset a rise in operating profits from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 3.94m. During the year, property disposals reduced group borrowings by Pounds 6m. The company's net worth fell to Pounds 21.5m, or a net asset value of 83p per share. The loss per share was 24.75p (13.27p). No dividend will be paid.</p>

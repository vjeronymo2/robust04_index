			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Trust and the Existing Pilgrim Funds are registered open-end management investment companies. The Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pilgrim Group, Inc., provides investment management services to the Trust and the Existing Pilgrim Funds. The Distributor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pilgrim Group, Inc. and a registered broker/dealer, acts as principal underwriter for the Trust and the Existing Pilgrim Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Under the Prior Order, the Existing Pilgrim Funds currently offer two classes of shares (``Class A'' shares and ``Class B'' shares). Class A (or the ``Front-End Load Option'') shares are subject to a front-end sales load and an annual fee of up to .25% of the average daily net asset value of such shares under a distribution plan adopted under rule 12b&hyph;1 of the Act (``12b&hyph;1 Plan''). Class B shares are subject to a CDSC ranging from 3% to 5% (but which may be higher or lower) for a period of up to six years. Class B shares also are subject to an annual fee of up to 1% of the average daily net asset value of such shares under a 12b&hyph;1 Plan. All references to Class A shares and Class B shares are to such classes of shares currently offered under the Prior Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants propose to amend the Prior Order to enable the Funds to offer a multiple class distribution system as described below (the ``Multi-Class System''). Under the Multi-Class System, in addition to the Class A and Class B shares, applicants will offer a third class of shares (``Class C''). Class C shares would have a higher minimum initial purchase amount, and would be subject to a CDSC expected to be equal to 1% during the first year after the initial purchase, and no CDSC thereafter. Class C shares also would be subject to an annual fee of up to 1% of the average daily net asset value of such shares under a 12b&hyph;1 Plan (collectively with Class B, the ``Deferred Option''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The 1% distribution fee applicable to Deferred Option shares is a combination of asset-based sales charges and service fees assessed under a 12b&hyph;1 Plan. In all cases applicants will comply with Article III, Section 26 of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Rules of Fair Practice as it relates to the maximum amount of asset-based sales charges and service fees that may be imposed. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30897 (July 7, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Under the Multi-Class System, applicants also from time to time may create one or more additional classes of shares, the terms of which may differ from the Class A shares, Class B shares, and Class C shares only in the following respects: (a) Each class may bear different fees payable under the applicable 12b&hyph;1 Plans, or different fees payable under a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan (``Shareholder Services Plan''), (b) each class may bear different Class Expenses, as defined below, (c) each class will vote separately with respect to a Fund's 12b&hyph;1 Plan, (d) each class may have different exchange privileges, and (e) each class may have a different designation. Shares of different classes may be sold under different sales arrangements (including, for example, subject to a front-end sales charge, a CDSC, or no sales load). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Each class of shares of the Funds will bear,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  based on the relative net asset value of the respective classes, all of the expenses of the Funds except that each class will bear different Class Expenses and the holders of Deferred Option shares will bear a proportionately higher share of the distribution fee than the holders of the Front-End Load Option shares. Class Expenses shall be limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees (including the incremental cost of monitoring a CDSC applicable to a specific class of shares), (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class, (iii) SEC and blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (v) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of shares, (vi) trustees'/directors' fees incurred or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class of shares, (vii) accounting fees and expenses relating to a specific class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Because of the additional expenses that will be borne solely by the Deferred Option shares, the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on the Deferred Option shares for financial statement reporting purposes is expected to be lower than the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on Class A shares. For tax purposes, however, the difference between the distribution fees payable by Deferred Option shares and the distribution fees payable by Class A shares ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  up to .75%) is not deductible and will be charged to the Deferred Option shares' paid-in-capital. As a result, Deferred Option shares will be receiving dividends which in part can be considered return of capital under the SEC's financial reporting rules. It is therefore expected that the net asset value per share of the multiple classes will diverge over time. Assuming no change in existing tax laws or relevant interpretations of the SEC's financial reporting rules, any Fund that issues two or more classes of shares similarly will capitalize rule 12b&hyph;1 fees for tax purposes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

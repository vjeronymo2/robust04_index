			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appeal Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Technical Amendments of 1993 amended section 435(a) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) of the HEA as those sections relate to institutional appeals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of cohort default rates. These amendments are not reflected in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this NPRM but will be addressed separately. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to remove the provision that provides that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may appeal its loss of participation in the FFEL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs under the provisions of this section on the grounds that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution has reduced its cohort default rate for each of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the two most recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated a cohort default rate for that institution by 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the amount by which its cohort default rate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous year exceeds the applicable threshold percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in this section. This provision is no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable because it was limited to notices of loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility that were received by an institution in the fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year that ended September 30, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations allow an institution to appeal its loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of participation in the FFEL programs under the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section on the grounds that, for any twenty-four month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period ending not more than six months prior to the date the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution submits its appeal, two-thirds or more of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's students who are enrolled on at least a half-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis are individuals from disadvantaged economic backgrounds as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by documentary evidence submitted by the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as a Pell Grant Index of zero, or an AGI of less than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poverty level, as determined by criteria developed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Health and Human Services. The Secretary proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the term ``such as'' be eliminated to reflect the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice; i.e., the institution must establish the grounds for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its appeal based only on the information specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The Department would only accept the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence listed in the regulations although the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations suggest that other evidence is acceptable. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change reflects the current practice of the Secretary. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary solicits comment on other acceptable forms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Student Loan Reform Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66) amended the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cohort default rate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to include Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consolidation Loans which are used to repay Federal Stafford and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal SLS loans. The Secretary proposes to amend this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reflect this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Definitions applicable to this section would be revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect changes to the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cohort default rate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 435(m) of the HEA. In accordance with the statute, as in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the past, for any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> former students at the institution enter repayment on Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stafford or Federal SLS program loans received for attendance at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution, the cohort default rate is the percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those current and former students who enter repayment in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal year on Federal Stafford or Federal SLS program loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received for attendance at that institution who default before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of the following fiscal year. Formerly, for any fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's current and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> former students entered repayment on a Federal Stafford or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal SLS loans received for attendance at the institution, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cohort default rate was the average over the three most recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal years of the rates calculated in the manner described for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter repayment on a Federal Stafford or Federal SLS program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan. The HEA now requires that, for any fiscal year in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fewer than 30 of the institution's current and former students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter repayment, the cohort default rate is the percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those current and former students who entered repayment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Stafford loans or Federal SLS loans in any of the three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most recent fiscal years who default before the end of the fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year in which they entered repayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to make clear that the issue of improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan servicing is only part of the appeal process and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relate to the Secretary's initial release of cohort default  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates. Thus, in issuing the rates initially, the Secretary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not obligated to consider allegations of improper loan servicing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to reflect this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change by removing the requirement that the Secretary must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclude any loans that, due to improper servicing or collection,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cohort default rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 435(m) of the HEA requires the addition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that a Federal SLS loan not be considered to enter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment until after the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an educational program leading to a degree or certificate at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible institution on at least a half-time basis (as determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the institution) and ceased to be in a period of forbearance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on that enrollment. Section 435(m) further requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each eligible lender of a Federal SLS loan to provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agency with the information necessary to determine when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loan entered repayment for purposes of this definition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires the guaranty agency to provide that information to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Brussels' green sprouts: Environment policy is unlikely to fall victim to European decentralisation Reports of the death of the European Community's environment policy - supposedly rolled back and crushed by Europe's new enthusiasm for 'subsidiarity' or decentralised decision-making - look premature. Yesterday's meeting of EC environment ministers kicked off discussion on the European Commission's green strategy for 1990s - a programme dubbed 'Towards Sustainability'. Ministers also decided waste for disposal was not an ordinary tradeable good, and referred the new right to ban waste imports to the environmental articles of the EC treaty, rather than those on the internal market and trade. This was a rare instance of environment needs taking precedence over the free circulation of goods within the EC's single market. The environment council was the first since Danish voters shook the EC to its foundations by rejecting the Maastricht treaty in June. It was also the first since the flamboyant Carlo Ripa di Meana's departure as environment commissioner at the end of the same month, amid rumblings of a bonfire of the nearly 200 pieces of EC environment law enacted in the past two decades. Mr Ripa di Meana's successor, Mr Karel Van Miert, says he still fears the environment could be made 'the sacrificial lamb' in the power struggle between Brussels and the member states about reining in EC decision-making. But there are at least four persuasive reasons to suggest environment policy will be rebalanced rather than gutted: When EC leaders are desperately trying to recapture public support for European integration, it would be politically unwise to start by junking a policy which commands overwhelming public support. The evidence suggests EC citizens look to Europe to protect their environment from pollution and degradation. So far this year Europeans have registered more than 500 complaints with Brussels, against 350 in all of last year. 'It has been a successful policy and perceived as such, and therefore it should be pursued,' Mr Van Miert insists. The environment is a policy area especially well-suited to a cross-frontier approach. The greener-than-thou Nordic and Alpine countries - first in the queue to join the Community - will strongly reinforce such an approach. The still nebulous subsidiarity principle, suggesting the EC should act only when supranational decisions are more appropriate than national or local action, could have been invented for the environment. All member states to some degree recognise that if the EC does not maintain a common environmental policy, standards will diverge between the richer north and poorer south. Non-tariff barriers to trade will creep into the single market, holding up the free flow of goods. Companies will be enveloped in multiple layers of national law, instead of common standards. The three countries most bruised by the debate over Maastricht - Denmark, the UK, and France - all back an EC environment policy. Indeed, Danish voters want more Community involvement; their fear that the EC would dilute their high environmental standards was part of the anti-treaty backlash. France, for its part, largely forced yesterday's decision on waste imports, and its Socialist government faces not only defeat by the centre-right in next spring's elections, but erosion from the green parties. The British government currently holds the EC presidency (to be succeeded in January by Denmark). It wants the 'Towards Sustainability' programme approved by December, and a 'greening' of other EC policies from transport to energy. More intrusively, the UK also supports the formation of an EC 'green police', a Community inspectorate to assure national enforcement of common standards. One way Mr Van Miert wants to diffuse the subsidiarity controversy is by placing greater onus on national courts to enforce implementation of EC law, removing the Commission from the firing line as a sort of court of appeal. Rows over implementation of EC law obscure the fact that only three cases of environment legislation have not been agreed unanimously by the 12. None the less, the rising cost of environmental standards during recession is posing a real threat to Europe's green dimension. Market instruments loom large in the Commission's programme for the 1990s. These range from the expensive energy tax to limit the carbon dioxide emissions which cause global warming, to the EC 'Eco-label' endorsing environment-friendly goods. Mr Van Miert points out that the energy tax proposal is full of safeguards for energy intensive industries. He recognises the difficult economic climate but says: 'As far as I know there is no alternative.' Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, is expected to tear up 10 to 20 'unjustified' Brussels proposals at December's EC summit in Edinburgh. If the energy tax were among them, the EC's green lobby would rightly think the tide had turned against them. But Mr Delors himself believes the jobs and growth of the future lie in developing energy-efficient, environmentally-friendly technology and production - an argument passionately advanced by Mr Van Miert. 'It would be counter-productive at the end of the day to use cost as an argument for standing still. That will not get us expansion in the long run.'</p>

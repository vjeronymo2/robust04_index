The EIS will describe the potential impacts of the proposed reestablishment of the Little Rock open-pit copper mining project located approximately 10 miles southwest of Silver City in Grant County, New Mexico. The proposed Little Rock Project would reestablish an open-pit copper mining operation at a site that was developed and operated sporadically between the 1950 <!-- PJG 0256 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; and 1972. The proposed Little Rock Project would resume mining operations at the site and would have a projected operating life of between 2 and 4 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The public is invited to participate in the planning process.

Since it was indicated by the BLM that the preparation of an EIS would likely be required, no Environmental Assessment (EA) was done. Instead, Phelps Dodge agreed to proceed in preparing an EIS and completed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between themselves, the BLM, and the United States Forest Service (USFS) outlining the responsibilities of each party to the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Phelps Dodge and the current owner, MM Holdings of San Jose, California, have entered into a lease-purchase agreement whereby Phelps Dodge has an option to purchase the Little Rock property pending a successful effort on its part to obtain the necessary environmental and operating permits and approvals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Little Rock mine is a small oxide copper deposit located approximately 1 mile west of the existing Phelps Dodge mining operation at Tyrone, New Mexico. It has operated sporadically, most recently between 1970 and 1972, producing copper via leaching and subsequent copper cementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed in the POO, the project would be a conventional open-pit mining operation with a daily production rate of as high as 160,000 tons for a period of between 2 and 4 years. No processing or waste disposal facilities are planned for the project area. All material mined will be transported to the existing Tyrone mine facilities via a haul road to be constructed from the Tyrone mine to the project site. Overburden or other inert, non-mineralized materials will be transported to the existing Tyrone tailing dams for use as cover material for tailing dam closure or stockpiled for reclamation of the site. All leachable material will be processed at existing permitted processing sites at the Tyrone mine. All solid wastes generated at the Little Rock mine will be transported to and disposed of at existing permitted facilities at the Tyrone mine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No permanent facilities will be constructed for the operations proposed under this Plan, with the possible exception of dewatering facilities if required by the New Mexico State Engineer or the New Mexico Environment Department. Minimal associated facilities specific to future mining of this site will be required and will consist of a temporary office trailer, a dewatering system, a water pipeline and fill station to provide water for dust suppression, a 46kV power distribution system, and a fuel dock. All these facilities will be transported or aligned along the proposed haul road or existing routes and will be removed upon completion of mining.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All mine overburden (waste) will be hauled off-site to be stockpiled on private property on top of existing, permitted Phelps Dodge tailing piles located northeast of the site. All suitable leach material mined from the site will be hauled to existing, permitted leach facilities on Phelps Dodge property. Existing leach and waste stockpiles from prior mining activities on the site would also be removed to these sites or remediated in-place, as required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Remaining waste products from the mining operations will be negligible since maintenance, office, and managerial functions will be located at the Tyrone mine. The Little Rock mine and associated facilities will be provided with trash dumpsters and will utilize the existing Tyrone solid waste landfill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reclamation of some items ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  removal of existing foundations, stockpiles and trash) would be done prior to, or concurrent with, mining activities. All existing debris would be transferred to the Tyrone mine for recycling or disposal. All non-recyclable materials will be disposed of at Tyrone's existing solid waste landfill. Reclamation of the majority of the site will follow mining to allow final limits of disturbance to be determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIS will address issues of geology and minerals, soils, water resources, vegetation, wildlife, range management, air quality, visual resources, reclamation, land use, access, recreation, wilderness, cultural resources, social and economic values, transportation and noise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BLM has identified the following potentially significant impacts as requiring additional analysis: The quality and quantity of post-mining water generated by the open pit; the effect on surface water quality and riparian areas of the proposed haul road to the Little Rock site; and the effect on surface water quality and riparian areas of the proposed diversion of California Gulch around the Little Rock site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because these issues were determined to require special investigation, it is anticipated that the majority of work for other resources will be limited to summarizing and incorporating by reference data and analyses from existing environmental studies as prescribed in 40 CFR 1500.4 and 1500.5. Additional investigation may be indicated for other resources after review of existing data and comments received during the scoping process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BLM's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) identification of viable alternatives; and (3) notifying interested groups, individuals, and agencies so that additional information concerning these issues can be obtained. The scoping will consist of a news release announcing the start of the EIS process; letters of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping document which further clarifies the proposed action and significant issues being considered to be distributed to those on the mailing list and available upon request.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Linda S.C.

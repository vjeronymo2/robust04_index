			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): When swings and roundabouts limit analysis - Inchcape The fashion for updating analysts on trading may have taken something of a dent after Inchcape's experience in January. When the international trading group, which announces 1993 results today, met stockbroking analysts, some thought it had said nothing new of any great significance. But others came away from the meeting bearish, and cut their forecasts. In the following days the shares slumped nearly 70p from a high of 606p, and have only recently begun to recover. All will be revealed in today's numbers. There is a wide range of forecasts, although most close Inchcape watchers range from Pounds 255m to Pounds 270m, up from Pounds 250.1m in 1992, excluding a Pounds 16m profit on the sale of a minority stake in Toyota GB to Toyota. Inchcape told analysts at the briefing that the second half had been similar to the first, when profits rose from Pounds 117.1m to Pounds 130.9m, in spite of a Pounds 12m higher interest charge. With such a diverse group there have been inevitable swings and roundabouts. One problem has been the strength of the yen last year which hit sales of Japanese cars to Europe. Another has been weak consumer demand in Japan and austerity measures in China, which held back sales of the branded goods Inchcape markets. But on the plus side, the UK car market picked up in 1993 with Toyota increasing its market share. The business services division was also performing well in most areas. Analysts may also take the opportunity to ask about Inchcape's intentions towards Gestetner, the office equipment distributor, where it has a 15 per cent stake with the option to go to 25 per cent. Many assume Inchcape will bid this year. Inchcape is expected to give a more detailed division of profits within its motors sector, which contributed 60 per cent of total profits in 1992.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Man in the news: Millionaire with a peace mission - Milan Panic Mr Milan Panic, who left Belgrade with a bicycle and Dollars 20, and ended up owning a pharmaceuticals company in California, appears to be enjoying his latest venture as prime minister of the unrecognised Yugoslavia. He has pledged to stop the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'The first step is to concentrate the heavy artillery of all three sides under the supervision of the United Nations,' said Mr Panic, chairman of International Chemicals and Nuclear Pharmaceuticals Inc. 'I will deliver the first Serbian tank in Bosnia to the UN,' he vowed. He sees his drive to demilitarise Bosnia as a crucial step towards the lifting of UN sanctions on Yugoslavia, now comprising only Serbia and Montenegro. Mr Panic took the premier's job out of patriotism and a seemingly unshakeable belief that he can succeed in a monumental task. But the odds are against him. A Serb immigrant who has lived the quintessential American dream, he built a pharmaceuticals empire which some observers say has shaky foundations. Ebullient and impulsive, Mr Panic joined Tito's Communist partisans at 14, and in 1956 defected to West Germany while competing in a bicycle championship. From there he went to the US. His US passport/dual citizenship should help as he travels abroad in a bid to pull Yugoslavia out of its international isolation. Despite UN sanctions, Mr Panic has received assurances from his lawyers that he can retain his US status. He often says: 'I am an American . . . and the prime minister of Yugoslavia.' His relationship with part of the political establishment in Washington is confirmed by his contributions to the Democratic party - he held a Dollars 1,000-plate dinner at his mansion in Pasadena to drum up support for Michael Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign. Back in his native Yugoslavia, now a land of intrigue and destruction, Mr Panic is determined to spread his vision of peaceful coexistence. 'Maybe I am naive, but I know that people are for peace. Maybe I am naive but I know that fathers don't like their kids killed,' he said in an interview with the FT. He explains that he has Moslems and Serbs in his family who get along together well. Mr Panic insists that Serbs and Croats do not hate each other. He says the same for all other ethnic groups in the region. His vision of inter-ethnic coexistence includes all the neighbours of the former Yugoslav federation except Italy. 'We need to build economic power so that together we can bargain for a better position internationally.' His solutions are primarily economic. For instance, he thinks the painful problem of Serbian-controlled Kosovo, the mostly ethnic Albanian province in southern Serbia, can be resolved by increased economic co-operation with neighbouring Albania. 'I want to make peace with Albanians. If the relationship, not just political, but economic, is improved with Albania, than Kosovo becomes much less of a problem.' Despite his message of peace, Mr Panic revealed only a vague idea of who is attacking whom and where. When informed of the ongoing Serbian assault on Gorazde, he said: 'Let's call them immediately,' ordering his aides to telephone the town in eastern Bosnia which has been under a Serbian siege for three months. It has no telephone or road contact with the outside world. Undeterred, he finally reached the town via short-wave radio. Mr Panic appeared unaware that he cannot stop the war until Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic resigns. Mr Milosevic still commands enormous popular support and controls parts of the Yugoslav army and Serb irregular forces. The relationship between the two men is unclear. He was nominated for his present position by Mr Milosevic. But in the murky world of Serbian politics, the role of Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic, a well-known writer, is not to be underestimated. Seen as the spiritual father of all Serbs, Mr Cosic is reported to believe that Mr Milosevic is ballast that must be shed for the sake of peace. Without the support of Mr Cosic, Mr Panic has no power base other than the Serbian lobby in the US. The prime minister earlier warned Mr Milosevic to keep a low profile. 'God help him if he gets in my way,' he said. Now he has toned down his message, saying 'Milosevic is expected to act as if he were the governor of California'. But Mr Milosevic is not likely to devolve his powers willingly to anyone, especially to a millionaire who speaks rusty Serbo-Croat and heavily-accented English. In an attempt to thwart resistance from Milosevic's ruling Socialist party, Mr Panic has tempered his privatisation plans with the promise to introduce 'socially responsible capitalism'. However, the chances of gaining support for an economic stabilisation programme are unrealistic given the war and sanctions. Western diplomats have described Mr Panic as a 'loose cannon'. US federal regulators appear to agree. ICN has been investigated twice by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The US justice department also brought a civil action in the late 1980s against ICN for overstating the potential of Virazole, a medicine approved in 1985 for the treatment of a rare respiratory disease. In 1987, ICN, based in Costa Mesa, disclosed reports that Virazole was effective in delaying the onset of AIDS in HIV patients. ICN gave up the fight for AIDS approval and paid a goodwill fine of Dollars 57m and wrote off a loss of Dollars 82m. In addition, Mr Panic paid a Dollars 600,000 fine to the Food and Drug Administration last year over the Virazole episode. Most diplomats in Belgrade give the prime minister no more than three months before he quits and returns to the US. Mr Panic, 62, dismisses this grim prognosis: 'I have not learned to fail . . . as a good American, we give all of our presidents 100 days to prove themselves.' Laughing, he asks: 'Do I seem like someone they can roll over easily?'</p>

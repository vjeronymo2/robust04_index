			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Sweden stands out amid troubled Nordic bourses - Robert Taylor discerns positive investor sentiment Denmark's unexpected, if narrow rejection of the Maastricht treaty in its national referendum on June 2 continues to have a negative impact on stock market performance in Scandinavia. It would be an exaggeration to suggest that the Danish 'no', in itself, will inflict long-term damage on what is already a rather fragile and uncertain outlook. But with the Nordic countries about to start their traditionally prolonged summer holidays, most analysts expect a period of trading in the doldrums before any hope of a pick-up in the early autumn. The Nordics are much more sensitive than they used to be to changes in the wider global market, now that their currencies are all pegged to Ecu, and negotiations are set to begin on their EC membership applications early next year. Some strategists think that concerns over the likely strength of the American economic recovery this summer, and uncertainties about prospects in Germany, the Nordics' main trading partner, could be more important than the Danish Maastricht decisions among the external factors affecting the Nordic bourses. However, internal factors could make Sweden, in particular, more attractive to foreign investors as the old restrictions on company share ownership are dismantled - part of the necessary adaptation to membership of the 19-nation European Economic Area (EEA) from next January. International interest was already evident last year when foreigners were net buyers of SKr11bn worth of Swedish stock in Stockholm, and analysts believe that figure could go as high as SKr20bn in 1992. Since its abolition of the turnover tax on dealings last November, soon after taking office, Sweden's non-socialist government has persisted with an ambitious programme of deregulation and liberalisation. Government permission is no longer required for foreigners who want to buy above a specific maximum figure equity and voting rights in Swedish companies, while this summer an increasing number of Swedish listed companies have decided to abolish the traditional distinction between free and restricted shares, which protects up to 70 per cent of stocks in Stockholm from foreign buyers. Analysts also point to some definite signs of improvement in the Swedish economy which has gone through its severest recession since before the second world war. The annual inflation rate is down to around two per cent, one of the lowest in Western Europe. Private savings are going up, and costs are coming down sharply. Mr Colin Gibson, at Carnegie International, sees evidence of an export-led recovery in Sweden which should gather strength during 1993, even if recent forecasts indicate a lower domestic growth rate than expected. Analysts are concerned - as is Sweden's central bank - about a burgeoning budget deficit which is set to climb to over SKr110bn, seven per cent of GNP. But Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, is well aware of that problem and made it clear earlier this week she intends to make a reduction in the size of the debt her highest priority. What excites many analysts about the Swedish corporate scene is the sign of improvement in the performance of Sweden's blue chip manufacturing companies. Share values in the mechanical engineering sector have risen impressively by over 34 per cent so far this year. During the past two years many Swedish companies, paricularly in that sector, have carried through successful re-structuring programmes which have reduced their cost levels and improved their industrial performance. James Capel is particularly impressed by SKF, the world's largest roller-bearing company, which is expecting to make an SKr1bn profit this year after losses of a similar figure in 1991. But other well-known multinationals, like Electrolux, Sandvik and Atlas Copco, are also reviving and there is hope that Volvo has begun a recovery in the vital American auto market. The Stockholm bourse is also taking a considerable interest in the Swedish government's planned privatisation programme. Last week, it was announced that there had been an oversubscription for shares in SSAB (Swedish Steel), which is the first company wholly to be privatised. Procordia, the pharmaceutical and food conglomerate, is also performing well with the expectation of an early sell-off by the state of its minority shareholding in the company. However, this does guarantee that Stockholm is on the verge of a powerful revival. The banking sector continues to be hit very hard by loan losses with a 32 per cent fall in their share values since the beginning of the year. This week, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, was unable to prevent a sharp fall in its shares after a four-month deficit for the first time in its history. Moreover, real estate and construction in Sweden continues to give understandable anxiety with a 28 per cent decline in share values since the start of 1992 and the bottom may not yet have been reached in that sector.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Liffe and OMLX to compete for Mid 250 volume THE London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) and OMLX, the London Securities and Derivatives Exchange, will compete head-to-head for volume on futures and options on the FT-SE Mid 250 index, it was announced yesterday. The London Stock Exchange yesterday made a surprise decision to award licences to introduce derivatives on the index of medium-sized UK companies to both exchanges. No launch date has yet been set by either exchange. The confrontation is particularly significant because Liffe products are traded in futures pits, using the traditional open-outcry method, while OMLX is an electronic trading system. The battle will therefore be viewed by proponents of each trading method as a vital test case. Mr Mark Makepiece, head of indices at the stock exchange, said that to award an exclusive licence to one exchange would have meant 'denying the market the right to choose'. The decision was welcomed by some traders as 'a courageous step', but others feared that the creation of two rival contracts would split the liquidity of the market. 'I think its a disappointing decision because dual listing is unlikely to be a successful formula,' said Mr Michael Heath, a director of Smith New Court, a leading UK equities marketmaker. It is possible that the contracts will co-exist, but most traders think it more likely that one will gain the upper hand. Liffe has several advantages: it already trades FT-SE 100 futures and options; many houses already have teams on the Liffe floor; and it is generally better-known. But OMLX also has its supporters. It is cheaper, requiring no additional deployment of staff, and some dealers believe that the electronic exchange is ideally suited to trading low volume contracts - they cite Liffe's poor record in equity options to date. The success of any contract will depend on the level of interest among fund managers, who are expected to use the new contracts for asset allocation and for hedging. The FT-SE 100 has underperformed the 250 by 11 per cent so far this year, underlining the lack of correlation between the two markets. The FT-SE Mid 250 index is becoming more widely used by UK fund managers, some of whom now track the FT-SE 350 index (FT-SE 100 and 250) rather than the FT-A All-Share Index. However, the success of one exchange's contract over another's will ultimately be decided by traders, since fund managers are unlikely to specify which exchange's contracts should be used.</p>

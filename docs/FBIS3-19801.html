The Defense Ministry  confirmed the step of the 57-year-old general today. As DPA  learned, he cited lacking support for his proposed austerity  measures by senior generals as the reason for his departure.  The Defense Ministry announced that no decision has yet been  made regarding Huber's request. The defense expert of the  Christian Democratic Union, Paul Breuer, demanded the  "unconditional examination of all of Huber's proposals and a  clarification of the circumstances that prompted Huber to take  this personal step." Juergen Koppelin from the Free Democratic  Party of Germany spoke of a "serious warning" for Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union). [passage  omitted]</p>

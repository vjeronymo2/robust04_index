			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLBERT GOES DEEP FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE  </P> <P> For one swing of the bat, it was like the glory days of old for Nate Colbert.  </P> <P> Colbert became the Padres' first hero when he hit 38 home runs in 1970 and  again in 1972, and he unleashed a sample of his old power in the Equitable  Old-Timers home run derby Saturday night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> After hitting a 390-foot drive that would have left the park if it hadn't gone  to dead center field, Colbert sent one of Bill (Spaceman) Lee's pitches over  the left-field wall in the sixth inning of the National League's 6-1 victory  over the American.  </P> <P> Colbert's home run struck the scaffolding used by an unsuspecting photographer  behind the wall. The photographer was looking elsewhere at the time, and the  ball missed him by no more than two feet.  </P> <P> "I didn't know if it would go out," Colbert said afterward. "It wasn't like  when I was 22. At 22, I knew right away, but at 44 I wasn't sure. At this  point, I have warning-track power."  </P> <P> Colbert is the Padres' all-time home-run leader, having hit 163 as their first  baseman from 1969 to 1974. He is now a coach for their Riveride farm club and  serves in their community relations department in the off-season.  </P> <P> Asked if he had gotten a special kick out of reliving a bit of his dynamic past  before the home folks, Colbert said, "Not really. I do it simply because of the  purpose of the game. It's for old-time players who need help."  </P> <P> A donation of $10,000 from each of the 26 games in of the Equitable series goes  to the Baseball Assistance Team (BAT) foundation, created to aid players of  pre-pension days.  </P> <P> Another man in a Padre uniform hit a home run immediately after Colbert's, and  for him it was a thrill. Denny Summers, the Padres' bullpen coach, who never  played in the major leagues, hit a line drive over the right-field wall, also  off Lee. Earlier, he hit a ball to the same area that fell about 10 feet short.  </P> <P> "This was great," Summers said. "It was my first Old-Timers game ever, and I  loved it. "Being a left-handed hitter, I wasn't too happy when they ran a  left-hander (Lee) out there. I thought to myself, 'They really want to get me  out.' The first one I hit, there had to be a little more strength on it, but I  knew the second one had a chance."  </P> <P> The champion home-run hitter of the night was Rico Carty, 50, who hit two off  Fergie Jenkins in the same time at bat. He also just missed a homer on a drive  that went even farther than the two others but was barely foul.  </P> <P> "Once a hitter, always a hitter," said Carty, who hit 204 home runs and had a  .299 career average.  </P> <P> The other National League home runs were hit by Hall of Famer Lou Brock and  Ellis Valentine who, at 36, was the youngest Old-Timer. Brock's struck the  right-field foul pole about 30 feet up, and Valentine's was the most prodigious  poke of all, landing in the 10th row of the left-field-seats.  </P> <P> And for the American League? With such musclemen as Frank Howard, Willie  Horton, George Scott and Jim Gentile on the team, it fell to the light-hitting  Bucky Dent to hit the only home run.  </P> <P> Dent finished with a career total of just 40 home runs, the most memorable of  which propelled the New York Yankees to a victory over the Boston Red Sox in a  one-game playoff for the American League pennant in 1978.  </P> <P> "With all those boomers around me, I was really getting teased," Dent said.  "After I hit one out (off Dennis Leonard), I heard the guys saying, 'Somebody's  got to hit one. We can't let this little guy get the only one.' It was a great  feeling."  </P> <P> The contest was played over seven innings as a preliminary to the  Padres-Houston Astros game. The format was a first for the Old-Timers series,  and it received mixed reviews.  </P> <P> Lee May said, "I liked it. People get to see more players hit. There's one  thing about hitting. No matter how old you get, you can still hit the ball."  </P> <P> Hall of Famer Billy Williams cast a negative vote, saying, "I don't think the  fans got much out of this. There are guys who can still make plays in the  outfield, and Lou Brock can still run the bases. I think the people would  rather see that than just a bunch of guys hitting."  </P> <P> Old Timer Notes  </P> <P> Frank Howard managed the Padres only in their disastrous, strike-torn season of  1981, yet he has positive memories of his only chance to lead a club. "It was  one of the greatest experiences of my life," Howard said. "We had some great  young talent, like Ozzie Smith for example, and the guy who followed me (Dick  Williams) added good leadership to that talent." . . . Hall of Famer Ernie  Banks brought along an aluminum bat, which he and Bill Lee used once each. "I'm  testing it for Sadahara Oh (the all-time Japanese home-run champion). He's  marketing it over there," Banks said.  </P></p>

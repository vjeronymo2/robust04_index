			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chelsfield and P&amp;O in Dollars 400m disposal The joint venture between P&amp;O, the shipping company, and Chelsfield, the quoted property group, yesterday announced the sale of its US residential garden apartments portfolio for Dollars 400m (Pounds 274m). Laing Properties Inc, which was acquired in 1990 by P&amp;O and Chelsfield, is selling the 6,500 properties to Security Capital Atlantic, a newly-formed residential property company specialising in the south-east of the US. Laing Properties is being paid Dollars 280m in cash and the remainder in shares, making it a 25 per cent shareholder in Security Capital Atlantic. The remaining 75 per cent will be owned by Security Capital Realty, a company chaired by Mr William Sanders, who is a shareholder in Property Trust of America, and Security Capital Industrial Trust. Security Capital Atlantic plans to float on the New York Stock Exchange as a real estate investment trust. The flotation would be, at the earliest, at the end of the year, said Mr Elliott Bernerd, Chelsfield chairman. The minimum value of Laing Properties' holding in Security Capital Atlantic has been underwritten through put options that can be exercised over the next two years. Cash received will be used to repay existing bank borrowings of Laing Properties, including Dollars 85m currently guaranteed by Chelsfield and P&amp;O. Mr Bernerd said that the transaction was consistent with Chelsfield's stated intention in its prospectus last December to float its residential properties in a real estate investment trust. Volatile market conditions caused the plan to be revised. Mr Bernerd said that the decision to sell to Security Capital Atlantic was 'a better solution' than the original plan because it gave Laing the option to convert the entire portfolio into cash. He said he was also pleased with the amount of cash immediately raised from and the pricing of the portfolio, which had clawed back the provisions made following its acquisition in 1991. 'In the round we are back where we started from,' he said.</p>

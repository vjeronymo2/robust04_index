			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RING THE ENVIRONMENTAL ALARMS;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION WOULD ERODE CITIZENS' ABILITY TO DEFEND FORESTS  </P> <P> The U.S. Senate, urged by Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) and Brock Adams, (D-Wash.)  has adopted an alarming piece of legislation. In a nutshell, the measure would  repeal, for parts of the Pacific Northwest, the federal environmental laws that  govern the use of lands belonging to the American people.  </P> <P> The mechanism for this is a rider attached by the sponsoring senators to the  annual appropriations bill of the Interior Department that effectively exempts  current timber sales from 13 national forests and other federal lands in the  Northwest from every national law that protects the environment. The rider was  passed without public hearing, without public testimony, without any  consideration by the congressional committees that are supposed to watch over  management of our national resources.  </P> <P> The wording of the rider makes it appear less significant than it really is,  saying merely that courts may not issue injunctions against logging operations  until there has been a full hearing on the objection before the court.  </P> <P> Thus, if interested citizens' groups present evidence that a federal agency's  logging plans violate laws enacted to protect the environment, the court's  traditional authority to stop the violation pending a full hearing is removed.  As a practical matter, the logging goes forward and later, when a full hearing  is possible, it's too late. The Hatfield-Adams rider is, plainly and simply, a  license to violate the law.  </P> <P> Recent actions by three federal judges spurred the introduction of the  Hatfield-Adams rider. In separate cases, all brought by citizen environmental  groups, the judges ruled that sales of old-growth timber from much of the  federal land in the Northwest appeared to be illegal. The cases dealt with  logging in the last of the Northwest's ancient forests -- trees up to 1,000  years old.  </P> <P> Similar riders have passed before. In fact, since 1985, Hatfield has succeeded  in getting six such measures through Congress, largely unnoticed by his  colleagues. On Sept. 6, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on an  appropriations bill rider authored by Hatfield in 1987. A lower court found  that the Bureau of Land Management had acted "arbitrarily and capriciously" in  disregarding "new, significant and probably accurate" information concerning  the potential extinction of the northern spotted owl on BLM lands, in violation  of the National Environmental Policy Act. But the appeals court confirmed that,  under the 1987 Hatfield rider, timber sales may not be challenged with claims  of new information about environmental impact, depriving citizens of another  piece of their right to ask the courts to enforce the law.  </P> <P> This year's Interior Department appropriations bill, with the Hatfield-Adams  rider, is about to go before a House-Senate conference committee. The measure  must be seen by the conferees for what it is -- a dangerous infringement on the  right of citizens to bring before the courts violations of laws by government  agencies. A large measure of the enforcement of our environmental laws has come  through suits by citizens and citizen groups. Continued restrictions on  judicial review could bar citizens from challenging failure to enforce any  number of laws -- those that protect our air, our water or our food, for  example.  </P> <P> With the disaster of Prince William Sound fresh in mind, we may find a useful  lesson in the battle fought some years ago over the trans-Alaska pipeline. The  pipeline, from Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope to the port of Valdez on Prince  William Sound, was challenged in court in the 1970s. Conservationists  attempted, among other things, to get the Interior Department to prepare an  unbiased environmental impact statement that carefully assessed the risks of  transporting North Slope oil by sea through Prince William Sound. The  conservation organizations wanted such risks compared to the alternative of  using an all-land pipeline route through Canada.  </P> <P> Pushed by the industry, which greatly preferred a pipeline to Valdez and then  transshipment of the oil by tanker, Congress exempted the project from the  National Environmental Policy Act and prohibited the courts from reviewing it  under any law. Thus, by a single stroke, Congress took citizens and the courts  out of the pipeline decision, leaving it entirely in the hands of federal  agencies.  </P> <P> No one can say whether the legal review urged by the conservationists would  have resulted in the pipeline being built through Canada. However, had it been  built overland, as conservationists preferred, Prince William Sound would not  have suffered the disaster that occurred March 24.  </P> <P> The Alaska pipeline decision illustrates the risks to the environment when  Congress is persuaded to exempt a particular project -- or an entire region --  from environmental laws that apply everywhere else. When Congress  short-circuits the orderly judicial process for testing the soundness of  potentially harmful acts, as the ancient-forest rider would do, the nation may  lose more in the long run than is gained in the short term. If logging what  little is left of the old-growth timber on public lands in the Pacific  Northwest cannot withstand application by impartial judges of the National  Forest Management Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water  Act and other environmental statutes, one wonders what sorts of activities  Congress is being asked to put beyond the reach of the law.  </P></p>

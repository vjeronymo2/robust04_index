			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sizing up Banesto's real worth - A look at the race for control of the bank As the dust begins to settle on the Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) crisis, the attention of Spain's big banks has turned towards who can gain from their old rival's problems. The competition to take a controlling stake in Banesto is starting to warm up. The matter should be decided early next month, provided that shareholders at Banesto's annual general meeting on March 26 approve the new management's plan to recapitalise Spain's fourth-largest bank. An auction of fresh equity to the bank that bids the most should be held shortly after. Banesto is not an obviously attractive proposition for any of the other large banks. After the Bank of Spain intervened to replace the old management in January, it estimated that Banesto's Pta8,000bn (Dollars 56.8bn) assets had been over-valued by Pta605bn, mostly because of an over-rapid growth in poor loans. However, the severity of the plan to clean up its assets, along with the size of Banesto's market share in deposits and its large branch network, mean that the bank which took it over could emerge as the dominant domestic retail bank. Banesto's name remains valuable in the rural south of Spain. Apart from the potential gains, each of Spain's large banks is frightened that the others could steal a march on them by taking over Banesto at the right price. 'Banesto is a big risk, but it could be a big opportunity as well,' says a director of one of the banks. The chance to take a controlling stake in Banesto has come through the plan drawn up by the new management. This gives a bank prepared to hold the stake in the medium-term - possibly for a minimum of three years - a chance to have a dominant minority stake of at least 35 per cent. The plan hinges on the allocation of Banesto's Pta244bn of equity reserves to provisions against bad debts. Shareholders - including the Corsair Fund led by J. P. Morgan, the US bank which advised Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former president - will also have to agree to dilute their stakes. This would be done by a 43 per cent write-down in the par value of Banesto shares, from Pta700 to Pta400 each, raising Pta49bn towards cleaning up Banesto's assets. Some Pta285bn more, channelled through Spain's deposit guarantee fund, will be contributed by Spanish banks and the Bank of Spain. The fund would finally inject Pta180bn of fresh capital into the bank, which would form 73 per cent of the new equity base, with the remaining Pta64bn coming from the written-down existing capital. This 73 per cent stake will then be sold by auction to a 'strategic buyer' from among the banks. The fund, which is being advised on the auction by the US bank Salomon Brothers, intends provisionally to ask for bids by April 12, with the buyer named a week later. The buyer will then have to offer Pta32bn of the stake - or 27 per cent of the total - at Pta400 each to existing shareholders. Three banks are thought likely to bid: Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), which has assets of Pta11,300bn; Santander, which has assets of Pta7,700bn; and Argentaria, with assets of Pta10,100bn. Each is being advised by an investment bank: respectively Merrill Lynch, S. G. Warburg, and Goldman Sachs. The banks have varying motives to acquire a large stake in Banesto: Argentaria would gain branches to add to a relatively small network, which is primarily based on the Caja Postal, the post office savings bank. However, an Argentaria acquisition could be complicated because the parliamentary opposition has been hostile to the idea, and it is only recently privatised. BBV is also weak in rural areas (outside the Basque country) where the Banesto network is strong. Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, insists his bank would not simply take on Banesto to grow bigger. 'Size is not our first concern - our strategy is concerned with profitability,' he says. Santander has competed aggressively with other banks to gain market share in deposits and savings products since 1989, when it broke the Spanish interest rate 'cartel'. It could gain by selling products through both branch networks, even if Banesto was managed separately from its retail bank. However, two uncertainties remain. First, banks have been trying to talk down shares - which yesterday traded at Pta743 each, well above the likely Pta400 nominal value. 'There is no way that we would bid at Pta750 a share. It is just not worth it,' says a director of one of the three interested banks. A second question is whether J. P. Morgan will attempt to block the plan on behalf of Corsair, either by voting against it at the meeting, or challenging it legally. The plan would dilute Corsair's 7.8 per cent equity stake to about 2.5 per cent if it did not invest fresh money in Banesto. Most observers expect J. P. Morgan to accede to the plan. 'Corsair's shares have no value at the moment. It is a choice between gaining something, or losing everything,' says one banker. Even if it does agree, there is plenty to argue about before the fate of Banesto is decided at auction.</p>

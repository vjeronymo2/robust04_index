			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Japanese car dealer makes staff travel by public transport MOST OF the 12,000 workers at Yanase &amp; Co, Japan's largest dealer in imported cars, have been ordered to take public transport to work, in an attempt to give potential car buyers the impression that the country's clogged roads are becoming less congested. Trying to push-start a stalled car market, Mr Jiro Yanase, the 76-year-old chairman of Yanase, which sells Mercedes-Benz and General Motors vehicles, has also asked makers such as Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor to forbid their employees from driving to work. As Japan's economy has slowed, so have car sales. Motor vehicle registrations were down by 7.2 per cent last year. Registrations of imported cars fell 7.7 per cent, prompting carmakers to consider new gimmicks to prompt customers to trade in and, preferably, trade up. However, carmakers think Mr Yanase's strategy a touch quirky. Toyota and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association both noted that the 'idea itself is interesting', but suggested improving transport infrastructure rather than keeping their employees off the road. The edict from Mr Yanase is not only a response to recession but another example of the sometimes eccentric policies of successful Japanese companies dominated by a charismatic figure. For example, Minebea, the world's leading maker of bearings, diversified into pig raising because of a lingering boyhood fascination of its late chairman with those animals. Mr Yanase originally asked that only Tokyo employees be banned from driving to work. But he has now extended the ban to branches and subsidiaries throughout Japan. A Yanase manager in Nagoya, central Japan, said about 8 per cent of employees are exempt, either because they live too far from the office or for health reasons. But the rest of the branch's 600 employees are not allowed to drive to work. 'We check the car park three times a day to make sure that no unauthorised employees have driven in,' the manager said. 'If they break the rule once, they will be given a warning. If they break it again and again, they will be admonished and their salary may be cut.' Growing clamour for a stronger voice, Page 12</p>

The Officers Union of Crimea  nominated 11 candidates for the Supreme Soviet of Crimea who  include Black Sea Fleet servicemen. The Officers Union turned  to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin and the Russian  Federation State Duma with a request to speed up the solution of  the question on placing Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet under  Russian jurisdiction. An appeal to Republic of Crimea President  Yuriy Meshkov contains a call to create on the basis of the  Officers Union a National Guard of Crimea and, in this  connection, to eliminate on the peninsula's territory the  National Guard of Ukraine.</p>

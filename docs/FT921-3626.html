			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Top telecom groups to form world network SOME of the world's largest telecommunications companies are collaborating to offer specialised communications services to the global financial services industry. The group includes MCI of the US, France Telecom, and Mercury Communications of the UK. The companies have formed a joint venture called FNA - Financial Network Association - which will provide communications services between the world's financial capitals. The provision of specialised business communications services is a growing area of commercial interest for telecommunications suppliers. BT of the UK, for example, offers such services through its Synchordia initiative. Computing services companies, including General Electric Information Services, have also offered business services over their global networks. FNA will, however, be one of the first of its kind to specialise in a single vertical market sector involving global telecommunications carriers. Other members are: AOTC of Australia; RTT-Belgacom of Belgium; Stentor of Canada; Deutsche Bundespost Telekom of Germany; Hong Kong Telecom; Italcable of Italy; KDD of Japan; Singapore Telecom; and Telefonica of Spain. FNA will be incorporated in Brussels. Its first chairperson is AOTC's Mr Allan Badrick.</p>

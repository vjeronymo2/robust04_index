			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Spain and Italy lead turnover gains November was a remarkably firm month for European bourse volume, says Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which produces the figures. After a fall of 10.1 per cent in September from the August level, and a compensating gain of 10.1 per cent, again, in October, Europe's eight biggest markets turned over 2.9 per cent more in November than in the month before. This happened in spite of a 1.5 per cent fall in the FT-Actuaries Europe index for the month, says Mr Cornish, as markets consolidated following October's steep increase, with only Brussels and Zurich out of the eight showing a rise on the month in share price terms. The UK, with an economy further on its way out of recession, had a good month with a turnover gain of 6.7 per cent, up 5.2 per cent on a 'very respectable' three month average, animated by budget hopes. The London market weighs heavily in the overall figures but, even excluding it, the continental seven still show a turnover gain of 0.9 per cent for the period. In fact, the biggest increases in volume last month came from the two markets which fell furthest: Spain, down by just under 5 per cent, and Milan, down 6 per cent. To Mr Cornish, this suggests an active European equity market with institutions keen to buy as well as sell. Institutional funds have big profits on their continental equity portfolios this year, so they can be uninhibited about selling. In 1993, when equity markets were far less comfortable, falls in share prices frequently reflected market makers marking them down, while the institutions sat on their hands. Spain chalked up a 33 per cent rise in November turnover, up 47 per cent on the average of the previous three months, as share prices went on the slide. The Madrid bourse was disappointed in its hopes of an early cut in interest rates, where the cut did not come until December 3, and there was also a peak in volume ahead of a futures expiry. Mr Cornish notes that volumes on Seaq International, the London screen-based trading system, almost doubled for Spain on the month, also to a record high. In Italy, turnover showed a gain of nearly 12 per cent on the month, but the figure was still down by over 14 per cent from the average of the previous quarter, reflecting a further fall in share prices in November as political nervousness fed on the collapse of the centre in the first round of the local elections. The Netherlands saw turnover rise 8.4 per cent to a new high as share prices showed some resistance to profit-taking, but the markets where share prices actually rose on the month did less well, the Swiss with a turnover gain of 4.6 per cent (albeit to a new record) and the Belgians with one of just 0.7 per cent. Germany and France both did lower business on the month, but they were up by 3.1 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively on very high averages for August/October. There seemed to be a pattern within November, says Mr Cornish. At the beginning of the month, there was a sell-off in the US bond market following strong US employment figures for October. The thought that American money would race back into the domestic fixed interest market after its recent adventures abroad led to equity sales in Europe and elsewhere. Later in the month those fears subsided, and were replaced by a run of strength which ran on until late last week, giving volumes a good start to December.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Bourse              Aug       Sep      Oct        Nov       US                    1993      1993     1993       1993   Dollars bn  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Belgium           64.52     86.99     77.87     78.39       2.16 France           176.99    184.37    201.93    191.05      32.20 Germany          184.40    150.42    183.24    177.99     103.72 Italy            47,394  44,009.6    31,410  35,092.8      20.58 Netherlands       23.60     18.90     25.10     27.20      14.14 Spain            959.64    825.61  1,042.89   1,384.6       9.82 Switzerland       24.50     19.80     28.30     29.60      19.74 UK                50.90     49.82     49.32     52.61      78.01  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Volumes represent purchases and sales.

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dutch retail group set to buy confectionery chain AHOLD, the Dutch retail and supermarket group, said yesterday it plans to acquire Jamin, a chain of Dutch confectionery shops, before the end of March. The company did not disclose how much it would pay Jamin's owner, Goudsmit, a Dutch holding company with varied interests in the retail sector, for the chain of 261 shops, including 114 franchise operations. Jamin had sales of Fl 150m (Dollars 82m) in 1991. It will become part of Ahold's specialty stores division, which generates around Fl 1bn of the group's annual sales of Fl 21bn. Ahold's main businesses are its Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and four supermarket chains in the eastern US.</p>

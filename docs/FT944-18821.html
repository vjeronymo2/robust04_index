			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / India steps up efforts to tackle plague Indian authorities yesterday stepped up efforts to stop the spread of pneumonic plague, while struggling to contain the economic threat posed by the growing number of overseas travel restrictions. The disease claimed the lives of two people in the capital, Delhi, yesterday  -the first reported deaths outside the western city of Surat where plague broke out last week. The deaths pushed the official death toll to more than 50, while the number of suspected plague cases rose to 2,500. Meanwhile, officials in the capital moved to close all schools and cinemas to prevent the plague bacteria spreading - and advised residents to cover their faces with masks or handkerchiefs in crowded places. The authorities' efforts have so far failed to reassure overseas governments and visitors. KLM, the Dutch airline, said that 25-30 per cent of tourists who had planned to travel to India by KLM this week and next had called off their trips. In the UK, Thomson, the largest holiday company, cancelled its Indian tours scheduled for the first two weeks of October. Beach holidays in Goa would go ahead, although people who decided to cancel would receive full refunds. The move came as many Asian and Middle Eastern governments banned all flights to and from India, and several European states imposed new medical checks on passengers arriving from the country. The UK health department said its plague surveillance system had identified eight people showing flu-like symptoms 'who may be infected'. But the Communicable Diseases Surveillance Centre said later that medical tests had cleared seven of them, while the eighth was unlikely to have the plague. Dr Kenneth Calman, Britain's chief medical officer, said the system would pick up more suspect cases. 'Should any cases be confirmed, they will be treated effectively with routinely available antibiotics,' he said. Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister who is visiting London, attacked countries that had imposed travel and trade restrictions on India. Indian food exports hit, Page 3</p>

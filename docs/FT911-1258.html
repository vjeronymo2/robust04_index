			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Companies shown to be ignorant of EC market rules MOST OF the UK's top companies have a poor knowledge of European Community competition law, according to market research carried out for Theodore Goddard, a leading City law firm. Only 4 per cent of UK companies knew that the EC could impose a fine of up to 10 per cent of a company's turnover for contravening competition laws, compared with 28 per cent of their French counterparts, the study showed. The survey covered 50 leading companies in the UK and France with a minimum turnover of Pounds 70m and a similar number of advisers including lawyers, accountants and bankers. Yet 84 per cent of the companies had been involved in a cross-border merger, acquisition, joint venture or trade agreement in the EC in the past three years. Almost all expected to be involved in such activity within the next five years. All the French companies had recent experience of cross-border activity. Overall, 84 per cent of the companies thought that their understanding of national competition law was 'fairly good'. Even so, 64 per cent of the UK companies admitted a 'fairly poor' or 'very poor' knowledge of EC competition law. The comparable figure for French companies was only 8 per cent. The research concluded that 36 per cent of UK companies failed to take account of national competition laws and 64 per cent failed to take account of EC competition laws to achieve strategic goals. UK companies adopt a reactive approach to competition issues, it said, only showing an interest when problems arise.</p>

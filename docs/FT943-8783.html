			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Indonesia spurns US pressure over workers' rights Indonesian police arrested the leader of the country's largest independent trade union at the weekend only days after the US indicated it was likely to delay a decision on whether to continue extending a trade privilege to Jakarta that hinges on workers' rights. Mr Muchtar Pakpahan, chairman of the independent Indonesian Welfare Labour Union, was arrested in connection with violent labour demonstrations in the North Sumatran town of Medan in April this year. Police reports said Mr Pakpahan was arrested because he was engaging in 'criminal acts which were likely to lure other people into criminality'. The government only recognises the SPSI, a union run by state bureaucrats which tows the government line. The issue of worker rights has been a thorn in Jakarta's relations with Washington, which had already postponed by six months a decision due last February on the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). On Tuesday, the US said Indonesia needed to do more, despite recent progress on worker rights but said it would delay a decision on renewing the country's GSP status. The delay did not come as a surprise to Jakarta. It would have been awkward for Washington to revoke Indonesia's GSP status three months before President Clinton is due in Indonesia for the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit which Indonesia's President Suharto is hosting. Under GSP, Indonesian manufactured goods are allowed duty-free entry into the US, helping textile and footwear exports in particular. However, the value of exports benefiting from GSP status is small. Last year Dollars 600m worth of Indonesian exports went to the US under GSP, which represented only 16 per cent of total Indonesian exports to the US. Economists say that if Indonesia's GSP status was revoked between Dollars 60m and Dollars 70m worth of trade would be lost.</p>

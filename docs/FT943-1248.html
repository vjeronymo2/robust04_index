			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Spelling out the risks Following publication in April of disclosure proposals for life assurance products, the Personal Investment Authority - the new regulator to protect the private investor - this week published proposals for unit trust disclosure. As with life assurance disclosure, the basic format is a simple, four-page leaflet. This sets out the aims of the fund, the commitment asked from the investor, the risk factors involved and, most importantly, the effect of the charges on the value of the investment. For unit trusts, providing clear details of a product's aims always have been an essential part of disclosure although, compared with any long-term, front-end loaded insurance product, the amount of commitment involved in a unit trust investment is minimal. Risk factors and the effect of charges are more difficult. On risk, the PIA goes well beyond the hallowed formula about fluctuating values - 'the price of units and the income from them can go down as well as up' - to include all the factors which might have an adverse effect on performance or are otherwise relevant to a decision to invest. The most controversial proposals will undoubtedly be those on the effect of charges. These have been rising steadily since they stopped being regulated in 1979. Before then, the initial charge and the annual charge added together could not exceed 13.25 percentage points over 20 years (say, 3.25 per cent initially and 0.5 per cent a year). Today, the typical unit trust charges 6 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent a year. This adds up to 36 percentage points over 20 years - nearly three times what used to be permitted. The unit trust movement is, rightly, proud of the fact that charges always have been stated clearly. The problem has been that the effect of those charges is never set out. And while the numbers seem very small, they have a big impact. After all, a 1.5 per cent charge will reduce the returns from a growth rate of 7.5 per cent by 20 per cent, and from a 5 per cent growth rate by 30 per cent. The PIA proposals shy away from explaining this. The clearest way of showing the effect of charges is to give the value of an investment at a fixed growth rate, assuming no charges, and to compare it with the value after making allowance for charges. This could be done in a simple two-column table using a standard Pounds 1,000 investment, periods of 0, 1, 5, 10 and 25 years, and a sensible growth rate of perhaps 5 per cent. The proposals reject the idea of showing these two growing values side by side. Instead, they set out a table of charges (see column two) extracted from a Pounds 1,000 investment over 1, 3, 5 and 10 years assuming no growth, and a similar table showing growth at the optimistic rate of 7.5 per cent (or 9 per cent for personal equity plans). Dangling the effect of charges in this way begs the question: effect on what? And the useful addition of showing the effect of any spread with returns at 0 years is rejected on the ground that very few people ever sell their investment on the day they buy it. True. But few people sell their new car as they drive out of the showroom - yet no one thinks it odd to show its immediate depreciation in that way.

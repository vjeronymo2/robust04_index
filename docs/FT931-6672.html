			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Scales meets Beckett TO MOST British theatre-goers, Samuel Beckett's 1961 classic Happy Days is an unknown quantity, whereas Prunella Scales, the latest interpreter of its central role, is - thanks to TV - a household name. At the West Yorkshire Playhouse's new staging, it is soon obvious that Happy Days, though Scales can reveal just about every comic facet in it, is nothing like the various comedies that have made her name. Not since Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound has a protagonist been so tied to the earth. In Act One, Winnie is up to her waist in earth; in Act Two, up to her neck. She is not all alone. Many of her words are addressed to her enfeebled and laconic husband Willie, though he is usually out of sight and often out of hearing. Communication, contact, memory are ebbing. No observer could miss the absurdity of this situation. Or the pathos of it. Scales's Winnie is Northern, middle-class, genteel, dowdy, fading. Nothing about her is heroic. Most of what she says she has said so often that her voice sometimes grows flattened and monotonous from custom. Scales catches Winnie's nervous system; and, when she gabbles, she is alarmingly real. If anything, she over-characterises Winnie (she is nearly the flip side of Thora Hird in Alan Bennett's Talking Heads) - gives Winnie more surface than essence. When, for example, she says 'Ah yes, things have their life, that is what I always say, things have a life,' you are more struck by her quaint way of lingering on final consonants ('thinnngs') than by what she is saying. In general, however, she so illuminates Beckett's words that afterwards, checking, I was amazed to note how almost every detail arose from his mind, not hers - even the overlap of her laughter with Willie's. She has complete ease with Winnie's constant change of mood; she is as natural speaking of 'the happy day to come when flesh melts at so many degrees', or suppressing a sob in 'That is what I find so wonderful,' as she is when prodding Willie with her parasol or reprimanding him for his personal habits. In details of timing, Scales, Robin Bowerman (Willie) and their director, Jude Kelly, do Becket proud. In two important features, however, this staging diminishes text and play. Both concern our sense of time, and affect the play's larger meaning. Firstly, the two acts are separated here only by a brief scene-adjustment and pause - as Tynan recommended, after the 1962 Royal Court production. But, by doing away with an interval (the play runs at 90 minutes), Kelly has weakened the sense of time's passing. Secondly, the text is heavily sprinkled with pauses - 'too full of infertile pauses,' wrote Tynan. Scales and Kelly, however, leave few pauses longer than a breath, and leave none of them infertile. Scales's eyes and mouth are always nervously on the move. Likewise, in Act One, her hands. The result is rather too rushed, with little sense of waiting, of speech confronting The Great Silence - not just Willie's silence, but the silence of heaven and earth. Pamela Howard's set, with scorched earth vanishing into baking sky, would be ideal if only Winnie's mound were shaped more like a gentle cone, less like a lump of sea-wall. Even so, Happy Days remains a masterpiece of moderist theatre; and, in Leeds, its meanings are all present. Winnie, the ageing breast (or mons Veneris); Willie, the ageing cock. The moods in which a woman addresses the loss of sexual activity, sexual identity, social colloquy, personal memory. The way that the sexes' struggle for power still surfaces. The touching fluctuations of the human spirit while seeing dust inexorably return to dust. Winnie to Willie: 'Just to know you are there within hearing and conceivably on the semi-alert is . . . er . . . paradise enow.'</p>

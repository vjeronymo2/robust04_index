Yeltsin said that more than one person could be  considered for the Soviet presidency, but he shied away from declaring himself  a candidate to face the most likely contender, his one-time supporter, Mikhail  S. Gorbachev. The Congress of People's Deputies, the parliament to which  Yeltsin was elected by a landslide, meets May 25 to choose a president from  among its 2,250 members. If past Soviet Communist Party practice holds,  Gorbachev, the current president and party general secretary, will be the only  candidate. But in an interview, Yeltsin did not discount the possibility of  alternative candidates. "There could be other suggestions from deputies," he  said.  </P></p>

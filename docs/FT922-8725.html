			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Citicorp man may chair O&amp;Y talks MR BILL RHODES, the Citicorp director who leads commercial banks' negotiations with debtor nations in Latin America, has been asked by Olympia &amp; York and its bankers to play a similar role in the O&amp;Y debt talks. In last week's meeting between O&amp;Y, which has debts of Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.7bn), and its 15 biggest bank creditors, Mr Rhodes acted as chairman. He is considering whether to continue to fulfil this function until the troubled property developers' future is resolved. The group of 15 is expected to meet again within the next 10 days and is expected to become the main forum for discussing the big issues confronted by all 100 of O&amp;Y's banks. Meanwhile representatives of the 11 bank lenders to Canary Wharf pointed out yesterday that the future of O&amp;Y's East London office development remains in the balance. 'There is a misunderstanding about why we agreed to provide O&amp;Y with Pounds 21m for Canary Wharf last week', said one senior banker. He said providing the money was not a vote of confidence in Canary Wharf's future. 'Bankers felt on the Canary Wharf sub-committee that time is needed to properly evaluate the project's prospects', he added. The Pounds 21m is enough to keep Canary Wharf out of administration, under UK insolvency procedures, until the end of the month. 'Even if Canary Wharf went into administration, the banks would have to continue funding it', the banker said. The Canary Wharf banks say they are encouraged by the UK government's plan to take around 500,000 sq ft of space at Canary Wharf. However a banker said: 'We need to be sure that the government is taking the space at commercial rates. If it is not, then the commercial viability of Canary Wharf will remain in doubt.' Banks have been told by O&amp;Y that the government is refusing to make any concessions relating to O&amp;Y's commitment to provide Pounds 400m towards the cost of extending the Jubilee underground railway line from central London into Canary Wharf. Bankers had hoped the government would at the very least defer some of O&amp;Y's payments to the end of the decade. As a result, the rental to be paid by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Environment Department for their space will be even more crucial to whether Canary Wharf can avoid administration. O&amp;Y is talking to four other prospective tenants for Canary Wharf. If the government signs up for its space, O&amp;Y believes other possible tenants may do the same. That would allow O&amp;Y to raise funds for the Jubilee line contributions by refinancing individual buildings against the security of future rents.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / English cricket fails its test in management: Lucy Kellaway seeks advice from business experts on the non-sporting qualities Ted Dexter's successor will need WHEN a once-great company makes losses in all its main markets and its chairman resigns in disgrace, it is time for a complete rethink. Likewise with the England cricket team. Yesterday Mr Ted Dexter, chairman of the England selectors since 1989, announced that he would resign at the end of the present series against Australia. England's defeat yesterday means it is losing 4-0 in the six-match series and has lost nine of its last 10 Tests. Under Mr Dexter, England has played 44 Tests, won nine, lost 21 and drawn 14. As the team struggles to repair the damage, management experts are queueing up to offer advice. Mr Paul Buchanan-Barrow of headhunters Korn/Ferry says: 'If the English cricket team was a business it would have a three- to five-year corporate plan. It would mean short-term pain - but that could not be more painful than being 4-0 down against Australia.' The first step, they all agree, is to get the right person at the top. According to Mr Edgar Wille of Ashridge Management College the chairman of the cricket selectors needs to have at least 10 management 'competencies'. He needs the social skills of team-building, networking, listening and empathy. He needs the ability to take risks and to view the world from new perspectives. He must be perceptive, curious, have a good knowledge of his competitors, and be able to gather and use information. These management skills are not necessarily those that great cricketers specialise in; indeed, Mr Buchanan-Barrow questions whether the England team really needs to have a cricketer at the top at all. 'You need someone capable of selecting technicians who can bat or bowl,' he says. 'You might find someone suitable in a successful organisation like SmithKline Beecham or Mars. They must have judgment and vision.' Mr Andrew Campbell, a director of Ashridge Strategic Management Centre, says: 'There is a difficulty in creating a shared sense of mission in these national teams when they only play together occasionally. 'The individuals are under so much pressure they lose sight of team responsibilities. They see themselves not as cricketers but as managers of the brand name.' Mr Campbell questions whether the mechanism of selecting the players is the best one. Most companies would be embarrassed to admit that they promoted staff in the haphazard way of the England cricket team - by part-timers basing judgments on a series of impressions. Most large companies have a formal assessment procedure in which staff members are appraised every year and their record kept on file. County teams could do the same. However, as many companies have found, this assessment procedure can be only as effective as the people who undertake it. A formal system can promise no solution if, like Mr Dexter, the assessors make the wrong choices.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 200 LAID OFF AT TROUBLED WHEELCHAIR COMPANY;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE ACTION BY EVEREST &amp; JENNINGS IS THE LATEST CUTBACK BY A LOCAL  BUSINESS THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A GENERAL SLOWDOWN IN THE COUNTY.  </P> <P> A Camarillo wheelchair company that once dominated the worldwide market has  laid off 200 workers -- about a third of its local work force -- in a quick  attempt to stabilize the financially reeling corporation.  </P> <P> The layoffs at Everest &amp; Jennings International Ltd. are the latest in a  series of cutbacks by area businesses that have contributed to a general  slowdown in the county's economy, according to economic experts.  </P> <P> In addition to the Everest &amp; Jennings' workers, another 670 workers in the  county have been laid off in recent months by such firms as Northrop Corp.,  Raytheon Co. and Texaco.  </P> <P> "This is the worst I've seen it since 1969," said Ralph Chumacher, president of  the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. "I think it reflects the mood of  the whole economy in the United States."  </P> <P> James Esmay, dean of the business school at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand  Oaks, said he expects layoffs among various businesses in the county to  continue.  </P> <P> "I don't think there is any question that the economy has slowed down," Esmay  said. "Whether we are in a recession, we still won't know for a couple of  quarters."  </P> <P> The Everest &amp; Jennings employees, were notified Tuesday and Wednesday that  they were being laid off. Company officials said they hope that the layoffs are  only temporary, but would not speculate when any workers might be rehired.  </P> <P> "Our company has been going through a difficult period," said a company  official who asked not to be identified. "The fact is, there was a need to  reduce our costs very quickly and very decisively. These are the hard actions  you have to make to protect the remaining positions."  </P> <P> The company, which has already cut about 350 workers worldwide since December,  is not anticipating more cuts, officials said. The employees laid off this week  range from salaried managers to assembly workers.  </P> <P> "We will be meeting with the remaining people to make sure they understand the  situation," the official said. "What we're trying to do is steady the  business."  </P> <P> The company -- which made wheelchairs for Franklin D. Roosevelt and Sir Winston  Churchill -- has been struggling to recover from a disastrous attempt to  diversify into other medical products during the 1980s.  </P> <P> In 1989, the company lost $42.1 million on sales of $183.9 million due mainly  to restructuring costs, inventory writedowns and costs of starting new  products.  </P> <P> In two letters written last week to Everest &amp; Jennings, Equity Pacific  Ltd., a major shareholder in the company, said payments on $14 million in loans  it made to the wheelchair manufacturer are overdue.  </P> <P> Top officials at Equity Pacific refused to comment on the matter. But a source  at Equity Pacific said the quick layoff decision could have been prompted by  the complaints about overdue loan payments.  </P> <P> "Something had to be done to bring spending in line with revenues," the source  said.  </P> <P> Although most of the laid-off workers at Everest &amp; Jennings were told that  Wednesday was their last day of work, some will be kept on for another month,  depending on the nature of their jobs, the Everest &amp; Jennings official  said.  </P> <P> "We still hope to recall the workers as quickly as we can, but it's uncertain,"  he said.  </P></p>

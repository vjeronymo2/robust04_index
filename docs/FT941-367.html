			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Norwich Union recovers with Pounds 131m Norwich Union, one of the largest mutual insurers, yesterday reported a return to profitability in its general insurance operations, providing further evidence of recovery in the sector after three years of poor results. The group also indicated that its rates for both motor and home insurance had fallen as claims experience in both sectors has improved. General insurance profits for the year to end December 1993 amounted to Pounds 131m before tax (losses of Pounds 23.4m). Gross premium income increased to Pounds 1.72bn (Pounds 1.7bn) but net claims fell to Pounds 1.07bn (Pounds 1.2bn). With commission and expenses falling to Pounds 375m (Pounds 405m), the company reduced its underwriting losses to Pounds 63.4m (Pounds 167m). Overall investment income rose to Pounds 207m (Pounds 194m). Mr Allan Bridgewater, chief executive, said the reduction in claims had allowed Norwich Union to reduce its premium rate for both home and motor insurance. Claims following thefts from cars fell by a third in 1993 to Pounds 54m. On average, rates for comprehensive motor insurance have fallen by 12 per cent, while rates for household contents policies have dropped by 10 per cent. Mr Bridgewater stressed that part of the decline reflected the greater use by policyholders of security devices and other safety and security measures. Premium income from life business increased to Pounds 2.75bn (Pounds 2.51bn), with new regular premium income amounting to Pounds 192m (Pounds 238m). Sales of single premiums over the year were Pounds 1.19bn (Pounds 952m). The group has also made rapid progress in the health insurance market, which it entered in 1991. Last year premium income increased by 60 per cent to Pounds 105m and profits were recorded in the fourth quarter. Norwich Union now has market share of about 8 per cent and more than half a million customers.</p>

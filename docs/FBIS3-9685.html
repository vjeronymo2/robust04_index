(2) The Coalition Council is made up of the coalition  entities' statutory representatives or by persons authorized in  writing to stand in for them. Unless agreed otherwise in  advance, coalition talks in the Coalition Council are attended  by three representatives of each coalition partner, with two  representatives being the minimum.    (3) The Coalition Council meets always with representatives  of all coalition partners present. Its meetings are held  regularly, at least once a week.

The coalition partners have agreed to respect  until the end of the electoral term the principle of  proportional representation in these bodies, according to the  present strength of the parliamentary clubs.    (4) Each contracting party has the right of veto in the  event of unsuccessful talks on personnel issues.

Consultations will always  be attended by the chairman of the parliamentary club and one  member of the club leadership. Following mutual agreement,  consultations can also be attended by the contracting parties'  experts.    (3) While respecting the principle of professional  expertise, consultations among coalition partners will be held  about filling leading positions in the general and specialized  state administration, appointing ambassadors, and filling posts  in the central bodies of state administration, as well as when  discussing key changes in the posts of district police chiefs.  These consultations will be held through the medium of  ministers nominated for the entities making up this coalition.  The ministers will communicate the position of the partner they  represent no later than one day before the government meeting in  question. If any entity represented in the coalition disagrees  with the proposed changes, the disputed issue must be decided in  the form of a coalition accord.  <H5>  Solution to Disputes </H5> <H5>  Article Eight </H5>   (1) In the event of a situation arising that, in the opinion  of any coalition partner, poses a threat to coalition  cooperation, this partner's chairman or his authorized deputy  will establish contact with the other coalition partners without  delay. The coalition partners will try to coordinate their  activity and reach consensus on measures that are suited to  improve the situation or come to terms with the disputed issue.    (2) Objections raised by any coalition partner to the  professional qualifications or political competence of  officeholders appointed on the basis of a coalition accord are  dealt with in the Coalition Council.  <H5>  Provisional and Final Stipulations </H5> <H5>  Article Nine </H5>   (1) In the interest of achieving consensus in addressing the  problems of contemporary society and with the aim of improving  ethnic relations in the Slovak Republic, the coalition partners  have agreed to cooperate with the Coexistence Movement and the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, political entities that  do not participate in the government.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, Fatah leader in the </F> occupied territories and Palestinian negotiator, by Sa'id  Mu'addi; place and date not given; from the "With the Events"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni: The Kakh and  Kahana Hay movements have been outlawed. How does the  Palestinian side view the [Israeli] Government's decision in  this regard?    [Al-Husayni] First, I believe this decision came too late.  It was unnecessary to commit the [Hebron] massacre in order to  make such a decision. In any case, to make such a decision--no  matter how late--is better than not to make any decision.  However, what is more important than making this decision is  implementing it, and figuring out how to do it. Will this  actually be a battle against all these settlers who are opposed  to the peace process and the idea of peace, or will its  implementation be confined to those whose membership in Kakh is  confirmed?    [Mu'addi] What can be done immediately to ease the tension  prevailing in the Palestinian streets in the wake of this  incident?    [Al-Husayni] First, I believe that the settlers residing in  Hebron should be evacuated. In addition, arrangements should be  made to protect the Palestinian people's security. Such  arrangements should include the issue of arming the settlers  everywhere. We believe that these settlers should be disarmed,  and that the army, and not the settlers, should maintain  security, especially since many of these settlers engaged in  settlement activities from the very beginning in order to  achieve a single objective; namely, to foil this political  process.    We also believe that the file of settlements should be  opened  at the negotiating table because this directly concerns the  Palestinian people's security. This issue should thus be  discussed. Discussions should not be confined to the Israeli  people's security, as was the case in the past.    [Mu'addi] Do you believe that Israeli-Palestinian  negotiations may resume next week in light of the intensive  consultations and contacts in Tunis, Washington, and Jerusalem?    [Al-Husayni] In fact, it depends on the practices on the  ground in terms of evacuating the settlers and releasing the  Palestinian detainees. All these issues, together, can pave the  way for the resumption of negotiations. I believe it is almost  impossible to resume negotiations without making any kind of  implementation on the ground.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni: Thank you very much, and  many happy returns ['Id greetings].    [Al-Husayni] Same to you.</p>

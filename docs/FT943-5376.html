			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Bougainville peace agreement The six-year guerrilla war on the Pacific island of Bougainville, controlled by Papua New Guinea, moved towards peace at the weekend after talks between Sir Julius Chan, PNG's newly elected prime minister, and Commander General Sam Kauona, leader of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA). A formal declaration said PNG troops and BRA rebels would 'maintain static positions' until a ceasefire was announced this week, when a South Pacific peacekeeping force would be sent to the island to ensure the truce was honoured. The Bougainville dispute centres on islanders' demands for self-rule. Tensions were inflamed in the 1970s and 1980s with the building of the Panguna copper mine, operated by Australia's CRA. Local landowners claimed that they did not get enough compensation and that income from the mine was siphoned back to CRA or the PNG government at the expense of the island's community.</p>

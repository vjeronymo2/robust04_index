In implementing these objectives, the Secretary determined to remove the Regional organizational layer and provide officials at lower organizational levels full authority to carry out program functions, with these field office officials reporting directly to program officials at Headquarters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 15, 1994, the Department published a Notice revoking and redelegating program authority to meet the objectives of the reorganization for the Office of Housing (59 FR 18282). That notice indicated that HUD would be issuing further guidance to field staff concerning their specific functions and responsibilities under the programs. This document contains that guidance, and revokes the redelegation contained within the April 15 notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the reorganization, field offices are categorized by Housing as AA (Super A), A, B, C+, C, and D offices. Each of the field offices are listed below by these categories. The geographic areas that constitute the specific jurisdictions of each field office will be addressed in a notice to be published and distributed separately from this delegation. The program areas of the Office of Housing_FHA include single family housing programs, multifamily housing programs, and nursing home and hospital mortgage insurance programs. This notice lists the programs in each of these program areas (see Part II below headed PROGRAMS) and the program functions (see Part III below headed FUNCTIONS) which are being redelegated. Depending on the category of the field office and other factors, there are slight variations, as further specified below, as to which program area is being handled in a particular field office and as to which HUD officials are being redelegated the authority to carry out the program functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Norway to sell bank holdings Norway's minority Labour government yesterday won parliamentary support for plans to reduce its holdings in the country's three largest banks. Over a three-year period the state became the controlling shareholder of the top three banks following a far-reaching rescue operation in which it injected NKr17bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to save them from collapse during the country's worst banking crisis since the second world war. The state is to cut its holdings in Den norkse Bank, the largest commercial bank, and Christiania Bank, the second largest, first to 50 per cent and later to 33.3 per cent. The state owns outright Fokus Bank, the third largest commercial bank, and plans sell its entire holding.</p>

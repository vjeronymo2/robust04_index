			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FINDING WORK IS NEVER A PROBLEM FOR BOB SAGET  </P> <P> "I mean, 'Videos' is a fad, obviously," Bob Saget said. "And people are going  to be saturated with a lot of video shows. I think there's a 24-hour video  channel coming on. But, I think, you know, whatever happens, happens. I'm not  going to run around scared. I'll just find something else to do -- maybe lawn  work."  </P> <P> Finding work is not exactly a problem these days for Bob Saget. The comedian  stars in two of television's hottest shows. Saget is host of ABC's "America's  Funniest Home Videos," which soared into the Nielsen Top 10 this spring and  never left, spawning numerous imitators and boosting sales of home video  equipment across the country.  </P> <P> He also stars as Danny Tanner in the ABC Top 20 sitcom "Full House." Tanner is  the single parent of three daughters in the show.  </P> <P> Saget met with television critics for a press conference in Los Angeles to  promote yet another television show, his HBO special "Bob Saget: In the Dream  State," which premieres Aug. 4 on the cable channel.  </P> <P> The show is a combination of dramatized dream sequences and stand-up comedy  performances by Saget, who directed the show and co-wrote it with his wife,  Sherri Kramer Saget, an attorney turned writer. The Sagets have two daughters.  </P> <P> Saget's status as a parent is important because so much of his on-screen  persona is connected with parenting.  </P> <P> Part of what makes his Danny Tanner character so appealing to the preteen  audience for "Full House" is that the three children run the house he's  supposed to be running. In that way, he's a child's dream parent. Saget also  cultivates that image in his HBO special.  </P> <P> "The HBO show is actually about being a parent and trying to get stuff done,  but you can't because you're up all night," Saget said. "People would say it  has a yuppie, 'thirtysomething' kind of feel to it sometimes. . . . It really  has a lot of me in it."  </P> <P> Saget said that because of the runaway ratings success of "America's Funniest  Homes Videos," being himself these days mainly means being busy.  </P> <P> "The success of 'Videos' has made me busier. But even when I didn't have any  work, I would always find a lot of work for myself to do," he said. "I've  always been kind of a workaholic, and I love working a lot. That's why I love  juggling all these shows."  </P> <P> Juggling involves taping "Full House" Monday through Thursday and "Funniest  Home Videos" on Friday. "And I'm also one of the writers on 'Videos,' " Saget  said. "So (the other writers) will come to my dressing room at 'Full House'  during the week when both shows are in production. . . . And, during lunch  hours and in between scenes I'm not in on 'Full House,' we'll be writing the  'Videos' show."  </P> <P> Saget sidestepped the controversy surrounding the use of videos that show  people or animals being hurt. "I don't choose the videos. Some I like. Some I  don't like. And that's the way it is."  </P></p>

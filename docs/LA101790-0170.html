			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> WHOOPI PROMOTES ROLE REVERSAL  </P> <P> Whoopi Goldberg believes actors should be able to play all roles, regardless of  race or sex.  </P> <P> "The part I played in 'Burglar' was written for Bruce Willis. 'Burglar' was his  film, and he dropped out of it," she said in the November issue of McCall's  magazine.  </P> <P> Goldberg, currently starring as the hotheaded, softhearted owner of  television's "Bagdad Cafe," said, "That's why my Broadway show was so startling  to some people, because I could do all those characters."  </P> <P> Those characters included a white "surfer chick," a male druggie with a  doctorate in literature and a 9-year-old black girl who lusts for long, blond  hair.  </P></p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine shrugs off Opposition ambush MR MICHAEL HESELTINE emerged virtually unscathed from a political ambush by Labour MPs when he made his first appearance in the Commons yesterday to answer questions about his new responsibilities as president of the board of trade. The Opposition contrasted his low profile since the general election with the challenging speeches on economic and industrial policy that captured the headlines during the period when he was seeking to replace Mrs Margaret Thatcher as leader of the Conservative party. Highlighting the views expressed by Mr Heseltine at that time, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, asked what had happened to such ideas as tax credits to encourage research, a levy to finance training, and the reshaping of regional policy and export services. To Labour cheers, Mr Brown demanded: 'Why is action man failing to act? Have you exchanged your principles for your presidency?' In dismissive tones, Mr Heseltine said he had just exchanged the Department of the Environment - his first post on returning to the cabinet - for the Department of Trade and Industry. He said the ideas favoured by Mr Brown were the basis for discussion during the general election, and added: 'Having failed to persuade the country, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to persuade the House of Commons.' Mr Heseltine told another Labour critic that he would offer no excuses for the present situation. He said: 'I would merely explain that this country has to fight its way out of one of the worst recessions since the war.' To succeed, Britain had to 'excel in the increasingly competitive world which we face'.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dr Pepper IPO plan revived FIVE months after it dropped plans to go public because of unfavourable stock market conditions, Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the big US drinks group, has revived its plan to sell shares in an initial public offering of common stock. But the size of the issue has been scaled down. The original plan was to sell 38m shares between Dollars 17 and Dollars 18 each, but Dr Pepper said it would sell only 20m shares, with a target price of Dollars 14 a share. Over the summer a number of planned flotations were temporarily withdrawn or abandoned because investor appetite for IPOs had waned. But shares have performed well recently and demand for new stock has recovered.</p>

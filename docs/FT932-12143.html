			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Kverneland buys Taarup KVERNELAND, the Norwegian producer of farming equipment, has bought Taarup of Denmark in a strategically important move to expand its range of grass machines and related products. Terms were not disclosed, but the deal boosts Kverneland's consolidated turnover by about 30 per cent to NKr1.3bn (Dollars 196m). To strengthen its capital base after the takeover, Kverneland proposes a one-for-three rights issue to raise about NKr78m. The group is best known for its soil preparation equipment and potato machinery. In grass machines, it had previously been represented only through its niche bale-wrapping product Silawrap.</p>

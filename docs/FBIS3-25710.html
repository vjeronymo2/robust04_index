This is the first  concrete result of peace talks, which began on Tuesday [22  February] in Bangui in the Central African Republic. Talks are  continuing today. The rebel movement, the National Awakening  Committee for Peace and Democracy [Comite de Sursaut National  pour la Paix et la Democratie -- CSNPD] is calling for a  referendum on setting up a federal state in Chad. Moise Kette  explained the request:    [Begin Kette recording] We will be examining the second  condition, relating to the organization of a referendum on the  form of the state. The unitary state has exacerbated the  tensions between the different communities to such an extent  that we feel that, in order to preserve the very unity of Chad,  it has become important to reconsider the form of the state. If  the people vote, the CSNPD will respect their verdict. We are  not going to impose federalism by decree, but we think that the  people are sovereign and that they have to be consulted. If we  do this, it is in the interest of the Chadian people. Some  people think that federalism means secession. Far from it, we  see it rather as a form of management; we have to try to adapt,  the least we can do is to try. If, in the long term, we find  that federalism is not appropriate, then we can return to the  unitary model. [end recording]</p>

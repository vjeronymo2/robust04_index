			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALK BIG, SPEND SMALL: OUR CHEAP FOREIGN POLICY  </P> <P> When Prsident George Bush visited Poland last month, he heard from Solidarity  leader Lech Walesa that Poland needed $10 billion in external aid to rebuild  its economy and avoid the dangers of political instability and social conflict.  Predictably, the U.S. reply has fallen far short -- even though Bush did say  Thursday he was sending additional food aid to Poland.  </P> <P> Now that Poland is on the way to installing its first non-Communist government  since World War II, Washington has agreed to help mobilize an international  package of assistance worth about $500 million, consisting mostly of World Bank  loans. This bargain-basement approach would be understandable if it were based  on a hard-headed calculation of how much external financing the Polish  government can effectively use or an unwillingness to put any real cash behind  our foreign policy priorities. For without cash, U.S. priorities become mere  rhetorical statements of preference, which no one knows how seriously to take.  </P> <P> This is the wrong time for Uncle Sam to have become an international Scrooge.  Some of the goals that have long been at the heart of American policy may now  be within reach, yet we run the risk of losing them for want of money. And new  global problems are emerging -- drugs and environment, for instance -- whose  solution will require enormous investments. Cold cash may be more important  than military muscle in advancing our interests in today's world.  </P> <P> Ever since the 1940s a fundamental U.S. aim has been to end Soviet domination  over Eastern Europe and the division of the continent into militarily and  ideologically hostile blocks. The first hesitant movement in those directions  is now under way in Poland, where the Soviet Union is today accepting  non-Communist leadership. If the new government succeeds, it will point the way  for other countries, and bolster Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform efforts in the  Soviet Union itself. But Poland's deep economic troubles could overwhelm the  experiment and produce a prolonged political crisis that would reverberate  throughout the Soviet Bloc. The curtain might well fall on further political  liberalization in Poland or anywhere else in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> This scenario is not inevitable, but it is a possibility. With more substantial  external help than is now being contemplated, the odds favoring a better future  for Poland could doubtlessly be improved.  </P> <P> It is not only in Eastern Europe that the United States may end up paying a  high price for its penury. Washington has enthusiastically celebrated Latin  America's democratic wave of the 1980s, as elected civilian governments have  replaced repressive military regimes in most countries of the region. But the  new democracies are still fragile, and their survival remains threatened by  Latin America's prolonged crisis of debt and economic depression.  </P> <P> The United States has responded to their appeals for help, not with debt relief  or significant new resources, but with lectures on free-market economics. And  even those countries that have sought to undertake U.S.-promoted  market-oriented reforms have found their way blocked by shortages of external  capital. Turning a cash-starved private sector into a vibrant engine of  economic growth is not an easy proposition anywhere.  </P> <P> In a period when Latin America is sending some $25 billion a year abroad to  meet its annual debt payments, and when investment at home is at an all time  low, U.S. aid to the region totals only $1.2 billion a year -- two-thirds of  that goes to tiny Central America. The amount for all of South America, where  the democratic trend has been most promising, was a meager $110 million in  1988, a negligible fraction of the continent's revenue from the drug trade.  </P> <P> And what about narcotics trafficking -- which Americans now identify as this  country's major foreign-policy problem? Despite our rhetoric about taking the  war on drugs to the source, the United States has been allocating only about  $100 million a year -- less than 2% of our federal drug budget -- to help other  countries eradicate crops, attack criminal networks and seize drug shipments.  This is spare change for the drug cartels, but it is positively munificent  compared with what we spend on international environmental problems such as  global warming and ozone depletion, which threaten untold harm from global  climatic disturbances.  </P> <P> We seem to have lost sight of the fact that many of our major policy triumphs  over the years have resulted from the effective and large-scale use of our  financial resources -- from backing our rhetoric with real money. Our greatest  postwar success was the Marshall Plan, which prompted Western Europe's economic  recovery, and thereby helped to avert the political and social breakdown of our  closest allies.  </P> <P> The Marshall Plan cost the United States some $13.5 billion over four years  (1948-1952), or about 1.2% of our gross national product, the equivalent today  of about $48 billion per year -- a virtually unimaginable sum. Today, our  annual foreign-aid expenditures worldwide -- for development assistance,  military aid, food shipments and support for multinational financial  institutions -- are less than one-third that amount. Indeed, we now spend a  smaller share of our GNP on overseas aid than any other major industrial  country.  </P> <P> In 1961, following Fidel Castro's rise to power in Cuba, we launched the  Alliance for Progress, the greatest U.S. effort ever to spur economic  development, social equity and political democracy in this Hemisphere. Although  the Alliance fell short of its ambitious (and probably impractical) social and  political goals, it did help set the stage for the region's subsequent rapid  economic expansion and modernization. President John F. Kennedy pledged to make  at least $1 billion a year available for the aims of the Alliance -- the  equivalent in today's dollars of about $5 billion -- or five times what we now  spend annually in Latin America.  </P> <P> Money was also a crucial element in achieving the Camp David Accords. President  Jimmy Carter's promise of economic assistance to Israel and Egypt now costs us  $8 billion a year -- more than one-half our total foreign-aid budget. Could we  afford another Middle East peace agreement today?  </P> <P> We are, of course, living in a period of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, of immense  budget and trade deficits and of domestic savings-and-loan and health-care  crises. But what is most in short supply is not money; it is our resolve to use  it to advance our goals and our values overseas. Poll after poll indicates that  the American people do not want to spend money overseas. Many, if not most of  us, would even cut back further on our current paltry expenditures.  </P> <P> Our tightfisted foreign policy should not be blamed on the American voter,  however. Our President and our other leaders have the responsibility to lead,  not merely to mirror public opinion; it is up to them to define what, in fact,  our vital interests are, to make intelligent choices about how best to use our  resources to advance those interests -- and then seek to mobilize political  support behind their choices, whether that requires increased taxes, defense  cuts or whatever.  </P> <P> The United States is, after all, still the richest country in history. We have  the resources to act as a great power and to make a constructive difference in  today's world. But we must understand that we cannot do so unless we are  prepared to place significant resources behind our international goals. We  cannot hope to build a world that reflects our own best values and long-term  interests on a shoestring budget.  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Mexican deputy to be charged The Mexican Congress has moved to strip immunity from its member implicated by the attorney-general's office in the assassination last week of Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, who was the number two official in the governing party, the PRI, Damian Fraser writes in Mexico City. The Congress said that it would lift the parliamentary immunity of Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, a PRI congressman from the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. The attorney-general's office is ready to charge Mr Munoz with having masterminded the assassination. Investigators said they had been told by an accomplice to the assassination that Mr Munoz and Mr Rubio Canales, a former colleague of Mr Ruiz Massieu who is now in prison, had plotted the murder so as to slow political reform in the country, to settle an old score with an enemy, and to weaken the government's battle against drug traffickers. Financial markets in Mexico were rattled by the accounts of an alliance between drug traffickers and political reactionaries willing to kill reform-minded politicians. The Mexico City stock market yesterday finished 2.2 per cent lower than the Friday close.</p>

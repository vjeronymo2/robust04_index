			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Travel: Dodging the herd on Limnos LAST September I enjoyed a pleasant week's holiday at the Akti Myrina hotel on Limnos, a low-lying island in the north-eastern Aegean. The visit was organised by The Best of Greece, a small upmarket tour operator that claims that 'long ago, we learned one essential thing about running a travel business to and in Greece: we don't cut corners and we don't look after the herd, the masses.' Its current brochure even quotes Noel Coward: 'Why do all the wrong people travel, travel, travel and all the right people stay at home.' Fair enough. The brochure was written well before John Major's win in last month's UK election, though perhaps next year's brochure will adopt a less class-conscious tone. But possibly it won't, for it cannot be doubted that The Best of Greece attracts well-heeled customers who want hassle-free holidays in the sort of hotels featured in its brochure. The new driving force at The Best of Greece is David Barber, who took over as general manager in March last year. Since then he has travelled extensively through the islands, seeking out 'hidden gems' like the Villa Andromeda, a former ambassadorial residence in Chania, Crete; the Tsitouras Collection, five houses converted from a 19th century mansion on Santorini; the Villa Daphne on Paros, and the private island (two houses) of Argironisos, off the Pilion peninsular. Also new this year is the Candia Park Village near Aghios Nikolaos, Crete, due to open next month, and a new choice of sailing holidays. Having spent a week at the Akti Myrina on Limnos eight months ago, it gave me idle pleasure to compare the brochure's up-beat assessment of the hotel and the island with my own recollections. The brochure calls the Akti Myrina one of Greece's finest hotels, emphasising its 'sublime accommodation on a peaceful island undisturbed by tourism' and waxing lyrical about its friendliness, setting (125 stone-walled cottages dotted over 20 acres of parkland), sports facilities (not just water sports - yawn - but tennis) and food. My experience of Greek hotels is limited, but I am happy with the brochure's claim that many guests return to the Akti Myrina year after year and almost look on it as a second home. As for Limnos, The Best of Greece correctly describes it as peaceful, with a quaint little capital, and 'dry and hot in summer but blessed with many fine sandy bays and beaches.' Perfectly true. What the brochure does not mention is the wind on Limnos. It is an extremely windy island. I hired an open jeep for a couple of days and my executive assistant, Miss Lee, travelling with me, was almost blown up into the sky, while my efforts at sunbathing on the hotel's beach were constantly thwarted. No muscle-clad bully kicked sand in my face; the wind did it for him. Prices at the Akti Myrina for holidays booked through The Best of Greece are on a half-board basis (dinner and breakfast) and include economy flights. Drinks are expensive. If you can avoid the peak period, prices at the Akti Myrina between June 1-July 12 and August 31-September 28 (from London) range from approximately Pounds 885 per person for seven nights in a twin standard cottage (Pounds 1,400 for 14 nights) to approximately Pounds 1,160 pp in a duplex front row (two-bathroom) cottage (Pounds 1,900 for 14 nights). Single cottages are available. These prices do not include transport to UK airports, watersports, excursions, drink or insurance.

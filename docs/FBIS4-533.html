			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. Waugh and H. Grange] </F>   [Text] If all goes according to plan, South Africa's new  government will be in office by mid-May. The dramatic moment  will follow the May 6 election of a new president by the  National Assembly and the formation of a multiparty Cabinet of  national unity. It will be preceded by a series of important  steps, triggered by the election.    Below are the major stepping stones on the path to the  future, gleaned by THE STAR from negotiating documents, the  various agencies involved and political parties.    -- On April 26 special voting will be held for people who  are  pregnant, aged, disabled or sick. South Africans overseas will  vote on the same day.    -- On April 27 and 28 ordinary voting will take place. April  27 will be a public holiday, and schools will remain closed on  April 28. Voting hours will be from 7 AM to 7 PM over the three  days.    -- The votes will be counted at 1,200 counting stations  around the country by electoral enumerators.    -- It is expected that the counting should be completed  within two days. In terms of electoral legislation, the results  will not be announced earlier than 48 hours after the polls  close -- and not more than 10 days later, by May 8.    -- The national and provincial results are likely to be  announced simultaneously by Independent Electoral Commission  chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler in Midrand. The names of  the candidates who will go to the national parliament and the  provincial legislatures will also be made public at that time.    -- The country will then enter the so-called "interregnum",  where the current government will act as a caretaker until the  new government takes power.    -- The nine provincial legislatures will convene for the  first time on May 5, while the National Assembly will be  convened by the Chief Justice in Cape Town on May 6. The  president will be elected by the National Assembly, and the  provincial assemblies will elect their premier.    -- Barring any delay in counting, the current Government  will  formally leave office on May 6. This will follow the convening  by the new president, in conjunction with leaders of other  parties with more than 5 percent of support, of a Cabinet of  national unity.    -- It is understood that the new parliament will continue  sitting until May 10. At this point the new president will be  inaugurated at a high-profile ceremony, due to be held in  Pretoria.</p>

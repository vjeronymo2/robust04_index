			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: UPLAND;  </P> <P> SEIZED GUITARS ATTRACT COLLECTORS  </P> <P> The collector shouted "8,000" to the auctioneer, and Brent Haesler knew it was  time to quit bidding.  </P> <P> Haesler, an amateur guitarist from Palos Verdes, was prepared to spend up to  $4,000 for a classic six-string but instead settled for a well-worn 1950  acoustic that was easily within budget at $300.  </P> <P> "I've never seen this many collectible guitars in one location," said Haesler,  36, whose modest collection includes a 1957 Gibson Les Paul.  </P> <P> More than 150 dealers, collectors and musicians from Washington to Japan  converged on an Upland auction yard Thursday night to bid on 87 vintage guitars  seized last year from a Thousand Oaks drug dealer.  </P> <P> When the bidding ended, United Auctions had taken in $112,850, and the  anti-drug unit of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department was $102,693.50  richer, after deducting a 9% auctioneer's fee.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies seized the guitars, along with $76,155 in cash and a 1988  Camaro, during a September, 1989, raid on the Potrero Road residence of William  H. Budnik.  </P> <P> Budnik argued that he paid legitimate money for the guitars, whose value he  estimated at about $100,000.  </P> <P> He dropped the claim after pleading guilty to possession of marijuana for sale  and serving several months of a one-year sentence in the Ventura County Jail.  </P> <P> The auction was held under an outdoor canopy with a jazz band accompanying  registered bidders who wanted to test the guitars' sound quality.  </P> <P> Albert Sullivan, 57, of Thousand Oaks satisfied a longtime desire when he  walked away with a 1949 Gibson jazz guitar.  </P> <P> Sullivan, who works in the electronics industry, said he has put off guitar  studies for years because he lacked a finely crafted instrument.  </P> <P> "I have an affinity for Gibsons since I had one in college that I sold when  money got tight," Sullivan said. "This scratches a longtime itch."  </P> <P> Collector Mac Yasuda paid the top price of the night in shelling out $8,000 for  a 1962 Fender Stratocaster, which was valued at $10,000. Several of the most  expensive guitars sold below their appraised values, while many guitars worth  $200 to $300 netted twice the price.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of happy buyers who walked away with bargains," said Bob Mohs of  United Auctions.  </P> <P> But, "There may be some purchases that people will be disappointed about once  they come out from under the ether."  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department officials suspected that Budnik might turn up to reclaim  some of his most coveted pieces, but auction officials recorded no sales to  him.  </P> <P> Judy Thompson, the Sheriff Department's property custodian, said the onetime  owner could only have gone away heartbroken.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of guitars here he could never replace," she said.  </P> <P> Said Doug Moran of United Auctions: "It would be tough for him to show up. Sort  of like going to your girlfriend's wedding or being the bellhop on her  honeymoon." CHRISTOPHER PUMMER  </P></p>

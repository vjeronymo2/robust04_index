			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Crossrail pressure resisted by Major THE GOVERNMENT tried yesterday to head off pressure from business leaders for a swift decision on the timing of legislation needed before the Pounds 2bn London Crossrail scheme can go ahead. As Mr John Major chaired a cabinet committee called to discuss the future of the joint public-private sector project, Downing Street played down suggestions that an early decision was vital if the project was to survive. Mr Major faced a dispute between the Treasury and the Department of Transport over the spread of risk between the private and public sectors. When agreed, the formula is expected to set the trend for other joint projects - including the extension of the Jubilee underground line - following a change of rules announced in the Autumn Statement. The prime minister is keen to encourage more private involvement in infrastructure projects, but the Treasury insists that commercial sponsors should not be allowed to make a return without risk. However, in a letter to The Times today, 13 business leaders complain there has been little progress since the project was given approval in October. They emphasise that they understand pressures on public spending, but say they do not expect the Treasury to foot all of the bill - the private sector had indicated its willingness to contribute substantial sums. Signatories include Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry; Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors; Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange; Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential; Mr Colin Parsons, chairman of Taylor Woodrow; Sir Peter Walters, chairman of Midland Bank; and Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster.</p>

Departing delegates from  the 48th session of the General Assembly which practically ended  today but for a few routine items were given the cheerful news  that 1994 will mark the start of a dynamic, growth-oriented  world economy.    The coming years will be especially good for South Asia,  particularly India. According to them, India would attain an  annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent, benefiting from its  reform-oriented policies and by positive global economic trends.    Mr. Cristian Oasa, U.N. economist and director of the  Department of Economic and Social Information, who released the  Department's year-end global survey, gave two reasons for this  optimism and ambivalence about the U.S. economic situation had  ended and it was now seen headed for strong growth, and the  Uruguay round for trade negotiations had concluded on a  successful note. "Both these factors were not present last  year," said Mr. Oasa.    African situation disturbing: While all regions of  the world, markedly Asia, were poised for greater growth, the  economic situation in Africa remained "disturbing," he noted.  Output in Africa was estimated to have grown only by 2 per cent  much less than its rate of population growth. The outlook for  1994 was likely to be no better.    Referring to Asia, Mr. Oasa said the region was slated to  remain the fastest-growing area. This was inspite of the fact  that China was expected to grow by only 10 per cent for the  first time in three years.    "India continues to accelerate out of its adjustment-related  slowdown at the beginning of the decade" the survey said. "Its  output in 1994 is predicted to rise at 5.5 per cent."    Along with the growth rate of six per cent or more in  several  countries, including the Republic of Korea, Taiwan province of  China, Indonesia and Thailand, the combined growth of South and  East Asia is expected to exceed six per cent.    The year-end survey predicted a rise in world trade by six  per cent in 1994. This was an improvement over last year when  there was a fall in world trade because of weak economic growth  in Europe and Japan.    Industrialised countries were expected to enter the recovery  phase of their economic cycles in 1994. While unemployment will  continue to remain high in Europe, the report said the job rate  in the United States was expected to be the highest in the  industrialised world.    The survey concludes with the observation that "the spirit  of  cooperation that prevailed among all groups of countries in the  last stages of the Uruguay round of trade negotiations gives  ground for optimism. Indeed, the conclusion of the round has  given rise to opportunities which could mark the beginning of a  more dynamic world economy."    The survey is expected to be considered by the Economic and  Social Council which holds its next session at New York next  month.    Resolutions adopted: The General Assembly, working  at top speed on Wednesday, passed a number of resolutions and  reports sent up by its main economic committee.    Two resolutions on the issue of international economic  cooperation adopted were noteworthy. One draft, strongly backed  by the nonaligned group, asked the industrialised creditor  nations and multilateral organisations to take additional  measures including, cancellation or reduction, to alleviate the  external debt burden of developing countries. The resolution  received 146 affirmative votes in an Assembly of 184 nations but  there was one negative vote cast by the United States.    Explaining its opposition to the resolution, the U.S.  delegate said the U.N. was hardly the forum to raise this  matter. For multilateral debts, the forum was the executive  boards of the IMF and the World Bank and the Paris Club which,  he said, had given debt relief to many countries. As regards  bilateral debts, this could be usefully discussed with the  bilateral creditors.    On the issue of North-South issues, the Assembly called for  strengthening "constructive dialogue and partnership" in order  to promote further international cooperation and development.  Such a dialogue should be conducted "in response to the  imperatives of mutual interests and benefits, genuine  interdependence, shared responsibilities and the partnership for  sustainable development."</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Technology: Research not to be sneezed at - Scientists are closer to finding a cure for the cold, writes Sheila Jones in a series on drug discoveries A vaccine for the common cold is a distant dream but a cure may be closer to hand. Scientists have tried for years to fathom the mysteries of the many viruses that cause the cold. There have been several false dawns. The discovery in 1985 of the structure of the rhinovirus - of which there are at least 120 out of about 200 cold viruses - was heralded as the breakthrough that might produce a vaccine. Some researchers said at the time, however, that its very complexity meant a vaccine was probably impossible. Yet, it was a breakthrough. It meant scientists could begin to think about designing a drug that might stop the virus. Nearly 10 years on, there is no new drug that does more than alleviate cough and cold symptoms. Drugs are becoming more sophisticated, but none prevents infection. Now, there is another breakthrough. In March this year, Agouron Pharmaceuticals, a small US company, announced it had discovered the atomic structure of rhinovirus 3C protease (RVP), an enzyme that plays a vital role in the lifecycle of the rhinovirus. The RVP enzyme helps the virus to do its work as it enters the body (through the nose, eyes or mouth), producing the symptoms associated with colds. 'It is probably the most important breakthrough since the structure of the virus was discovered in 1985,' according to Jeffrey Almond, microbiology professor at the University of Reading, one of the main centres of research in the UK into the common cold. Agouron believes the discovery will enable it to design a drug, atom by atom, that will lock into the enzyme and inhibit or stop rhinovirus replication. It sounds familiar, but there are some differences. First, every virus and rhinovirus would need its own vaccine because each is minutely different: Agouron believes the enzyme structure is common, or similar, to at least the rhinoviruses. If it can design a drug to fit the RVP enzyme, it could reach half of all colds. Second, Agouron, in common with several other pharmaceutical companies, is working with computerised drug design. Computing tools can provide important leads in the search for the right atom to create a molecule that locks on to a virus. The chances of hitting the right combination are greater because scientists can try out any number of combinations more swiftly than they could 10 years ago. Agouron says it hopes to have a drug in the development phase by next year, although it will be 'some years' before such a drug would be on the market. Drugs go through years of clinical trials before they are allowed on to the market, whether for prescription or over-the-counter sale. Initially, Agouron plans to develop agents for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Agouron is not alone in the race to design a drug to kill the cold. Agouron provided Eli Lilly, the US company, with the RVP structure in exchange for commercial rights to anti-HIV agents produced jointly by the two companies. Also in the picture are Japan Tobacco, the main contributor of funds for Agouron's anti-viral research, and Syntex, a US subsidiary of Roche of Switzerland, which is also contributing. JT has contributed Dollars 56m (Pounds 35m) to the collaboration in the past three to four years, in exchange for a licensing and profit-sharing arrangement. Any other company, Agouron acknowledges, could establish the enzyme structure and design a prophylactic drug. Yet all researchers are aiming at an extremely difficult target, says David Tyrell, a virologist who ran the common colds research unit at Salisbury in the UK for 26 years until its closure in 1990. 'You need to produce something that will kill the virus but won't also damage the delicate nerves and tissue in the nose or cause irritation that is worse than the cold,' says Tyrell. He points to the early optimism about interferon in the mid-1980s. The first experiments showed that it stopped the cold but it produced unacceptable side-effects, including nasal damage. As the world waits for a cure, the OTC coughs and colds industry is constantly upgrading and refining its products. Nearly two-thirds of cold sufferers seek self-medication in a global market worth about Pounds 3.5bn a year. The trend in the industry is to improve what is already available. Most cough and cold remedies contain an analgesic, such as paracetamol or aspirin, plus one or more active ingredients to control specific symptoms. These include decongestants such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine and sedative antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine and promethazine, to suppress coughing and to dry a runny nose. The industry has sought to target specific symptoms, to improve tastes and delivery systems, to speed up and prolong treatment effectiveness, and to produce better and safer packaging. The industry has also produced new mixes with drugs coming off prescription and on to the OTC market. Two years ago, the antihistamine Tavist, developed by Sandoz of Switzerland, switched from prescription to OTC and is now an ingredient in the company's cough and cold remedies. Boehringer Ingelheim, which leads the German market, says it is focusing on switching more prescription-only drugs to the OTC market following the move to OTC of its Bisolvon cough treatment, which sells about DM245m (Pounds 102m) annually, DM45m of which is prescription-based. Crookes Healthcare, the UK division of Boots Healthcare International, launched ibuprofen, the analgesic, anti-pyretic (lowers temperature) and anti-inflammatory drug onto the OTC market in 1983 as Nurofen. This year, the company produced a new formulation - Nurofen Cold &amp; Flu tablets - the first specific cold treatment sold OTC containing ibuprofen. The product's other active ingredient is the decongestant pseudoephedrine. P&amp;G is also launching in the US a patented formula in its Vicks range which is ibuprofen-based and contains a decongestant. Procter &amp; Gamble's recent repackaging of some products is typical of moves under way elsewhere in the industry. P&amp;G's new Accutip packaging for its cough products restricts the amount of liquid leaving the bottle, and SmithKline Beecham has recently repackaged its top-selling Contac line of cold remedies. Johnson &amp; Johnson has introduced the Tylenol FastCap, a bottle cap that opens with a slight twist. It is aimed at elderly or arthritic people and households without young children. Improved delivery systems in recent years include easy-to-swallow gelatin capsules and day/night tablets of drowsy and non-drowsy cold formulas in one package. The market, dominated globally by a handful of international groups, is also trying to produce better-tasting remedies, such as SmithKline's range of Beecham powders for hot drinks containing honey and lemon. Reckitt &amp; Colman, of the UK, now produces a range of its leading Lemsip brand, with drowsy and non-drowsy formulas, capsules and flu strength. The company says more Lemsip products, with known pharmaceutical agents, are being developed. Leaders in the global coughs and colds OTC market are P&amp;G, which has about a 15 per cent share, according to industry estimates; Warner Wellcome, the Anglo-American joint venture between Warner Lambert of the US (which produces Benylin) and Wellcome of the UK (which makes Sudafed) with 14 per cent; American Home Products, with about 8 per cent, and SmithKline Beecham, which has a 4.5 per cent share (this is expected to rise to about 7 per cent when details of SB's recent acquisition of Sterling Health are finalised). None of the leading pharmaceuticals companies is betting on a cure, but all are reshaping, repackaging and remixing. 'The goal is to get a cure,' according to P&amp;G, 'but before you get there, you have to try to improve what's available now.' A six-part series on cancer research will start on the Technology Page next month. The drug discovery series will resume next summer.  ------------------------------------------------------            EUROPEAN COUGH MEDICINE MARKET  ------------------------------------------------------ Brand value  ------------------------------------------------------ Brand                  Manufacturer            Per cent  ------------------------------------------------------ Benylin                Warner Lambert             30.0 Covonia                Thornton &amp; Ross             9.4 Boots own-label        Boots the Chemist           6.5 Actifed                Wellcome                    5.3 Sudafed                Wellcome                    3.8 Vicks                  Procter &amp; Gamble            3.9 Meltus                 Seton Healthcare            3.8 Tixylix                Intercare                   2.7 Robitussin             Whitehall Laboratories      4.6 Veno's                 SmithKline Beecham          2.0  ------------------------------------------------------               MANUFACTURERS' SHARES  ------------------------------------------------------ Manufacturer                               Per cent  ------------------------------------------------------ Warner Lambert                               19.1 Mars                                         12.7 SmithKline Beecham                           11.5 Crookes/Boots                                 8.8 Zyma Healthcare                               5.6 Procter &amp; Gamble                              5.4 Marion Merrell Dow                            5.2 Wellcome                                      4.3 Reckitt &amp; Colman                              4.2 Intercare                                     1.9  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Euromonitor Market Direction from trade estimates  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

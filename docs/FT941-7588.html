			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Race body aims to boost impact The Commission for Racial Equality yesterday announced a new structure aimed at making better use of its resources and meeting Citizen's Charter standards. Commission staff will be deployed to work more closely with other agencies as part of a 'promotional drive throughout society'. Mr Herman Ouseley, commission chairman, said racial discrimination was 'subtle, covert and sophisticated'. The restructuring was intended to make the commission more responsive and effective, and to bring it closer to its clients - both the institutions that came to it for guidance and the victims of discrimination. Under its Citizen's Charter undertakings the commission will set standards for handling inquiries - for example acknowledging letters in two working days and providing full replies in a further eight. With resources limited and a budget unlikely to increase in real terms in the near future, members of the commission believe greater collaboration with other agencies offers the best chance of increasing the commission's influence. The commission is campaigning with other race relations bodies for stronger laws. Members of the Commons home affairs committee are investigating racial attacks and have been considering whether there should be a new specific offence of racial violence or racial harassment.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Banks raise serious doubts on funding for Jubilee line BANKERS to Canary Wharf, the financially troubled property development, said yesterday there was serious doubt about whether they would provide funds to extend the Jubilee line into east London. They said there were no firm commitments from them to provide the Pounds 400m towards the cost of extending the underground rail line which the government has said is needed from the private sector. Without this contribution, the extension will not be built. In November, the administrators to the project said agreement in principle had been reached with 11 banks on the provision of the funds, including an immediate contribution of Pounds 98m. As a result, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, earmarked public funds in the Autumn Statement for the government's share in the project. But it emerged yesterday that the 11 banks, including Barclays and Lloyds of the UK, have not made a binding agreement to provide the private sector share. They are relying on the European Investment Bank, the European Community lending institution, to provide the bulk of the Pounds 98m. 'I am confident that the EIB will come up with the money,' said one banker. However, a banker with close links to the EIB said it had not made any promise to provide the money and there was considerable doubt whether it would do so. The EIB has already lent Pounds 100m to the project. Another Pounds 600m has been provided in a main lending facility provided by 11 banks. Four Canadian banks have provided a separate Pounds 450m loan. Canary Wharf is in administration under UK insolvency procedures. Bankers said the project would probably go into liquidation if there was no agreement on funding for the Jubilee line. Discussions on the funds are closely linked to separate talks on how to provide an additional Pounds 200m needed to complete Canary Wharf's building in London's docklands and provide incentives to prospective tenants. A banker said that without agreement on how to finance the completion of Canary Wharf, no money would be provided for the Jubilee line. The current uncertainty about the funding of the Jubilee line was caused in part by the unexpected reversal of an offer from Credit Suisse, the leading Swiss bank, to provide a large portion of the Pounds 98m. A banker said Credit Suisse's board overturned a proposal to provide the funds made by more junior executives.</p>

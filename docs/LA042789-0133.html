			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GE RECEIVES $750-MILLION ORDER FROM JAPAN UTILITY  </P> <P> General Electric Co. has been awarded a $750-million contract to build a power  plant in Japan that will become the world's largest combined-cycle power plant,  the company's top executive announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> "This is the largest fossil generation order ever for GE," GE Chairman John F.  Welch Jr. told shareholders during the company's annual stockholders meeting  here.  </P> <P> Tokyo Electric Power Co., a privately owned utility, awarded the contract to  GE. Once in operation, the combined-cycle power plant will be capable of  generating 2,600 megawatts of power -- 600 megawatts more than the world's  largest combined-cycle plant currently in operation, Welch said.  </P> <P> Combined-cycle power plants use the exhaust heat from a gas turbine to generate  steam, which in turn drives a steam turbine, thus generating power from energy  that would have been wasted.  </P> <P> The power plant is scheduled to begin commercial service in the Tokyo area in  the mid-1990s.  </P> <P> GE will serve as the prime contractor for Tokyo Electric's new power plant,  working with Japanese companies Toshiba and Hitachi on plant construction.  </P> <P> All eight of the proposed power plant's gas turbines will be manufactured in  GE's Greenville plant and the eight steam turbines and hydrogen-cooled  generators will be manufactured in GE's facilities in Schenectady, N.Y.  </P> <P> The order from Tokyo Electric comes on the heels on a $250-million order from  Duke Power Co. in March.  </P> <P> During the shareholders' meeting, held amid heavy security and marked with  often heated exchanges between GE executives and shareholder-activists, Welch  said the company would try to become "simpler, faster" and more  "self-confident" during the 1990s.  </P> <P> GE, which employs about 298,000 workers worldwide, reported sales of $50  billion in 1988.  </P></p>

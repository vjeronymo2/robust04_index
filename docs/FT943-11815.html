			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / BAT defies US tobacco propaganda BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, announced a 5 per cent increase in half-year profits to Pounds 948m before tax in the face of what it called 'unprecedented propaganda' against the tobacco industry in the US. The figures - towards the top end of expectations - were helped by a strong performance from BAT's US tobacco company Brown &amp; Williamson. It recovered market share lost in last year's price war sparked by rival Philip Morris and lifted trading profits 76 per cent to Pounds 217m. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the US figures 'largely speak for themselves' and showed BAT was weathering the political backlash against cigarette-smoking. 'We have been subjected to a period of unprecedented propaganda in the US,' he said. 'The board, however, remains confident of the tobacco industry's ability to continue to defend itself successfully, not only in court but wherever a more balanced view is taken.' He said BAT was pressing ahead with its proposed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 655m) acquisition of American Tobacco, the fifth largest US cigarette company, although completion was unlikely before the end of the year. The strong performance from Brown &amp; Williamson resulted from a more stable US market, increased domestic sales and exports, and improved margins on its GPC brand. Operating profits last year of Pounds 80m in BAT's Brazilian business were wiped out this time by difficult economic conditions. But a strong performance from the international British-American Tobacco business helped the tobacco division lift operating profits to Pounds 576m - an increase of 8 per cent, stripping out an exceptional gain of Pounds 135m last year on a brands swap with US company American Brands. On the financial services side, operating profits increased 10 per cent to Pounds 439m, with a Pounds 193m contribution from life and investment business, and Pounds 246m from general business. Total profit from continuing operations at Eagle Star in the UK rose from Pounds 45m to Pounds 69m, with UK personal lines business performing well, and no further provisions made for its discontinued financial insurance operations. Allied Dunbar lifted its contribution 14 per cent to Pounds 84m. The single premium investment side was strong, but new life and pensions business were both lower. In the US, Farmers recorded flat profits of Pounds 252m, reflecting a lower contribution from the life business. Total group turnover from continuing operations for the six months to June 30 increased from Pounds 11.9bn to Pounds 12bn, but BAT's shares fell 9p to 434p in spite of the profits increase, as investors took profits after a strong recent performance by the shares. The interim dividend increased 8 per cent to 8.5p, although earnings per share increased only 1 per cent from 19.3p to 19.4p. Lex, Page 18; Details, Page 21</p>

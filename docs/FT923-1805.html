			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Lamont to take tough line on public spending THE UK government will take an even tougher line on public spending since suspending the pound's participation in the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, said yesterday. Speaking in Washington, Mr Lamont said that monetary policy, which now will be based on a range of financial indicators, would be supported by a tight fiscal stance: 'With sterling now floating outside the ERM, a rigorous approach to public spending will be even more important.' His comments came as ministers in London suggested that sterling's withdrawal opened up the prospect of a small cut in interest rates as long as the pound stabilised on currency markets. Senior Whitehall officials pointed out that both inflation and output had 'undershot' the Treasury's predictions in the March Budget allowing some scope for an easing of policy. Mr Lamont refused to be drawn on when rates might fall. Instead he stressed that the government would not take any risks with inflation. It would ensure that monetary conditions are sufficiently tight to ensure the government's objective of bearing down on inflation. He said UK monetary policy before the floating of the pound last Wednesday had been tighter than required to deliver the UK's inflation objectives. On the other hand, the subsequent fall of sterling had produced some loosening of monetary policy. As currency trading rooms across Europe opened for business last night, investors switched funds into the French franc and the D-Mark while sterling dropped to a new low against the German currency. The pound dropped to DM2.5616, over 5 pfennigs down on Friday night's close, cutting UK government room to reduce interest rates. Mr Lamont, who was addressing the International Monetary Fund's policy-making interim committee said he would be making an assessment of the UK's present monetary stance soon. The assessment, which could determine interest rate changes, would be based on a number of financial indicators, including narrow money, broad money, assets prices including houses and the sterling exchange rate. He acknowledged that operating monetary policy without a clear rule such as ERM membership was not easy. 'Judgment has to be applied,' he said. 'Operating a floating regime is not easy and not a soft option.' This was also true of fiscal policy. 'It has been suggested that while monetary policy was constrained by the ERM, we should have been prepared to follow a more expansionary fiscal policy,' he told the IMF. 'Whatever the merits of that argument, and I, myself, was far from convinced, they clearly do not apply now.' British business leaders were dismayed by the narrow French vote and forecast more uncertainty. Companies battered by the recession had hoped for a decisive Yes, and the tiny majority was not widely welcomed. Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said anything less than a two-thirds Yes majority should rule out ratification of the treaty by Britain. 'In the light of events last week and the level of clear popular dissent expressed in France, Denmark and elsewhere, we believe it would be folly for the government to commit the European economies to economic and monetary union and political union as envisaged in the treaty.' Mr Richard Brown, director of policy for the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'A narrow result is probably the worst result, because it means more uncertainty. At least a Yes vote is better than a No vote, because it means that Maastricht will continue. But it could also mean more instability, and that is what business does not want.'</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Bank of England had early BCCI warning: Inquiry told of secret meetings to discuss fraud THE BINGHAM report on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International will contain evidence that the Bank of England had, by March 1991, received a comprehensive account of fraud at BCCI, four months before it was closed down. Lord Justice Bingham, who is expected to publish his findings in two weeks, was appointed by the government to evaluate the role of the Bank of England in supervising BCCI's UK operations. His draft report includes evidence from both Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor, and Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in BCCI, that mid-level Bank officials were told of the main areas of fraud at BCCI in a series of meetings in the first three months of 1991. The current draft of the Bingham report comments that in view of the Bank's decision in April 1990 to attempt a rescue of BCCI, it was unfortunate that senior Bank supervisors did not at that time establish close contact with high-ranking Abu Dhabi officials. Price Waterhouse has told Lord Bingham that it had been passing on details pointing to aspects of fraud at BCCI from the beginning of 1990, far earlier than previously reported. These early meetings were arranged in the greatest secrecy and no notes were taken of these meetings by Price Waterhouse. The frequency of meetings increased throughout 1990 and detailed notes were taken by Price Waterhouse of the later meetings. Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England director with responsibility for supervision, has said that it was not until the Bank received a formal report on BCCI, under section 41 of the Banking Act, on June 22 1991 that it judged it correct to close down the bank. 'The section 41 report completely transformed our view of BCCI,' he told a Commons select committee earlier this year. Bank officials most involved in receiving information from Price Waterhouse were Mr Roger Barnes, head of supervision, and Mr John Bartlett, his deputy. The Price Waterhouse partner most involved in talking to the Bank was Mr Christopher Cowan. Price Waterhouse first became aware of the heart of the BCCI fraud - that the bank had failed to make a record in its accounts of deposits totalling Dollars 600m (Pounds 314m) - in late December 1990. At about the same time, Price Waterhouse also learned that Dollars 600m of loans recorded in BCCI's books as having been made to wealthy individuals in the Middle East were false. Details of this Dollars 1.2bn fraud were discussed on January 4 in a meeting attended by Mr Cowan, Mr Zafar Iqbal, BCCI's chief executive, and Mr Barnes, the Bank's head of supervision. Mr Barnes was told about the unrecorded deposits and the phoney loans. In the subsequent three months, Price Waterhouse uncovered details of every other major element of the fraud at BCCI. Its partners were part of a team set up by BCCI in October 1990 to investigate fraud at the bank. In January and February 1991, there were more than 20 meetings between members of the investigating team and BCCI employees, including more than 15 with Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former chief executive of BCCI who was deeply implicated in the fraud. The team reported to BCCI's investigating committee on February 26 in Abu Dhabi and outlined every substantial area of fraud at BCCI. These included: A cover-up of loss making loan accounts by transferring funds from other accounts. Failure to record deposits. Creation of phoney loan accounts. The misappropriation of funds managed by ICIC, an offshoot of BCCI. The purchase by BCCI of its own shares. The disguised ownership of US banks in contravention of US law. A huge exposure to Gulf, the shipping group. The extent of losses incurred by BCCI's Treasury division. The collusion of customers in providing comfort to auditors that false loans were genuine. The creation of fictitious income to hide the extent of BCCI's losses. The members of the investigation committee were sworn to secrecy by BCCI about these discoveries, but Price Waterhouse communicated full details to the Bank of England, an action permitted under the Banking Act. Mr Cowan, the only member of the committee permitted by BCCI to take briefing material on the inquiry's conclusions out of Abu Dhabi, had a meeting at the Bank of England on March 1. On March 4, Price Waterhouse was appointed by the Bank to carry out its section 41 investigation. Creditors lose appeal, Page 4</p>

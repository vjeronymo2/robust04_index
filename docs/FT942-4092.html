			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Land takes 7% Bredero stake British Land yesterday raised the stakes in Slough Estates' attempt to privatise Bredero Properties, by acquiring a 7 per cent stake in the property developer at above the offer price. Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, said 'the stock become available, and there was no downside, so we thought we ought to have a look at it'. British Land bought 2.5m shares, at 11p, from Scottish Amicable. The price compares with Slough's current cash offer of 10p. Bredero's share price rose 2 1/2 p to 13p yesterday. Mr Ritblat said his primary interest was in Bredero's Buchanan Centre retail development site in Glasgow. Bred-ero's other large asset is the site for Centre West (East) in London's Hammersmith. A number of private shareholders, controlling around 10 per cent of the company, have already undertaken to block the bid, which requires approval from 90 per cent of shareholders. British Land is also unlikely to accept, and Slough may be forced to either lower the acceptance threshold, or raise the price, before its offer closes next Thursday. Slough would need to acquire at least 75 per cent of Bredero to gain tax benefits from its losses, which amounted to more than Pounds 100m, over the past 3 years. Slough paid Pounds 14.6m for its 49.6 per cent stake in Bredero back in December 1986. After asset disposals to cover falling valuations and rising debt, Bredero now has a net negative value of Pounds 3.4m, and the Slough offer values it at Pounds 3.75m. This compares with an asset value of almost Pounds 100m, at the peak of the property market.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Ukraine faces poll run-off Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister, will face each other in a run-off election scheduled for July 10 to select the country's next leader, officials said yesterday. Preliminary returns suggest the two are clearly ahead of the five other presidential candidates, but neither obtained the outright majority required for victory in the first round. Sunday's vote underscored deepening regional divisions. Mr Kuchma, who was a director of the former Soviet Union's largest missile factory and who promised to bring law and order to Ukraine, improve links with Russia and boost economic performance, won a landslide in the mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine and the separatist Crimean peninsula, taking up to 80 per cent of the vote. Mr Kravchuk, who sought to position himself as the only candidate able to preserve stability and national unity, won more than 90 per cent of the vote in the less populist, but fiercely nationalist west. Mr Oleksandr Moroz, the hardline socialist who leads the dominant bloc in parliament, was placed a poor third.</p>

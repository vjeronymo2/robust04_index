			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Bonn] </F>   [Text] After a two-day delay the Croatian-Bosnian talks  are in progress in Bonn. Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman are  discussing three problems: halting the conflict between Croats  and Muslims in central Bosnia, access to the sea near Neum, and  the status of Mostar. We have learned from sources in our  delegation that some new initiatives have been proposed,  primarily regarding access to the sea near Neum. We have  learned that, according to the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation's  proposal, both Neum and Mostar will be under European control  for a period of two years. This means in practice that access  to the sea near Neum will be joint, neither Croatian nor  Bosnian, but both Croatian and Bosnian.    Mostar, like Sarajevo, will be an open city, but under  European control. Under no circumstances can Mostar be the  capital of the so-called Herceg-Bosnia or Croatian republic.  The Croats will be allowed to have the seats of some of their  (?institutions) in it. However, let me repeat, Mostar will not  be the capital of the Croatian republic. This means that it  will formally not be a part of any of the republics in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina union, but it will belong to everyone. This  is actually the solution recently proposed in Vienna by Prime  Minister Silajdzic when he said: Mostar for Mostar's citizens.  If the European governors manage to organize their authority in  a satisfactory way, this will mean exactly that: All Mostar  citizens will be able to return to their Mostar.    Let me just mention that, in addition to the two presidents,  Izetbegovic and Tudjman, the other members of the  Croatian-Bosnian delegations are Foreign Minister Irfan  Ljubijankic, Presidency member Ivo Komsic, and Muhamed  Sacirebey, Bosnia-Herzegovina ambassador to the United Nations,  on the Bosnian side, and Foreign Minister Mate Granic on the  Croatian side. The so-called Herceg-Bosnia is being represented  by Mile Akmadzic. Therefore, Mate Boban is not present. Does  this mean that a great obstacle to the peace negotiations has  been removed? Well-informed sources and politicians claim that  Mr. Boban is already an ex-politician and Zagreb's ex-pet.    This has been Nada al-Isa reporting from Germany for Radio  Television Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

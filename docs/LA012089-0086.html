			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Surrealist painter Salvador Dali's condition worsened after he developed  pneumonia and an inflamed lung, according to the hospital in Figueras, Spain,  where he is being treated. Dali, 84, suffers from heart problems for which he  has been hospitalized three times in the last two months. His personal  physician, Dr. Carlos Ponsati, said that he is in critical condition with a  high fever and that X-rays showed he was getting worse by the hour. Doctors  have ruled out moving him to a larger institution in Barcelona, about 60 miles  from Figueras, because of his fragile condition, Spanish news reports said.  </P></p>

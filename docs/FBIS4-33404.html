			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 3 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister  Miguel Angel Burelli said here today that Venezuela has agreed  to receive Haitian refugees on the condition that they comprise  only a small number of refugees who would remain in Venezuela  temporarily, until the crisis in the Antillean nation is  resolved.    The Venezuelan Government's decision was announced after an  official U.S. delegation headed by Under Secretary of State  Strobe Talbott asked the government of Venezuelan President  Rafael Caldera to accept Haitian refugees.    The U.S. official called the Venezuelan offer "generous,"  and  he recalled that Caracas had received the very first Haitian  refugee--President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who was received by  Venezuela after he was overthrown in September 1991. Talbott  reiterated that his government wants a "peaceful and  multilateral" solution to the Haitian crisis.    Burelli told newsmen that Venezuela "has informed the United  States that it will not close its doors and that it will receive  a group (of Haitians), provided they are temporary refugees who  will remain until the precarious situation in Haiti is resolved."    The foreign minister explained that the Venezuelan Embassy  in  Washington will list the number of Haitians eligible to travel  to Venezuela as an "undetermined number," although "this cannot  be a large number."</p>

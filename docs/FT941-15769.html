			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Westinghouse chairman shows his hand: Michael Jordan's aims have met with scepticism Mr Michael Jordan has one of the least enviable jobs in US industry. Westinghouse Electric, the struggling conglomerate he was brought into six months ago to salvage, is still suffering from the financial trauma wrought by losses of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) it sustained in a disastrous move into financial services in the late 1980s. Many of its core businesses - led by power systems and defence electronics - face low growth and weakening profit margins. Its shares are languishing at a third of their level of four years ago. Now, after six months as chairman and chief executive of the Pittsburgh-based group, Mr Jordan has decided to show his hand. The former senior Pepsi executive and one-time McKinsey consultant has this week unveiled pre-tax charges of Dollars 750m (Dollars 500m after tax) to cover restructuring and lay-offs, as well as a further Dollars 376m write-down in the group's equity to meet pension liabilities and other one-off items. Mr Jordan's plan involves tackling the groups' financial drag on all fronts. It also involves simultaneously restructuring the group's core businesses and raising new capital to finance growth in markets where, he admits, the profit potential is some way into the future. The reaction of Wall Street, which marked down the company's share price again yesterday to Dollars 13 5/8 , down Dollars  1/2 this week, suggests that this will be a tall order to fill. Attempts to extricate itself from the troubles of the past have eaten deep into Westinghouse's capital base. At the end of 1993, shareholders' funds were down to around Dollars 1bn, says Mr Jordan (full 1993 figures have not yet been published). That is less than half the Dollars 2.2bn of a year before. The company is now on a tight rein from its bankers, whose approval it had to seek before it could go ahead with the write-downs. Even after the latest clean-out, the company still has Dollars 5.2bn of debt, though Dollars 1.4bn of this should be paid off shortly with the proceeds from disposals. Westinghouse also has a growing pension fund deficit. Under pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Westinghouse has been forced to adopt a progressively more conservative accounting approach to its pension fund. These changes have lopped another Dollars 255m off its capital base, and forced Westinghouse to issue Dollars 200m of new shares to its pension fund to try to stem the shortfall. To make matters worse, the group's businesses are generally in low-growth areas, and profit margins have been under pressure. And Mr Jordan doesn't even have the luxury of slashing costs to give an immediate fillip to Westinghouse's cash-flow. Attempts at restructuring over the past five years have already reduced the workforce by 20-25 per cent to 54,000 in the group's continuing businesses. There is little fat to be cut, and any further gains will have to come from a more far-reaching reorganisation of the way the group's businesses operate. The new Westinghouse boss has set his sights on three years for pay-back from the latest restructuring costs, and five years to change a corporate culture which he calls 'a throw-back to the 1950s'. Against that background, Mr Jordan's plans look ambitious. First, he has attempted to put all of Westinghouse's past problems behind it. Thus the charges this week, which also include reserves to cover litigation and environmental clean-up costs. With these changes, he promised an end to the traditional 'annual surprise' which Westinghouse has sprung on Wall Street at the end of each year. Last year, environmental services were an 'unmitigated disaster', he says. Previously, big losses came from financial services. If Mr Jordan can really stem the flow of bad news and restructuring charges in future, he will have done much to restore the badly dented credibility of Westinghouse's management. Second, he has decided to limit disposals and hold on to a wide range of businesses, sticking closely with a partial divestment plan developed in November 1992. There have been one or two changes: Knoll, the loss-making furniture group, will not now be sold because Westinghouse could not get a good enough price for it, while large parts of the environmental business are for sale. However, Mr Jordan has turned his back on a full-scale break-up of the group, or the sale of any of what he calls its 'core' businesses. These include power generation, defence electronics, broadcasting, refrigerated transport services, and the provision of services to the nuclear energy industry. Third, the Jordan plan envisages investment and growth. To back this, it plans to issue Dollars 500m of preferred shares in the first half of this year, which will be converted into ordinary shares at some stage in the future. 'Just to sit with our hands in our pockets and wait two years for our balance sheet to improve is not an option,' he says. One business targeted for investment is power generation, an operation with sales of Dollars 1.5bn in 1992. Westinghouse believes it can benefit from growing demand in Asia, particularly China. Others are Thermo King (the refrigerated transport business) and broadcasting. Through its ownership of broadcast television stations and a group of radio stations, Westinghouse generated operating profits of Dollars 160m in 1992 on sales of Dollars 853m, and now aims to become the US's biggest radio group. Mr Jordan also sees prospects for more modest growth from two of the group's biggest businesses: defence electronics and energy systems, which between them accounted for Dollars 4.2bn of its Dollars 9.3bn sales in 1992. He plans to reverse attempts to tilt the electronics business to non-defence areas, betting instead that US defence cuts on hardware spending have reached bottom and that existing projects in which Westinghouse is involved will not be high on the Pentagon's list of cuts. Also, the nuclear power industry needs services to improve its facilities and bring down its costs to be able to compete with other power producers, says Mr Jordan. Wall Street's reaction signalled its disbelief in what was seen as an ambitious plan. Even before Mr Jordan's public comments, Moody's, the US rating agency, downgraded the group to junk bond status last week. Straining credibility were Mr Jordan's claims that the group could pick itself up from its current lows and expand aggressively in rapidly-changing markets. Commenting on changes in broadcasting, for instance, he said: 'We have the ability to be a player in this industry as it reshapes and consolidates.' Some analysts would rather see Westinghouse sell its broadcasting unit and use the cash to concentrate on power and electronics. Mr Jordan does not rule out the prospect of a flotation and partial sale of the broadcasting business in the future. For now, though, the division remains central to his plans to strengthen the group's cash-flow (operating profits at the group are projected to grow at 10-12 per cent a year in future). If he is right, then these earnings will enable the group to pay down its debt, strengthen its capital base and emerge with a broad range of profitable businesses by 1996. But if Mr Jordan has bitten off more than Westinghouse can chew, he is under no illusions about what the reaction of the market will be. 'The honeymoon is now officially over. It's now open season on CEOs again.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     WESTINGHOUSE, 1992 (DOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Sales      Operating                                                       profit/loss  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Broadcasting                                 853         160 Defence electronics                        2,874         256 Environmental systems                        643          71 Power generation                           1,520         135 Energy systems (nuclear)                   1,329         145 Knoll Group                                  578         (40) Thermo King                                  685         104 Industrial products                          642         (17) Westinghouse Communities (property)          235          87 Other                                         68         (73)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Westinghouse, Salomon Brothers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

In a recent interview, which the finance minister gave me,  he joked:    "When I resign, I will make a bet.... No, first I will make  a bet that the exchange rate will reach 2,000 [rubles to $1],  and the next day I will announce that I am going...."    Many commentators today think that there is a very real  possibility that Mr. Fedorov will resign. Everything depends on  who will be named as vice premier by Viktor Chernomyrdin on  Monday.    "It is very unlikely that Fedorov will stay if Zaveryukha is  vice premier," according to, for instance, Sergey Vasilyev,  leader of the Russian Government's Working Center for Economic  Reforms.    The finance minister and Aleksandr Zaveryukha,  representative  of the agrarian lobby in the government, have been engaged in  long and hard conflict, which is naturally based on the fact  that the latter persistently demands money from the former while  he equally persistently denies it to him. But virtually no one  doubts that Mr. Zaveryukha will become a vice premier. While  the chances of Fedorov himself becoming one of the four vice  premiers are seen as minimal. So the prospect of the finance  minister finding himself not on a par with his antagonist, and  even in a subordinate position to him, are perfectly real.  People who know Boris Grigoryevich well claim that he would  certainly not accept that.    Does this mean that the end of financial stabilization is  nigh?    The ruble exchange rate is already falling, and quite  appreciably. Igor Doronin, expert at the Interbank Currency  Exchange, considers that "this is a perfectly natural  phenomenon. The minimium wage has almost doubled. Transport  fares have doubled. Municipal services have gone up two- or  threefold. Why shouldn't the exchange rate fall in such a  situation?" His forecast is 1,800-1,900 rubles to the dollar  within the next few weeks.    Fedorov's departure in this situation will certainly cause  alarm among commercial structures, according to Igor Doronin.  "The political situation, the top-level reshuffle, the  strengthening of the position of the sectoral lobbyists in  government -- all this creates a background conducive to  destabilization of the ruble," Doronin contends. In such a  situation "no normal businessman will sell foreign currency."  In the Interbank expert's opinion, even the current rate is  being maintained thanks to massive currency intervention by the  Central Bank.    If reshuffles do take place in the Finance Ministry, much  will depend on who replaces Boris Fedorov: Will the next  minister be sufficiently tough and independent? Petr Aven,  president of the Alfa-Bank and former Russian minister of  foreign economic relations, thinks that only one person is  rightly able to claim the post -- Yegor Gaydar. The prime  minister's opinion on this score is known only to him for the  time being. Two other names are cited: Sergey Dubinin and  Andrey Vavilov -- current deputy finance ministers. However,  those candidates' chances are slim.</p>

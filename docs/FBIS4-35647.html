			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--The 17th ministerial session of the UN  Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, ESCWA,  yesterday evening approved a report submitted by Dr. Sabah  Baqjaji, the Commission's executive secretary, on the economic  and social situation of the Syrian Arab citizens under Israeli  occupation in the occupied Golan. After its approval yesterday,  this report became one of the UN documents condemning the savage  practices of the Israeli occupation authorities in the occupied  Golan, Israel's violations of basic human rights, and Israel's  looting of the occupied Golan's water and agricultural  resources, as well as the building of illegal settlements in the  Golan.    The session also approved reports on the Palestinian Arab  people's situation in the occupied territories, the  reconstruction of Lebanon, and cooperation among ESCWA member  states on joint water resources, environment, continued  development, and trade exchanges.    The participants in the session elected 'Abd-al-Rahman  Madani, the [Syrian] irrigation minister and head of the Syrian  delegation, as first deputy at the session. The ministerial  session is scheduled to continue its meetings today in order to  finish discussing the topics on the agenda, led by locating a  permanent headquarters for ESCWA. Jordan, Qatar, and Lebanon  offered to host this headquarters on a permanent basis.    The Syrian Arab delegation shared in introducing several  amendments to phrases in the submitted reports. In their  entirety, these amendments focused on canceling any phrase that  may give the impression that there is support for the  multilateral negotiations, particularly the issue of common  waters.</p>

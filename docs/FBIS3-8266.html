			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bosnia's Muslim leaders are trying to end the  protest against the departure of Canadian peacekeepers from  Srebrenica. The Canadians have ended their tour of duty in the  mainly Muslim enclave (?and been relieved) by Dutch troops. But  protesting Muslims kept the Canadians from leaving their  compound this weekend. The Muslims see the Canadians as their  protectors and don't want them to leave.    The departure of the Canadians is also being blocked by  Serbs  surrounding Srebrenica. They claim the Canadians' heavy-duty  vehicles will tear up the road and are preventing a UN convoy  sent from Visoko from reaching the area. [passage omitted]</p>

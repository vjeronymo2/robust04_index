			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: The flaw in local government argument Sir, Your leader, 'The politics of local government' (February 2), accurately assesses many of the reasons why there is now so much hostility, both within Westminster and throughout the UK, to the local government review. There is no doubt that the business community is horrified by the proposals emanating from the Local Government Commission. There is equally no doubt that council taxpayers are becoming increasingly concerned at the costs they would have to pay. However, your suggestion that halting the review nationally and limiting changes to a small number of areas, including Cleveland, offers the 'best exit route' is indefensible. Such a move would almost certainly leave the government open to yet further legal challenges. A central flaw in that argument is the myth, regrettably repeated in your comment, that the 'new' counties such as Cleveland have 'failed to win popular support' and, by implication, are therefore prime candidates for change. The facts are that, on the evidence of the Mori polls carried out for the Local Government Commission, the level of public identity with Cleveland is actually higher than many so-called 'traditional' counties, including Lincolnshire (where the commission is recommending the status quo of county and districts), Gloucestershire and Derbyshire. In terms of 'user satisfaction', an opinion poll carried out by Harris Research in 1992 showed no less than 79 per cent of residents satisfied with Cleveland's services, one of the highest figures recorded for any authority in recent years. That does not mean we do not recognise the desirability of change - provided it produces better services, greater cost-efficiency and has the support of local people. A unified Teesside, with a second authority to recognise the unique sense of identity in Hartlepool, is the only option which can deliver those essential requirements. Teesside, by the way, enjoys an even higher level of public identity than the Yorkshire Ridings or Somerset. But that is not what is being proposed by the commission. It has ignored the views of those in business, health, education, the voluntary sector and many, many thousands of Teessiders. Instead it proposes a costly, inefficient and unwanted division of services in England's smallest mainland county among four unitary authorities based on existing district boundaries. Your leader warned against 'unviably small replacements', but that is what is being proposed. On the basis of the commission's own estimates, such a disastrous proposal would involve transitional costs of between Pounds 13m and Pounds 18m, together with additional running costs of up to Pounds 10m a year compared with a united Teesside authority. It would be a disgrace if this were imposed on the local community at the same time as the review was being shelved elsewhere. The interests of the people of Teesside should not be sacrificed simply in order to save face in Westminster.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Liu Zhiqing (2692 1807 3237) and Yang </F> Jiuwei (2799 0036 0251)]    [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- Our country's  new-generation meteorological satellite, "Fengyun-2," was  recently transported to the Xichang satellite launching center,  where it will be lifted into space on a "Long March-3" carrier  rocket in April.    This stationary-orbit meteorological satellite, developed by  the Chinese Research Institute of Space Technology, will be used  primarily to collect information for the preparation of  visible-light and infrared-light cloud charts and water  distribution maps; to collect and transmit observation data  compiled by meteorological, maritime, and hydrological  departments; to disseminate extended digital cloud charts,  low-resolution cloud charts, and weather maps for use by ground  stations at home and abroad; and to provide observation data for  use in satellite engineering and space environmental science  research.    Compared to the two "Fengyun-1" satellites launched in 1988  and 1990, the new-generation meteorological satellite  "Fengyun-2" reportedly represents a breakthrough in terms of  technical performance, scope of application, and service life.  The satellite employs a number of advanced technologies, such  as scanning radiometry, slender-body control technology, and  apogee engine separation, marking the first time such  technologies have been used domestically, and signalling a new  stage in our country's space technology.</p>

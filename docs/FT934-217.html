			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Arts: Hard times can also be healthy times / A look at the changing face of Europe's musical establishment during 1993 Three developments dominated the musical landscape of continental Europe over the past year, each with broad implications for the future. The appointment of Hugues Gall as head of the Paris Opera raised hopes that this once-great institution may enjoy a rebirth. After nearly half a century of boom, Germany's orchestras and opera companies found themselves hard hit by recession. And in Salzburg, Gerard Mortier continued to upset everyone and anyone, provoking a public spat with Claudio Abbado over links between the Easter and Summer festivals, and then telling the Vienna Philharmonic that it may be dispensable. Gall will not assume hands-on control of the Opera Bastille until 1995, but his appointment - in the wake of the French centre-right parties' return to power last March - has already injected a long-overdue note of realism. The Bastille was a Socialist utopia, designed to give the highest number of performances to the largest number of people in the best possible quality. It has been a lame duck since its inauguration in 1989, plagued by technical faults, rocketing budgets, poor artistic planning, bad management and strikes - the latest of which, in November, forced the cancellation of the opening night of Bob Wilson's Madama Butterfly. Gall proposes strong medicine. The number of performances at the Bastille will be reduced, but will include the grand classical ballets which can sell out its 2700-seat auditorium. A select slab of the opera repertory will return to the Palais Garnier (probably at higher prices than the Bastille), alongside a reduced ballet schedule. Both houses will at some point be shut, the Bastille for acoustical improvements, the Garnier for refurbishment. The biggest challenge will be political. To bring down costs, staff must be reduced, monopolies broken, contracts renegotiated. Gall will be treading a tightrope with the unions and the Opera orchestra, who have sabotaged all previous attempts at reform. He will try to 'cohabit' with the current music director, Myung-Whun Chung, who stands to lose most of his power. With Pierre Berge's motley management team now clearing their desks, the Bastille can be expected to drift for the next 18 months. Gall, who was Rolf Liebermann's deputy at the Opera in the 1970s, knows the problems inside out. His record over the past 12 years in Geneva suggests he has the political and artistic savoir-faire for the job. But he will be climbing an operatic Everest. Musical Germany fell into a state of shock as recession took its toll. From Bielefeld to Bamberg, budgets were chopped by up to 20 per cent. Even the Bayreuth Festival has been forced to trim expenditure. While the long-term effect on morale and artistic vitality is far from clear, some conclusions can be drawn. Germany has not made the mistake of subjecting its myriad orchestras and theatres to a beauty contest; none will disappear. With few exceptions (notably the Berlin Philharmonic), cuts have been applied equally and received stoically. But there has been a change in perception. High cultural spending has long been taken for granted in Germany. There was unnecessary fat and a lot of waste. One of the most perceptive remarks came from Christoph von Dohnanyi, a former intendant in Frankfurt and Hamburg and now chief conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra: 'Hard times can also be healthy times. Theatres must make themselves necessary to the society which pays for them. Art without some financial pressure is not good - as long as the pressure is not so great that it actually hinders art.' Three years after his arrival in Salzburg, Gerard Mortier continues to ruffle feathers. His joust with Abbado over co-production plans for the 1995 Easter and Summer festivals may have ended inconclusively, but it showed that Abbado was not to be out-manoeuvred. By forcing the Italian conductor to fight on behalf of the Easter Festival, Mortier has unwittingly helped to make it more independent of the summer event. Competition will be healthy. Abbado has yet to indicate how far he plans to remould and liven up the Easter Festival, but his record in Berlin suggests that no-one is better able to change perceptions. Mortier's conflict with the Vienna Philharmonic, which boiled over again in early December, is more far-reaching. The orchestra has been resident at the Summer Festival for 70 years; it even has a street in Salzburg named after it. The musicians' threat to boycott the festival after 1995 has to be taken seriously. Mortier considers the Philharmonic conservative and expensive, and is not afraid to say so in public. He awarded last summer's opening concert to a youth orchestra; the highlight of the 1994 concert programme promises to be a Beethoven cycle featuring the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Mortier reckons the Salzburg Festival can survive without the Vienna Philharmonic - but can Mortier survive his own non-stop offensive on the festival's sacred cows? His programme has been a breath of fresh air. Salzburg needed that - but it may not tolerate Mortier's big mouth indefinitely. Outside the festival season, Berlin clearly eclipsed Vienna as Europe's musical capital, notwithstanding another excellent Wien Modern contemporary music festival in November. Abbado has rejuvenated the Berlin Philharmonic; Daniel Barenboim has transformed the Staatsoper unter den Linden. The fusion of artistic life between east and west Berlin has been slow but not as painful as anticipated. After watching the Schiller Theater go down as a sacrificial lamb, most companies survived. Fears that the Deutsche Oper might not last the decade now look unfounded. In Munich, the Jonas touch has yet to be properly felt at the Bavarian State Opera, despite a clever public relations campaign since the former ENO general director arrived in September. His real test will be the July opera festival: can he make it a truly festive event, or will it remain an expensive run-through of repertory? Whatever tricks he pulls out of the bag, Jonas surely realises he needs a more dynamic music director than Peter Schneider. Looking back over my own tally of performances, I find the following reputations either enhanced or consolidated: Samuel Ramey, whose first Boris Godunov (in Geneva) was imposing without excess histrionics; Nikolaus Lehnhoff, whose poetic production of Henze's Der Prinz von Homburg - revived at Zurich in the autumn - has almost single-handedly rehabilitated this beautiful work; Sylvain Cambreling, whose conducting of Simon Boccanegra was a much-needed fillip for Frankfurt's musical life; the Oslo Philharmonic, which made a triumphant tour of Europe's four major summer festivals with Mariss Jansons; the Bolshoi Opera, whose concert performances at the Lucerne Festival showed a tradition intact; Waltraud Meier, whose courageous Isolde at Bayreuth and radiant Sieglinde in Berlin vindicated her move into dramatic soprano territory; and Olaf Henzold, the most promising young German conductor. Declining reputations included Placido Domingo, whose Bayreuth Parsifal suggested an artist on automatic pilot; Bob Wilson and Ruth Berghaus, who do little more than repeat their own theatrical cliches from one production to the next; and Yuri Temirkanov, who is starting to become a liability for the St Petersburg Philharmonic. My performance of the year was Gounod's Mireille in Lausanne at the end of November, a blissfully natural production of an underrated opera. No stars, no ugliness, no vulgarity, no need to be strikingly original or modern - just pure lyric charm, provencal atmosphere and a powerful performance from Danielle Borst in the title role.</p>

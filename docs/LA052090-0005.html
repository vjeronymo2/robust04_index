			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S IN THE MALE  </P> <P> Kaufman, of course, is the "Babe" Ruth of local man bashers. But she does  manage, in her chirping, clucking style, to make at least one good point.  </P> <P> Us fellas would be better off, she hints, if -- every once in a while -- we  allowed ourselves to experience the cosmic self-doubt and general mechanical  incompetence that goes along with being a chick.  </P> <P> Personally, I think it's a great idea. I also think that any idiot -- male or  female -- knows there is a little bit of doll in every guy and a little bit of  guy in every doll. Otherwise, dolls would never wear shoulder pads and guys  would never shave.  </P> <P> The male ego simply does not exist in pure form. Every man has at least some  "womanly" aspects to his personality. I, for example, have no less than three  women living inside me. Prudence is in charge of manners, and Martha is great  with kids. Flo is a study in warmth and spontaneity. All three conspire to make  me a better man.  </P> <P> Maybe, just once, we could hear something positive about the men inside Margo  Kaufman. I'm dying to know if any one of them could change a flat tire without  bursting into tears.  </P> <P> ERIK FAIR, Santa Ana  </P></p>

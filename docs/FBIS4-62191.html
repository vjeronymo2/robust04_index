			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] INTERFAX has learned that a confidential meeting  between Azerbaijani leader Heydar Aliyev and other officials and  the plenipotentiary representative of the Russian president for  the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement, Vladimir Kazimirov, could be  held Thursday [12 May].    Besides other issues, the meeting will focus on the date and  agenda of the Azerbaijani-Armenian summit planned to be held in  Moscow.    IF Note: In an interview with INTERFAX, Armenian  Presidential Assistant Levon Zurabyan confirmed the possibility  of such a meeting under Russia's auspices. He said pleparatory  diplomatic activities were carried out through the mediation by  the Russian side. As has been reported, the  Azerbaijani-Armenian summit planned to be held during the CIS  April summit was disrupted. Armenia has been maintaining that  the reason for the disruption was Azerbaijan's reluctance to  accept the Russian plan for the settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh.    In an interview with INTERFAX, Kazimirov pointed out that an  Azerbaijani-Armenian summit could be useful on a rather advanced  stage of consideration of the draft settlement agreement," based  on the Russian design.    Kazimirov pointed out the main provisions of the Russian  settlement plan. The first stage is "short, but crucial and  complicated" -- the establishment of a cease-fire. The second  stage involves a shift to the elimination of consequences of the  armed conflict, including a withdrawal of troops from the  occupied territories, exchange of prisoners of war, hostages,  bodies of the killed, information of those missing in action or  killed, re-introduction of the transport and power lines and the  repatriation of refugees to their permanent locations. On the  third stage, political talks on the future legal status of  Nagorno-Karabakh will be launched.    "Whenever the sides are close enough to signing such a draft  agreement, such a meeting in Moscow will be possible," Kazimirov  was quoted as saying.    Zurabyan said the Moscow summit was envisioned by a protocol  signed at the meeting of Armenian, Azerbaijani and  Nagorno-Karabakh parliamentarians in Bishkek on 5 May through  the mediation of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly.    IF Note: Azerbaijani Parliamentary Speaker Rasul Guliyev who  signed the document with a number of stipulations came under  harsh criticisms by the parliamentary opposition, the National  Independence Party lead by Etibar Mamedov. According to the  party, Guliyev committed high treason by signing the Bishkek  protocol "together with the leader of the Supreme Soviet of a  non-existent so-called Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, Karen  Baburyan." The party said Guliyev "created all necessary  conditions for the recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  as a subject of the international law and open the possibility  for concluding an agreement which would legalize the deployment  of Russian troops in Azerbaijan."    In the meantime, Nagorno-Karabakh Foreign Minister Arkady  Gukasyan did not preclude that the reports on Azerbaijan's  signing the Bishkek protocol on the settlement in  Nagorno-Karabakh on 8 May were another tactical step by Baku.  In Gukasyan's opinion, only the deployment of peacekeeping  forces was capable of putting an end to the bloodshed.    Azerbaijani Defense Minister Mamadrafi Mammadov, his  Armenian  counterpart, Serzh Sargsyan, and the Nagorno-Karabakh troops  commander, Samvel Babayan, signed an agreement Wednesday  midnight to cease-fire as of 0000 on 12 May, Interfax learned  from well-informed sources from in Stepanakert.    Meanwhile, the Nagorno-Karabakh Army press service reported  fierce fighting along the frontline, despite the cease-fire  agreement signed. The press service said that after a heavy  shelling Azerbaijani troops attempted to break the  Nagorno-Karabakh defense near the village of Yusifdzhanly of the  Agdam district at about 0700 Thursday.    The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reported Armenian units had  tried to develop their offensive on Geranboi and Agdam yesterday  night.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology: Talking tough The formidable difficulties posed by speech recognition are rivalled by those involved in converting text to speech. Scientists still have a limited understanding of the way in which speech signals are produced. Moreover, a convincing representation of speech depends on pronunciation, pitch and intonation, which often obey complex and loosely defined rules. The monotone voice produced by synthesisers often sounds more robotic than human. Nonetheless, researchers are increasingly optimistic about text-to speech technology. 'Today, the quality of synthetic speech from text has improved to such an extent that real world applications are now viable,' says a report by BT Laboratories, part of the UK telecommunications company. Some applications are already being commercialised. Novell, a US software company, is about to launch a system that will read out E-mail messages over the telephone, allowing people to check their electronic messages when they are away from a terminal. Potential applications are wide-ranging. Telephone-based systems would allow recipients to listen to their fax messages, doctors on call to gain access to their patients' records and information services to provide regularly updated bulletins. The technology could also be used in reading machines for the blind and navigation systems for drivers. Other applications would arise because speech stored in text form takes much less computer storage space than digitised speech. Most of these applications will not materialise until further refinements have been made to the text-to-speech process. This usually begins by stripping punctuation out of the text and converting numbers to words. It then converts the text to phonemes, the smallest segments of sound in the language and assigns stress to words. These are then used to synthesise speech, a process that either depends on extremely complex conversion rules or else on concatenation methods, such as threading together stored samples of speech. But voice technology companies eyeing a potentially large market are not deterred by the research effort required, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, a market research company. 'Text-to-speech technology will be a key focus of many vendors' research and development efforts,' it says.</p>

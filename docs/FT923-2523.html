			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow erratic as Europe holds sway Wall Street US STOCKS moved erratically in a narrow trading range yesterday as Wall Street tried to absorb the bewildering events in European money markets, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 3,319.21, down 8.11, after retreating in the late afternoon from a minor gain. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was an active 231.6m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index ended a slight 0.15 up at 419.92 and the Nasdaq composite was finally 1.97 off at 585.89. The blue chip Dow index declined some 16 points in reaction to the Bank of England's interest rate rise, but then began to rally as rumours swept New York that the Bundesbank would move quickly to cut German interest rates. US equities reversed direction again when Britain suspended its currency from the European exchange rate mechanism and hopes of a German rate cut faded. A further domestic damper on the market was the US industrial production figures for August, showing a seasonally adjusted fall of 0.5 per cent, compared to a consensus forecast of a 0.3 per cent decline. International Business Machines fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 82 7/8 in active trading after several more analysts lowered their ratings on the stock and cut back their earnings forecasts. The move followed news late on Monday that another manufacturer of mainframe computers, Amdahl, was expecting a third-quarter loss because of poor market demand. Federal Express, which reported a sharp fall in first-quarter net income after the market closed on Tuesday, dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 . Yesterday several analysts lowered their earnings forecasts for the group and at least one downgraded the stock. In the energy sector, Exxon rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 . Atlantic Richfield moved ahead Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 119 3/4 as an analyst raised his forecast for the company's third-quarter earnings, citing firm crude prices. Occidental Petroleum eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 after an analyst's downgrading of the stock due to chemical market conditions. Polaroid was unchanged at Dollars 32 3/4 in spite of news that the company had unveiled a new compact, autofocus instant camera. General Dynamics gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 79 1/4 after a meeting with analysts on Tuesday at which the defence company produced evidence that its efforts to improve efficiency were bearing fruit. Several analysts yesterday lifted their 1992 and 1993 earnings forecasts for the group. Canada TORONTO closed near the day's low as uncertainty surrounding European currencies and interest rates depressed bank shares, but the overall market was only moderately down. The same uncertainties boosted gold shares, the sector's index advancing 183.2 to 5,660.3. The TSE 300 index finished 10.3 off at 3,453.8 and falls outscored rises by 318 to 247 after volume of 39.6m shares. Among golds, American Barrick climbed CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 39 7/8 , Echo Bay CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 8 3/8 and Placer Dome CDollars 5/8 to CDollars 13 1/2.</p>

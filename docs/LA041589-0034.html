			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR REJECTS TRADING LAND FOR PEACE  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday he rejects trading land for peace  despite an earlier government statement that Israel is willing to discuss any  option with the Palestinians.  </P> <P> "I don't accept it. It is not necessary. It is not relevant," he told reporters  upon his return to Israel from the United States.  </P> <P> Shamir, 73, described his 10-day U.S. visit as a success and added: "There is  an understanding between the U.S. and Israel about our four-point peace  initiative."  </P> <P> Shamir met last week with President Bush, who supported Shamir's idea for  elections in the occupied territories but said the United States could not  accept permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Shamir's plan offers elections to choose representatives from the occupied  territories to negotiate an interim settlement with Israel.  </P> <P> Several West Bank Palestinians reportedly have offered a counterproposal that  residents elect members of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Palestine  National Council instead of representatives for talks with Israel.  </P></p>

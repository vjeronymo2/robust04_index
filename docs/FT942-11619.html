			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Doubts grow over Colosio conspiracy The Mexican government is backing away from the contention that Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the slain presidential candidate, was the victim of an organised plot. The special prosecutor has released a report by Spanish police which says video evidence used to implicate six alleged accomplices of the confessed assassin is 'inconclusive'. The report by Spanish experts 'throws the investigation open and raises the possibility there was no plot to kill Mr Colosio', an official says. Conspiracy theories have been further fuelled by last week's murder of Mr Federico Benitez, the police chief in the city of Tijuana, where Mr Colosio was killed. Mr Benitez was reported to have had a number of secret files on the Colosio murder stolen just before he was killed. A government official said Mr Benitez had information about Mr Sergio Ortiz, deputy attorney-general in Baja California, who was arrested on Tuesday on charges of protecting a well known drug cartel.</p>

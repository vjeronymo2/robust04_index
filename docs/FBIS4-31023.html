			<p>BFN     [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia June 1 (CTK) -- The former  Slovak Defence Minister Imrich Andrejcak has criticised the  changes made in the Partnership for Peace presentation document  by Defence Minister Pavol Kanis. Andrejcak made his comments  during an interview with the Slovak regional daily LUC, which  carries it today. The changes mean that the ministry's  contribution to the funding of the Partnership project will now  be up to 4.5 percent instead of the originally envisaged one per  cent, Andrejcak says. The promise to send more troops to  ex-Yugoslavia and to set up a stand-by battalion available to  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] at short notice will cause extra  arms and equipment expenditure, and might compromise the Slovak  Army's readiness for battle, Andrejcak says. "Some army  functionaries take advantage of Mr. Kanis' unfamiliarity with  army codes and customary procedures," he says.    In the case of the crash of the Slovak Army's SU-22 military  plane in April an investigation report calculated the financial  loss and clarified the disaster's causes. "I believe that in  this very case some functionaries have tricked the minister  (Kanis) as a way of finding an easy way out," Andrejcak says in  LUC.</p>

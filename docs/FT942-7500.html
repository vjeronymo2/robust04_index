			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fairline powers ahead to Pounds 350,000 Fairline Boats, the Peterborough-based luxury powerboat maker, more than doubled interim profits as UK sales rose 29 per cent and some export markets improved. Profits rose from Pounds 161,000 to Pounds 350,000 pre-tax for the six months to the end of March. Optimistic that the second half would show a similar rate of growth, the company declared a 40 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 5p (3.575p), payable from earnings per share of 6.74p (3p). The shares closed up 40p at 435p. Sales rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 15.2m) of which direct exports, up 12 per cent, accounted for 70 per cent and additional foreign sales by UK distributors accounted for an estimated 20 per cent. Mr Sam Newington, chairman, said conditions had been better than he had expected although confidence in some overseas markets 'is not as strong as we would like'. Although sales to Germany have been holding up, the French and Italian market had proved 'tricky', he said. But improving consumer confidence in the domestic market and continental Europe was leading to higher sales. The company hopes to raise margins by reducing the number of models and holding down raw material costs which account for 60 per cent of production costs. The order book stands at about Pounds 10m, more than 50 per cent higher than a year ago. Two new models will be launched at the Southampton Boat Show in September to supplement the four introduced in the last 12 months. Increased production is likely to be met by re-opening of one of the group's factories near Peterborough. Net cash at the end of the six months was Pounds 2m.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: ABB wins Dollars 150m Iran power order ASEA Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, said yesterday it had won an order worth around Dollars 150m (Pounds 102.7m) to convert an Iranian gas turbine power station into a combined-cycle power plant. ABB said the conversion would boost output at the plant in the holy city of Qom by 50 per cent to 600 MW without requiring additional fuel. The order was placed by the Tehran regional electricity corporation with financing provided by the World Bank. The project is due to be completed by the end of 1996. ABB will supply boilers to extract waste heat from the four existing gas turbines. The heat will then be used to generate steam, which will power two new steam turbine generators. Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh this week visited Turkmenistan for talks on the construction of an oil pipeline from the former Soviet republic through Iran and Turkey to Europe, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported yesterday. In March Iran and Turkmenistan agreed to study the building of an oil pipeline from Turkmenistan to Tehran with a capacity of 80,000 to 140,000 barrels per day.</p>

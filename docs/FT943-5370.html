			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Yeltsin seeks to outsmart his nationalist critics The outbreak of fighting in Chechnya appears to mark the start of a new, violent phase in a Moscow-backed effort to install a non-separatist government, and to help keep Russia from splintering. The turbulence comes in Russia's most volatile region, a strip of well-armed Moslem republics in its south-west Caucasus mountain region. It originated three years ago, when Mr Dzhokhar Dudayev returned to lead Chechnya after serving as a general in the Soviet strategic bombing division, and declared independence from Moscow. He humiliated Mr Yeltsin, who sent in about 500 Russian troops to put down the separatism but quickly had to withdraw when Mr Dudayev declared war. The attempt to unseat -Mr Dudayev, however, risks heavy bloodshed in a republic known for blood feuds and belligerent clans. In oil-rich Chechnya, high fashion involves variants of 1930s-style gangland pinstripes and fedoras, and government ministers keep loaded pistols and rifles on their desks and in concealed holsters. Mr Yeltsin's open support for Mr Dudayev's opponents is partly a strategy to pre-empt his own nationalist critics by appearing tough against independence drives in Russia's restive regions, such as Tatarstan and Bashkiria. He is also sending a signal that he will no longer tolerate such flagrant defiance. Moscow's plans also appear to stand a good chance of backfiring. One of Mr Yeltsin's greatest political foes, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, has become Chechnya's most conspicuous opposition leader and may himself take power there. Mr Khasbulatov was Russia's parliamentary speaker until Mr Yeltsin ousted him last year in a bloody shootout, and was released from prison in February. While denying he wants to be Chechnya's president, Mr Khasbulatov has allied with two of three warlords who have emerged against Mr Dudayev, and yesterday said he was forming a paramilitary unit to oppose the republic's president. The anti-government groups possess enough armour to lend some credibility to assertions that Moscow has armed the rebels. Last month Mr Yeltsin sent cash to one of the rebel provinces, Nadterechni, to make up three years of back pay to pensioners and government employees that had been withheld by a blockade from Moscow. The windfall significantly boosted the image of the region's warlord, Mr Umar Avturkhanov, leader of the rebels' Provisional Council. This has made Mr Avturkhanov appear to be Moscow's favourite to succeed Mr Dudayev. But another regional strongman, a 31-year-old former Grozny mayor named Mr Beslan Gantemirov, is said to control the biggest rebel force, about 1,000 men in Chechnya's Urusmartanovsky region. Then there is the third warlord, Mr Ruslan Labazanov, 26, a martial arts specialist who says he supports Mr Khasbulatov. Mr Labazanov's political plans are simple: 'If Dudayev does not resign, we will eliminate him.'</p>

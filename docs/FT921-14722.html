			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips in quiet session THE foreign exchange markets saw cautious trading yesterday, with the dollar consolidating after a strong upward run at the end of last week and sterling remaining just above its floor within the European exchange rate mechanism, writes Simon London. Having peaked in New York on Friday, the dollar eased slightly during Far Eastern trading yesterday from the US closing level. By the close in Tokyo, the dollar stood at DM1.5720, down from New York's DM1.5735 finish and a high of DM1.5880 in US trading. The pattern was similar against the yen, with the dollar ending at Y126.70, from Y127.05. Dealers said trading in the US currency now had little direction following better than expected US non-farm employment data on Friday. The figures left a balance of dealers prepared to buy the dollar on expectations of a further rise, and banks which retain a negative outlook for the currency. Further US economic releases this week could crystalise the position. Today, retail sales figures will be announced, followed by retail price inflation figures on Thursday. A quiet morning session in Europe saw the US currency tread water, closing at DM1.5725 and Y126.80 in London, from DM1.5825 and Y127.00 on Friday. In New York the dollar edged up to end at DM1.5780 and Y127.05. Sterling remained pinned close to its floor within the ERM grid. Having opened at around DM2.8380, from a close on Friday of DM2.84, the pound weakened slowly through the day to end at DM2.8350. The UK currency's effective floor stood at DM2.8330, as determined by the position of the Spanish peseta within the ERM, little changed from last week. Dealers said negative sentiment against sterling was increased by the weekend publication of the first opinion polls of the new year, which showed the opposition Labour party holding a lead of 5 percentage points over the government. The D-Mark itself could be tested by the outcome of the current round of wage negotiations between employers and unions in the steel sector, seen as setting the trend for the rest of German industry. The union meets today to consider its next action in pursuit of a 10.5 per cent pay increase. Elsewhere, the Australian dollar firmed after concerted intervention by the domestic monetary authorities and the US Federal Reserve, following a one-point cut in interest rates last week. The Australian currency closed at Dollars 0.7420, up from Dollars 0.7365 on Friday. The Canadian dollar was buoyed by the launch of several international bond issues, including Ontarion Hydro's CDollars 1.5bn global bond issue. From a close on Friday in Canadian trading of CDollars 1.1543 against the US dollar, the Canadian dollar strengthened to end at CDollars 1.1485 in London, just off its high of CDollars 1.1460.</p>

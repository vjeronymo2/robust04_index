			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Military Sciences Professor Colonel </F> (Retired) A. Krasnov under the rubric "Air Forces Tactics: A  Look at the Problem": "Aerial Battle at the Threshold of  Changes"]    [Text] Military hardware is upgraded in the Air Forces as  in no other branch of the armed forces, and that has a direct  impact on the development of their tactics. It is not difficult  to assume, however, that these two interconnected processes will  be accomplished in the future chiefly under the influence of the  changes that are planned in the military policy of our state and  the significant cutbacks in the size of the Russian Air Forces.  Domestic science will have to resolve quite a few issues in this  regard that affect, in one way or another, all areas of the  military arts, including questions of improving the tactics of  aerial battle. The most important of these, in my opinion, are  the following.    What enemy aircraft could our pilots encounter in  battle? This question was as simple as could be during the  times of grim confrontation between the Warsaw Pact and NATO:  the tactical fighters produced by the United States and the  Western European countries. But today we should also add to  that... the domestic Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters, whose tactical  flight characteristics are highly regarded by aviation  specialists around the world.    China and Germany, aside from the traditional buyers (more  than 40 nations), have been displaying an interest in these  aircraft. The FRG is moreover ready to buy MiG-29s that are not  right off the assembly line; the Luftwaffe would also acquire  aircraft from combat formations, replacing the engines and  electronics on them with newer ones. They have calculated in the  West that it would be more advantageous to put an improved  version of the Russian MiG into service than to labor over the  development of the expensive EFA Eurofighter.    The continuing instability of the military-political climate  in some regions, and especially the Near East, also cannot fail  to be taken into account in this situation. Armed conflict broke  out once more in the Persian Gulf in January, after all, with  the active employment of aviation just as happened two years  earlier. And who knows, perhaps soon Russian pilots will be  taking part in peacekeeping actions by multinational forces in  "hot spots" around the globe. They would likely then have to  confront these same MiGs and Sukhoys...    The program of testing of the new-generation F-22 fighter is  moreover approaching completion in the United States. It  possesses, in the opinion of specialists, the highest combat  potential of aircraft in this class that are in service today  with the air forces of the leading air powers. Failing to  mention the fact that the Americans will try to win the world  market for aircraft hardware in the future through the sale of  this aircraft is to play the ostrich, sticking one's head in the  sand at the sign of danger.    The substance of the concept of the "likely adversary," as  we  see, is becoming more voluminous for our Air Forces, and it must  consequently be used with a regard for new approaches to the  tactical training of flight personnel in fighter aviation. Just  which ones? It is still difficult to answer that question.    Where will the battle be waged? We have lost a  considerable amount of space with the collapse of the Warsaw  Pact and the withdrawal of our troops from Eastern Europe,  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The boundaries of our radar  reconnaissance and warning of a possible air attack in some  sectors have, as a consequence, drawn significantly closer to  the groups of forces and important targets covered by fighters  in some sectors. And that means that our likely adversary  obtains a palpable advantage under these conditions.    It cannot be ruled out that a number of Eastern European  countries would not act on the side of the CIS in a military  conflict in certain situations. The United States and its allies  in NATO are moreover able to create strike forces of troops and  air forces in any part of the globe in a short period of time.  Suffice it to say that the plans of the American command  envisage the redeployment of up to 1,500 combat aircraft from  their continent to Europe in 20 days. The possibility of an  attack on the part of an enemy with surprise mass maneuvers thus  increases sharply in the event of the deployment of air strike  groups along our western borders.    The circumstance should also be taken into account that the  entry into service on a mass scale of means of aerial attack  manufactured using Stealth technology, strategic cruise missiles  using conventional ordnance and other types of high-precision  weaponry would lead to a significant change in their operational  structure in operations and strikes. The latter would obviously  not have strict time frames, and could be carried out in waves  for a prolonged period from various directions, accompanied by  strong electronic suppression of troop command-and-control  systems and weapons to as much as theater depth.    The opportunities for the timely entry of fighters into  battle from a status of ground alert duty and the intercept of  an airborne enemy in the distant approaches to the targets they  are covering are sharply restricted under those conditions. The  sole way out of this situation, in my opinion, is transition to  a means of waging combat operations that is in this case not  economical--fighter airborne alert status. What else can be done?    How will the battle be waged? The fundamental  rules that were devised and codified in local wars and armed  conflicts in the last thirty years will obviously remain in  force for the next decade as well, if not longer.    There would seemingly be no need in this regard to discuss  today the upheavals in air clashes between fourth-generation  aircraft. But let us nonetheless try and answer a question: How,  taking into account the cutbacks in our fighter aviation, can we  achieve the maximum realization of the combat potential of the  Su-27M and MiG-31, which--it is no secret--will in the near  future constitute the foundation of the aircraft inventory of  fighter and PVO [air-defense] aviation? How can we learn, in  other words, to fight using skill rather than numbers? We will  proceed therein from the fact that the tactics for waging aerial  battle by the crews of those aircraft are founded chiefly on the  use of the "recommendations" of on-board expert systems and the  delivery of high-precision weaponry.    The search for an airborne enemy by the crews of fighter  interceptors could thus be accomplished through its preliminary  detection by velocity, with the further tracking of several  targets according to the ranges measured using the automatic  selection of pulse repetition frequencies for the on-board radar  and the depiction of symbols (corresponding to target range and  speed) on a display in the cockpit of the interceptor. An  on-board thermal direction finder and laser rangefinder could  also be used for the concealed surveillance of the overall  aerial situation. All of the subsequent measurements of range to  the target are made using the on-board radar.    Assessment of the tactical situation is performed, by and  large, by the on-board expert system. After the detection of a  group target, for example, it establishes the quantity and place  of each aircraft in the group and determines their affiliation  and priority without the intervention of the pilot, after which  all targets are ranked according to the degree of danger and the  most dangerous are put onto the display.    The commander of the interceptor group must make the  decision  to enter into battle in the next stage. His plan could be as  follows: having detected one or several targets, the pilots take  up a tactically advantageous position with regard to the enemy  and make a concealed approach to him. Each distributes the  guided missiles on board the fighter against the targets  assigned by the group commander, and tracks them until such time  as his aircraft is at a distance from one of them that  corresponds to the maximum permissible range of weapons  delivery. It only remains to execute the missile launch and  disengage, using vigorous maneuvers guaranteeing the safe  evasion of possible return fire from the enemy. The group  commander, depending on the situation and the results of the  first attack, then either organizes another pass or assigns his  subordinates the task of finding new targets.    But how, say, can battle be waged if the enemy has both a  quantitative and a qualitative superiority? This is far from a  rhetorical question, if one takes into account the significant  cutbacks in the funding allocated in the Russian budget for the  continued development of the latest models of military aircraft.  This problem is obviously in need of serious analysis. The basis  for it could be a consideration of the combat tasks of fighter  aviation.    You will agree, whatever contemporary aviation systems it  may  be equipped with, that it will have to wage battle only for  tactical supremacy in the air--that is, in a restricted area and  in the most crucial periods of combat operations--using small  forces, with the observance of the principles of mass and  centralized application.    If the likelihood of a large-scale war against Russia  exists,  then it is only potentially, in the long term. But local  military conflicts are making themselves known even today, and  require the appropriate level of readiness of our Air Forces. It  must therefore be taken into account, when preparing them, that  combat operations in local conflicts, as a rule, are of a  localized nature; there is not always a clearly outlined front  line; and, raids of enemy aviation are possible from various and  most unexpected directions. Fighter aviation, aside from its  basic "classical" tasks, will have to perform a new one as well  in this regard--supporting the redeployment of mobile forces to  the "hot spots." But if the prevailing geopolitical situation of  Russia, the large spaces and the poor sophistication of the  airfield network are taken into account, then in my opinion it  is difficult to count on efficiency in the maneuvering of  fighter units and their concentration in the threatened areas in  the event a military conflict breaks out.    Quite a few difficult-to-solve problems of this sort have  unfortunately accumulated in the tactics of fighter aviation in  our Air Forces, since it has gotten into a state of anabiosis,  figuratively speaking, in its development. One unequivocal  conclusion suggests itself here--although its basic provisions  remain in force, the necessity would seem to have become urgent  to expand them and bring them closer to the realities of the  present day. At this stage, when the formulation of the military  doctrine of Russia is approaching its conclusion, it is more  desirable than before to devote attention to the theoretical  elaboration and practical assimilation of questions of preparing  and waging combat operations by its Air Forces, and first and  foremost fighter aviation.

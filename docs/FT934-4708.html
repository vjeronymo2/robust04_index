			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Currency gains bolster profits at Rothmans Favourable exchange rates lifted first-half profits of Rothmans International, the restructured tobacco group, by 11.5 per cent. The rise came in spite of a 9 per cent decline in worldwide cigarette sales writes Philip Rawstorne. Operating profit rose 8.6 per cent, to Pounds 212.6m (Dollars 314.6m), in the six months ended September, on net sales 12 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.22bn. Taxable profits, boosted by Pounds 29m from currency translation, rose from Pounds 209.3m to Pounds 233.4m. Due to the complexity and timing of the group's reconstruction, a single dividend for the year will be paid next August. Much of the overall decline in cigarette volumes was accounted for by lower sales in the UK, France, and the former Yugoslavia. Profits in western Europe were also hit by taxation changes in Germany and rationalisation costs of Pounds 16.7m, mainly in Belgium. Operating profit in Malaysia benefited from price increases and a favourable change in the mix of brand sales. The contribution from Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines improved after last year's Pounds 9.2m exceptional costs. However, in the Philippines volumes were significantly lower due, in part, to the closure last December of Alhambra Industries. Net investment income rose 54 per cent, from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 20.8m. In spite of difficult conditions in a number of markets, Lord Swaythling, chairman, said he expected satisfactory full-year trading results. Profits, however, would reflect the effects of reconstruction costs of Pounds 48m.</p>

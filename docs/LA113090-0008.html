			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO. 10 CS LONG BEACH WOMEN TAKE ON NO. 6 STANFORD TONIGHT  </P> <P> Early-season scheduling hasn't been easy on the Cal State Long Beach women's  basketball team, but the 49ers hope to make the most of it when they tip off  tonight at 7:30 against sixth-ranked Stanford at University Gym.  </P> <P> Having defeated No. 7 Texas, 80-74, last Friday, No. 10 Long Beach (1-0) can  make the defending NCAA champion Cardinal 0-2.  </P> <P> Stanford lost to Tennessee, 95-80, Sunday at Knoxville.  </P> <P> "Thinking about it, to get (to the top), it looks steeper and higher than it  did last year," Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I look at the media  guides and think, 'How are we going to beat these teams?' "  </P> <P> Stanford center Trisha Stevens, who had not practiced or played since surgery  on both knees last April, scored 28 points against Tennessee. Julie Zeilstra  added 17 points, Sonja Henning 15.  </P> <P> Long Beach guard Dana Wilkerson had 16 points against Texas, and center Kari  Parriott had 15 points and 15 rebounds.

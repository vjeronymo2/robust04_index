			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to this amendment to section 1915(c)(3) and the amendment under section 9411(c) of OBRA '86 limiting waivers under section 1902(a)(10) to ``comparability'' of covered services under section 1902(a)(10)(B), States had been permitted to waive eligibility requirements for the categorically needy, but not the medically needy. Generally, States used the waiver authority to use institutional income and resource deeming rules. The result of these two amendments to section 1915(c) is that this waiver authority no longer extends to the categorically needy, but extends only to the medically needy. However, a State may continue to use the institutional eligibility rules for categorically needy waiver recipients, if the individuals are members of an eligibility group that the State may elect to cover under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(VI) of the Act and &sect;435.217.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Post-Eligibility Treatment of Income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule, we revised the post-eligibility rules at &sect;435.726(c)(1) and &sect;435.735(c)(1) to include the provisions of section 9502(e) of COBRA and section 9435(a) of OBRA '86. Post-eligibility calculations for individuals who are found eligible under &sect;435.217 determine how much of eligible waiver recipients' income is applied to the cost of home and community-based waiver services. One of the deductions from waiver recipients' income included in these calculations is a deduction for the maintenance needs of the waiver recipient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9502(e) of COBRA amended section 1915(c) of the Act to reflect a change in the amount States may protect for the maintenance needs of waiver recipients in the post-eligibility calculations. The amendment in COBRA specifically allows States to use a higher maintenance needs standard for home and community-based recipients than permitted under &sect;&sect;435.726 and 435.735(c)(1) for waivers approved or renewed on or after April 7, 1986. The amendment in OBRA '86 further amended section 1915(c) to also permit use of the higher maintenance need standards for waivers approved or renewed before April 7, 1986. In the proposed rule, we provided that the maintenance amount be based on a reasonable assessment of need and that States set an upper limit which cannot be exceeded for any one individual. Should a State choose to use maintenance need standards that vary by individual, it must assure that all individuals in like circumstances are treated comparably.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule did not address how the rules used to determine income in the post-eligibility income and resource process for an institutionalized individual who has a spouse who lives in the community would affect home and community-based waiver recipients whose eligibility is based on section 1924 of the Act. We are addressing this issue in a separate rule that will propose further revisions to the post-eligibility regulations. These revisions will address application of the section 1924 rules and other matters. They will include our interpretation of ``institutionalized spouse'' at section 1924(h)(1) as allowing, on a waiver-by-waiver basis, use of the post-eligibility rules at section 1924(d) to determine Medicaid benefits payable for individuals who are eligible for home and community-based waiver services under &sect;435.217. That is, an individual would be subject to the section 1924 post-eligibility rules if (1) the individual's State elected the section 1924(h)(1) post-eligibility option, (2) the individual meets the criteria of &sect;435.217, and (3) the individual has a spouse who is neither institutionalized in a medical institution or nursing facility nor receiving home and community-based waiver services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

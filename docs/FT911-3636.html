			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: Britain's legacy from neglecting education Sir, It was disappointing to find Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, April 18) endorse the vulgar view that qualifications are unnecessary. It has been a long-standing English practice to denigrate formal training by pointing to the odd genius who made it to the top without such training. But for every Isambard Kingdom Brunel who got to the top a thousand 16-year-olds are left without hope of qualifications either from school or at work each year. That neglect of education is at the root of Britain's structural problems is not merely the view of the Labour party. Mr Brittan also takes the standard neo-classical position that all things, goods or services, are equal with production and that manufacturing should have no special status. However, if you think in terms of tradeables and non-tradeables, manufactures are more tradeable than services, and while it is conceivable that an import bill of any size can be financed by income on invisible account or capital inflow it is not very likely. The problem is that for Britain to finance its import bill without a devised manufacturing sector will require either a drastically devalued pound, a very high nominal interest rate or a large number of unemployed. Economic policy is about the art of the reasonably probable and not merely the remotely possible. M. Desai, professor of economics, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, WC2</p>

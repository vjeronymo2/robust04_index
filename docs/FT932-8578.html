			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Belgium benefits from strong early sales into Far East NEW issue activity was subdued yesterday, ahead of today's Danish referendum, but dealers expect the flow of deals to pick up if the Danes vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty this time. Among the borrowers said to be eyeing the Ecu market were the European Investment Bank, the European Community, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Spain and Italy. The focus of attention yesterday was the Kingdom of Belgium's Dollars 500m Eurobond due 1998, which benefited from strong early sales into the Far East. The issue, arranged by JP Morgan, was officially launched in London time, but underwriters were alerted in advance, allowing sales to be made throughout the Far Eastern trading day. Belgium has been a rare visitor to the international markets in recent years, which helped fuel demand for the issue. The pricing, at 21 basis points above the five-year US Treasury yield, was considered fair for an AA+/AA1 sovereign borrower. Several underwriters said they had sold substantially more than their allotments, while others said demand was strong but only in certain areas. The improved performance of the dollar recently has encouraged interest in three to five-year paper among certain investors. A number of other dollar offerings are about to be made. Toyota Motor Finance is expected to launch a Dollars 200m - Dollars 300m three-year deal today, while the Asian Development Bank is preparing a Dollars 500m 10-year issue via Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan. In addition, Chubu Electric Power is said to be planning a swap-driven deal in the Canadian dollar sector, though it may shift elsewhere if better arbitrage opportunities are available. Elsewhere, General Electric Capital Corporation launched a L150bn issue due 2000 via Deutsche Bank. The deal met firm demand, due to strong interest in high-yielding currencies.</p>

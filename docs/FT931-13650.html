			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Decline to Pounds 3.25m at Hill &amp; Smith 'THERE is no reason for me to apologise for these results,' said Mr John Silk, chairman of Hill &amp; Smith Holdings, as he announced a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 3.25m in the year to September 30. Mr Michael Sara, managing director of the West Midlands-based steel fabricator and stockholder, explained that steel stockholding and drop forging were tough markets for all participants, but that the group had been buoyed by the motorway barrier and bridge parapet, building products, and drainage products divisions. The stockholding division 'made a small loss before interest charges of some substance', said Mr Sara, adding that industry volumes had fallen by between 10 and 15 per cent in most areas. The three drop forging operations had been reorganised into one company and the division had made 'a small loss for the first time'. After the year-end, he said, it had been hit by the pit closure programme - a lot of mining equipment is drop-forged. The other three divisions were profitable, though barriers and parapets, 'the backbone' had seen new entrants to its markets. Mr Sara said that here the group was keen to preserve market share, though in stockholding margins were more of a priority. Turnover declined to Pounds 63.1m (Pounds 75.8m), due mainly to the disposal of Invicta Fencing and Tipton Steel Stockholders (Stoke) - 'items of bad news', according to Mr Sara. They had a combined turnover of Pounds 11m. Their sale and 'good stock control' reduced gearing from 14 to 10.6 per cent. The group had Pounds 1.2m cash at the year-end and acquisitions were possible. It bought Duct &amp; Access Covers in March for a maximum Pounds 3.2m. Earnings worked through at 7.85p (11.17p) per share and the final dividend is held at 3.9p for a maintained total of 6p.</p>

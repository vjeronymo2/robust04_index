			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (13): JGB futures stir bad memories - Japan THE CLOSED nature of Tokyo's financial markets was highlighted by the controversial launch of Japanese government bond futures on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange this month. The launch of the JGB futures by Simex, which also runs the Nikkei futures market, has bought back bad memories to Tokyo stock exchange officials, who blamed the plunge in the stock market on excessive futures and options transactions. Many in the financial markets point out that such misconceptions stem from the heavy regulation over derivative products in Japan, which has also kept the use of futures and options under-developed. Simex launched the JGB contract after suggestions from the Managed Futures Association in the US. Mr Ang Swee Tian, president of Simex, said: 'Earlier in the year we indicated that we were studying the possibilities, and there was no indication of concern then,' he says. However, TSE officials have been angered by the launch of the cheaper contract by Simex. 'We only got a fax in August from Simex notifying us of the launch,' says the TSE. JGB futures are already traded in London and Chicago, but this will be the first launch outside of Tokyo in the same time zone. Simex says the commission levels are around half of those in Tokyo. TSE officials have tried to convince Simex to cancel the plan, without success. 'The launch will erode liquidity in Tokyo, hence distorting prices and the efficiency of the market,' says a TSE spokesman. Officials at Liffe, visiting Tokyo recently, have also denounced Simex as a 'free rider' copying successful products on other exchanges. Mr Ang contends that the move by Simex will not fragment the market, since Tokyo's JGB futures market is already huge with widespread participation. Volume on the Tokyo JGB futures is about six times that of Singapore. Tokyo financial authorities have warned Japanese brokers and traders against marketing, or using the Simex futures. However, this will not stop overseas investors, including overseas affiliates of Japanese brokers, from trading. Some traders point out that the move by Simex reflects growing demand from non-TSE members who want to trade JGB futures without paying exorbitant TSE membership fees. However, a trader at a UK brokerage based in Tokyo says he will not use the Simex market until its liquidity and pricing efficiency has improved. 'The real test is going to come when the Tokyo futures market is locked due to a large sized order,' he adds. The small turnover is expected to keep large-lot players away, and concerns over the open outcry system exists. Unlike the JGB futures traded in London, the contracts are not compatible, with the size of each contract in Singapore half the Y100m of the Tokyo contract, and positions are not transferable. One trader at a leading Japanese house, however, points out that trading on Simex holds great potential. 'From the users point of view, competition between exchanges isn't a bad thing. The TSE shouldn't involve market users in its rows,' he says. It is not the first time TSE officials have failed to persuade Simex to change its stance on products linked to the Japanese market. The TSE tried to convince Simex to implement trading restrictions on its Nikkei 225 futures contracts, following the crash in the Tokyo stock market. Tokyo financial authorities blamed futures and options contracts for volatility on the underlying stock market, and implemented a spate of trading restrictions over the past two years. They also requested that Simex introduce stricter rules to curb trading, but Simex failed to comply. The result of tighter restrictions and higher trading costs on the Osaka stock exchange, where the Nikkei futures are listed, resulted in a shift of trading to Singapore. Japanese officials were angered by the plunge in derivatives trading on the Osaka exchange last year, while activity jumped on Simex. In July, the TSE drafted a new set of restrictions for the stock index futures market, including the introduction of a circuit breaker mechanism to suspend transactions when prices swing wildly. A separate group of Osaka and Tokyo stock exchange members has been working on a new stock index for futures, and a new index was announced by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, which calculates the Nikkei 225 index, on October 8. The Nikkei 300 is a capitalisation weighted average of 300 stocks, and a new futures contract based on the index is expected to replace Osaka's Nikkei 225 futures, which is a simple price average of 225 stocks, and has been criticised as being easily manipulated. Meanwhile, although Japan's new coalition government is calling for less regulation and freer markets, the ministry of finance is far from easing its grip on new financial products, including new derivative instruments. Earlier this year, the Committee to Make Tokyo Markets More Transparent and International (CTTI), an industry body made up of Japanese and foreign financial institutions, criticised the ministry's decision-making in evaluating new financial products saying it was unclear and inconsistent.  ----------------------------------------------------- AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME OF NIKKEI FUTURES  ----------------------------------------------------- Year                                 Number of                                      contracts  ----------------------------------------------------- Simex  ----------------------------------------------------- 1988                                     2,348 1989                                     3,492 1990                                     3,715 1991                                     3,045 1992                                    13,897 1993 (Jan-Sep)                          18,898  ----------------------------------------------------- TSE  ----------------------------------------------------- 1988                                    21,752 1989                                    21,858 1990                                    55,239 1991                                    87,980 1992                                    48,289 1993 (Jan-Aug)                          36,251  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Simex, Osaka Securities Exchange  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

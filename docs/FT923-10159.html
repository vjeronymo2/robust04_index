			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit shares remain out of favour KWIK-FIT Holdings, the tyre and exhaust fitter, said yesterday that it had noted that several brokers had downgraded their forecasts for the current year to February 28 1993. This, the company said, had resulted in a sharp fall in the share price recently. Yesterday the decline continued, to 104 1/2 p. On June 4, the shares stood at 223p, on July 24 at 176p, on July 27 at 169p, slumping 120p the following day. The company stressed that buoyant tyre sales in the final quarter of last year had been followed by a May, June and July down on last time, though demand for other products continued 'at a good level'. Tyre sales generally had fallen, though the company had maintained its market share. The balance sheet was strong, the company said, with relatively low borrowings. It fully expected to maintain the level of its dividends. In the year to February 29 1992, the company had achieved a 66 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 32.1m in defiance of the recession. This it had accomplished with operating margins up from 10 to 15 per cent and with interest charges down by Pounds 4m.</p>

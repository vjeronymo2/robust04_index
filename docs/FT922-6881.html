			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Japan's land prices show record fall A SURVEY of Japanese urban property values has found a 12.3 per cent fall in residential prices in the six months to the end of March, the largest fall in the post-war period and an indication of the severe pressure on financial institutions which have been big lenders to the property market. The Japan Real Estate Institute said the national land price index, including commercial and industrial property, fell by 1.9 per cent during the same period to 108.4, the first decline in 17 years. The institute's survey is regarded as a lagging indicator, and the 12.3 per cent fall in the urban residential index to 83.8 does not reflect the dramatic price plunges in some sectors, particularly the condominium market on the fringes of Tokyo and Osaka. Some Osaka condominiums have fallen in price by more than 40 per cent over the past year, following a spate of speculative building from the late 1980s until 1990, when there were a record 1.7m housing starts in Japan. The figure fell to 1.37m in 1991, and property agents say demand appears to have bottomed for well located apartments selling for around Y40m (Pounds 169,000). Housing starts in March were 2.6 per cent lower than the same month in 1991, and leading apartment builders say their fast growing stock of unsold apartments appears to have peaked. However, developers holding highly priced properties in areas that were thought feasible sites at the peak of the speculative era remain in serious financial difficulty, and officials at the real estate institute indicated that national property prices would continue to fall in coming months. The institute found that the residential price index in central Tokyo was down 12.2 per cent to 83.1 over the six month period, while in Osaka, the index fell 14 per cent to 78.1 and in Nagoya, it was 2 per cent lower at 118.2. Reuter adds: Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday released revised figures showing a fall in industrial production in March of 2.6 per cent from the previous month.</p>

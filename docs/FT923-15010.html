			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Expansion at EMH as deficit is reduced European Motor Holdings yesterday reported sharply reduced losses for 1991-92, two acquisitions and a share issue to raise Pounds 610,000. Losses for the year to March 31 of Pounds 1.38m pre-tax compare with Pounds 2.72m for the 15 months to end-March 1991. Following a reorganisation, EMH has now been substantially redirected as a more broadly based motor-related group. Turnover on continuing activities amounted to Pounds 23.12m (Pounds 8.62m). Losses worked through at 18.1p (139.6p) and the dividend is being omitted - 0.5p was paid previously. The acquisitions are of Mill Garages, a Sunderland-based operator of 13 motor retail franchises, for Pounds 2.59m, and the business and certain assets of Wiltshire-based Nigel Bristow Toyota, and a garage owned by Bristow, for Pounds 640,000. The purchase price for Mill Garages will be satisfied via the issue of 2.3m new ordinary shares, of which 1.57m are being placed on behalf of the vendors. The 570,000 shares being issued for the purchase of Bristow are also being placed on behalf of the vendor. The share issue to raise Pounds 610,000 is of 540,000 new ordinaries at 112p per share. The cash will be used to reduce debt of the enlarged group.</p>

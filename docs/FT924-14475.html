			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Observer: Paltzer's how-to The bottom of a recession would not seem to be the best time to launch yet another Do-it-Yourself magazine on to a depressed UK magazine market. But Swiss born publisher Rolf Paltzer is confident that he's got his timing spot on with his first magazine Here's How. He's no stranger to British magazines. In the 1980s he turned the women's magazine market on its head when working for Gruner and Jahr, the German publishers. In 1986 he launched Prima and a year later Best, proving that a newcomer with a different idea can conquer the competition even in a mature market. But it is one thing entering the UK market with the backing of a German publishing giant. It is quite another doing it as an independent. However, the 42-year-old Paltzer, who quit G&amp;J a couple of years ago, thinks he's spotted a gap: 'There's nothing between brick-laying and soft furnishing.' The market is ready for an idiot-proof guide, he tells me.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Research to help bus de-regulation THE GOVERNMENT is to carry out further research into the sort of information required by bus passengers as part of measures intended to improve bus de-regulation outside London. The government also proposed clarifying the guidelines given to traffic commissioners to help them control severely congested bus routes. It also wants to halve the registration period required for changes in bus routes to 21 days and increase the threshold from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 10,000 under which authorities may award bus routes without tendering.</p>

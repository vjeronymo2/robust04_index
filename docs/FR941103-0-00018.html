			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 2, 1993, the FDIC issued its own proposed regulation implementing section 7(h) of the IBA. See 58 FR 11992. The Board has consulted with the FDIC concerning the response to its proposed rule. Both the Board and the FDIC have attempted to make their final rules as consistent with one another as possible and thereby to reduce the burden that might be imposed on applicants. A description of the final rule and an analysis of the relevant comments follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Determining if an Activity is Permissible for a Federal Branch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters generally stated that no application should be required from a state-licensed branch or agency for the conduct of an activity that is permitted for a federal branch pursuant to interpretation, opinion or advice issued in writing by the OCC or its staff, as well as by statute, regulation official bulletin, circular or order. The commenters argued that a stricter requirement would result in a competitive disadvantage to state licensed offices and thereby would be inconsistent with the intent of the statute. The Board agrees with that argument. Accordingly, the conduct of activities permitted for a federal branch pursuant to interpretation, opinion or advice issued in writing by the OCC or its staff would not require an application, so long as such interpretation, opinion or advice is still considered valid,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , it has not been overruled by the OCC or found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, because national banks and federal branches may rely on a written opinion of counsel that an activity is permissible under the National Bank Act or other applicable statutes, in the Board's view, it would be appropriate to permit state-licensed branches and agencies also to rely on such opinions, provided the opinion of counsel is based on a reasoned analysis of applicable statutes, regulations, official bulletins, circular, orders, or interpretations, opinions or advice of the OCC or its staff. The Board plans to consult with the OCC when questions arise as to the permissibility of any particular activity. Insured branches of foreign banks also should consult with the FDIC as to the permissibility of particular activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Bank Approach Versus Activity Approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board's proposed rule took a bank-based approach to implementing the statute; that is, an application was required from each bank wishing to conduct or continue to conduct an activity not permissible for a national bank. The comments suggested that the Board instead take an activity based approach, at least with respect to activities which the commenters believed presented minimal risk. One commenter suggested that the Board entertain applications from industry trade groups with respect to the conduct of such activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has determined that a combination of the two approaches is the appropriate way to proceed and has modified the proposed rule accordingly. As described in further detail below, the final rule provides that certain categories of activities are consistent with sound banking practice and that no application should be required to conduct such activities. The fact that the Board's prior consent is not required does not preclude the Board from taking any appropriate action within its authority with respect to such activities if the facts and circumstances warrant such action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Not Required in Certain Instances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first category of activities exempted from the application requirement are certain activities already determined by the FDIC not to pose a significant risk to the Bank Insurance Fund pursuant to &sect;362.4(c)(3) of the FDIC's regulations (12 CFR part 362). The Board has determined not to require an application under this part for the conduct of any such activity that the FDIC would permit an insured state bank to conduct directly, provided the activity is permissible for the branch or agency under applicable state law and any other applicable federal law or regulation. The Board believes the conduct of these activities, with proper controls, is consistent with safe and sound banking. As set forth in 12 CFR 362.4(c)(3)(i)&hyph;(ii)(A), the exempted activities include guarantee activities and activities found by the Board by regulation or order to be closely related to banking. In addition, the Board has determined to exempt from the application requirement any activity conducted as agent rather than as principal, provided that the activity is one that could be conducted by a state-chartered bank headquartered in the same state as the branch or agency is licensed. Of course, all activities of the branches and agencies remain subject to examination. If any particular activity is found to be improperly conducted, the Board retains enforcement authority to require conformance to safety and soundness requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: Swan Lake or Swan Fake .. - The latest staging of this perennial favourite THERE is always Swan Lake. There is, I often think, only Swan Lake. 'Give them anything', says the box office, 'but call it Swan Lake'. So, of course, as the resoundingly titled National Ballet of St. Petersburg embarks upon a regional tour - in a first visit to Britain - its calling card is the inevitable outbreak of feathered mopery. I don't know what audiences expect from a company presenting one-night stands of this celebrated trap for the unwary, but the troupe comes from Russia, there is Tchaikovsky emerging from the pit and girls in white tutus on stage exemplifying the hoariest of dance cliches, so probably all's for the best in the best of balletic worlds. The idea of Swan Lake as the summum bonum of dance-going is promoted by far too many companies. The Royal Ballet will open its autumn season with swans; English National Ballet announces a new staging next year; Northern Ballet Theatre will show an idiosyncratic version in a forthcoming visit to London. The result has been, unsurprisingly, to debase and denature a prime example of Imperial Russian ballet-theatre. Swan Lake was, and remains, a grand spectacular, demanding massive opera house forces and the most refined and noble dance-style to sustain it, with, at its heart, a true ballerina - no-one else will do. The debilitating nonsense propounded by many ensembles under this title is an affront to the work itself, and to the ideals of classic ballet which it enshrines. Swan Lake becomes Swan Fake. What then of the National Ballet of St. Petersburg, and it offering? The company was formed in 1947 as the Leningrad Ballet, and embarked upon a touring existence in the Soviet Union. The dancers are identified in the programme as being graduates of the Vaganova Academy. The production, by Viktor Korolkov, director of the troupe, contains elements from the Mariinsky original, with the usual massive emendations (including that bloody Jester) owed to Gorsky's Moscow stagings, and the statutory Soviet happy ending. It is ballet on short commons, efficient in view of the restricted numbers of the ensemble, and hideous to look at. Contemporary Russian design for dance has an affection for lurid colours, skimpy fabrics, and far, far too much metallic thread: when, in the new Russia, they get around to drag-queens, this is what they will wear. Oleg Averzhanov's decorations are lamentable in their flimsiness and rampant improbability. The staging offers little resistance to this visual inadequacy. No less dispiriting the music for the evening. The score is performed by the State Radio Symphony orchestra from St. Petersburg - some 30 musicians who are amplified so that chamber texture becomes louder without gaining body. Stanislas Gorkovenko elicited a loving account of the overture, but thereafter, the need to whip up a musical storm meant that sensitivity was at a premium. The ensemble of swans at the Bristol Hippodrome on Tuesday, when I saw the staging, were well-drilled, and this may count as the chief virtue of an evening that otherwise looked artistically impoverished, and would have seemed more so were it not for the presence of artists from the Kirov and Bolshoy troupes as guest principals. The central role was split between Nadezhda Pavlova, as Odette, and Lubov Kunakova as Odile, with Alexander Bogatyrov their Siegfried. Pavlova gave a more touching interpretation - pure, eloquent line; silken phrasing - than I have ever known from her before. Kunakova came on stage in the third act as a firework display of bravura steps - and these were the best Kirov pyrotechnics. Bogatyrov, with little apparent physical power left, remains a wonderfully believable hero, noble in bearing, sensitive, and amid the optimistic brouhaha of the court scenes, seeming a prince indeed. It is extraordinary, and illuminating, to watch artists of the calibre of Pavlova, Kunakova, Bogatyrov, in these reduced circumstances. They do not know how not to perform Swan Lake. The music sounds, and their bodies and temperaments respond with actions that compel belief in the idea of a great and beautiful ballet having this title. The dance is clear; the drama touches us; classic ballet lives. And so, with them, does Swan Lake. Swan Lake will tour Britain until October 10. The visit is sponsored by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.</p>

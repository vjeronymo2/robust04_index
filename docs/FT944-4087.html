			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool prices in the main international primary markets continue to fluctuate narrowly. Finer merinos which eased just recently were unchanged or a fraction dearer at this week's closing auctions in Australia, and prices for middle range merino fleece have remained firm. The market indicator closed down again on the week, at 768c/kg compared with 774c/kg, but the mid-week quotation was 763c/kg. New Zealand crossbred prices eased more definitely, with the indicator down 18 cents to 521c/kg. The overall impression is one of a fairly firm market passing through a period of uncertainty. In the UK sentiment has not been helped by the latest interest rate rise, which is likely to depress consumer confidence further in an already fragile situation.</p>

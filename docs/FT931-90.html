			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Citic Australia to buy Japanese retailer stake CITIC Australia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Beijing's most important investment vehicle, the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, plans to buy 10 per cent of Yaohan International, the big Japanese retailer. Citic Australia is acquiring a stake in Yaohan from Mr Kazuo Wada, its chairman and largest shareholder, who built the company into a large international retail chain. Yaohan, which owns stores spread across Asia, America and Europe, recently opened one in Beijing. The shop is located directly opposite Citic's Beijing headquarters. Yaohan said it had ambitious plans to expand in China. Citic Australia, whose interests include a USDollars 70m investment in an aluminium smelter in Victoria, the southern Australian state, is emerging as an aggressive investor internationally. The Chinese parent company was founded in 1979 to promote the country's business links with the outside world. It was headed by Mr Rong Yiren, China's best-known millionaire, who was appointed the country's vice-president at the weekend. Citic's directors announced yesterday that Mr Rong would be stepping down as chairman to allow him to concentrate on his state responsibilities.</p>

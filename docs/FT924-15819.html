			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Bottomley faces pressure on health funding reforms MRS Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is under pressure to explain the financing of next year's community care reforms when she addresses social services leaders today. The biggest-ever changes in community care, based on providing services for elderly and handicapped people in the community rather than in institutions, is only six months away from implementation. However, Mrs Bottomley, locked into a difficult public-spending round, has not been able to allocate budgets to local authorities which will be responsible for co-ordinating the new arrangements. Mrs Bottomley has to obtain sufficient funds to ensure the smooth implementation of the reforms and to win enough money to honour the government's commitment to maintaining growth in health service expenditure. Council leaders made clear yesterday that they want Mrs Bottomley to discuss the financial arrangements for community care when she addresses the conference of the Association of Directors of Social Services and the local-authority associations today. Mr Toby Harris, chair of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities social services committee, said the government was leaving it 'perilously late' to announce the level of resources for community care. The association says more than Pounds 750m will be needed to cover the total cost of operating the new community care system in England.</p>

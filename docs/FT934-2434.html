			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: British manufacturing far short of world class Sir, Over the past two to three years, I and a number of colleagues in the US and Japan have compiled an analysis of 'world-class' manufacturing operations. We used the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award criteria as a means of defining world class, and any operations scoring more than 900 we called world class. In all, we considered just over 12,000 operations and managed to identify 1,039 operations scoring more than 900 on the Baldrige Scale. The results show that Japan has 675 world-class manufacturing operations, North America has 221, west Germany 71, Britain 40 and France 32. When the number of operations are split by location, the result is revealing about local circumstances. Of the Japanese-owned operations, 510 are in Japan; for North American-owned operations, 113 are in North America. For both the German and French operations the bulk are in their home countries, with 67 and 29 respectively. Yet for the British operations, 34 are located outside the UK. I think we have a long way to go if the UK manufacturing base is to become world class. Michael Cross, 20 Amherst Road, Ealing, London W13 8ND</p>

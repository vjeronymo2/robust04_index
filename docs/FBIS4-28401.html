			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA June 10 -- President Le Duc Anh yesterday  submitted to the National Assembly at its current session a  proposal for ratification of the United Nations Convention on  Sea Law-1982 to which Vietnam is a signatory.    Vietnam has a long coastal line and large territorial waters  and it has always attached importance to the sea issue. Over  the past years Vietnam also directly took part in, and made  certain contributions to, the building of the convention.    The UN Convention on Sea Law will serve as an international  legal basis for the state and people of Vietnam to defend their  sovereignty and territorial integrity at present and in future,  thus contributing to promoting peace, stability, friendship,  cooperation and development in the region and over the world as  a whole.    On behalf of the government, Vice Prime Minister Tran Duc  Luong also made recommendations to the National Assembly for  ratifying the UN Convention on Sea Law. He also asked the N.A.  to assign the N.A Standing Committee and the government to amend  the national laws to suit to the stipulations of the convention,  and allow the government to take appropriate measures to  strengthen the defence and management of the territorial waters  and continental shelf of Vietnam.</p>

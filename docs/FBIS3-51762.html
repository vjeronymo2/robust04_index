He heads the so-called Change 94  Alliance. Good morning professor, thanks for being here.  Political analysts who were here earlier today called the  Change 94 Alliance a Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican  Movement] alliance because you are a member of the Molirena  party, so is Guillermo Quijano, and Tomas Herrera deep down is  also one because he works with Mario Galindo, a Molirena member,  in the same law offices.    [Carles] To describe Tomas Herrera that way shows a complete  lack of respect. Tomas Herrera is the president of a political  party [Agrarian Labor Movement -- MOLA] and is a distinguished  professional with his own merits. He is a man who has fought  all his life for liberty and democracy and began his struggle  against the dictatorship back in 1969. My fellow citizens who  made those assertions made a very poor political analysis.    [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, another very important aspect is  the  fact that you, according to studies made, represent the official  sector -- you belonged to the official sector and so did  Molirena. Many people believe that your links to Molirena do you  harm. What do you think?    [Carles] Good gracious! Molirena is a party; in addition I  have been nominated by Morena [National Renewal Movement], a  party with much vitality, much organization, and which will be  successful. I was also nominated by the Civic Renewal Party.  These were the bases of my political actions; there are  persons, however, who saw what happened yesterday and who do not  appreciate what has been happening for several months. My base  is the 60 percent of Panamanians who are not members of any  political party.    [Alvarado] How do you describe yourself at this moment? Are  you in opposition to the government?    [Carles] I am a citizen who takes action according to my own  point of view. I proved this during the four years I was  comptroller general.    [Alvarado] There are those who argue that your candidacy  represents the country's business or oligarchic class -- the  interests of the rich and not the interests of the poor.    [Carles] Look at who is making this statement! This holds  true for those who said this....    [Alvarado, interrupting] The Arnulfists, mainly.    [Carles] Good gracious! The Arnulfists also have very rich  people, a big oligarchy, and some who are very rabiblanco  [derogatory term for upper-class Panamanians]. This holds true  for all parties so this is just an indiscreet remark by people.  People should show more respect. Regardless of their social,  economic, or racial condition, I have, and it gives me great  satisfaction, friends everywhere -- in the interior, in the  city, in farming, industry, business, and among workers. This  is really something silly by people who should know better and  who want to use this as a populist and senseless maneuver. I  believe those who are carrying out that sort of campaign must by  now be regretting this. Wait until they come and ask for help  and I reply by asking: What is wrong with you? Are you against  anyone who has something? That is not the way. Panamanians who  have not stolen any money have a right to do what they please  with it and take part in the political party of their choice --  businessmen, industrialists, cattle ranchers, workers,  professional people. It seems to me a disservice to the country  to make these insinuations. Let us measure the campaign by the  candidate's merits and capacity and not any other way. Let us  see what can they do and what can I do with my capacity,  experience, and knowledge.    [Alvarado] Are you coming close to possible talks with  Mireya  Moscoso, Arnulfista Party president and presidential candidate?  This is rumored in political circles.    [Carles] Look here, I think we have reached a certain point.  We have the nomination and have broadened somewhat the base that  allows electoral and political actions. But remember my dear  Alvaro: I am the candidate, I am the one who is going to rule, I  am going to be the boss, the person who has the program in his  head and in writing is me, and that I am the person whom the  country identifies as the person who has a possibility of  fulfilling a program. What lies ahead are formulas that need to  be resolved such as questions to do with candidacies and  nominations. Regarding the presidency, I am the candidate and I  have absolutely no attachments or commitments for political  opportunities with anyone. I am going to choose my assistants  among capable Panamanians, so I do not believe we should waste  any time on this.    [Alvarado] Professor, something that has become very  relevant is the president's statements on Saturday. What is  your opinion on Endara saying that he openly supports Mrs.  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber describing as traitors all those in his  government, principally from Molirena, who did not support him  [the Arnulfist ticket]?    [Carles] This is a free country and each person should  politically opt for what he believes in. The president should  by now be worried after using such strong words. Perhaps in the  heat of the moment he said things that I, who know him well,  know he does not feel.    [Alvarado] Can there be any impartiality in his words after  he swore to respect the electoral process and not meddle in  political affairs?    [Carles] People's oaths are each person's promise. I am sure  that he went slightly overboard when he took such a direct  participative stance. This is a problem he should admit to. He  is going to resolve it because Guillermo Endara deep down is  someone who is very willing to obey the law. If he scoffed at  it at the National Theater [as heard] and has repeatedly said  that he will preside over open elections, which I believe is the  case, then he will have to straighten his course. Otherwise, he  is going to have -- I know how these things are -- a disastrous  last few months in office. Guillermo Endara has a vision of the  future because he is aware that he cannot allow his work to  become complicated in his last months in office.    [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, today an EL SIGLO newspaper  headline  says that the Legislative Assembly now is in the hands of  Molirena, which in certain ways is an opposition party.  National Assembly President Arturo Vallarino has said the  president could be put on trial for his statements on Saturday.  What do you think?    [Carles] First of all I must correct you because no single  party controls the Legislative Assembly and the actions they can  initiate are something they should.... [pauses] They can only  ensure compliance of the legal aspects. This is a very delicate  topic that needs proper consideration. I am sure that President  Endara's attitude in the future will be to keep his promise to  hold free and open elections, without becoming politically  involved. It does not matter what happened recently; I hope  that he keeps to his promise because this is one of his basic  goals and I believe he is going to keep to it.    [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, what other parties are seeking to  support your candidacy or join the alliance?    [Carles] I believe what we need now are agreements of  support  for the future. I hope that a process of adjustment will begin  among the various groups that have formed and that these groups  will join us or that some may transfer their attention to us.  You will doubtless have noticed that when these youths speak  they have great mobility, while others are not yet defined. I  believe that between now and 8 February some will join. I will  continue, of course, with the candidacy I have initially  accepted by the Morena Party and the Civic Renewal Party.  Others, I hope, will join as we go along. This will avoid  having so many party groups, and most especially, the great  majority of independent Panamanians will start defining  themselves in our favor. The candidates are what is important  in these elections and not the ticket of the political  mechanisms that of course served to comply with the electoral  laws.    [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, what will win these elections, the  person or the party? What do people support right now?    [Carles] What I can see is that voters want a good president  who makes decisions and resolves problems. This is not  something that the parties guarantee, it is the candidates who  guarantee this.    [Alvarado] You visited Chiriqui Province this weekend, what  is the situation there? Chiriqui producers constantly complain  about the situation.    [Carles] Lately I have had the opportunity to visit several  places in the country. This weekend I promised, as a matter of  economic policy, to fight so that the Republic of Panama can  resolve its food problem. If a government does not contribute  to solving the problem of food produced in the country, it is  not doing well. I told them what has been my norm for many  years: to reasonably protect the production of cattle and dairy  products, rice, corn, sorghum, tomatoes, and some vegetables.  This is an unalterable policy, but I warned that this would be  done within reason so producers can increase their efficiency  and ensure that prices to consumers are reasonable as well.</p>

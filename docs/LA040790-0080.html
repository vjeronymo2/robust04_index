			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIAN GUERRILLAS SAY THEY WILL RELEASE 3 EUROPEAN HOSTAGES  </P> <P> Palestinian radicals led by Abu Nidal, one of the world's most notorious  guerrillas, said Friday that they will free three European hostages in response  to an appeal by Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi.  </P> <P> A Palestinian source told Reuters that Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, 31, her  Belgian boyfriend Fernand Houtekins, 42, and their baby Sony, who was born in  captivity, will be released in the next few days.  </P> <P> "I am glad to announce that our group has agreed to respond to the appeal of  leader Moammar Kadafi," said Walid Khaled, spokesman for Abu Nidal's  Revolutionary Council of Fatah, in a statement released in Beirut.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Kadafi had urged Muslims to adhere to the "noble Islamic values  which affirm the honor and humanity of man and the non-taking of innocent  hostages."  </P> <P> The Palestinian statement left unclear the fate of four Belgians, who were  kidnaped with Valente and Houtekins in November, 1987, from a yacht in the  Mediterranean off the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. Earlier, the organization  had said it was trying to free all the hostages.  </P> <P> The statement also did not mention another baby reportedly born to Valente and  Houtekins a few months ago. Sony was born about two years ago. In December,  1988, the kidnapers freed two other children of Valente who had been seized  from the boat.  </P> <P> At the time of the kidnaping, the Palestinian group accused the hostages of  being Jews spying for Israel. However, friends said they were Roman Catholics  on vacation.  </P> <P> The hostages are believed to be held either in Lebanon or Libya.  </P> <P> The Revolutionary Council of Fatah is thought to be behind a string of attacks  against Israelis, Europeans and Persian Gulf Arab states. In one of their most  violent attacks, Abu Nidal's guerrillas killed 16 people at the Rome and Vienna  airports in 1985.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Yana Mirontseva: "Creation of Joint-Stock Company </F> Envisaged for Deposit Development: Controversy Over Sukhoy Log  Deposit"]    [Text] The controversy surrounding the Sukhoy Log  gold deposit in Irkutsk Oblast has been going on for almost two  years. By most modest estimates, at least six participants have  been involved in it: the city of Bodaybo administration, the  Irkutsk Oblast administration, the Lenzoloto AO [joint-stock  company], Roskomdragmet [Russian Federation Committee on  Precious Metals and Precious Stones], Roskomnedr [Russian  Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral  Resources], and the Australian company Star Technology System.  Nevertheless, there is hope that one of the largest gold  deposits in the world will be under development soon: Lenzoloto  AO General Director Valentin Avlov proposed to set up a  privately held joint-stock company especially for the  development of Sukhoy Log. During the general director's visit  to Moscow, which he completed yesterday, he succeeded in  obtaining preliminary approval from federal authorities for the  creation of the joint-stock company.    Sukhoy Log is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in  the world (estimated reserves--1,000 tonnes). It is located in  the vicinity of the city of Bodaybo in Irkutsk Oblast.    Let us recall the history of the conflict: The conversion of  Lenzoloto PO [industrial association] into Lenzoloto AO  proceeded in keeping with the government decision dated 9 April  1992. In the text of the document things were not made clear  regarding the participation of foreign capital, as well as  Lenzoloto AO's succession rights to "use of land and other  natural resources," which are in conflict with legislative acts  adopted later--in particular, the law on mineral resources.  Therefore, Roskomnedr does not recognize as legitimate  Lenzoloto's license to develop the Sukhoy Log deposit. All  materials on the subject were recently submitted for  consideration to the Ministry of Justice. If the ministry finds  Lenzoloto's license illegitimate, the deposit will be put up for  bid.    Another violation was committed in signing the agreement in  keeping with which the Australian company will begin financing  of development after geological information on Sukhoy Log  deposit is declassified. Last week a state commission of the  presidential administration's control administration worked in  Bodaybo. As the commission's head, control administration  department chief Aleksandr Lapenkov, put it, "removing the  'secret' designation is a very serious matter, and it is unclear  who will take responsibility for it, since distribution of this  information may influence the world price of gold and thus  damage Russian interests in this market." Because of this,  Lenzoloto AO cannot get money from its foreign founder.  According to information in KOMMERSANT's possession, on 15  December 1993 at a conference in Yegor Gaydar's office a  decision was made to remove the "secret" designation; however,  at this point there is no official confirmation of this.    According to preliminary information, the presidential  administration commission and the Irkutsk Oblast administration  are inclined to accept the compromise solution proposed by  Lenzoloto AO General Director Valentin Avlov. Which is the  following: Since the conversion of Lenzoloto PO into Lenzoloto  AO has already taken place, let it continue to operate. To  develop the Sukhoy Log deposit, a new privately held AO will be  created with the participation of Lenzoloto AO, Minatom  [Ministry of Atomic Energy], the Irkutsk Oblast administration,  and other interested enterprises. This proposal was also  accepted by top officials in Roskomdragmet, Roskomnedr, and the  State Committee for Administration of State Property, with whom  Mr. Avlov conducted negotiations during his visit to Moscow.  This raises hopes that the conflict will be resolved very soon.</p>

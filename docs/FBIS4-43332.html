			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Donald Macintyre and Colin Brown: "Tories Demand </F> Tax Cut Lifeline"]    [Text] John Major yesterday held out the prospect of a  wide-ranging Cabinet reshufffle next month as ministerial  pressure mounted on him to bring forward tax cuts in the wake of  the Tories' worst electoral performance this century.    The Prime Minister confronted his critics with a warning  that  he stood ready to "beat" any challenge to his leadership and  that he would "stick to" existing policies despite a European  election defeat which left the Tories with just 27.8 per cent of  the popular vote.    Mr Major, who confirmed yesterday that there would be a  reshuffle "not this week, not next week, but not never," has  told close colleagues that it will be more than "mere tinkering"  -- implying the dismissal as well as the transfer of some  Cabinet ministers.    His firm declaration that he intended to fight the next  general election as party leader, and on existing policies, came  amid signs of an imminent and intense debate within the party  over the desirability of early tax cuts to win back the support  of defecting voters. Some ministers are expected to press for  the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, to reconsider the second-stage  increase in VAT on domestic fuel to 17.5 per cent next April,  partly on the grounds that the gathering recovery will make the  2bn pounds revenue gain from the rise less necessary.    In a marked departure of style, Mr Major chose to give his  first public reaction to the Tories' drubbing in the European  Parliament elections in the garden at No. 10 Downing Street at  what he said would be the first of a series of ad hoc and  on-the-record press conferences for political reporters.    His move came as a jubilant Labour Party celebrated gains in  Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Hertfordshire and Kent which Jack  Cunningham, Labour's shadow Foreign Secretary, said were a  "watershed." He added: "Labour has won in areas where we  haven't been successful since the 1960s and in some cases even  farther back than that."    After clear hints of pre-general election tax cuts from Sir  Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, following last week's  by-election defeats, Mr Major reaffirmed he would "rather let  people decide for themselves how to spend their money than we  should decide on their behalf."    But he was guarded on the timing, adding: "If and when it is  prudent to cut taxes in the future, our instinct will be to cut  them." He was echoed last night on Channel 4 News by Mr Clarke,  who said: "Taxation will come down when we can afford to lower  taxation."    But in the most significant reaction to the election results  from the right wing of the Cabinet, John Redwood, Secretary of  State for Wales, acknowledged that Labour had had a "good night"  and that its policy of criticising the Government had "paid off  in the short term."    Mr Redwood added: "The Government needs to listen. People  want a continuing recovery, which we intend to deliver and they  want lower taxes which only the Conservatives wish to deliver  when circumstances allow."    Although Mr Redwood's reaction scrupulously conformed with  the letter of government policy, it will strike a chord with  senior backbenchers such as Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922  Committee, who also stressed the importance of tax cuts, adding:  "Let me just make this absolutely clear. John Major is our  Prime Minister and he will remain so."    Asked if he foresaw a leadership challenge, Mr Major said:  "I am still here. We have a mechanism if people wish to  challenge in the autumn -- that's a matter for them. I don't  expect one. I will be here waiting for it if there is one. I  will beat it and I will be here through the general election."    Some advisers are urging Mr Major to appoint Michael  Heseltine as chairman in the reshuffle -- a move designed to  raise party morale and make it more difficult for the President  of the Board of Trade to remain a potential contender for the  leadership.    The Liberal Democrats declared themselves highly satisfied  with winning their first two European seats -- in Somerset and  Cornwall-- and Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, in an  Independent article today, affirms that "the electorate remains  stubbornly three-dimensional."    The one setback to an otherwise resounding victory for  Labour  yesterday was the capture by the Scottish Nationalist Party  [SNP] of the seat for North East Scotland. The SNP secured a  record share of 33 per cent of the Scottish vote. And in  another significant result John Hume, the Social and Democratic  and Labour Party candidate, saw his vote rise in the three  member Northern Ireland seat from 136,000 to almost 162,000  almost overtaking Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party MEP  [member of European Parliament].</p>

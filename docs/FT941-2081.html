			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / New Italian government will face spending crisis Italy yesterday revealed that spending in 1994 was liable to overshoot the budget target by L14,800bn (Pounds 6bn). The budget shortfall comes during the closing stages of the election campaign and underlines the limited options open to the next government. It would make it extremely difficult for the media magnate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the conservative alliance and a possible prime minister in a coalition government, to carry out his promise to relaunch the economy, reduce taxes and provide more jobs. Instead the next government will probably be forced to introduce a corrective budget shortly after it takes office. The estimate is based on first quarter treasury receipts which were lower than expected as a result of the recession biting deeper. At the same time social security spending has grown faster and the savings envisaged in the reform of the civil service have been slow to materialise. The 1994 budget envisages holding the deficit at L151,000bn, equivalent to 8.7 per cent of GDP. On latest projections the deficit would expand to almost L160,000bn. One area where spending has grown rapidly is pensions, and officials have warned this week that Italy will have to accelerate its plans to raise the pension age to 65 years. If tough measures are not taken on pension and health spending, the total social security budget may exceed 14 per cent of GDP. Italy's state-dominated pension system is among the most generous in the EC and reforms introduced last year envisage only a gradual tightening of benefits and an extremely slow move from the current retirement ages. The pensions budget has been complicated by the recession with large-scale resort to early retirement to facilitate industrial restructuring.</p>

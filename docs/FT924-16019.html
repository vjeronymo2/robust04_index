			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low prices force closure of Argentine meat-packing plant A MEAT-packing plant in Argentina part-owned by Citicorp has closed its doors because export prices have fallen to the lowest in 18 months while operating costs keep rising, a bank executive said yesterday. 'The decision was taken because it does not make economic sense any more,' he said. 'International prices have fallen heavily and the instability in Brazil, our biggest competitor, has contributed strongly to the decline. They have virtually destroyed the market.' Citicorp bought a 9 per cent stake in the loss-making state-owned Santa Helena plant when it was privatised in March 1991. Although the bank, together with leading meat-packing group Huancayo, its local partner, paid only a token sum for Santa Helena, they reportedly invested working capital of about USDollars 20m into the plant. Brazil and Argentina are among the world's main exporters of processed beef products. Trade in frozen and chilled beef is strictly controlled, with the European Community, Argentina's main trading partner allowing imports only of premium quality cuts. While Argentine businessmen complain bitterly that Brazilian companies benefit from an undervalued currency and government support, Argentina is slowly pricing itself out of international markets. Citicorp recognised that inexorably rising costs in Argentina were undermining Santa Helena's profitability. Wages in Brazil averaged Dollars 50 a month, compared with Dollars 500 in Argentina, said the executive. Furthermore, although inflation has fallen to a modest 1 to 1.5 per cent a month, the exchange rate has remained fixed since March 1990, leading to an increasingly overvalued currency. According to official statistics, the real exchange rate fell by over half and prices fell 11 per cent in the five years to July 1992. Argentina's overall trade balance has been in the red nearly all this year, accumulating a deficit of Dollars 151.8m in the five months to May this year. As a result, about 60 per cent of Argentina's meat-packers that operated in the export market have now ceased operation. Only meat-packers that sell on the local market, where they can charge higher prices, are still in business. Huancayo and Citicorp decided to close Santa Helena after the plant's rising losses threatened to drive the group - which still turned a profit on the domestic market - into the red. However, the Santa Helena plant is only being mothballed pending an improvement in the international market. The Citicorp executive commented: 'Brazil cannot go on like this much longer and soon prices will settle down. The government could also help, by providing credit lines and tax rebates'.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: MEDIUM MISSES THE MESSAGE IN '50 YEARS OF TV'  </P> <P> As always, the very look of Walter Cronkite and the sound of his voice impart  the wisdom and credibility of a modern Moses leading his flock from a wasteland  of ignorance to a promised land of enlightenment.  </P> <P> "And that's the way it is," America's anchorman emeritus and icon of trust  assures us, like old times, near the end of Sunday night's "Fifty Years of  Television: A Golden Celebration" on CBS.  </P> <P> Increasingly, however, that's not the way it is.  </P> <P> For this, we can mostly thank TV's partiality not only for fact-twisting  docudramas, but also, now, for re-created contemporary news events that fuzz  truth and speculation.  </P> <P> In fact, "Fifty Years of Television" itself -- an entertainment special airing  at 9 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8 -- is not the way it is, or was. Not entirely,  anyway.  </P> <P> For one thing, it frames the medium narrowly and uncritically, omitting such  prominent recent footnotes, for example, as those controversial dramatic  re-creations favored by some syndicated tabloids and such network offerings as  "Saturday Night With Connie Chung" on CBS, and NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" and  "Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow."  </P> <P> Even when properly labeled, these truth-like simulations of actual events rank  among the most dangerous and destructive booby traps of modern TV, invariably  exploding in our faces and bringing blindness instead of clarity.  </P> <P> NBC News seemed to be acknowledging that when it announced this week that  simulation-laden "Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow" -- a news magazine that  aired three times last summer -- was being transfered to the network's  entertainment division. The news division earlier produced a fourth episode  that will air next week.  </P> <P> Said NBC News president Michael Gartner about re-creations: "We have determined  that the practice can result in confusion to the viewer. Our primary  responsibility at NBC News is to convey information clearly. If viewers are  confused, the solution is simple: abandon re-creations in news programming."  </P> <P> Uh . . . wait a minute. Confusion is not for NBC News, but it's acceptable for  NBC's entertainment division to confuse viewers? What else can you infer from  Gartner's statement?  </P> <P> Will re-creations on "Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow" be much less confusing  merely because the show is switching bosses and no longer will be fronted by  news anchors? Gartner is right about a news division's responsibility to  "convey information clearly." Yet doesn't an entertainment division have the  same obligation?  </P> <P> You wouldn't think so judging by the CBS entertainment division's "golden  celebration" of TV on Sunday.  </P> <P> Oh, it's entertaining all right, essentially a merry-go-round of archival clips  -- many of them quite wonderful -- bridged by commentary from TV stars ranging  from Cronkite to Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy, a fusion somehow epitomizing  TV's merging realms of news and entertainment.  </P> <P> The program is fun, among its treasures being excerpts from such ancient TV  productions as "Marty," with Rod Steiger as the story's self-deprecating pudgy  hero who isn't interested in making a fashion statement: "The blue suit, the  gray suit, I'm a fat little man."  </P> <P> But understand "Fifty Years of Television" for what it is, two euphemistic  hours that distort through narrowness. In a sense, the show is its own  re-creation, flowing from Cronkite's misleading assertion that TV "was  introduced at the New York World's Fair" in 1939, when in fact the British were  already regularly telecasting by that time.  </P> <P> Even more fundamentally, a program that celebrates TV by excluding much of TV  -- and while also leaving out the warts -- is a celebration of ignorance.  </P> <P> Despite Cronkite's presence, "Fifty Years of Television" sort of slips TV news  in through the back door. Much worse, it doesn't even mention sports programs,  daytime programs, children's programs or syndicated programs. Also missing,  incredibly, are not only local TV and public TV, but also the blazing  technologies of cable, VCRs and videos that have helped alter the TV landscape.  The cable omission is especially ironic because the show's executive producers,  John Moffitt and Pat Tourk Lee, have had their greatest recent success in  creating HBO's "Not Necessarily the News."  </P> <P> Now comes Not Necessarily Television.  </P> <P> Covering half a century of TV in two hours minus commercials just barely beats  trying to squeeze an 800-pound gorilla into a matchbox. Thus, "Fifty Years of  Television" offers hardly any reflection or interpretation, no Geiger counter  to locate the medium's common denominators, both positive and negative.  </P> <P> It's as selective as our own memories, a highlight reel of prime-time clips not  from TV's vast transparent ooze, but from mostly impact shows, making TV look  far more exhilarating -- and bold -- than it was or is.  </P> <P> We see Edward R. Murrow's famous denunciation of notorious Red-hunting  demagogue Joseph McCarthy, for example, but nothing about the cowardly networks  cooperating in censoring programs and going along with the black-listing of  allegedly Communist-leaning writers, producers, directors and actors.  </P> <P> "Productions have continued to address the vital issues of our times," Jane  Seymour says Sunday. Yes, such as those wall-to-wall rape stories that have  cluttered the November ratings sweeps.  </P> <P> As if hauling out a token black member of an otherwise all-white country club,  Seymour dutifully cites the classic "Roots" as an example of TV's greatness in  drama. Fair enough. Yet unmentioned is that the expected post-"Roots" flowering  of black dramatic opportunities never materialized.  </P> <P> Surely something more cosmic is demanded of a retrospective of American TV. No,  you can't get enough of Sid Caesar's genius, or of "I Love Lucy," Mary Tyler  Moore, Jack Benny, Ernie Kovacs and clips of those primitive early days, when,  in contrast to today, TV's talent was more advanced than its technology.  </P> <P> When you think of what TV has recently imprinted on our minds, however --  pictures of the eroding Berlin Wall, of 200,000 Czechs demonstrating for reform  in Prague, of terrified Salvadorans caught in a crossfire of bullets and  politics -- it's evident just how weak and soft Sunday's program is.  </P> <P> This is television, not a fat little man.  </P></p>

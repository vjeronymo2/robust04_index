The government initiative involves  three ministries: Internal Administration, Justice, and Finance.  The main objectives are to combat the entry of narcotics into  Portugal, prevent their distribution, and to make access to  consumers more difficult. Celso Paiva reports.    [Paiva] Three ministries stand united against drugs. All of  them are responsible for key sectors, that if coordinated can  achieve better results. From Internal Administration there is  the security forces, from Finance there is the Borders  Directorate-General, and from Justice there is the Judicial  Police [plain clothes police] and obviously the legal processes  necessary to carry out certain operations. With the protocol  signed today, the government is trying to coordinate the  prevention and fight against drugs. It is trying to allocate a  specific mission to each entity but without them stepping on  each others' toes. And together, with coordination, they will  be able to fight drug trafficking.    Firstly, it is necessary to fight the entry of drugs into  the  country, but it is also necessary to work from within: To  prevent distribution and to make access to consumers more  difficult. The document was signed by the directors general of  the Judicial Police, of the PSP [Public Security Police], of the  GNR [National Republican Guard], of the Borders  Directorate-General, and of the Planning Group for the Fight  Against Drugs. The three ministers were left to make the  speeches. Dias Loureiro [internal administration] was the first  to speak and began by revealing crime figures for 1993. A 2.5  to three percent increase, according to the minister this is a  very good figure, bearing in mind that in 1992 the increase  reached nine to 10 percent. Dias Loureiro was quoting figures  from the Attorney General's Office. The minister went on to add  that the 2.5 to three percent increase is mainly due to  drugs--after all, the main topic of this meeting of the Higher  Council for Internal Security.    Laborinho Lucio [justice] spoke next. He confirmed the crime  figures and said he was very pleased with the protocol just  signed.    [Announcer] The government is committed to the fight against  drugs. A difficult mission as the business does not stop  growing, you just have to look at the quantities of drugs being  seized. Teresa Xavier reports.    [Xavier] The police have stated that the amount of drugs  being seized in Portugal is rising. With regard to heroin, in  1993, 86 kilos were seized--62 percent up on 1992. As for  hashish, 48,000 kilos were seized in 1993--seven times the  amount seized in 1992. Cocaine is an exception, the figures show  a downward trend. The police said that in 1992, 1,900 kilos  were seized, while last year only 166 kilos were seized. The  amount of cocaine seized dropped by 91 percent. Most of the  drugs were seized at borders and airports.    [Begin Anselmo Louro recording, identified below] With  regard  to heroin, a small percentage was seized at the Vilar Formoso  border. A higher percentage was seized in private homes in the  interior of the country. As you know, heroin is destined for  internal consumption, and it has been difficult to seize it at  the borders. As for cocaine, most of it--about 80 percent or  more--was seized at airports. Hashish was seized in the  interior of the country, coming from ships, via the sea, and  from Morocco. [end recording]    [Xavier] That was Anselmo Louro from the Department for the  Investigation and Fight Against Drug Trafficking. The drugs  seized in Portugal come from, among other places, Germany, Peru,  and Morocco.    [Begin Louro recording] With regard to cocaine, most of it  comes from Peru--1,754 kilos. As for hashish, the largest  amount came from Morocco--8,862.3 kilos. As for heroin, 55  kilos were seized nationally, 30.235 kilos alone from  Holland--more than 50 percent. [end recording]    [Xavier] Heroin, cocaine, and hashish are the drugs most  consumed in our country, and the ones most sought after by the  police, who only manage to seize less than 10 percent of the  drugs that enter Portugal.</p>

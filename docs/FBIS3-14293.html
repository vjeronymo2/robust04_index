Agreement was reached on the resumption  of the Gaza-Jericho talks next Tuesday, and progress was made on  most of the issues on the agenda. The Cairo talks ended last  night and the Israeli delegation is now on its way home. It  will report to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at noon. Our  political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports from our Tel Aviv  studio:    A short time ago, an Israeli source very involved in the  Cairo talks, told us that a breakthrough or at last progress was  made in Egypt, which will permit the resumption of the  Gaza-Jericho talks next Tuesday. Progress was made on issues  which can be grouped under the term Palestinian security  problems, which surfaced due to the Hebron massacre, especially  on the establishment and deployment of a Palestinian police  force in Hebron. The force will be linked to the Palestinian  police force to be set up in Gaza and Jericho whose  establishment has already been agreed on. It will be associated  in some way with the Hebron Municipality, but will be  operationally subordinate to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces].  That was the main problem under discussion this past week and  once it has been resolved, the talks can now focus on the  resumption of the Gaza-Jericho talks. The police force will be  made up of several dozen Palestinian policemen, which as far as  is known, will be armed with revolvers for self-defense. They  will conduct joint patrols with the IDF and the foreign  observers Israel is prepared to have deployed in Hebron.    The prime minister said yesterday that the talks between  Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan will resume in late April,  unrelated to the talks with the PLO. We can therefore state  that the peace talks are making a great stride forward along all  tracks.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ennemix takes unusual route to stock market Ennemix, a small east Midlands and East Anglian aggregates company, is today expected to announce plans for one of the most unusual flotations for some time. The company, which is seeking to raise Pounds 8.7m for new acquisitions and to reduce borrowings, will offer shares in the form of a rights issue to existing stockholders of Anglesey, a publicly quoted North Wales mining group. Anglesey, which needs cash to pay for preliminary works, is expected to receive about Pounds 600,000 of the new money. Ennemix would take a 15 per cent stake in the mining company. Imperial Metal Company, of Canada, which previously has provided seed-corn finance for Anglesey, would not take up its rights but would still be left with 50 per cent of the company through a debt-for-equity swap. The scheme, which would resolve the problems of a small highly-geared aggregates company trying to float on its own in a difficult stock market and raise much needed cash for Anglesey, has been organised by Guinness Mahon. The development of Anglesey, which owns the mining rights to 10m-15m tonnes of zinc, lead and copper as well as some gold and silver deposits in Parys Mountain, north Anglesey, has been delayed by a fall in base metal prices. The company needs to raise more funds if it is to contin-ue. Anglesey, instead of issuing more paper, will be asking its own shareholders to put up this money in return for Ennemix shares. Nash Sells, a venture capital company which owns 22.5 per cent of Ennemix, plans to raise a further Pounds 1.3m by placing about half its stake with institutions. Of the total Pounds 10m to be raised, about half will be offered by way of rights to Anglesey shareholders with the remainder of the shares to be placed. The McLeod family, which currently owns 77 per cent of Ennemix, will not sell any of its shares - reducing its stake to about 25 per cent after the issue. About 62 per cent of Ennemix shares would be left with institutions or Anglesey shareholders. Ennemix, which owns seven sand and gravel quarries and 17 concrete plants in the east Midlands and East Anglia, is forecasting after-tax profits of Pounds 1.1m this year following last year's Pounds 1.64m loss.</p>

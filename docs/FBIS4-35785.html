			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 Jun (MENA) -- The Arab League General  Secretariat has strongly denounced Israel's military operations  against Lebanon, which killed and wounded many of the brotherly  Lebanese people.    In a statement released today, the Arab League stressed that  the continued Israeli buildup in southern Lebanon runs counter  to Israel's claims that it seeks a durable, just, and  comprehensive peace with the Arab countries and contravenes the  rules of international law and the international resolutions,  particularly Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's withdrawal  from south Lebanon and the establishment of Lebanon's  sovereignty over all its territories.    The statement stressed that Israel's continued hostile  practices against the Arab people in the occupied Arab  territories neither serve the peace process nor help build  confidence, at a time when the region's peoples need to devote  their attention to stability, security, and overall development.    The Arab League Secretariat called on the Security Council  and the United States and Russia, the cosponsors of the Middle  East peace process, to force Israel to immediately halt its  military operations against south Lebanon and to put all  possible pressure to compel Israel to implement Security Council  Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's unconditional  withdrawal from south Lebanon.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Autocrat who bolstered Bundesbank independence: Obituary - Karl Klasen MR Karl Klasen, the former Bundesbank president who died in Hamburg on Monday, a day before his 82nd birthday, was an autocratic Social Democrat who presided over the West German central bank during one of its most turbulent periods. He joined the Bundesbank when already wealthy after a career in private banking, spending 13 years on the board of the Deutsche Bank from 1957 onwards, the last three as joint chief executive. At the Bundesbank he took a lordly pride in leaving day-to-day affairs in the hands of subordinates. During his time in office between 1970 and 1977 he bolstered the central bank's reputation for independence. He developed a well-known disdain for colleagues who read the fine print of economic analyses. But through his natural sovereignty and a few well-chosen words, he could exert immediate control over a roomful of bankers. Mr Klasen's relationship with Mr Otmar Emminger, a peppery and egocentric economist who was his deputy, was cool to the point of frigidity. In contrast to Mr Klasen, Mr Emminger's attention to detail was minute, even extending to occasionally drawing some of the Bundesbank's monetary charts himself. Mr Klasen formed a close friendship with Mr Helmut Schmidt, the former chancellor, and Mr Karl Schiller, the legendary economics minister who helped bring Mr Klasen to the top Bundesbank job. He fell out with Mr Schiller during the crisis over the breakdown of the Bretton Woods currency system. Mr Klasen's refusal to follow Mr Schiller's suggestion of floating the D-Mark in 1972 led to Mr Schiller's resignation. Even though the government was later forced to bow to the inevitable and revalue the D-Mark, Mr Klasen's stature improved after Mr Schiller's resignation. In 1973 to 1975, in the wake of high pay settlements after the 1973 oil crisis, Mr Klasen surprised many by stepping firmly on the monetary brakes to curb inflation. He earned the reputation of provoking Germany's 1975 recession. But the lesson that the Bundesbank could act tough when the economic going was at its most difficult was not lost on the politicians.</p>

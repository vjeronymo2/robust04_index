			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / European Government Bonds: Spain suffers from volatile trading conditions THE Spanish bond market is reeling. In little more than two weeks the peseta has been devalued, effective exchange controls have been reintroduced and the Kingdom of Spain's foreign currency debt has been put under review for a possible downgrade. Last month's five per cent devaluation brought the peseta's parity in the ERM down from Pta65 to the D-Mark to Pta68.4, but the currency has stayed weak despite continued intervention by the Bank of Spain. The devaluation took place on September 18: five days later the Bank of Spain forced institutions purchasing foreign currency against the peseta, or buying pesetas, to make a 12-month interest-free deposit equivalent to the transaction with the Bank. The Bank said the measures were necessary because of the 'volatility, speculation and disorder' in the currency markets. 'A lot of confidence has been killed and there is a clear sentiment, lead by foreigners, to get out of Spain,' said Mr Alvaro Villacieros, chief of trading at James Capel's Madrid securities house. The 10-year bond yield rose by nearly a full point to 13.50. That same week, trading began on a Dollars 1.5bn issue that represented the Kingdom of Spain's first venture into the Eurodollar bond market. The Kingdom was forced to increase the yield by 10 basis points to 55 over US Treasury bonds. The effective reintroduction of exchange controls was an ill-fated decision that was taken as the lesser of three evils. The Bank of Spain took it in preference to taking the peseta out of the ERM and raising interest rates. At the weekend, Mr Carlos Solchaga, the economy minister, singled out the measures as a 'real problem' and said he hoped they would be lifted 'in the next few days' in order to restore investor confidence. He conceded that it would then 'take time for confidence to return'. What the markets sense is that, in all logic, any decision to lift exchange controls can only be accompanied by a decision to realign the peseta. Mr Solchaga hinted as much when he called for a 'disposition (among EMS members) to consider frankly whether the (ERM) grid is the right one'. The other greater evil that the exchange control measures sought to avoid - a rise in interest rates - is also back on the cards. Independently of whether the controls are lifted or not following a realignment, the market expects interest rates to climb. Interbank rates rose last week by 0.25 per cent to 15.5 per cent and an important auction of certificates of deposit, CBE's, today is expected to deliver higher rates. In this environment the decision last week by Moody's Investor Services to put Spain's AA2 credit rating under a review was characterised as 'not very opportune' by Mr Solchaga and bluntly called 'the final straw' by a broker in Madrid. Investors were by this stage near panic and the Madrid stock market's general index tumbled to its lowest level for six years. If the ERM, and the peseta within it, is saved through a realignment, or if some form of mechanism, such as the 'multilateral fund' that Mr Solchaga is currently canvassing, is introduced to restore depleted national reserves (Spain's remain robust at Dollars 59.6bn after spending a reported Dollars 13.5bn last month to defend the peseta) and if there can be an ordered pan-European retreat from high interest rates lead by Germany, then what will the bond market be looking at in Spain? The quick answer is the government's ability to implement a 1993 budget that it describes as the toughest in 20 years. The budget increases central government spending by only 3.7 per cent, a fall in real terms, and is likely to push up unemployment next year by 300,000 to beyond the three million level. The market will increasingly scrutinise Spain. The Spanish treasury needs to raise a total of Dollars 55bn before the end of the year, some Dollars 17bn of it in net new financing, in order to service the deficit.</p>

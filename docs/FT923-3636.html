			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Amec shares fall 10% on dive to Pounds 11m and halved interim pay-out AMEC yesterday became the third large UK construction company this week to cut its interim dividend. The group is halving the payment to 2p following a first half pre-tax profits fall of 52 per cent, from Pounds 21.9m to Pounds 10.6m. Turnover fell by 9 per cent to just over Pounds 1bn. Wimpey and Taylor Woodrow both announced dividend cuts earlier this week after incurring first half losses. Amec's share price, which had fallen by almost two thirds since May, tumbled a further 10 per cent yesterday to 60p as fully diluted earnings per share slipped to 2.7p (6p). The stock market, which had expected a dividend reduction was surprised by the announcement of an unexpected Pounds 12m loss on the company's Australian business. The losses included Pounds 5m of provisions against hotel, shopping and office developments in Sydney and Melbourne. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said conditions in the Australian market were difficult due to previous over-building in the commercial sector. The company had cut its Australian workforce by half, which led to labour disputes resulting in cost over-runs on some developments. It was also proving difficult to persuade customers, themselves under pressures from the collapse of property markets, to pay bills. Sir Alan said that the provisions were more than enough to cover any liability on the contracts and that the Australian business was expected to break even in the second half. He said that the reverse had offset a resilient performance in the UK, where profits were roughly similar to those in last year's first half which 'was an excellent performance in very difficult market conditions.' Mechanical and electrical engineering profits in the UK and Europe, helped by acquisitions and settlement of claims, jumped from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 22.1m. Against this, building and civil engineering profits, reflecting difficult conditions in UK commercial and industrial property markets, were more than halved from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 4.7m. Housebuilding and property development incurred a loss of Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.3m). The US, where the group has been cutting back its mechanical and electrical operations in depressed oil and gas markets in Louisiana, saw losses increase to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.3m). The company had a net cash outflow of Pounds 60m in the period reflecting timing of payments, seasonal factors and lower turnover which left it with net cash of Pounds 15m at the end of June. The group is continuing to cut costs where it can - the workforce is expected to be reduced by a further 10 per cent this year. COMMENT Amec's worldwide mix of businesses, with its weighting towards mechanical and electrical engineering, had been considered to be better suited than many of its rivals for riding out the construction recession. What these figures show is that no construction company is immune from the downturn. The complexity and higher value of m/e work means that when things go wrong it can be very expensive, as Australia shows. On the positive side, Amec has a stronger balance sheet and has shown a keen ability for generating cash from its businesses. With no sign of any recovery and fears that another Australia may be waiting to mug the group it is difficult to recommend anything more than a hold, notwithstanding its previously good cash management record. A pre-tax profit of Pounds 25m puts the shares on a fully diluted prospective p/e of 10.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Walker 'pretended dead friend carried out deals' Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent Walker property and leisure group, pretended that a dead friend had been responsible for transactions in an attempt to head off inquiries into the fraudulent inflation of his company's profits, it was alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Walker also tried to distance himself from transactions at the centre of the alleged fraud when first questioned by the Serious Fraud Office, Mr Peter Rook QC, prosecuting, told the court. The prosecution alleges that Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, fraudulently inflated the profits of both the Brent Walker group and its media division by Pounds 19.3m between 1984 and 1987. This was done by falsely claiming film rights had been sold when Brent Walker later secretly reimbursed the purchasers of the rights, so fraudulently funding its own profits, the prosecution claims. The former Brent Walker chairman denies four charges of theft involving a total of Pounds 17m, two charges of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify the company's accounts. Mr Aquilina denies one charge of theft, three of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify accounts. Mr Rook said that after press articles questioned the validity of some of the transactions in which rights were sold to Universal Talent Management (UTM) Mr Walker told his auditors that these had been carried out by Mr John Love, a business associate. In fact, Mr Love, who had looked after the administration of a Bahamas-based trust for Mr Walker and his family, had died a few months earlier, Mr Rook said. 'It appears he had nothing to do with Universal but on the basis that dead men don't talk, it was easy to attribute UTM transactions to him,' he said. UTM was one of three apparent purchasers of the rights, the prosecution says. When questioned by the Serious Fraud Office about transactions concerning a second purchaser, a company called Alberta, Mr Walker sought to distance himself from any direct involvement in the deals, Mr Rook said. He told the SFO he knew nothing of a Pounds 4m loan from Brent Walker to Alberta or that his company had fully guaranteed it. However, Mr Rook showed the jury documents signed by Mr Walker which, he said, demonstrated that the loan had been guaranteed. The trial continues on Monday.</p>

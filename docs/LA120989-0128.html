			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> LOARA OVERCOMES PANIC TO BEAT MAGNOLIA  </P> <P> Loara High School hasn't played in the finals of a boys' basketball tournament  in more than two decades, so Saxon Coach Jerry Halpin wasn't too worried when  his team panicked in the third quarter Friday night.  </P> <P> But the Saxons survived a third-quarter rally by Magnolia High School and  escaped with a 69-52 victory in the championship game of the Garden Grove  Tournament. It was their first tournament title since the mid-1960s, Halpin  said.  </P> <P> Loara nearly let the game slip away after building a 37-18 lead with 5:04 left  in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Magnolia trimmed the deficit to 54-44 with 4:17 left in the fourth period, but  Tes Whitlock and Kareem Collins each scored four points in a 15-8 streak that  sealed the victory.  </P> <P> "We fell apart," said Loara center Joey Gaudio, who finished with 17 points.  "We thought we had it won in the third quarter and we let up."  </P> <P> Still, Halpin wasn't too worried.  </P> <P> "I think our semifinal game with Western on Wednesday night took a lot out of  us," Halpin said. "But we've got this team playing hard and believing in  themselves. And in high school sports, believing in yourself goes a lot further  than talent."  </P> <P> Magnolia Coach Al Walin said his team never should have given Loara the big  lead. The Sentinels sank only five of their first 15 free-throws and had 14  turnovers.  </P> <P> "We had such a lousy start that we couldn't get organized," Walin said. "The  loss was our own fault. We didn't do things we wanted to do."  </P> <P> One of those things was stopping Whitlock, who finished with a game-high 18  points and was named the tournament's most valuable player. He had eight points  in the fourth quarter, when the Saxons pulled away.  </P> <P> "Tes knows when to rest and when to turn it on," Halpin said.  </P> <P> Robbie Hargis scored 13 points for Magnolia (3-2).  </P> <P> The Saxons improved to 4-0 under Halpin, their first-year coach. They won only  four games all last season.  </P> <P> "I'm really not surprised to be 4-0," Halpin said. "We were 12-6 during the  summer leagues, but I don't think it really sank in how good this team was  until we rallied from 19 down against Western in the semifinals."  </P> <P> It sank in a little further on Friday night.  </P> <P> In consolation games of the Garden Grove tournament:  </P> <P> Western 68, Buena Park 45 -- Sam Sabbara scored 35 points to lead the Pioneers  in the third-place game. Richard Harvey led Buena Park with 12.  </P> <P> Estancia 55, Laguna Hills 50 -- Augustin Heredia scored 19 points and Son Ly  added 12 to lead the Eagles in the fifth-place game.  </P> <P> Garden Grove 52, Bolsa Grande 51 -- Joe Aguirre's tip-in at the buzzer gave the  Argonauts (1-2) the victory in the seventh-place game. Mark Perry led Garden  Grove with 16 points and Aguirre added seven. Sherman Gorden led Bolsa Grande  (1-3) with 13 points.  </P></p>

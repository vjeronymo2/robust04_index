			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zhu Shengquan (2612 3932 0356), edited by Yang </F> Jian-xiu (2799 3005 0208): "Strengthen Macroeconomic Management  of Individually Run and Private Businesses"]    [Text] Today, now that individually run and private  businesses have developed to a certain stage, how are we to  improve and strengthen government macroeconomic management over  them so that they are gradually raised in scale, raised in  grade, and raised in level, and they gradually develop to become  productive businesses utilizing science and technology and  oriented to the outside. This is a question worthy of serious  exploration.  <H8>  I </H8>   The 14th party congress decided a policy requiring that we  encourage and develop individually run and private businesses  and relax restrictions in terms of their operational scale,  operational range, development proportion, and business targets  so that the development of individually run and private  businesses is further accelerated and they can play a positive  role in terms of raising overall economic volumes, increasing  fiscal revenue, and increasing employment channels. The problem  at present is that many localities have not yet formed truly  effective management methods, and this situation is not  conducive to the healthy development of individually run and  private businesses.    1. Seen from the angle of management targets, many  localities implement the policy of "ruling through inaction."  They generally do not include individually run and private  businesses in regional development plans, and even if they are  included, it is impossible to truly implement the plans. What  is the reason for this? First, they dare not manage these  enterprises. Many comrades are still afraid of "private" and  "capitalist," and they consider "private" and "capitalist" to be  the same thing. They think that creating conditions for the  development of individually run and private operations and  resolving their difficulties is intended to help private persons  make money and become wealthy, which is the same as developing  capitalism. Second, they consider that there is no need to  manage them. Some comrades say that individually run private  businesses come under the natural market economy, they are  entirely free to decide on their own operations, and they must  take responsibility for their own profits and losses. Thus,  there is no need to manage them. Third, they are unwilling to  manage them. Some localities believe that at present,  individually run and private businesses are still quite weak,  and, at present, the most important thing is to relax policies  and reduce "intervention"; otherwise, "as soon as they are  managed they will be strangled." Fourth, they are unable to  manage them. Many comrades hold that at present new situations  and new problems are emerging in an unbroken stream and it is  difficult to manage even state-owned and collective enterprises,  much less individually run and private businesses.    2. At present, the management structure is still in a quite  confused situation. On the one hand, in their development,  individually run and private businesses urgently need the  guidance of information, need to attract skilled personnel, and  need technological training, legal consultancy and other  services. However, there is no one to supply them with these  services. On the other hand, there are many departments which  issue instructions and orders to individually run and private  businesses and require them to pay levies. Thus, some  individual operators and private entrepreneurs have closed down  their businesses, some pay management fees to "foster" licenses  and await opportunities, some attach themselves to organs and  schools and don the "tag" of "township and small town  enterprises", "school-run enterprises", "welfare enterprises" of  "organic entities," and so on. Some simply operate without  licenses.    3. Seen from management measures, it is still the case that  mainly administrative management is used at present. A set of  macroeconomic legal and economic management methods to oversee  production and operation activities, exercise product quality  supervision, and supervise the levying of taxation in respect of  individually run and private enterprises has still not been  formed. Thus, first, overall legal guarantees are absent. So  far, there are only the "Provisional Regulations on Private  Enterprises" and there is a lack of legal restraints on actions  which violate the legitimate rights and interests of  individually run and private enterprises or which interfere with  their normal operational activities. Even if such activities  are detected, there is no law with which to punish them.  Individual merchants and operators of private businesses  generally feel a lack of security, and they are unwilling to  expand production. Second, a set of measures for the  comprehensive economic management of individually run and  private businesses has not yet been formed. While their  development is now being encouraged, support and guidance is  still far from sufficient, and even when the government does  have some support measures, the phenomenon whereby policies are  cut off and checked during implementation is very widespread.    4. Seen from the contents of management, three major  problems exist: First, there is a tendency to stress  "relaxation" and to "look lightly" on management. This is  mainly seen in the relaxation of policies in many regions, and,  in practical work, adopting a policy of "first relaxing and  subsequently guiding and first developing and later improving."  While this can, to a certain degree, mobilize the enthusiasm of  individual and private businessmen, it can also bring chaos to  economic order, spread improper and illegal practices, and  increases the difficulty of standardized management. Second,  "fines" are stressed and "education" is looked upon lightly.  Some departments, in facing illegal phenomena, only engage in  "stopping." They do not provide any "educational" measures in  terms of how to operate legally, they do not provide any  "guidance" measures in terms of which direction they should be  developing in, and they do not provide any "assistance" measures  in terms of helping them develop to higher levels. Third,  stress is placed on building fair market structures, but little  attention is paid to the coordinated fostering of market  systems.    The building of trade fair markets in various  places indeed plays a role whereby "the building of a market in  a place stimulates some industry, which invigorates the local  economy and brings prosperity to the people." However, in  comparison with trade fair markets, the various types of  production factor markets clearly are insufficiently developed  and, speaking in general, it is still difficult for individually  run and private enterprises to obtain skilled personnel,  technology, and raw materials through the market.    5. Seen from the management time sequence, in most cases  management is "passive management." It is often the case that  only when deviations and problems appear in individually run and  private businesses, such as structural imbalances, the  manufacture and sale of poor quality and fake goods, tax  avoidance or evasion, scams and deceptions, and other types of  illegal operational activities, and there is a need to  investigate and punish, is any attention given to such  businesses. Very rarely is there serious education and guidance  given to them beforehand.    6. Seen from the results of management, there are a number  of elements which need to be noted. First, the phenomenon of  uneven development and particularly uneven development between  regions is very serious. Some regions have even seen a downward  trend. Second, the structure is not optimal. There is only a  very small number of individually run and private enterprises  which engage in deep-level processing of local agricultural and  sideline products. Third, the scale is not large. Many  individually run and private enterprises are mum-and-pop shops  and factories or father-and-son operations, and very few of them  are large, modern, mechanized producers. Fourth, illegal  activities frequently occur and some individually run and  private enterprises evade tax and avoid tax, manufacture fake  and poor-quality products, engage in smuggling and dealing in  smuggled goods and the manufacture and sale of pornographic  books and videos, and so on.  <H8>  II </H8>   The government's macroeconomic management of individually  run  and private businesses should be carried out through planning,  coordination, service, guidance and education to help  individually run and private businesses achieve an increase in  scale, increase in grade, and increase in level. At the present  stage, we should place stress on grasping the following aspects:    1. We must further change concepts to be able to properly  deal with relationships in three respects. The first is the  relationship between developing individually run and private  businesses, and upholding the prime position of socialist public  ownership. In our country, a situation has been formed where  the public ownership economy occupies the prime position and  diverse economic components see concurrent development. Major  industries and businesses which affect the national economy and  the people's livelihood are controlled by the state, and the  appropriate development of individually run and private business  will not shake the prime position of the public ownership  economy. The second is the relationship between developing the  public ownership economy and developing individually run and  private businesses. Seen from the short term, after  individually run and private businesses see development, it is  inevitable that they will have a certain effect on the public  ownership economy. However, seen from the long term, they will  also force state-owned enterprises to change their operational  modes and operational mechanisms and will result in them  developing and achieving a higher level. Developing the public  ownership economy cannot be realized through restricting the  individually run and private economy. In the same way,  developing individually run and private businesses cannot be  realized by weakening the public-ownership economy. We must  rely on both these components so that through competition, they  will engage in mutual study and mutual borrowing, the strengths  of one will make up for the weaknesses of the other, and they  will see joint development. Third is the relationship between  the contribution to society made by individually run and private  businesses and the illegal activities which occur in their  operations. Seen overall, the vast majority of the individual  and private entrepreneurs are good, and they become wealthy  through hard work and operating within the law. Those who engage  in illegal activities constitute only a small minority. In  order to promote the development of individually run and private  businesses, governments at all levels should make overall plans  and provide support in various respects.    2. Improving the external environment and creating fine  conditions for production operations.    1. The public opinion environment. It is necessary through  newspapers, radio and television broadcasts to make widely known  the important role which individually run and private businesses  play in social development. Wide publicity should be given to  advanced model persons in such businesses so as to raise their  social status and allow those operators who act in accordance  with the law to engage in their production operations boldly and  self-assuredly.    2. The legal environment. It is necessary to further  perfect laws and regulations to clearly stipulate that the  legitimate rights and interests of individually run and private  businesses are protected and to specify responsibilities when  the law is violated. Local ruffians and hoodlums who seize the  assets of individually run and private businesses and interfere  in normal production operations must be punished in accordance  with the law.    3. The policy environment. At present, regions differ in  the degree of relaxation of their policies in respect of  individually run and private businesses. The coastal regions  are more relaxed than the hinterland regions and the developed  regions are more relaxed than the undeveloped regions.    In future, we must continue to relax restrictions. First,  we need to relax the operational range, and we should allow  individually run and private businesses to operate in all  industries and produce all products not restricted by state  policies. Second, we should relax development proportions, and  in accordance with the level of development of the productive  forces in particular areas, such businesses should be allowed to  develop as far as they can. There should not be any artificial  development proportions imposed. Third, restraints on scale  should be relaxed, and individually run and private businesses  should be encouraged to develop trans-regional and  trans-industry operations. They should also be allowed to  contract, lease, merge with, or purchase state-owned enterprises  and to run joint-fund cooperative enterprises. Fourth,  restraints in terms of credit and tax reductions should be  relaxed, and the tax burden of individually run and private  enterprises should be brought closer to that of publicly owned  enterprises. It might also be possible, in accordance with  state industrial policies, to allow them to enjoy various tax  reductions or tax remissions like state and collective  enterprises. Banks should include individually run and private  enterprises in their credit budgets and, if the operations of  enterprises are in accord with state industrial policies and  have good results, they should be given credit support.    4. The market environment. In accordance with the principle  that the one who invests is the one who obtains the benefits, we  should continue to encourage social investment in developing  various types of markets, expand the range of these markets, and  link them up with the national and international markets. It is  particularly important to develop various types of production  factor markets.    3. Strengthening management and education so that  enterprises raise their own quality. First, it is necessary to  strengthen the concept of law and strengthen the concept of  business ethics so that these businesses operate in accordance  with the law. Illegal activities by individually run and  private enterprises not only harm society, but are also  disadvantageous to the healthy development of such enterprises.  In response, we should, on the one hand, rely on the government  to strengthen education, and, on the other hand, rely on the law  to seriously investigate and punish violations. In respect of  the tax issue, in cases where tax exemption is appropriate,  enterprise should be exempted from tax, while in cases where tax  levying is appropriate, tax should be levied. We cannot blur  the distinction between these two options. Second, we need to  strengthen the market economy concept. Through mass  organizations such as industrial and commercial federations,  individual operators' associations, private business operators'  associations, and so on, education and guidance can be  strengthened, and these businesses can be assisted to speedily  establish market economy concepts which are in accord with  modern market competition. Third is raising the quality of  management. It is necessary to strengthen training in  management knowledge for individual operators and private  entrepreneurs. They should be encouraged to join some business  associations and societies to help them raise their management  level. Fourth is raising the quality of science, technology,  and culture. Relevant departments, while carrying out various  types of cultural training, must draw in and encourage the  participation of individual industrial and commercial operators  and private entrepreneurs.    4. Strengthening coordinated services so that these  enterprises develop in an orientation of productive, externally  oriented enterprises which make full use of science and  technology. First, it is necessary to sort out and reorganize  individually run and private businesses. When individual  industrial and commercial operators have achieved a certain  scale and have the conditions for registration and issuance of a  private enterprise license, they should be encouraged to change  their registration. In respect of those who operate without a  license, it is necessary to actively do good work to make it  convenient for them to obtain a license. If they do not then  seek a license, they should be firmly outlawed. In respect of  those private enterprises which are still attached to collective  economy units, it is necessary to clearly explain policies and  separate them from the collective economy in accordance with the  law so that they can travel a healthy road of development.  Second, it is necessary to optimize structures. This will  mainly involve information guidance and industrial policy  guidance to help them effect changes in four respects: First,  they should make the change to production enterprises, and,  particularly, to enterprises engaged in deep-level processing of  agricultural and sideline products and the manufacture of  farming tools and equipment and other industries which serve  agriculture so that they can travel a road where agriculture,  industry, and trade are combined. Second, they must change  towards becoming enterprises which make full use of science and  technology. That is, they must adopt modern advanced science  and technology, increase the scientific and technological  content of products, raise the product grade, and realize  prosperity through science and technology. Relevant government  departments must actively develop technological consultancy and  technological guidance. Third, they must change into  enterprises which achieve economies of scale. On the one hand,  they can be guided, on the basis of voluntary participation, to  organize cooperative organizations, while on the other hand they  can be guided to use their profits to expand reproduction and  expand the scale of production. Relevant government departments  must actively participate in feasibility studies and only if  projects are in accord with state industrial policies should  they be given support. Fourth, they should change into  externally oriented enterprises. Relevant government departments  must do well as "navigators" and support individually run and  private enterprises to enter international markets. Departments  should help enterprises to link up with foreign sales avenues,  act as a bridge in drawing in foreign funds, and do well in  consultancy work, such as investigating the funds situation of  foreign businesses and providing information on the economic  situation abroad. Those private enterprises with the conditions  should be encouraged to set up companies abroad and they should  be given autonomy in foreign trade.</p>

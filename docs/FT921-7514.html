			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Shell fails to cheer City with pay-out ROYAL Dutch/Shell group, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, disappointed the City yesterday when it increased its dividend by 4 per cent to 20.9p from 20.1p, just below the rate of inflation, after reporting a slight drop in profits for last year. The company's shares lost 15p to 440p as many traders compared the increase with British Petroleum's move to raise its dividend 4.7 per cent, given Shell's stronger cash position. Sir Peter Holmes, Shell's chairman said: 'Inevitably, if times are hard, the dividend may be shaved a bit, but our long-term objective is to keep up with inflation in real terms.' He stressed that the company's dividend had grown in real terms by 75 per cent over the last 10 years. Shell reported a 4 per cent drop in its profit for 1991 to Pounds 2.89bn on a replacement cost basis which strips out the effects of stockholding gains and losses. On an historical cost basis, profit dropped by 33 per cent to Pounds 2.4bn reflecting the fact that 1990 results were buoyed by stock gains. Sir Peter said 1991 had been a 'mediocre' year with a 'disappointing' fourth quarter. But he said he was not pessimistic for this year as he believed measures taken at Shell Oil, the company's US subsidiary, should lead to a gradual improvement in North American results. In addition, 'chemicals have probably started to bottom out and should start to improve this year'. Sir Peter said he thought oil prices would remain in the range of Dollars 15 to Dollars 22 a barrel for the rest of the year. The company's investments had all been tested against a 'challengingly low' oil price, he said. Mr Nick Antill, oil analyst at Hoare Govett was sanguine about Shell's prospects in spite of downgrading his profit forecast for this year to Pounds 2.45bn from Pounds 2.6bn on the basis of last year's results. 'Shell has kept its balance sheet intact and gives the impression of a company that is growing - on the operational side - through the recession,' he said. The company's refining and marketing division showed record profits after extremely high refining margins during the Gulf war lifted income for the full year. At the same time, crude oil production increased by 10 per cent to 2.1m barrels a day for the full year. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 22; Markets, Page 40</p>

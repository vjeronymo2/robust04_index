			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Chairman of French chemicals group stays MR JEAN-RENE Fourtou was yesterday reconfirmed as chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, the French state-owned chemicals group, for a third three-year term. The reappointment of Mr Fourtou, 52, a former management consultant, was expected. The government was pleased with his record of building up a profitable health care business to counterbalance the group's traditional dependence on basic chemicals. This strategy partly explains why Rhone-Poulenc was able to lift profits by 37.5 per cent in 1991, a good performance during a tough year for the industry. Mr Fourtou is among the 45 chairmen of state-owned companies whose mandates come up for government review in the next month or two. The government last month appointed Mr Louis Schweitzer as chairman of Renault, groomed for the job by his predecessor, Mr Raymond Levy. Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, yesterday looked certain to keep his job for a second term after being nominated by the government representative on his board.</p>

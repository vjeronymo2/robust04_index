			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Japan withdraws atrocity claim Mr Shigeto Nagano, Japan's justice minister, yesterday withdrew his claim that an infamous Japanese wartime atrocity never happened. But his unconvincing retraction prompted fresh calls for his resignation. Mr Nagano's claim, that the 1937 massacre of Nanking was a fabrication, has angered China, South Korea, and other neighbours, throwing a shadow over Japan's recent statements of regret for the war. The massacre of Nanking was an 'undeniable fact' said Mr Nagano yesterday, in a stilted apology, restricted to the wording of an earlier government statement. He even failed to impress his own coalition ally, Komeito, the clean government party. Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito's secretary general, said this 'does not release him from the need to take the responsibility as a cabinet minister.' The Social Democratic Party, Japan's second largest opposition group, said Mr Nagano's retraction did not end the matter and he should step down. China yesterday sought to calm the row when president Jiang Zemin told a visiting Japanese politician that he wanted to develop friendship with Tokyo 'while keeping in mind the past as an admonishment for the future,' said officials. However, the South Korean foreign ministry summoned the Japanese ambassador, to ask the Tokyo government to explain its position on Japan's war record. A war victims' association staged a demonstration outside Japan's Seoul embassy, in which they burned an effigy of Mr Nagano and demanded his resignation. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new prime minister, is understood to be furious over Mr Nagano's remarks and the diplomatic damage they have caused. He is expected to discuss with cabinet colleagues how to respond after his return from a European tour on Sunday. The row shows the difficulties Japan faces in trying to confront its wartime responsibilities, where it lags far behind Germany in voicing official regret for the past. This accounts for one of the largest cracks in Japan's national consensus. Reform-minded politicians on left and right, including the conservative Mr Hata, believe that heartfelt apologies for the war are a key to improving Japan's international credibility. The traditionalist right wing does not accept Chinese accounts of the war and believes former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa went too far, last year, in making the most explicit apologies to date.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol, BASAPRESS, 6/6/1994 -- Today, Tiraspol  Radio made public the letter written by Colonel Bergman [chief  of staff of Dniester forces] forwarded to the Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev. The letter was intercepted by the  Tiraspol Security. It states that "Dniester faces a crisis  situation affecting the economy, especially the industry, and  the state administration. The shortage of cash made the  revolted citizens take streets demanding the resignation of the  corrupt government and Russian aliens who are to be blamed of  people's impoverishment. A lot of employees of administrative  and juridical organs are resigning. The 14th Army is not able  to assure them with jobs. It can only morally support them.  Firm measures taken by us would allow us with minimum effort to  achieve the awaited settlement of the relations with Moldova.  Regardless of all my reports on the situation, General Lebed  [head of 14th Russian Army] refused my requests to take  measures. Obviously, this is a underestimation of the  situation." Bergman demands Lebed "the permission to take  control over the situation in Dniester." Sources from the  Security Committee say that "it is unlikely that the letter was  written by Bergman, as its form and style do not correspond to  the Chancellery norms of the Russian military units." However,  the same sources say that the signature belongs to Colonel  Bergman. Colonel Bergman denied that he wrote the letter. He  called this provocation instigated by the Dniester Security  Council. He pointed out that "such a letter could not be sent  to the Russian Defense Minister by avoiding the 14th Army  command."</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A SQUEEZE on stock index futures sent the March contract on the FT-SE 100 racing forward, pulling the underlying cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening level of 2,536 proved to be the low-point of the session, as the March future contract found sporadic buyers shortly after the opening, with dealers who had gone 'short' over the weekend trying to cover positions. That buying gathered momentum around 10am when, combined with orders from two leading houses, March was squeezed forward to touch 2,552. The tentative opening on Wall Street initially caused March to relinquish earlier gains, but its turnround led to a further squeeze in the dying minutes of the session, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reported to be particularly active. The March contract closed at 2,574, around 18 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash, which fell to around 4 for this account. Turnover remained poor, coming to 4,782 lots. The traded options market remained dull, with turnover a negligible 17,637. Volume in the FT-SE 100 index option reached 7,054 lots. Amstrad was the busiest stock option, trading 2,555 contracts.</p>

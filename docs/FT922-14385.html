			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iranian warplane episode leads to crude price rise WORLD OIL prices moved upwards yesterday following Iraq's claims that it had shot down an Iranian warplane over Iraqi airspace at the weekend. North Sea Brent oil for May delivery was up 30 cents at Dollars 18.85 at the close of trading. At one time during the day it had touched Dollars 19 a barrel. Middle East tensions have buoyed sentiment in the oil market where traders continue to be concerned at the ongoing disagreements between Libya and the United Nations about the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, as well as the impact of sanctions. Cuts in output by Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser extent, Iran, are beginning to be felt in the market. While these have not been great, they are enough to support the market in the short-term. Mr Joe Stanislaw, at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said: 'The irony is that the United Nations probably has more influence on the oil price right now than Opec'. The colder-than-usual spring weather in Europe and North America has pushed up heating oil prices which, in turn, has pulled crude oil prices in its wake. However, while traders say that sentiment in the market has become much firmer during the past few days, this could still be shortlived if the current Middle East disputes are resolved soon. Russian oil output is expected to fall to 397m tonnes in 1992, down 14 per cent from 1991, according to a government document released on Monday, reports Reuter from Moscow. Daily oil output had fallen by 20,000 tonnes between November 1991 and March 1992, the document said. It was circulated at a meeting of the Russian Congress of People's Deputies. March oil output totalled 34.7m tonnes, down from 36.2m in November. The document said that higher prices were essential to end the slump in output.</p>

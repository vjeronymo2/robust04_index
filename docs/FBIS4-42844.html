			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Franz Nickel: "Hardly Any War Without German </F> Arms"]    [Text] It was hardly of any news value when the 300  participants in the annual general meeting of the Goettingen  "Society for Threatened Peoples" strongly criticized German arms  exports to almost all crisis spots in the Third World, and to  dictators and governments that "violate human rights." After  all, the statement in the relevant resolution that "in the past  few years, there was hardly a genocide that did not also involve  fire from German arms..." is meanwhile regarded as a sure fact.    Even two years ago, the United Nations demonstrated that  with  arms exports totaling $2.53 billion in 1991, Germany, for the  first time, moved up to third place in the list of major arms  exporters behind the United States and Russia.    What is probably less well-known are the deals in connection  with the dissolution of the National People's Army (NVA) of the  GDR, and the "scrapping" of its sizable military technology.    After the last NVA flag was lowered on 2 October 1990,  experts from the Defense Ministry in Bonn and the Bundeswehr  Command East could hardly believe what they counted: They had  not expected the more than 2,200 combat tanks, 7,000 armored  vehicles, 2,400 artillery pieces, 400 combat aircraft, 57  warships, 296,000 tonnes of ammunition, and 1.2 million handguns.    However, other things came to light, too. After the Modrow  government stopped all arms sales on the part of the GDR, the  last GDR Government under De Maiziere decided to sell as much of  the sensitive heritage as possible. Defense and Disarmament  Minister Rainer Eppelmann, a former priest of the opposition and  conscientious objector, and now a deputy for the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] in the Bundestag, in the summer of 1990  issued Order 31/90 to "step up efforts...to sell military  materiel." This was done through "effective marketing." A few  days before German unity, in August/September 1990, Eppelmann's  ministry concluded 44 contracts with other countries or private  companies on the supply of NVA material.    According to insiders, the trick was to conclude these  armament sales still under the GDR Government so that the future  all-German Government could not be held responsible.    It was bad luck for Eppelmann that a short time after  unification he was charged with extensive shady NVA dealings,  resulting in billions [currency not specified] of damage to the  Bundeswehr through the squandering of national assets. Yet,  investigations came to nothing....    Independent of such dubious last-minute sales, after the  GDR's accession to the FRG, the question remained: What should  one do with the old burden inherited from the NVA? The  objective was to get rid of everything by 1995. Yet, the  Defense Ministry in Bonn expected that getting rid of the almost  300,000 tonnes of ammunition alone would take 10 years and cost  5,000 marks [DM] for each tonne to take apart and discard --  altogether DM1.5 billion. Moreover, the guarding and clearing  of the 3,315 buildings cost a lot of money each day.    Requests for second-hand NVA arms from more than 70 European  and oversees countries created the idea in the Defense Ministry  to turn "scrap" into money and political assets through generous  donations.    The Federal Government donated NVA equipment worth DM740  million to the United States for its Gulf war forces.  Air-to-air missiles, launcher vehicles, guided missiles, motor  vehicles, and ammunition went to Israel. Turkey received German  tanks, artillery pieces, and aircraft free of charge.    Uruguay's fleet bought five minesweepers from the NVA  heritage and two barges for DM3.1 million. The U.S. Navy picked  up, among other things, the Hiddensee of the Tarantul rocket  fast patrol boats. The Belgian BEIJ-MA group took the Dessau,  Tangerhuette, Genthin, and Rosslau minesweepers. The Indonesian  Navy bought 39 warships from GDR stocks at a price of $1.1  billion. The United Nations received L60-type trucks. A total  of 475 water transporters went to Uruguay and Ecuador in  humanitarian aid, 751 trucks were sold to Russia and Ukraine,  pontoon vehicles to Greece, ammunition to Finland and Greece.  In eastern Germany itself, all kinds of motor vehicles,  multicars, fork trucks, tank trucks, snowplows, cranes, field  bakeries, fire trucks, and emergency power generators from the  enormous stocks are being sold to private persons.    How much money has been made or what infringements against  the arms export laws there were remains an open question.    Exports of NVA material to Turkey has become a permanent  political scandal.    Apart from Bonn's arms exports to Turkey, which have caused  a  great deal of controversy for decades, according to official  information from the Federal Defense Ministry, the following has  been supplied to the Bosporus since April 1994 from the stocks  of the former GDR Army: 300 BTR-60 PB armored personnel  carriers; 4,996 RPG 7 bazookas, including 197,130 grenades; 222  heavy machine guns; 2,491 light machine guns; 303,934  Kalashnikov submachine guns; 20 KMT 5 mine detectors; 500,000  steel helmets; and hundreds of millions of rounds of various  ammunition -- altogether worth $1.6 billion.    For two years, human rights organizations, former NVA  officers, and journalists have documented in letter and picture  that such arms from GDR stocks have been used to suppress the  Kurds. This is why the Federal Government put a temporary halt  to arms supplies in early April. Yet already in May it was said  that the accusations that German military technology would be  used against the Kurds have "not proved sound." Exports have  resumed. Last week, Ankara reported officially that 1,168  Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) guerrilla fighters had been  killed since April....</p>

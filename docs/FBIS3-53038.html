Only 43 members of the house supported the  motion, 57 opposed it, and two abstained. The debate centered  around the statement by Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur, who  said the current peace negotiations could lead to the  establishment of a Palestinian state. Foreign Minister Peres  said the government rejects the establishment of such a state  because it opposes the presence of any foreign army west of the  Jordan River. [passage omitted]    In presenting the no-confidence motion, Tzomet Knesset  Member  [MK] Gonen Segev said the opposition would silence itself if the  Labor party went back to the people with a new platform. In the  meantime, MK Segev accused the government of violating the  current Labor platform of opposing a Palestinian state and in  favor of holding on to the Jordan Valley. [passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres responded to the  no-confidence  motion denying any deviation from the Labor party platform. He  said the government is not discussing a Palestinian state in the  current negotiations, only autonomy for the Palestinians, as  stated in the party platform. [passage omitted]</p>

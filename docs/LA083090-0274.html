			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OBSESSION;  </P> <P> FOR YEARS, SI FRUMKIN IRKED THE JEWISH ESTABLISHMENT WITH HIS CRUSADE TO AID  SOVIET JEWS. NOW HIS CAUSE IS IN THE MAINSTREAM.  </P> <P> Head down, Si Frumkin stood quietly as he was introduced to the group of about  35 affluent mainstream Jews. Although he was, for decades, one of the most  relentless and troublesome voices speaking out on behalf of Soviet Jews, few in  the room had heard of him.  </P> <P> Frumkin mock-winced in embarrassment as the introduction was ended: "Since he  retired in 1987, he has been devoting his full life to doing good deeds."  </P> <P> Uncharacteristically formal in a tie and tweed jacket, Frumkin greeted them  with his characteristic ironic humor, which often stops just short of sarcasm.  </P> <P> Congratulations, he told the group, for having such smart parents and  grandparents. They "got out." Otherwise they would not be sitting in a living  room in Beverly Hills, but in Minsk or Kiev, waiting for Operation Exodus to  get them out now.  </P> <P> It was an unusual setting for Frumkin, now 60, a man whose battle for Soviet  Jews has often set him outside of, or at odds with, local Jewish leadership. He  has said of himself and the Southern California Council for Soviet Jews that he  founded in 1968: "Frankly the Jewish Establishment doesn't like what we do."  Yet, here he was at a parlor meeting for Operation Exodus, the massive  fund-raising campaign to evacuate the Jews from the Soviet Union and help them  settle in Israel.  </P> <P> Parlor meetings and fund raising are not his style. He is more comfortable in  front of a street demonstration with a bullhorn or at an office machine  churning out copies of "his latest" for every member of Congress.  </P> <P> Over the decades he has moved radically from the left to the right, partly  because of his single-mindedness about his cause. But he has kept his objective  and has seen his issue become mainstream.  </P> <P> Frumkin, a Holocaust survivor, alluded only briefly to "the camps,"  concentrating instead on what happened to the survivors after liberation.  </P> <P> "The world didn't give a damn. We were an embarrassment. The world didn't know  what to do with us. It would have been better if we had died."  </P> <P> His rage was all the more forceful for its containment. It lent authority and  urgency to his remarks, his point being, "Now there is a place for Jews to go  -- Israel."  </P> <P> In the late '60s a message from Soviet Jews began reaching the West, "Why have  you forgotten us?" he said. "We remember now. After decades of fighting (for  their right to emigrate), now we're getting our wish." He did not describe that  fighting, the years of demonstrations at Soviet cultural events, of  confrontations with the guardians of bureaucratic procedures, of being a gadfly  to the discomfort and embarrassment of many in the Jewish Establishment. He has  often called himself obsessed and driven in those years, and readily says it  made him "a lousy father" to two sons, now grown, and broke up his marriage.  </P> <P> He did tell, however, of his recent trips to the Soviet Union which led him to  one conclusion: "They've got to get out of there."  </P> <P> Before the parlor meeting was over, those assembled would fill out pledge cards  amounting to more than $200,000, bringing Los Angeles that much closer to its  goal of $36 million, part of a national goal of $420 million and a worldwide  goal of $600 million.  </P> <P> One man, Eugene Davis, clearly impressed and moved by Frumkin, went up to him  at the end and said, "Si, you're a book that needs reading."  </P> <P> Si Frumkin lives in Studio City with his second wife, Kathy. He runs the  council out of a crammed study where the combination of office machines and  weightlifting equipment leaves little room to walk.  </P> <P> There is plenty to look at though: The walls are covered with photographs of  demonstrations and pictures of Frumkin with President Ronald Reagan, Jeane  Kirkpatrick, Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.),  television commentator Bruce Herschensohn), newsman George Putnam.  </P> <P> He has hung his family photos near the entry and history has given them a  haunting effect. Most were taken in Lithuania in the years leading up to the  Holocaust. Innocence, well-being, family ties and affection hang suspended in a  time without much strife. Mother and son, grandfather as a schoolboy in the  uniform of his military academy, a New Year's Eve party where the guests, his  parents among them, in white-tie-and-tails elegance have paused, Champagne  glasses in hand, for a semi-formal portrait.  </P> <P> One picture stands out: his parents leaning on a fence in the woods on a sunny  day, a little dog between them on the fence rail.  </P> <P> "That was Tommy, my terrier. The Germans took him away. They wanted him because  he was a purebred. It was just as well -- we couldn't feed him."  </P> <P> Before he became Prisoner 82191 of Dachau, he was born and started to grow up  in Kaunas as Simas Frumkinas. His was "a prominent family in an East European  town," Frumkin said. His father was an automobile and motorcycle dealer, and  when the Harley-Davidson salesman visited, he brought Si a present.  </P> <P> "I was the only kid in Lithuania with a Mickey Mouse toothbrush."  </P> <P> Affluent and assimilated, there was no shtetl life, no Yiddish, no visits to  the synagogue. Just a yearly Passover dinner.  </P> <P> To this day he is "quite irreligious" explaining it away a little lamely,  saying, "I never acquired the habit. I never learned the prayers. I never made  my bar mitzvah -- by then I was in the camps."  </P> <P> The good life ended in stages. When the Soviets took over Lithuania in 1940,  communism ended his father's business. In 1941 the Germans came, and the 40,000  Jews of Kaunas were herded into a ghetto surrounded by barbed wire. When the  ghetto was evacuated in 1944, there were about 7,000 surviving. The women were  deported to Poland, the men to Germany. His father died "of weakness" 20 days  before Dachau was liberated in 1945. Frumkin was 14.  </P> <P> Deciding against a return to the Soviet Union, where survivors were being  treated as collaborators, he joined the thousands wandering around Europe and  made his way through the chaos to Italy where he and his mother reunited.  </P> <P> "I didn't resent the fact nobody wanted us. It didn't occur to me I had that  right. Who knew from human rights? I didn't really even resent the Nazis. I was  scared of them, but I didn't question it. It was like being scared of an  earthquake."  </P> <P> Rather, he said, "I wanted to go to the movies and chew gum. More than anything  else I wanted to go to school and catch up on my education. I knew I was  ignorant."  </P> <P> He studied in Switzerland and England, emigrated briefly to Venezuela before  coming to New York in 1949. He graduated from New York University in 1953.  Years later, when he was married, living in Los Angeles and running the  Universal Drapery Co. out of a Skid Row building, he earned a master's degree  in history from Cal State Northridge at night.  </P> <P> Once the message from Soviet Jews reached him, "Why have you forgotten us,"  Frumkin's drapery company increasingly became a sideline. His grab for normalcy  seems to have come to a complete and permanent halt.  </P> <P> L.A. Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's stories about the early days of working with  Frumkin on behalf of Soviet Jewry kept him going for two hours late one  afternoon in his office at City Hall. If there is one story that sums up Si  Frumkin, however, he would have to choose the one about the toilet plunger.  </P> <P> A Soviet freighter came into Los Angeles Harbor in the early '70s, and  Yaroslavsky and Frumkin rented a motorboat and chugged out to the ship,  intending to paint "Let the Jews Go" on the side. But how to stay in place once  the engine was shut off? Frumkin solved the problem. They moored themselves to  the freighter with a toilet plunger.  </P> <P> "He's such a smart man," Yaroslavsky said, chuckling fondly. "He's so quick.  His talents are so interchangeable. He'll be translating Russian one minute,  fixing the refrigerator the next, figuring out the toilet plunger."  </P> <P> Mention "Soviet Jews" in 1968, Frumkin said recently, and the average American,  Jews included, would probably be puzzled, unaware that there were any Soviet  Jews.  </P> <P> Once they were on Frumkin's mind, however, he was not going to rest. The Jewish  Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles had a Commission on Soviet Jewry and  Frumkin went to volunteer. He heard nothing for six months, he said, then  learned a demonstration was planned during Passover in the Fairfax area.  </P> <P> Thinking "the more publicity the better," he said, Frumkin took it upon himself  to approach then-Councilman Tom Bradley, not going through channels. Bradley  declared Soviet Jewry Day. "Did I get in trouble!" Frumkin said. "They told me  I'd offended other councilmen."  </P> <P> It was a bad fit from the beginning.  </P> <P> "Si was always more activist than corporate," Yaroslavsky explained. They met  through the demonstration where Yaroslavsky, a UCLA student and leader of  California Students for Soviet Jewry, spoke on his recent trip to the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> Both men found the Jewish Establishment, as represented by the Federation, too  conservative, cautious and bureaucratic. Whatever their ideas, such as a  candlelight walk in Westwood for Hanukkah, they were always cautioned not to  rock the boat.  </P> <P> The activist split off from Federation, formed the Council, teamed up with the  student leader, and got going. Their modus operandi often bore the stamp of  Frumkin's prankish wit.  </P> <P> They hired a helicopter to fly over the Super Bowl with a banner: "Save Soviet  Jewry." When Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev visited President Richard Nixon at  San Clemente, they released 5,000 helium-filled balloons imprinted with "Let My  People Go." When the Bolshoi Ballet came, they distributed fake programs  outside the Shrine Auditorium which said: "Enjoy the show, but . . . "  </P> <P> They got accused of scare tactics, of intimidation in some of their boycott  threats, such as their efforts to stop travel agents from promoting trips to  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "We found out there were other nuts like us across the country," Frumkin said.  They teamed up to form the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews.  </P> <P> Gimmicks such as sending greeting cards to Soviet Jews and the  adopt-a-refusenik-family campaign were adopted across the country by  synagogues. "Virtually everything that was done emanated from Si's head,"  Yaroslavsky said.  </P> <P> "The problem (with the Jewish Establishment) was not fear of our actions'  effect on Jews in the Soviet Union. It was ego, turf and bureaucracy. We were  making news. How do you explain to your boss, if you're being paid $41,000 a  year in 1971 to do it, and there's this drapery salesman putting 10,000 people  in the street?"  </P> <P> Havi Scheindlin, who directed the Commission in the late '70s, recalled  recently, "I was told, 'Don't get involved with his group. They have a  different philosophy.' "  </P> <P> There was an ideological split, she said. Frumkin, for example, worked with  other dissident groups in the Soviet Union, rather than keeping Jews separate.  Frumkin says he was often at odds with Israel and its supporters, because his  Council insisted Jews should be allowed to emigrate wherever they wanted, not  forced to go to Israel.  </P> <P> Whatever the differences, Frumkin and Yaroslavsky describe them in the past  tense. In fact, Frumkin is now a member of the Commission's executive board.  </P> <P> "The organized Jewish community came late to the issue," Scheindlin said. "If  not for Si and Zev, it would never have happened to such a degree. By the end  of my tenure there, it had happened. We were an issue to be contended with."  </P> <P> By 1976, 72,000 Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union. Their cause was a  mainstream issue and Frumkin was burned out. He pulled back and the Council  became dormant until the Gorbachev years.  </P> <P> Frumkin is his own best enemy when it comes to slowing down. Having done well  in the drapery business, and owning two commercial buildings, he was able to  retire in 1987. "I never realized retirement could be such an Olympic event,"  he said dryly of his life now. He is driven, acknowledges he is full of  survivor's guilt and a sense that he owes. He is seemingly incapable of not  responding to the problem at hand.  </P> <P> Once the Soviet Jews started arriving here, he realized existing efforts to  help them adjust were inadequate. He was a founding member of the Assn. of  Soviet Jewish Emigres. There are lectures of the "how to write a resume and go  on an interview" genre, clothing and household goods giveaways, a network of  free medical care providers. Those who are established are urged to help the  newcomers.  </P> <P> "They came in very poor and very selfish," he told the group at the Operation  Exodus gathering. "I'm happy to say, some of them are starting to give back.  They're becoming mensches (responsible people) like the rest of us."  </P> <P> He speaks to students twice a week during the school year for the Simon  Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies, writes a weekly column for the B'nai  B'rith Messenger and translates it for Panorama, a Russian-language weekly  newspaper. His reactivated Council is sending books on Judaism and the history  of anti-Semitism to Soviet Jews by the thousands. He keeps up the pressure on  Soviet and American bureaucracies about visas. He does not stop.  </P> <P> The pictures of Frumkin with conservative politicians and right-wing  personalities are not the only indicator that the former Vietnam War protester  has hung a right.  </P> <P> His columns often wave the flag for America or Israel, and he comes down hard  on peaceniks, anti-interventionists, Palestinian sympathizers, would-be flag  burners, affirmative action advocates.  </P> <P> "As time goes by, I suppose I've gotten righter and righter. At one time, I was  on the board of Americans for Democratic Action. I have learned about the  Soviet bloc and the oppression taking place. I have come to learn that  communism and extreme socialism always hurts people . . .  </P> <P> "And I've come to see that left-wing believers are a much greater menace to  Jews than others. It's the left wing that raised anti-Semitism to the point  where it is almost acceptable if you call it anti-Zionism. 'Zionism is racism'  -- that's infamous."  </P> <P> He sees a double standard operating often, for example, holding Israel to a  higher standard than its neighbors, or making allowances for certain actions of  minorities. He rejects it out of hand, arguing with a stubborn logic that keeps  a narrow focus.  </P> <P> He can work himself into a fury quickly and come out with hard-nosed  statements.  </P> <P> Taking the wrongfulness and "absurdity of classifying human beings by race" as  a starting point, he took off on a tangent that included a scornful dismissal  of recent Los Angeles County reapportionment attempts to ensure more Latino  representation, and a question about why, if South Africa is so bad, do so many  black Africans from other countries try to get in?  </P> <P> "It's nonsense and it annoys the hell out of me," he said of quotas and an  affirmative action mentality, before moving on the Middle East.  </P> <P> "Israel is the only country in the world where Arabs can vote and sit in  Parliament," he said.  </P> <P> "So Jews bought a building in East Jerusalem and want to live there, in the  Arab quarter. Why not? There are Arabs living in the Jewish quarter and nobody  talks about that."  </P> <P> And then, the fury spent, he was back to being his own different drummer:  </P> <P> "Having said all this, it's entirely possible if I were an Arab on the West  Bank, I'd be out on the street throwing rocks. Once you believe you're  oppressed . . . "  </P> <P> At best, his stubbornness is idealistic, based on a lot of "shoulds."  </P> <P> "I am idealistic," he said smiling, calmed down to irony again. "I guess I'm  looking for fairness in an unfair world."  </P></p>

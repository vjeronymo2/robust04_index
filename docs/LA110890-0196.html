			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> ELECTION TILTS CITY BALANCE OF POWER  </P> <P> The election of two candidates supported by Councilman Robert A. Curtis has  tilted the balance of power in this South County city, and political observers  believe that the change may lead to a testy relationship with the city's sole  developer, the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> The new council members are Sharon Cody, the chairwoman of a citizens'  committee that opposed the failed effort to recall Curtis, and Robert Breton,  another Curtis ally. Susan Withrow, an administrative intern with the city of  Dana Point, also won a seat on the council.  </P> <P> Curtis, a prosecutor with the Riverside County district attorney's office, said  Wednesday that he was thrilled by the results and that some previous council  decisions, including the acquisition of a Mission Viejo Co. building for a  permanent civic center, may be reversed.  </P> <P> "The days of business as usual where the (Mission Viejo Co.) policies went  unquestioned are over," Curtis said. "The new leadership will have the courage  to stand up to the Mission Viejo Co. whenever necessary and wisdom to negotiate  with it whenever possible."  </P> <P> The Mission Viejo Co. was a major financial supporter of the campaign to recall  Curtis.  </P> <P> Curtis is a favorite to be elected mayor when the new council holds its first  meeting on Nov. 26. "If I am asked to take the job, I will accept and try to  lead the council into a new era of harmony and effectiveness," he said.  </P> <P> Wendy Wetzel, the company's director of corporate affairs, said she did not  think the election of Curtis' two allies would affect the developer.  </P> <P> "The residents have chosen and we're hoping to work with the new council,"  Wetzel said. "The candidates all pledged to be independent. I would hope that  they would independently look at each decision and work for the best." Mayor  Christian W. Keena and Councilwoman Victoria C. Jaffe did not seek reelection.  Councilman Norman P. Murray, 72, the only incumbent seeking reelection,  finished eighth in a field of 14 candidates.  </P> <P> Withrow said she is optimistic that the new council will work as a team. "By  virtue of new blood on the council we'll see a new style of business," she  said.DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Owen 'to reverse' Bosnia carve-up THERE will be no internationally-sanctioned ethnic carve-up of Bosnia-Hercegovina in any future constitutional settlement, the two international mediators for former Yugoslavia said yesterday, Frances Williams writes from Geneva. Lord Owen, the EC mediator, and Mr Cyrus Vance, for the UN, said in Geneva that territory seized by force would not be recognised. 'We do not accept this status quo as permanent and we intend to see that it is changed', Lord Owen said. Earlier, the UN human rights investigator for ex-Yugoslavia, Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said on his return from an 11-day visit to the region that the objectives of the 'ethnic cleansing' policy in Bosnia had already been achieved. But Lord Owen said the constitution for Bosnia-Hercegovina now being drafted would provide for the effects of 'ethnic cleansing' to be reversed.</p>

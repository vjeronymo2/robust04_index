			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Syncordia finds connections slow to make - British Telecom's network management unit is optimistic SYNCORDIA, British Telecom's Atlanta-based network management subsidiary, was launched 18 months ago with much fanfare and big ambitions. But it has been slow off the mark. The offshoot, centred on global telecommunications outsourcing - whereby companies spin off their computer systems management to an outside specialist - has announced only four customers so far. They are Amadeus, the European travel reservations consortium, BP Chemicals, IBM-Europe and Firmenich, the Swiss maker of fragrances and flavourings. However, Mr John Koehler, the company vice-president and general manager, says it has more than double that many letters of intent. But if Mr Koehler does not sign at least four of those by today he will not meet his publicly-stated goal of at least eight customers by the end of this month, the end of Syncordia's first full fiscal year. Nonetheless, he said, 'I'm happy with where we are. We're getting all the business we hoped to get and more.' BT, he added, is 'very pleased'. The company contends that because of a sales cycle of up to two years it is just on the cusp of reaping what it has sown since September 1991. One of the deals soon to be announced will be Readers Digest, whose contract for data transmission services is in the final testing phase. Syncordia says a lengthy sales pitch is required to overcome the many reservations companies have about farming out such a vital and sensitive part of their business. It takes time, says Mr Koehler, for 'people to understand how they fit together. You're really becoming part of their company.' Yet, even the upbeat Mr Koehler is unsure when Syncordia will operate in the black. He warily suggested it would not be impossible in two more years. At present, he calculates the annual revenues from Syncordia's four contracts at Dollars 32m to Dollars 40m. BT will not say how much it has invested, although analysts estimate the amount at roughly a couple of hundred million dollars. Despite the cost, BT's commitment to making Syncordia a leading player in what is estimated to become a Dollars 4bn to Dollars 6bn network outsourcing market by the mid-1990s is unflagging. Mr Bob Raggett, a BT spokesman, said: 'We are looking for quite considerable growth internationally, and Syncordia has to be a success. It's what the customers are asking for.' BT has, however, had to go it alone on Syncordia without the equity partnerships it originally envisaged. BT failed to entice Deutsche Telekom or Japan's NTT to join as 26 per cent equity partners in Syncordia. BT instead joined France Telecom to form their own outsourcing company, called Eunetcom. NTT, with a restructuring under way, has put talks with BT on ice. In the crucial and highly-competitive US market, a partnership or an alliance is deemed especially important for Syncordia's success. Mr Eugene Idenberg, executive vice-president of MCI Communications, said Syncordia 'will have a tough time without an American partner'. This notion has helped fuel rumours of BT's interest in buying a stake in EDS, the Dallas-based data processing company. But BT's Mr Raggett says 'We've been waltzing around the dance floor with practically everyone' in an attempt to find a US partner or acquisition. He added the effort was not just for Syncordia but for BT. Syncordia has so far created just 25 of its eventual target of 70 switching hubs in major cities, which means some customers might have to wait. Meanwhile, its staff has grown from just under 70 to 230 in Atlanta and a total of 350 worldwide. Outsourcing can include designing a voice, data and video communications system, purchasing and installing equipment around the world, providing and monitoring the global network and unified billing across currencies. But, so far, Syncordia's contracts tend to be for a slice of these services. For Amadeus, which was expanding into North America, Syncordia is providing a network for data transmission between the travel company's main data processing centre in Erding, Germany, and US locations through Atlanta. Given that Amadeus does not have personnel in North America, Syncordia provides staff, evaluates vendors, and selects and buys hardware and presents integrated billing. For IBM Europe, on the other hand, its contract is more limited. It manages only the physical private network linking 10 IBM locations in five European countries to its international backbone network. Yet if Syncordia's has not made the biggest splash into this relatively fresh market, BT seems undeterred. Mr Laurence Heyworth, an analyst with Robert Fleming Securities, says, given Syncordia's importance in BT's strategy to be the leading supplier of telecommunications services worldwide, 'as long as they feel that it's moving in the right direction, they'll back it to the hilt.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] The parliament of the self-styled Dniester Republic  intends to request the support of the deputies of the Russian  Federal Assembly, the Chisinau-based INFO-TASS news agency  reported today. We hope that our proposal referring to the  setting up of a confederation of republics in the Republic of  Moldova will be received with understanding, a special appeal  adopted by the most recent session of the Tiraspol Supreme  Soviet says. The Dniester deputies are complaining about the  fact that the Chisinau authorities do not wish to agree to  settle the conflict in a mutually acceptable way, INFO-TASS  mentions. The document also asks the Russian parliamentarians  to recognize, under such circumstances, the Moldovan Dniester  Republic as an independent and sovereign state that is a friend  of Russia.    Victor Puscasu, the deputy speaker of Moldova's Parliament,  assessed that the text of the aforementioned appeal expresses a  lack of willingness and the inability of the Tiraspol leaders to  settle the Dniester problem at the negotiating table. The  setting up of a federation or a confederation of states on the  territory of the republic of Moldova is totally out of the  question, Puscasu asserted. The Dniester problem can and has to  be settled by keeping Moldova united, by granting a special  juridical status to the rayons on the left bank of the Dniester  River, Puscasu emphasized adding that this position is also  supported by the UN, CSCE, and the leadership of Russia and  other states.    Today Mr. Slavomir Dabrova, the head of the CSCE mission to  the Republic Moldova, taking the floor during the meeting of the  Unified Control Commission that had been set up for the Dniester  security zone, presented the final decision of the recent Rome  meeting of the ministerial council of the CSCE member countries.  The document recommends that the Dniester region should be  granted a special juridical status, but remain a constituent  part of the Republic of Moldova. The Tiraspol members of the  unified commission reacted to Dabrova's statement with aloofness  saying that the decisions of the CSCE missions are not mandatory  for them, MOLDOVA-PRES news agency informs adding that by recent  orders of the so-called Dniester Ministry of Interior, the  representatives of the CSCE mission are prohibited to travel  freely on the territory of the Dniester Republic, including the  security zone instated on both banks of the Dniester River.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Councils cannot 'opt in' to review PLANS TO allow councils to 'opt in' to the review of local government in England have been vetoed by Mr John Major, Alison Smith writes. The proposal from Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to allow councils to vote in favour of inclusion in the review, was among suggestions for overhauling the reorganisation of local government. Today's Local Government Chronicle says the prime minister rejected the idea of making the review voluntary last week. An announcement on the revision is not now expected until September. Mr Major's main reason, it says, was that making later stages of the review optional would encourage Scottish and Welsh councils to try to avoid being reviewed. Legislation on Scottish and Welsh local government is due to come forward in November. The environment department wants to speed up the review so that it does not last the scheduled three more years.</p>

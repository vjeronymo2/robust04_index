			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS' BORGOGNO FORGOES SENIOR SEASON TO SIGN WITH GIANTS  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton second baseman Mate Borgogno signed with the San Francisco  Giants Tuesday and will report tonight to the team's Class-A affiliate in  Everett, Wash.  </P> <P> Also signing with major league teams Tuesday were Brent Bish, a former  two-sport standout at Esperanza High School, with the San Diego Padres and Troy  Paulsen, a former standout at La Quinta, with the Philadelphia Phillies.  </P> <P> Borgogno, an 18th-round draft pick in last week's free agent amateur draft,  wasn't happy with the team's original offer and had considered returning to  Fullerton for his senior season. But a meeting Tuesday morning with a team  official made his decision a lot easier.  </P> <P> "I don't want to talk money matters, but they doubled their original offer and  I'm happy with that," Borgogno said. "I loved playing at Fullerton, but once  they came up with the money, it wasn't a hard decision."  </P> <P> Borgogno, a left-handed hitter, was the Titans' second-leading hitter with a  .376 average, and he had 16 doubles, 44 runs scored and a team-high 54 runs  batted in.  </P> <P> He also was one of the main reasons Fullerton went from a poor defensive team  in 1989 to what Coach Larry Cochell called "the best infield I've had in 24  years." After committing 29 errors in 1989, most of them at shortstop, Borgogno  made only nine errors this season.  </P> <P> Bish, a junior shortstop at Cal State Los Angeles, was drafted in the 16th  round and will report Thursday to the Padres' Class-A team in Spokane, Wash.  </P> <P> Bish was The Times' player of the year in soccer and the starting third baseman  on the Esperanza baseball team that reached the 1987 Southern Section 5-A  championship game.  </P> <P> Bish becomes the third infielder from that Esperanza team to sign professional  contracts, joining Tom Redington (Atlanta Braves) and Doug Saunders (New York  Mets) in the minor leagues.  </P> <P> Paulsen, a second baseman for Stanford, will report to the Phillies'  instructional team in Clearwater, Fla. Paulsen was named to the all-tournament  team at the recent College World Series.  </P></p>

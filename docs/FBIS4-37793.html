			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Bomb Explosion in Mashhad </F> and Some Observations"]    [Text] As reported by foreign news agencies as well as by  the regime's propaganda networks, on Monday, 20 June, a strong  bomb exploded at the Emam Reza Shrine in Mashhad, killing or  wounding dozens of pilgrims and inflicting damage on the shrine.  After this incident, the regime's officials immediately blamed  one of the antiregime organizations for this explosion.    Naturally, assassinations, murders, and the planting of  bombs  are considered by each and every free-thinking person and  organization that respects human rights and the lives of human  beings to be terrorist acts, irrespective of who perpetrates  such terrorist acts and who the targets are. Therefore, the  Democratic Party of Kordestan condemns this act and considers it  to be extremely ugly and inappropriate.    The question that arises in this connection is: Who  perpetrated this terrorist act and what were its purposes and  objectives? In order to answer this question there are some  issues that can clarify the situation to a certain extent and to  show why this inappropriate and antihuman act was perpetrated.    First of all, if we try to track down the engineers and  perpetrators of this terrorist act and to search for the person  or direction whence such acts emanate -- and these are people  who are very skillful in perpetrating such acts -- we should,  first and foremost, point an accusatory finger at the clerical  regime. This is because this regime is basically a terrorist  and terrorist- nurturing regime and has perpetrated dozens and  even hundreds of terrorist acts at home and abroad against its  opponents, so much so that in the world today and in the eyes of  the world the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran and of the  clerical regime is tantamount to terror and terrorism; and it is  such characteristics and such acts that have made the regime a  topic of discussion by everyone.    But there is a specific reason why this criminal act was  perpetrated at the place it was and against the lives of  defenseless people, and a partial examination of this reason  will help us to solve the riddle. It is a definite and  indubitable fact and not a secret to anyone that the antipopular  clergymen are the enemies of all the Iranian people and that  this regime has no qualms about massacring or killing anyone in  this country. Moreover, the past has shown that in order to  achieve its objectives, the clerical regime resorts to any  incorrect act and to any antipopular plot and machination and  that it does not spare any crime in order to achieve its ends.    Thus, in the chaotic situation that the regime is facing at  home, and since it cannot answer the people, it is a simple  matter for it to engineer such plots, to perpetrate such  incidents so that it can distract the public from major problems  and focus the people's attention on other issues such as this,  to further pave the way for more suppression and pressure at a  time when the people's voice of protests and aversion has  intensified, and to thus impose a more stifling condition on the  people.    Meanwhile, we see that in order to show that, contrary to  what is said against it, the clerical regime--which is regarded  as a terrorist regime by the public because of its continued  terrorist acts and the violation of human rights and is  condemned by humanitarian circles and forums and by human rights  supporters at least twice a year--is itself the target of terror  and terrorism and that if it sometimes adopts suppressive  measures, its only objective is to fight terrorism and  subversion. Thus, it further paves the way for the suppression  and assassination of its opponents at home and abroad.    The time and place of the bomb explosion shows how the  regime  perpetrated this plan through careful planning so that it could  rouse the religious sentiments of simple-minded people. Thus,  the Emam Reza Shrine was chosen--and that, in the month of  Muharram and during the Tas'ua and 'Ashura ceremonies.  Otherwise, if it was any other person or persons apart from the  regime--that is, if the said person or persons believe in  terrorism and in planting bombs--there are better places and  better objectives that can inflict damage and blows on the  regime and its officials and not on ordinary and defenseless  people.    We do not rule out the fact that after the explosion of this  bomb by the regime's men and on orders of the regime's  intelligence and terrorist networks, a new wave of suppression  will be started by the regime and for this to be transformed  into a pretext for the compilation and implementation of a new  program of pressures on the people of our country in general and  on members of opposition organizations in particular. For this  purpose, each and every one of us should reveal such plots and  vile machinations by the regime and further inform the public of  the regime's plots and ploys as much as possible.</p>

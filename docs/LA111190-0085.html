			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAGIC KINGDOM'S PRICE HIKES DECRIED  </P> <P> In addition to concern regarding the Persian Gulf crisis, coupled with reckless  spending, less-than-honest politicians and myriads of assorted gripes and  complaints regarding government and spending, I was more than a little incensed  when I read "Disney Hikes Ticket Prices to Disneyland" (Oct. 30).  </P> <P> The price for one family of four to enter the park -- only -- is $100, let  alone the cost of food and beverage and parking.  </P> <P> What child does not want to go to Disneyland and enjoy the frivolity and  wonderland that it offers, and how many blue-collar workers can afford their  children this privilege at such a cost?  </P> <P> Their admitted net income for 1989 was $703.3 million. How can their executives  sleep nights? I am certain that Walt Disney, in his conception of this  wonderland, would want every child to experience his dream and not be reserved  for the privileged middle and upper class.  </P> <P> If the general public, particularly those with young children, try staying away  from the park for a while, perhaps those powers that be will realize this  price-gouging is unwarranted.  </P> <P> MARGARET K. BAUMSTEN, Laguna Hills  </P></p>

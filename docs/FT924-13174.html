			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Letter (7): Coal seen as victim of muddled economic thinking and lack of long-term strategy Sir, As the grand-daughter of a Northumbrian miner, I watched the painful transformation of a resilient and proud community. Long ago, I crept south to run a service sector company. In the past, it was possible (though not easy) to adapt. Now, what prospects do 30,000 grief-stricken miners have? The industrial loss will compound this country's infrastructure deficit. There is scant evidence to suggest that any government takes a sufficiently impartial and long-term view of the country's needs and hopes, to create the basis for sustainable economic and social health. We should have a published, national five year rolling plan which could accommodate free market principles without allowing a political free-for-all. An abiding aspect of the miners' tragedy may be that the shaky road behind is clear; yet the road ahead is not built, and who dare be confident that the supposed economics of this decision are not another blind alley? Christine Large, chairman, Epigram International, 52 Winterbrook Road, London SE24</p>

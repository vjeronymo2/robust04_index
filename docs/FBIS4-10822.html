			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina concluded a 48-hour visit to Argentina today  with a meeting during which he thanked participants for their  solidarity with Cuba and assured them that Cubans will resist  until they win.    Robaina stressed during his speech that Cuba's independence,  sovereignty, right to speak for itself, and other principles are  not negotiable.    When introducing Robaina, Monsignor Pedro Padura, bishop of  Rosario, reiterated the Argentine people's solidarity with Cuba  and encouraged the Cubans to continue "tending their garden of  hope."    Robaina responded by saying that his fellow countrymen know  how to tend that garden with "their sweat, their hearts, and  their very lives if necessary."    The event was held in a theater in downtown Buenos Aires and  attended by more than 1,000 people. It was organized by the  Solidarity With Cuba group made up of dozens of friendship  societies from various sectors.    The Cuban leader spoke at length of the current situation in  Cuba, denounced the U.S. blockade, and expressed his  appreciation for international solidarity with Cuba.    Regarding the anti-Cuban campaign focused on the alleged  violation of human rights on the island, Robaina strongly  rejected those accusations and said there are millions of people  in the world who have no rights at all.    There are millions of people, Robaina stressed, who cannot  read or write those two words (human rights).    Robaina met yesterday with Argentine President Carlos Saul  Menem during a meeting the two leaders described as positive.  Robaina also met with members of the Senate and Chamber of  Deputies foreign affairs committees, held two working sessions  with acting Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, and met with  Deputy Economy Minister Carlos Sanchez.    The distinguished guest also spoke of "investment and trade  with Cuba" at the headquarters of the Argentine Chamber of  Commerce and discussed Cuba's foreign policy with members of the  International Relations Council (CARI).    Robaina was declared "illustrious guest" by the Buenos Aires  Study Council [Consejo Deliberante de Buenos Aires] and met with  former President Raul Alfonsin, leader of the Radical Civic  Union, and members of the broad front coalition and the  socialist union.    Robaina also met with Cubans residing in Buenos Aires.</p>

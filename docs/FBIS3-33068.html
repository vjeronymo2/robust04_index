			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria at a dinner </F> hosted by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori at the Peruvian  Embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota; date not given; from the "Good  Morning Peru" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] Mr. President, under this new reality that we are  experiencing of trade opening, political reforms, modernization  of the state, and hemispheric integration, your presence  currently takes on a significant meaning. The similarities in  the problems that plague the Peruvian and the Colombian peoples  pave the way for understanding and comprehension between us. I  am referring to drug trafficking, terrorism, the extreme  guerrilla violence, and, of course, poverty, indigence, and lack  of opportunity that so harshly continue to hit some areas of our  two nations.    We Colombians are pleased with the great progress Peru has  achieved in recent times. The Peruvian economy that had reached  astronomical inflation rates barely a few years ago, now has an  inflation rate slightly higher than ours. Also, economic  growth, which for more than two decades had been stalled, in  1993 achieved a 6-percent growth rate.    Likewise, drug trafficking, violence, and terrorism have  strongly oppressed our peoples over the last decade. We are,  however, winning this struggle. One only has to mention Abimael  Guzman and Pablo Escobar's names to remind the most skeptical  that no criminal, no matter how powerful he may appear, can  indefinitely defy the will of a people who are not willing to  live in fear. These people have found justice in their  authorities through the required solutions. If the first one  [words indistinct] is serving his sentence, the second was  recently gunned down by our authorities.    This is why President Fujimori, I am certain that the  positive results achieved by your government in the economic as  well as political and social fields will allow Peru once again  to be reintegrated into the international financial community,  to advance with firms steps toward the encounter with progress.    From Peru arose the process that led to our independence, as  well as Bolivar's integration [words indistinct]. We are united  by the Amazon, the Andes, and the significant opportunities we  have before us on the Pacific side. We are also united by that  desire to [words indistinct] countries of a continent with a  millennium of traditions; based on these we project ourselves  toward the future. Few nations have [words indistinct] goals and  expectations.    This is a happy occasion for all Colombians. My people and  my government are honored by your presence, my president friend.  There is a great deal that unites us. We have a common past, a  common border, a [words indistinct], a cultural history, and a  common future that men of your stature help to form. We must be  conscious to share more in the future. We want our two nations  to strengthen their ties of friendship. We want our mutual  [words indistinct] to strengthen democracy and to give way to a  better future for our children.    I know you well enough, President Fujimori, to say that you  are a man of vision and of character, two of the vital [word  indistinct] of true leaders. Allow me tonight to offer a toast  to your country and to your personal well-being, with the hope  that both nations will achieve peace, equality, and social  justice which our peoples demand.

Despite speculation that other EC community states were sceptical about his credentials, the reason turns out to be nothing directly to do with Unwin. The pussy- footing was over who will succeed him at the end of his term six years hence. Certain smaller states, fed up with their sparse plum ration, wanted assurance that his successor will be one of their citizens.</p>

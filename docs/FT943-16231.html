			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Brazil's inflation over 50% a month Brazilian inflation accelerated sharply in June before the launch of the country's new currency, with the monthly rate of more than 50 per cent, technically placing Brazil in hyperinflation. Prices increased by 50.75 per cent in June, up from a monthly 45.1 per cent in May, according to the FIPE institute. However, many prices were raised ahead of the introduction of the new currency, the Real, last Friday. Inflation in the Real is expected to fall sharply this month, helped by parity to the US dollar. But the June increase will add to pressure on the government to force suppliers to reduce prices in the Real. The acceleration in inflation in the last few weeks has also fuelled claims by workers that their purchasing power was undermined before the new currency was introduced. Yesterday, petroleum workers' unions at the state-owned oil and gas company Petrobras claimed six of its refineries had been affected by strike action. The unions are demanding compensation for what they claim is a 50 per cent loss in buying power because of inflation and the new currency. Petrobras claimed that production was not affected at any of the six refineries. Uncertainty over the new currency also led to a near 2.5 per cent fall in early trading on the Sao Paulo stock market. Investors are concerned the government may move to block foreign investors tempted by Brazil's high interest rates.</p>

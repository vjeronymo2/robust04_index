			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RESIGNING FEDERAL JUDGE IRVING TO HELP FORMER LAW PARTNER'S SAN DIEGO FIRM  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, who is resigning from the San Diego  federal bench Jan. 1 over frustration with rigid sentencing guidelines,  announced Friday that he will become affiliated with his former law partner's  San Diego law firm.  </P> <P> Irving, 55, considered one of San Diego's finest trial lawyers before his  appointment to the federal bench in 1982, said he does not, however, plan to  return to the practice of law. He said he wants to help lawyers settle complex  civil lawsuits already in the court system, and to mediate disputes before they  blossom into suits.  </P> <P> Since announcing Sept. 26 that he will be the first judge in the nation to  leave the bench because of the guidelines, Irving, who also earned a reputation  as one of the most able federal judges in California, has been wooed by law  firms from around the state.  </P> <P> But he said Friday that he simply felt most comfortable with his former  partner, Douglas M. Butz, whose San Diego firm -- Butz, Lucas, Dunn &amp;  Enright -- specializes in the defense of civil lawsuits.  </P> <P> "It's like going home," Irving said in an interview Friday.  </P> <P> Later, he said, "I felt I'd be a lot more comfortable over there, in that  setting, that my comfort level will be much higher. I want to feel my way, to  see what I want to do. I know I want to mediate (disputes), but, beyond that, I  want to see what I want to do. This way there's no pressure."  </P> <P> Butz, who practiced law with Irving for several years before Irving took the  bench, said Irving will not be a partner in the law firm but will be associated  with it, with the title "of counsel." Irving will not be contributing earnings  to the firm, Butz said.  </P> <P> "There are so many reasons to want to be associated with someone like (Irving)  that have nothing to do with economics," Butz said. "He has been extremely  influential in my development as a lawyer and as a person, and I owe him so  much. It's just wonderful to have him come back."  </P> <P> From 1963 until 1982, Irving ran a private practice in San Diego, specializing  in legal and medical malpractice defense. Butz joined him in 1974, and they  worked together for eight years, until President Reagan appointed Irving to the  federal bench.  </P> <P> Irving, however, said in September that he was giving up a federal judge's  lifetime tenure because he considers the sentencing guidelines unfair,  especially the mandatory lengthy sentences the rules impose on first-time drug  offenders.  </P> <P> The rules, which took effect in November, 1987, use a point system -- based  mainly on the severity of the crime -- to determine sentencing. Neither a  criminal's background, role in the crime, past record, nor remorse can be used  to reduce the sentence below the minimum guideline.  </P> <P> Based upon the idea that prison is designed to punish, not rehabilitate, the  guidelines sharply reduce a judge's discretion in sentencing convicted  criminals.  </P> <P> Irving's impending departure already has made a significant impact at the San  Diego federal court.  </P> <P> Besieged by drug cases, many stemming from arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border,  the court already had been short one full-time judge for several months before  Irving's Sept. 26 announcement. Upon the notice of his resignation, he  immediately stopped taking new civil or criminal cases, so five full-time  judges have been doing the work of seven.  </P> <P> During his eight years on the bench, Irving has drawn a significant number of  high-profile cases.  </P> <P> Most recently, he presided over the trial last summer of Richard T. Silberman,  a one-time governor's aide and wealthy San Diego financier who was convicted of  one felony count and later pleaded guilty to another in connection with a  money-laundering scheme.  </P> <P> A San Diego native, Irving went to college and law school at the University of  Southern California. He is a graduate of Point Loma High School.  </P></p>

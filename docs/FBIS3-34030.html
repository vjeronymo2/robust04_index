The Jordan News Agency, PETRA, Monday reported that  the Ministry informed the secretary general of the party, Milhim  al-Tall, of its decision. The party's constituent assembly last  month authorised Mr. al-Tall along with members Ahmad  al-'Awayishah, Shahir al-Rawashidah, 'Ali al-Talafih and  Muhammad Khattab to apply for licensing. The party, which is  almost exclusively made up of former adherents to the Syrian  Ba'th Party, joins four other political parties on the pan-Arab  spectrum. These parties are the Jordan Socialist Ba'th Party,  the Progressive Arab Ba'th Party, the Jordan Arab Democratic  Party and the most recently licensed National Action Front  Party. The party's leader, Mr. al-Tall, ran for a Muslim seat  in Amman's Third District in the 1989 parliamentary elections.  During his campaign, he openly advocated Jordan's union with  Syria.</p>

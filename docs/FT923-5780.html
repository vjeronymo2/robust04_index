			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Markets pick up as worries over D-Mark ease: 1,000-point rise in Tokyo helps rebound EQUITIES and bonds recovered across Europe yesterday as worries diminished slightly about the effects of the strong D-Mark on the faltering European economy. The rebound in prices was especially marked in London, Paris and Frankfurt, and was helped by a big rise early yesterday on the Tokyo stock market, triggered by hopes of government action to buoy Japanese growth. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, sought to calm worries about currency strains with a statement in Paris that a realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism was 'not on the agenda'. He also hinted at further concerted central bank intervention to depress the D-Mark against the dollar. Such action might be expected to reduce pressures on the weaker currencies in the ERM, which have raised the possibility of rises in interest rates across the Continent. Amid nervous trading in most financial markets, Mr Sapin's remarks helped persuade more investors to switch funds into the dollar and out of the D-Mark. In London, the dollar closed below the day's highs at DM1.4105, up slightly under half a pfennig, but eased back slightly in New York where it finished at DM1.4095. Early today in Tokyo it was quoted at DM1.4057. But the firmer dollar failed to give more than a slight lift to the pound and the lira, the two weakest ERM currencies. Both slipped against the D-Mark to close in London near their ERM floors, stoking speculation that the UK and Italian governments might be forced to raise interest rates. Sterling at one point yesterday brushed DM2.80 before falling back in late trading to close in London, and later in New York, down  1/2 pfennig at DM2.79, less than 2 pfennigs above its DM2.778 limit. Against the dollar, sterling lost just under 1 cent in London, closing at Dollars 1.978. In late New York trading, it reached Dollars 1.9803, and early in Tokyo it was quoted at Dollars 1.9855. The lira hit a record low of 764.7 against the D-Mark, compared with its ERM floor of L765.4. In London, the FT-SE 100 index gained 26.6, closing at 2,311.6, while bourses in Paris and Frankfurt rose 1.5 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively. In Italy, however, investors continued to take a gloomy view, with shares setting a new low for the year. European bond markets were generally firm, although UK gilts lost up to half a point. The markets took heart from a 6.1 per cent rise in the Tokyo market, where the Nikkei average closed 1,013.35 higher at 17,555.0. It was the first 1,000-point gain since April. Measures thought likely to be adopted by the government to buoy the economy include an increase in public sector investment and aid to lift property prices. However, by mid-morning today share prices had drifted downwards after profit-taking and futures-linked selling, with the Nikkei shedding about 150 points. On Wall Street yesterday, stocks gained an early boost from gains on overseas markets but late program selling left the Dow Jones Industrial Average just 7.83 higher at 3,254.64. Even though the currency markets were steadier yesterday after the strains of earlier in the week, the central banks in Portugal and Spain were both forced to buy their currencies to stop them weakening against the D-Mark. After the strong rise in the German currency, it finished yesterday as the second strongest after the Belgian franc in the 10-currency grid, up from fourth strongest three weeks ago. The market strains were discussed in Paris yesterday by finance ministry officials from the main industrialised countries in a meeting which ends today.

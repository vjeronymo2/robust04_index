			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Mario Soares by unidentified </F> reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [FINANCIAL TIMES] Do you believe the European  Parliament should be given greater powers?    [Soares] Yes. We must work towards the creation of a  European constitution and true European citizenship. This will  help ensure that the people of Europe become aware that they  have the ability to influence their own future as Europeans.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Where should the European Union [EU] place  its greatest economic and social priorities during the next  three or four years?    [Soares] The priorities are to advance to economic and  monetary union with an effective European Monetary Institute.  We should not forget the European social charter. Progress in  the economic and political fields must be matched by advances in  social affairs.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Is there a danger of a two-speed Europe?    [Soares] This is unacceptable. I see Europe as a broad  space for solidarity between people, regions and countries. The  existing inequalities, aggravated by an unfavourable economic  climate, cannot be used as an pretext for creating a two-speed  Europe.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Should the EU give priority to deepening  integration among the 12 members or to widening it towards East  Europe?    [Soares] Both policies are equally necessary. There cannot  be true broadening without deepening. The EU should adopt  policies aimed at eventually admitting the countries of Central  and East Europe as full members.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Are you worried that German unification  and a shift in the EU's centre of gravity to the east and north  could harm Portugal's interests?    [Soares] There is an unquestionable possibility of this  happening. The EU should take steps to avoid this development.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Will assistance for poorer EU states  inevitably have to be cut after the expiry of the 1993-99  package?    [Soares] It is important, necessary, and urgent to supply  aid to Central and East Europe. But this should not be done at  the price of reducing aid to southern European countries, which  are full members of the European Union. Aid should continue for  as long as inequalities between countries justify it.    [FINANCIAL TIMES] Is European monetary union in 1999 still  practicable?    [Soares] Europe has lately been gripped by pessimism over  the potential of the European project. Some voices describe it  as utopian. I do not share this opinion. Only by pressing  forward towards full European union, with realism and  resolution, will we overcome our difficulties.</p>

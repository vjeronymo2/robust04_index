			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / The tigers face a challenge: Increasing regional competition is forcing Taiwan and South Korea to run faster to stay ahead The seemingly unstoppable rise of east Asia's 'tiger' economies is one of the industrial miracles of the late 20th century. Admired, envied and sometimes feared, their vigorous export-led growth is often held up as a model for poorer economies - and a stiff competitive challenge for wealthier ones. However, South Korea and Taiwan, the two biggest tigers, have reached an awkward age. Infant prodigies no longer, they are having to run harder to stay in the fast lane and to keep alive ambitions of joining the world's most advanced industrialised powers. Influential observers in both countries argue that they are increasingly handicapped by baggage from their past. Shedding it, they say, requires a radical redefinition of the role of the state in their economies and adherence to stronger, market-based disciplines. But although many businessmen and politicians pay lip-service to such calls for change, it is proving slow to materialise. 'Taiwan is still following tracks laid down in the 1950s and 1960s,' says Dr Kai Ma of the Chung Hua Institute, a respected economic research centre in Taipei. 'But the old rules no longer apply. Our whole economic and industrial strategy needs to be reviewed.' Dr Jwa Sung-hee of the Korea Development Institute, a leading economic research centre in Seoul, broadly agrees: 'South Korea must set its economic house in order this decade. In terms of liberalisation, we are falling behind. If we don't act decisively now, we will be bypassed by late-developing Asian economies like Malaysia.' So far, such concerns have not dented economic performance. Taiwan is heading for 6 per cent real growth this year, and Korea for more than 8 per cent. Both enjoy negligible unemployment, buoyant exports and robust capital investment, while their stock markets have recently hit new highs. However, new challenges are crowding in from all sides. The most pressing is fiercer regional competition. Countries such as China, Malaysia and Thailand, with wage levels as low as one-tenth of those in Korea and Taiwan, are undercutting them in older industries such as textiles and shoes - and may soon do so in newer ones like petrochemicals and steel. The result is a shift of more labour-intensive production out of the tigers. Taiwan has lost 12 per cent of its manufacturing jobs since the late 1980s, as more than 20,000 companies have moved productive assets estimated at Dollars 20bn to mainland China. The impact has been less dramatic in Korea, partly because, unlike Taiwan, it has avoided sharp currency appreciation. Nonetheless, regions such as Pusan, where traditional manufacturing industries are concentrated, have been hit hard. The impact of competition from the emerging economies has been partly offset, however, by the rapid growth of regional markets, which both countries have been quick to exploit. South-east Asia has overtaken the US to become Korea's biggest export market. Despite Taiwan's ban on direct transport links with China, its exports to the mainland are expected this year to match those to the US. But both countries are keenly aware that, to stay ahead of regional rivals, they need to raise their performance closer to levels in the industrialised world by shifting into activities with higher margins and value-added. Each brings to that task contrasting competitive strengths, reflecting distinctive industrial structures evolved over the past 30 years. Taiwan's economy is built on the spirited entrepreneurship of swarms of small manufacturing businesses, which account for most of its exports. Niche producers par excellence, they have prospered in sectors ruled by fashion or rapid technical change and have made Taiwan the world's largest exporter of bicycles and printed circuit boards for personal computers. If Taiwanese are east Asia's skilled artisans, Koreans are its forgemasters. The sprawling chaebol, or family-controlled conglomerates that dominate the Korean economy, have long sought advantage in large-scale heavy industry, gambling ever larger investments in giant mass-production facilities. This heroic risk-taking - long encouraged and underwritten by government support - has made Korea the world's biggest shipbuilder and its sixth largest producer of steel and cars. In all these sectors, further ambitious expansion is planned. Despite these differences, the two countries share some important weaknesses. Both depend heavily on imported technology and components, above all from Japan, with which they run large trade deficits. These amounted last year to 6.5 per cent of Taiwan's gross national product and 3.5 per cent of Korea's. Though Korean semiconductor makers have recently gained world market share in D-Ram memory chips, their achievement owes less to trail-blazing technology than to continued heavy investment in production capacity at a time when recession-bound Japanese producers were cutting back. Most Korean and Taiwanese companies also remain 'fast followers', not innovators, and lack strong international consumer franchises and marketing skills. Much of Taiwan's output is still sub-contract work for foreign companies, which distribute the products under their own names. Some Korean groups, such as Hyundai and Samsung, are trying to establish their brands overseas. But despite increased attention to quality, their products have yet to overcome a nondescript image as second-best alternatives to Japanese goods. As a consequence, the two countries' exports still sell heavily on price, leaving them highly sensitive to exchange rate movements. In Korea's case, the problem is compounded by the fact that many of its exports are in sectors where Japan is the acknowledged quality and technology leader. Similar doubts were, of course, expressed about Japan's prospects as recently as 15 years ago. However, there are important differences. Western manufacturers, which once provided soft targets for Japanese exporters, have grown tougher, as global competition has forced them to restructure, improve quality and innovate faster. Japan also controls access to its most sensitive industrial know-how more strictly than did the western countries whose technology it borrowed freely early in its development. Even though Korea's Samsung recently developed the world's first 256MB D-Ram, it must still rely on Japanese equipment to make the devices in volume. Faced with these obstacles, Korean and Taiwanese businessmen no longer talk as though emulating Japan's industrial ascendancy were just a matter of time. They increasingly accept that their economies can aspire to match its achievements only in selected areas. Some Korean exporters are also placing less emphasis on the US and western Europe, after losing market share there. They aim instead to concentrate in the next few years on less demanding third world markets. Many are also eyeing keenly the potential of North Korea's market, in the belief that the two countries may soon be unified. Longer term, the two tigers are pinning hopes to government-backed pushes in high-technology. Both countries are stepping up spending on research and development, investing in science parks and have ambitious plans to develop aerospace and biotechnology industries. Their most valuable assets are skilled labour forces and sizeable pools of western-educated engineers and scientists, many of whom they are now seeking to entice back home from jobs abroad. 'Engineers here are good but cost less than in Japan, so we can afford a bigger effort,' says Mr Winston Wang, head of Nan-Yang Plastics, one of Taiwan's largest manufacturers. The catch, however, is that other countries can play the same game. 'China has 20 or 30 times more engineers than Korea or Taiwan, and they are even cheaper,' says one western businessman. Taiwan also wants to develop its service sector and attract foreign capital and technology by becoming a centre for the regional operations of multinational companies. But it faces daunting handicaps. As well as its diplomatic isolation and lack of direct links with China, Taiwan has poor infrastructure, countless barriers to foreign investment and opaque rules of business conduct. Both tigers have surprised the world before by achieving apparently impossible feats. But while their efforts in the past have been geared to storming other countries' markets, the challenge today is increasingly to tackle structural weaknesses in their own. Historically, the tigers' overriding priorities have been to replace imports with home-produced goods and promote export-led growth. They have targeted 'strategic' industries and sheltered their home markets with extensive non-tariff barriers. Such protection has exacted a price by encouraging excess capacity and slowing industrial rationalisation. Korea, which imported 1,300 cars last year, has four - possibly soon to be five - volume producers, while in Taiwan 11 car assemblers serve only 20m people. Financial markets, meanwhile, have been constrained by tight exchange controls. Policies which directed credit to 'strategic' sectors on preferential terms have turned many commercial banks into extensions of industrial policy. In short, policies that have helped make the two countries champion exporters have insulated their economies from global market forces and stunted domestic demand. Lacking strong pressure from consumers at home to innovate and develop sophisticated marketing skills, their industries have followed, rather than led, international market trends. Gradually, though, the old order is starting to crumble. In both countries, authoritarian military regimes were replaced by democratic governments in recent years. This has loosened governments' grip on industrial policy and encouraged lobbies to press for economic and financial reform. The search for a bigger world role is also increasing pressures for change. Korea's impending application for membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the club for the world's leading economies, will expose its restrictions on capital flows to critical scrutiny. Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as an industrialised economy this year will require it to adopt a more liberal trade policy. But although both governments say they are committed to liberalisation, progress to date has proven halting and haphazard. The political drive from on high faces formidable obstruction from bureaucrats below, who fear deregulation will erode their power. In Taiwan, democracy is also blamed for slowing reform efforts. 'Democracy makes the economy more transparent and fair, but less efficient,' says Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of the government's Council for Economic Planning. 'In the days of martial law, we just did what was right for the country. It is much harder to push through decisions now.' Such interventionism has traditionally been even more pronounced in Korea, where the government seems even more reluctant to accept that genuine liberalisation would restrict its scope to intervene in the economy. Ministers' continuing inclination to meddle is exemplified by their strenuous behind-the-scenes efforts to prevent Samsung from starting car production and Hyundai from competing in steel, on the grounds that they would undermine the profitability of existing producers. 'Ministers and officials think they have to plan liberalisation in every detail,' says Dr Jwa of the Korea Development Institute, who acts as an adviser to the finance ministry. 'They have no clear concept of what a free market means.' All the evidence suggests that entrenching market-based reforms in Korea and Taiwan will take time. Perhaps the biggest barrier of all is the self-confidence bred by the giant economic strides they have made in the past 30 years. As Dr Young Soogil, an eminent Korean economist puts it: 'We think we are changing very rapidly because we only compare ourselves to our own past. What people don't realise is that the rest of the world is changing just as quickly, and we are in danger of being left out.'</p>

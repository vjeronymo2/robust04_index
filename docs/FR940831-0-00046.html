			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act do not provide for a deemed filing date of an application for benefits in the situation described by the commenter. These sections provide for a deemed filing date when: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* it is determined to the satisfaction of the Secretary that an individual failed as of any date to apply for [Social Security or SSI] benefits *&blank;*&blank;* by reason of misinformation provided to such individual by any officer or employee of the Social Security Administration relating to such individual's eligibility for [the respective] benefits *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> To be accorded a deemed filing date under these sections of the Act, an individual must demonstrate to our satisfaction that his or her failure to apply for benefits was due to misinformation which was communicated to that individual by an officer or employee of SSA and which concerned that individual's eligibility for the benefits. There must be a satisfactory showing that the failure to apply for benefits was the direct result of such misinformation. For this purpose, we require in &sect;&sect;404.633(c)(4) and 416.351(c)(4) that the misinformation must have been provided to an individual in response to his or her request to us for information about his or her eligibility for benefits, or the eligibility for benefits of another person, for which he or she was considering filing an application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : While expressing strong support for the proposed rules, one commenter urged that efforts be made by SSA to ensure that misinformation is not disseminated from SSA field offices or teleservice centers. Another commenter who supported the proposed rules recommended that SSA establish a monitoring process to identify sources of misinformation and implement strategies to correct any problems that are found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : We are committed to ensuring that we provide the highest quality service possible to the public in a courteous, timely and accurate manner. We already have put into place procedures for monitoring the service provided to the public and for addressing problems discovered in the delivery of service by our employees. As part of this effort, employees are instructed to answer all calls by identifying their Agency, followed by their full name or a title and last name for identification purposes. In addition, ongoing training is conducted, incoming telephone calls are randomly monitored, in-office interviews are monitored, and quality reviews are conducted. We believe that these measures to protect the public from being given misinformation will help to ensure that potential applicants are provided timely and accurate information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes to the Proposed Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;&sect;404.633(b)(2)(ii) and 416.351(b)(2)(ii) of the final rules, we are revising the phrase ``Before we may consider establishing'' which was used in the corresponding sections of the proposed rules. We are changing the phrase to ``Before we may establish'' to conform to the wording of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;404.633(b)(1)(ii) and 416.351(b)(1)(ii). This is simply an editorial change to make the provisions of the final rules consistent. The final rules also reflect a few other nonsubstantive changes to the proposed rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulations contain information collection requirements in &sect;&sect;404.633(f) and 416.351(f). We ordinarily would seek approval of these requirements from OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act. We are not doing so in this situation because we already have clearance from OMB to collect this information using form SSA&hyph;795 (OMB No. 0960&hyph;0045).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 15 minutes per response. This includes the time it will take to read the instructions, gather the necessary facts, and provide the information. We expect approximately 1,000 claimants or applicants to complete form SSA&hyph;795 annually, and estimate the total burden to be 250 hours. If you have any comments or suggestions on this estimate, write to the Social Security Administration, Attn: Reports Clearance Officer, 1&hyph;A&hyph;21 Operations Building, Baltimore, MD 21235, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (0960&hyph;0045), Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect only individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

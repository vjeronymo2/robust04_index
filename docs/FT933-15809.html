			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Bogey word for EC: Europe's magnetic pull often promotes Balkanisation Personally I have always felt attracted to the Balkans - influenced, perhaps, by memories of the exotic Balkan Sobranie cigarettes my mother used to smoke. But 'Balkanisation' has long been a bogey word for west Europeans. It is what happens when large empires fragment into small and squabbling mini-states: impotence, frustration, bloodshed - and all in a context of complexity with which world statesmen, not to mention their electorates, soon lose patience. Until two or three years ago it was a rather dated bogey word, referring mainly to things that happened in 1914 or earlier. Now, alas, it is all too topical. The break-up of Yugoslavia has been a classic case of Balkanisation right there in the Balkans. The rest of the Balkan peninsula - generally understood to include Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and the European part of Turkey - has come to be seen mainly as the wider theatre in which the Yugoslav tragedy is being played, and which might go up in flames if the fire on stage is not quickly put out, or at least contained. Needless to say, this state of affairs is not good for the region, even those parts of it that have so far been spared direct involvement. Their trade is distorted by sanctions and by the disruption of transit routes, notably the Danube. Insecurity discourages foreign investment. And political leaders, too, tend to discriminate against the region. They give priority to central Europe - which is closer and seems more hopeful - or to Russia, because of its manifest strategic importance and vast natural resources. With a mixture of guilt and exasperation, they regard the Balkans as an area where they must struggle to contain the war, but there is nothing else to be done. What western Europe most fears about the Balkans is that it might itself be contaminated and Balkanised. That is what happened, according to most west European diagnoses, in 1914; and if there is one thing the EC still feels entitled to congratulate itself on, in a Balkan context, it is that it has preserved its unity in the Yugoslav conflict, albeit a unity of near-paralysis, in spite of deep disagreements among its members. You can well imagine, therefore, that a meeting last weekend in Corfu on 'the European Community and the Balkans', co-sponsored by the Commission with two semi-official Greek think-tanks, and attended by people from all the Balkan states, old and new, was not an entirely smooth or joyous affair. The people from Brussels tried not to sound patronising, but almost always failed. The people from the Balkans avoided, to a surprising extent, rehearsing their local quarrels. Instead they joined in a united litany of complaint, accusing western Europe of everything from impeding capitalist development in the Balkans in the 19th century to discriminating against them in the kind of agreements it is prepared to negotiate in the late 20th. Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro, who as Portuguese foreign minister presided over the EC's abortive effort to prevent the war in Bosnia last year, was obliged to make an almost ritual act of contrition for that failure, while pleading that, if it were to do better in future, the EC must have 'a credible back-up capacity' - ie, a military one, provided by the Western European Union, or failing that by Nato. 'Who is to blame?' asked Nikolai Todorov from Sofia, voicing the almost unanimous anger of the region. 'Who should take the burden of responsibility for what is going on in the Balkans today? What are we up against - 'Balkanisation' or 'Europeanisation'?' Europeanisation of the Balkans? It sounds the opposite of what is happening, but I think I see what Mr Todorov means, or might mean. The EC congratulates itself on its powers of integration internally, and the 'magnetic attraction' it exercises on those around it. What has not been sufficiently noted is that this powerful magnetic pull tends to provoke the disintegration of other federal or co-operative structures in the neighbourhood. The EC may preach local and regional co-operation, but the audience is not interested. What the audience sees is a rich and powerful club, membership of which eclipses the value of any local association. Every nation or potential nation, if not every individual, starts to think how it could get in and how, above all, it must not be held back by association with less wholesome or less fortunate neighbours. This is not a purely Balkan phenomenon. Czechs have dissociated themselves from Slovaks, and are not happy even about being bracketed with Hungarians and Poles. The latter in turn insist that they are central Europeans, who must not be lumped together with others further east or south. Balts are determined to be in a different category from Ukrainians, and Ukrainians from Russians. But 'Balkan' is also a category no one wants to belong to, as a Slovene speaker in Corfu made tactlessly clear. 'Slovenia,' he said, 'will not take part in anything that pulls our country back, or puts it into a marginal group.' One cannot blame the EC for something that is the inevitable consequence of its success. But it could have done more to counteract it. Rather than deal with each country separately, on a 'hub and spoke' basis, it should have done what the US did in 1947 when 'Balkan' tendencies in western Europe were rampant. Get together, George Marshall told the Europeans: work out a joint programme, and we will help you. 'Any government which manoeuvres to block the recovery of other countries cannot expect help from us.' That is the tone the EC should have taken in its dealings with the Balkans, and with eastern Europe as a whole.</p>

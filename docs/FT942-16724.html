			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Metals foray benefits Middlesex Middlesex Holdings yesterday announced a return to the black at the operating level in its first results since entering the metals trading business in the former Soviet Union. The former Ferromet, which is chaired by Mr Phil Edmunds, the former Middlesex and England cricketer, achieved operating profits of Pounds 158,000 in 1993, against a loss of Pounds 1.1m, on sharply lower sales of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 7.24m). The absence of an exceptional Pounds 8.99m gain from disposals enjoyed in 1992 resulted in a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.85m to Pounds 155,000. Earnings per share fell from 2.71p to 0.03p and, as previously, there is no dividend. The operating profit was due to a Pounds 358,000 trading contribution from metal trading businesses formerly owned by Mr Masoud Alikhani, the Iranian-born businessman These companies were injected into Middlesex as part of a capital restructuring and Pounds 754,725 rights issue last November. Mr Alikhani was appointed chief executive at the same time. Following the restructuring, 29.9 per cent of Middlesex is held by Mr Alikhani, his family, and a group of seven Russian investors. Mr Alikhani says he intends to exploit the lack of financial infrastructure in the former Soviet Union which leaves many local companies unable to transact business in neighbouring republics. Middlesex currently buys raw materials to supply to smelters, which then pay the company in the finished product. The group is also involved in oil trading. Middlesex intends to expand in the CIS and has recently appointed Mr Alexander Vladislavev, vice-president of Russia's equivalent of the CBI, as an executive director. Mr Alikhani has warranted to bring trading profits of Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) into Ferromet. This had already been achieved since the businesses were injected, he said.</p>

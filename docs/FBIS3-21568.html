			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Disarmament" column: "The </F> Fate of the Nuclear Train Is Again at a Dead End. This Time in  a Railway Siding"]    [Text] Ukraine has suspended the evacuation of nuclear  warheads to Russia. As SEGODNYA reported in its 2 March issue,  60 "Ukrainian" nuclear warheads dismantled from the strategic  missiles of the 46th (Pervomayskaya) Missile Division of the 43d  Missile Army were delivered to embarkation points on flatcars of  a special high- security train. But then everything stopped  going according to plan: the train did not arrive at its  destination -- the "electromechanical" plant in a closed town  run by the Atomic Industry Ministry in the Urals region where  nuclear charges are assembled (and dismantled)....    It will be recalled that on 14 January a tripartite  Russian-U.S.- Ukrainian agreement was signed in Moscow on  conditions for the liquidation of Ukrainian nuclear weapons in  Ukraine. In subsequent weeks, experts on both sides prepared a  coordinated schedule for the evacuation of the nuclear warheads.  Specialists of the Russian Defense Ministry's 12th Main  Directorate managed (with the assistance of the Ukrainian  military) to resolve all technical problems within an early  period. The warheads were delivered to the embarkation point  and prepared for shipment.    The Ukrainian side, however, suddenly suspended the  withdrawal, demanding confirmation that the Russian Atomic  Industry Ministry will in March supply to Ukraine fuel  assemblies for its nuclear power plants in exchange for the  warheads. Ukraine badly needs nuclear fuel, with its power  industry being on the verge of closure. But so far there has  been no confirmation from Moscow about nuclear fuel supplies.  Therefore the Ukrainian side also put on hold the loading of  warheads because it is not at all safe to keep nuclear munitions  "on wheels."    Meanwhile the Ukrainian president has begun his visit to  Washington. Earlier it was expected that Leonid Kravchuk would  report to President Clinton about the start of real  implementation of the 14 January agreement which was apparently  supposed to raise Kiev's prospects of getting U.S. economic  assistance. At the end of February, however, the general  atmosphere of Russian-U.S. relations changed: the Ames case,  followed by mutual deportation of diplomats and the demands in  Congress to freeze U.S. aid to Russia.... Kiev must have  concluded that the orientation of U.S. foreign policy is  changing and now there will be no direct linkage between  economic assistance and the nuclear issue -- and the time has  finally come for Ukraine also to show firmness in its relations  with Moscow.    True, Moscow is behaving far from impeccably. To date the  question about who will pay for fuel deliveries has not been  settled. The Atomic Industry Ministry cannot just present fuel  assemblies from its stocks to Ukraine as a gift: people in  closed cities are also experiencing difficulties over the  nonpayment of wages. As a result, the military just sits  waiting with its dangerous, restless cargo until the politicians  have figured out what has to come first, "the money or the  goodies." Meanwhile the Russian Gazprom has already started to  cut gas supplies to Ukraine, and this can hardly improve the  general atmosphere of deep mutual distrust between Moscow and  Kiev.</p>

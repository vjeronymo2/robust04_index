			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine and Russia have resumed  negotiations on the future of the Black Sea Fleet with the two  delegations meeting at Ukraine's Ministry of Defense on 12  April. As UNIAN already reported, the Russian delegation is led  by Yuriy Dubinin, the Russian president's ambassador-at-large  and includes Feliks Gromov, the Russian Navy commander.    "We have long been offering to return to the Black Sea Fleet  negotiations," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told  UNIAN, "and today these negotiations have been resumed. It is  in our interests and those of the Russian side to find a  solution to this issue in order to prevent the Fleet problem  from setting off unexpected developments. Right now, everything  happening around the Fleet is out of control, and the Odessa  incident is an example of that. If we manage to find a solution  soon to the Black Sea Fleet problem on the basis of mutual  interest, we would decrease the probability of unforeseeable  consequences in future. We need to find such solutions that  will not harm the Black Sea Fleet and at the same time satisfy  the interested parties. These solutions must be based on the  Massandra, Yalta, and Zavidovo accords.</p>

The  figure includes nationals of 136 countries, "ranging from  Afghanistan to Zimbabwe," Sykora said.    The inflow of Chinese has declined, while the number of  immigrants from the former Soviet Union has been on the rise, he  reported. They often work without residence and labor permits.  "They arrive in the Czech Republic, as to a blessed country, in  order to earn money here," he added, and noted that the  employers, too, are punishable for hiring illegal workers.    The latest problem are Tunisians, Sykora said. During  foreign police round-ups, when foreigners are checked, some 70  percent of the detained are from Tunisia. These people are  usually heading for the West, he reported.    Sykora called nonsense the allegation that 30,000 Americans  were living in Prague. He explained that according to the  current estimates, about 80 million foreigners had arrived in  the Czech Republic this year. If they come from the States of  visa-free contact with the Czech Republic, they can stay here  for 30 days with no registration necessary. Therefore, it is  not possible to estimate the number and nationality of people  staying in the Czech Republic illegally.</p>

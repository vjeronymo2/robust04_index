			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Italy set to reform tax on interest for interbank deposits ITALY'S cabinet was poised yesterday to abolish the 30 per cent withholding tax on interest for interbank deposits, in what would be a further crucial step in reforming Italy's capital markets. Confirmation of the decision is due at a cabinet meeting today, according to Mr Rino Formica, the finance minister. Mr Formica did not indicate when the move would take effect. Removal of the withholding tax would be one of the most significant in a series of recent steps to liberalise and improve the competitiveness of Italy's capital markets. However, while numerous moves have been made on the bond side, tax reform on interbank deposits, strongly supported by the Bank of Italy, had been consistently blocked by the Finance Ministry. 'It will be an enormous boost for the entire structure of the capital markets,' said one leading banker yesterday. Bankers have been lobbying for the change for some time, on the grounds that the tax created severe distortions in the interbank market and handicapped the lira deposit market overall. Moreover, while interest on interbank deposits has been subject to withholding tax, such lending to corporates has been exempt. The result has been to make banks extremely reluctant to lend money among themselves. Banks with excess liquidity have tended to make funds available to the interbank market only when other avenues - such as lending to corporations - has failed. Even then, funds have been placed on the interbank market for the briefest possible periods. 'The interbank market tends to be used only as a last resort, and on an overnight basis', commented one banker. The tax makes using the market 'atrociously expensive', he said. Removing the tax should stimulate the creation of a much deeper interbank market and produce a range of maturities. Those, in turn, should spur the development of derivate products like interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements. Such techniques have flourished in the London-based Eurolira market - which is unaffected by the withholding tax - but been severely handicapped domestically. By removing the main barrier between the domestic interbank market and that for Eurolira deposits, the tax change would also create a much bigger overall lira deposit pool. The existence of the tax is believed to be one of the major factors behind the delay in creating futures and options products on Eurolira deposits at foreign derivates markets, a step that may now be accelerated. The lower house of the Italian parliament yesterday approved a long-awaited new law governing minority shareholders' rights in takeover bids. With only days before the dissolution of parliament, approval of the law, which has been seen as one of the last crucial steps in Italy's stock market reform, appeared increasingly doomed. The new ruling must now be approved by the senate before becoming law.</p>

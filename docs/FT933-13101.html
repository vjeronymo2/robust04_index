			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Management: A victim of its own success - Controversy over a BSI standard threatens to discredit the issue of quality David Franklin had been supplying one large supermarket with air fresheners for 14 years. Suddenly, he was given three months' notice that unless his south London company registered for BS5750, a quality management standard, it would be dropped from the supplier list. 'It would have cost us Pounds 4,000 to obtain BS5750,' says Franklin, managing director of the company which bears his name. For a business with turnover of Pounds 750,000 and a workforce of only seven, he says, the quality standard would have been an unnecessary burden. Fortunately, Franklin was able to convince the supermarket buyer that the standard would not mean a better product but would push up his costs. The buyer backed off but Franklin knows other businessmen who have not been so lucky. Companies around the country have been coming under pressure from their customers to conform to BS5750, frequently after many years of trouble-free dealings. BS5750 was launched in the late 1970s to improve the poor quality image of British industry and was taken up in Europe as EN29000 and around the world as an international standard ISO9000. But it now threatens to damage the reputation of the British Standards Institution (BSI), which created it, and more importantly, discredit the issue of quality across a large sector of British business. The furore over BS5750 has forced BSI to set up a special committee to review the problems caused to smaller companies. It is looking at ways of simplifying the implementation of the standard for small firms and reducing costs. So concerned has BSI become at the growing controversy that last week it made the first of a planned series of presentations to the press to explain the standard and the role of BSI. 'I want to clear the air because there are a lot of misconceptions about BSI and its terms of reference,' said Viv Thomas, BSI chairman. 'BS5750 is a national asset which BSI designed and exported around the world.' Setting quality standards for your suppliers is nothing new. The Ministry of Defence and the nationalised industries have long had codes and guidelines to ensure they got value for their large purchasing budgets. BS5750 was launched in 1979 to establish some common standards and to extend the idea more widely throughout industry. Ironically, BS5750 has become a victim of its own success. Initially it was taken up by large companies which could cope with the formal systems involved and the large volumes of paperwork but it has since spread to smaller firms. It has been enthusiastically adopted by organisations as diverse as manufacturers, accountants, chambers of commerce, schools and police stations. The controversy surrounding BS5750 has caught BSI unprepared. It is used to writing industry-specific product standards - covering the durability of fitted kitchens and the strength of motor cycle helmets. BS5750 was the first of what are known as 'horizontal' standards, applicable across a broad swathe of industry. It has come at a particularly difficult time for BSI. The organisation is half-way through a programme to make it less bureaucratic and more commercially minded. The strains created by this process led to the surprise resignation of its chief executive, Michael Sanderson, last month. It has also coincided with a government review of BSI, the desirability of continuing to subsidise the organisation and the issue of standards writing in the UK. Unlike the product standards which BSI routinely produces in their thousands, BS5750 is a measure of quality procedures and much more open to individual interpretation. It measures the consistency of a business's systems for dealing with customer orders, purchasing, stock control, manufacturing (or providing a service) and delivery. BS5750 is intended as a readily recognised guarantee of a company's quality assurance standards so that customers do not have to carry out their own assessment and suppliers avoid being swamped by inspection visits. But one critic, Trevor McCarthy, who has worked with companies registering for BS5750, says companies should write their own, brief, quality manuals and use inspection visits as a way of impressing potential customers. BSI and many of the 22,000 UK businesses which have registered for the standard refute the criticisms of BS5750. It allows companies to reduce waste, increase productivity and obtain a competitive advantage, says Thomas. One engineering company with turnover of Pounds 1m and a workforce of 35 saved thousands of pounds and achieved a big improvement in customer relations when it tightened up its procedures for maintaining and updating its engineering drawings. Before obtaining BS5750 and taking greater care with its drawings it would turn out parts to an obsolete specification and have to scrap the consignment. Arranging for the proper storage of tools saved employees of the same company lost time previously spent hunting in corners and under benches for a mislaid piece of tooling. 'We have had a positive feedback from 20 companies for every company with a negative experience,' comments Thomas. A survey of more than 2,300 companies which had qualified for BS5750 by Pera International, a research and consultancy group, showed that 89 per cent reported improvements to operational efficiency, 76 per cent obtained a marketing benefit and 48 per cent an improvement in profitability. But other surveys have revealed a more critical view of BS5750. Only 8 per cent of managers rated their quality initiatives a total success - due to a shortage of resources and a lack of commitment by top management - according to an Institute of Management study. A survey by IBM Consulting Group to determine whether British companies were up to 'world class' standards showed that possession of BS5750 made no difference unless it was part of a wider quality programme. Concern about BS5750 has arisen for several reasons: It is frequently mistaken for a guarantee of product or service quality. Companies which took up the standard in the early 1980s understood the distinction but this has been lost as its use has become more widespread. 'With hindsight we should have kept up the awareness campaign,' comments Derek Prior, BSI's communications manager. BS5750 has even started to appear on consumer product labelling, with the implicit suggestion that it is a quality mark. It sets no formal, standard criteria because quality management systems are infinitely variable depending on the company, its activity and procedures. When Toshiba's copier division launched a programme to persuade its UK dealers to register for BS5750 it debated whether to set a response time for repair men of eight or 16 hours. Eventually it decided on eight hours. But it could have set 16 hours providing it consistently met this standard. Toshiba has backed up BS5750 with a range of its own, defined quality procedures. It generates paperwork. Small companies in particular use simple procedures which are frequently not written down. Formalising these systems can produce thick quality manuals. When Wessex Water registered for BS5750 the documentation of its quality systems filled 164 manuals - a total of more than 22,000 pages. 'But it is not all new paper,' says John Snoxell, water production and systems manager. 'Most should have existed before. Now it is all under control and we know where all the copies are.' It is costly, particularly at the end of a recession, when companies' resources have been depleted. Consultants' fees could amount to Pounds 400-Pounds 500 a day for between 15 and 20 days, a total of Pounds 6,000-Pounds 10,000, though government subsidies could meet half or even two-thirds of the bill. Costs could be cut further by taking part in joint programmes run by trade associations and some consultants. The cost of the initial assessment and monitoring over the first three years for a professional services company employing 50 people on one site could vary from Pounds 2,900 to Pounds 7,125, according to a recent handbook, Implementing Quality through BS5750/ISO9000 (By P. Jackson and D. Jackson. Kogan Page. Pounds 25). There is often no indication whether a company has obtained BS5750 for the entire range of its activities or for a small division employing only a few people. Companies are not obliged to be precise, although they would be legally liable if they attached it to an operation which had not qualified. The system for approving certification companies is in need of overhaul. Twenty six certification companies have been accredited by the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies, but other non-accredited organisations may also award certificates. BS5750 has not yet made great inroads internationally. Many countries with a good record for product quality, which BS5750's critics say is all that really matters to the customer, make little use of the standard. BSI's Quality Assurance division, one of the 26 accredited groups, has issued BS5750/ISO9000 certificates to 14,805 UK companies but to only 367 in the US, 122 in Japan and 45 in Germany. Overseas interest is increasing however, BSI says. It is important that the controversy about BS5750 is resolved. For BSI because it has other 'horizontal' standards in the pipeline, covering the fields of environmental management and total quality management. And for business because, in the longer term, the move towards more formal quality systems appears inevitable. Increasing cross-border trade will boost demand for standards which are acceptable around the world.</p>

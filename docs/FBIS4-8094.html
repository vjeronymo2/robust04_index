			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 9 Apr (TANJUG) -- A meeting between the  commanders of the [Bosnian] Serb and Muslim armies, with  UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] mediation, which began around  1300 at Sarajevo airport, is still under way this afternoon, and  could go on for several hours.    As TANJUG's correspondent has learned, the talks are  difficult and tense, and it is completely uncertain whether the  standpoints of the two sides will come closer, and whether a  cease-fire agreement will be signed.    The commander of the main headquarters of the Srpska  republic  army, Lt. Col. Gen. Ratko Mladic; the commander of the Muslim  forces, Gen. Rasim Delic; and the UNPROFOR commander for former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen. Michael Rose, are holding talks behind  closed doors.    Today's meeting is a result of efforts made yesterday by Gen  Rose to get both commanders to the negotiating table. However,  their different standpoints on the peace agreement have not been  reconciled and it could be said that bridging this gap will be  the central topic of the talks.    TANJUG has learned from reliable sources that the Muslim  side  arrived at the meeting with a 14-day cease-fire offer, insisting  that Gorazde be the main topic.    However, as Gen. Mladic pointed out at the meeting, the Serb  side does not want to discuss partial and short-term solutions,  but it has offered talks on an overall and unconditional truce  along all demarcation lines in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Thus the Serb side is not prepared to discuss any particular  front outside the context of the overall situation; this is  contrary to the standpoints of the Muslim forces' command, which  is trying to give top priority, in achieving a truce, to those  battlefields where which the situation is developing in a way  completely out of keeping with its wishes and aims.</p>

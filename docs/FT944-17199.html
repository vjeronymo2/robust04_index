			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / This Week: Film There is an old movie adage that when all else fails - or when all else has succeeded but you need a fresh gimmick - you should send your characters into the desert. There you will find eye-catching scenery, limitless horizons and a licence to conjure mirages. Many people at Cannes this year thought The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert was a mirage. A comedy of cross-dressing from macho Australia? And a funny one? It fast became the hit of the festival. It revives Terence Stamp's career at a stroke - he plays one of three drag queens whose hired bus breaks down in the Outback, causing many an unexpected encounter and adventure - and provides the wittiest, most off-the-wall gay movie since La Cage Aux Folles. Priscilla opens this Friday. Disney's The Lion King opened last Friday and is already swallowing large audiences whole. This desert is African and the most spectacular cartoon landscape of modern times. Thrill to the stampeding wildebeest. Gasp at the burning plains patrolled by lions and hyenas. And relish Jeremy Irons' suave turn as the wicked lion uncle, obviously reared on old George Sanders films when he was a cub. Zhang Yimou's To Live, from the director of Red Sorghum and Ju Dou, is another of China's revisionist epics about Chinese history: 30 years in the war-ravaged, Mao-harrassed life of a puppeteer and his wife. But Zhang's vision is fiercer and harsher than Chen Kaige's in the recent Farewell My Concubine, and the battle confrontations in the desert are unforgettable. Finally, wrap up your desert research with Walter Hill's Geronimo, filmed in scenic Utah, a few leagues north of the Indian chief's real stomping grounds in Arizona/New Mexico. In other respects the movie, opening this week, claims exhaustive historical authenticity and has Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall in the supporting cast.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Arts: BCMG/Knussen - Adrian Boult Hall, Birmingham In each of its concerts this season, the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group has included a premiere, and the last of the series on Sunday brought a new work from the 21-year-old Scottish composer David Horne. Out of the Air had been commissioned by the Michael Vyner Trust, set up to commemorate the late director of the London Sinfonietta; though the Trust will naturally centre its activities on the Sinfonietta, encouraging promising young composers to write for the ensemble, it plans to spread its largesse as widely as possible, and will work with other groups such as BCMG. Horne is certainly a hugely promising talent; his towards dharma .., heard at Edinburgh last summer, was evidence of that. He is now studying at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and, naturally enough, still finding his voice; perhaps for that reason Out of the Air, a sequence of 'five inventions for ensemble', was not entirely consistent and coherent. The first two movements are convincing, economical elaborations of rhythmic figures; the final piece works up to a brilliant, extrovert finish. But the slow third becomes over-dense and clogged, and the fourth lacks a distinctive idea, so that the work seems more diffuse than it probably is. The BCMG was conducted by Oliver Knussen; they had begun with a dreamily sensuous account of his Ophelia Dances, coming up freshly minted and teeming with ideas, each solo phrase lovingly shaped. The programme ended with Birtwistle's Meridian, in a performance with the London Voices and the mezzo-soprano Mary King, of glinting, crystalline textures and sinewy expressive force. Completed in 1971, Meridian is one of the most fascinating and transitional of Birtwistle's early masterpieces. With its solo horn and cello it looks back to the savage ritualised violence of the works around Punch and Judy, while the hazy sound mobiles created by the eight sopranos start to explore the world that would eventually encompass The Mask of Orpheus; its texts too, a poem by Christopher Logue framed by stanzas from Thomas Wyatt, dealing with the power of music and its fateful limitations, look forward to that huge opera. Above all, though, it's a magnificently sustained piece of word setting in its own right, with vivid ideas and highly wrought vocal lines contained within a dramatic trajectory of irresistible certainty.</p>

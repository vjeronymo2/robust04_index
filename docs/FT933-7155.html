			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Fall in Japan's capital spending seen CAPITAL spending by Japanese companies is set to fall this year for the third year running, according to a bank survey published yesterday, highlighting the continued weak state of the country's economy. In a survey of 1,544 companies, Nippon Credit Bank found that planned capital spending for fiscal 1993 was down 3.8 per cent from the level given in a similar survey in February. This meant planned capital investment for the fiscal year would be 3 per cent lower than in the previous year. It was the first time in seven years that the level of planned capital investment had fallen between February and August, the bank said. Capital spending planned by manufacturing companies was down by 15.2 per cent, marking the second double-digit decline in two years. Capital spending by manufacturing companies had fallen by 18.8 per cent in fiscal 1992. Nippon Credit Bank also said that although non-manufacturing companies planned to increase capital spending by 1.5 per cent on the previous year, if utilities and leasing companies were excluded, planned capital investment would fall by 7.6 per cent. Evidence of Japan's economic slump continued to surface. Toyota, Japan's largest car-maker, said it was temporarily transferring 175 employees to a group subsidiary. Production at the subsidiary, which makes bodies for recreational vehicles, one of the most active market sectors, was expected to grow, while Toyota's own production had been slowing. Asahi Glass, a leading glass-maker, is closing a car-window-glass factory because of the slowdown in the domestic motor industry.</p>

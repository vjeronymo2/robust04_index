			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE, BAKER CLASH ON 3RD WORLD POLICY  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze clashed sharply over Afghanistan and Nicaragua on Friday but also  moved close to signing several technical agreements on arms control, officials  said.  </P> <P> Baker and Shevardnadze, meeting in a luxurious lodge beneath the snow-topped  crags of the Teton mountains, spent almost two hours of an intense one-on-one  session sparring over their policies on the Third World conflicts, officials  said.  </P> <P> The two men became so absorbed in the argument that their meeting ran more than  an hour later than scheduled, leaving dozens of senior aides waiting in lobbies  and hallways.  </P> <P> But U.S. and Soviet officials said the forceful exchange did not derail the two  countries' plans to sign an agreement today on "trial verification" of their  nuclear arsenals and to announce the timing of a first summit meeting between  President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials often have pointed to Soviet behavior in the  Third World as a key test of whether the "new thinking" proclaimed by Gorbachev  has any real impact on the Kremlin's foreign policy.  </P> <P> According to a senior aide, Baker told Shevardnadze bluntly "that when we take  a look at some of the patterns of Soviet involvement (in the Third World) . . .  there is, from our standpoint, a disturbing flow of arms."  </P> <P> He said U.S. intelligence reports have detected "a surge of arms" to pro-Soviet  regimes in Cambodia and Ethiopia, "a tremendous increase" in weapons shipments  to the pro-Moscow government in Afghanistan and a continued flow of weaponry  from the Soviet Bloc to the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> "That doesn't seem to fit our understanding of what 'new thinking' is supposed  to embody," he quoted Baker as saying.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze rejected the criticism and accused the United States of acting  irresponsibly by continuing its military aid to Muslim rebels in Afghanistan,  officials said.  </P> <P> "In our view, the United States is violating its obligation as a guarantor of  the Geneva accords (reached in 1988 to end the Afghan war)," a senior Soviet  official said, pointing to continued U.S. arms shipments to the rebels. That  agreement calls for an end to foreign aid to the rebels, but the Bush  Administration has said it will continue sending supplies as long as Moscow  continues active support for the Kabul regime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Officials Annoyed  </P> <P> In the case of Nicaragua, Shevardnadze annoyed U.S. officials by sticking to  his position that the Kremlin has stopped sending arms directly to the  Sandinistas but is powerless to stop its allies like Cuba from doing so.  </P> <P> The Baker-Shevardnadze argument, as recounted by their aides, sounded like a  return to the days of U.S.-Soviet polemics before Gorbachev came to power. But  officials on both sides took pains to stress that the dispute did not poison  the two countries' discussions on other issues.  </P> <P> "It was a discussion that was carried on in a way that suggested that these two  men have established a working relationship" in which both sides "have to be  honest and candid," a U.S. official said.  </P> <P> Soviet officials said they were neither surprised nor upset by the U.S.  criticism, but they also appeared anxious to turn the meeting's attention  toward arms control, the subject the Kremlin wants to keep at the center of the  superpower agenda.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze and Baker spent much of the afternoon discussing the proposals  advanced by Gorbachev in a nine-page letter that the Soviet foreign minister  delivered to Bush on Thursday.  </P> <P> Among Gorbachev's offers was a suggestion to break a long-running U.S.-Soviet  deadlock over testing weapons to defend against nuclear missiles, a dispute  that has been a major obstacle to the conclusion of a strategic arms reduction  (START) treaty.  </P> <P> Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor P. Karpov told reporters that his country  was willing to agree to "some testing of devices in space" and suggested that  the two sides agree to a list of permissible tests. U.S. officials, who have  long asserted a right to test exotic beam devices in space under the 1972  Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, said they were willing to consider the Soviet  approach.  </P> <P> Two years ago, some U.S. officials suggested such an approach, and the Soviets  seemed to endorse it. But then-President Ronald Reagan, who feared limiting  tests could cripple his controversial Strategic Defense Initiative, rejected  it.  </P> <P> Officials said the expected agreement on "trial verification" would formalize a  surprisingly fast acceptance by the two countries of a new principle in arms  control talks: that experiments to test the feasibility of systems to verify  the size and location of nuclear weapons can be conducted even before a treaty  to reduce them is complete.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration proposed the idea in June, but Soviet officials  insisted that the agreement to be signed today was devised by their experts in  Moscow. The pact is a general agreement by both sides to begin working on ways  to begin mutual verification of each others' arsenals, a key part of any arms  reduction effort.  </P> <P> Baker and Shevardnadze are also expected to sign an agreement to exchange  information before any major test or exercise of strategic nuclear forces, a  Soviet official said.  </P> <P> They also may sign an agreement to swap information about the size and location  of each others' chemical weapons, a step toward reducing those arsenals,  officials said -- although some officials said last-minute snags could delay  that pact.  </P> <P> Baker and Shevardnadze met here, at a resort built by the late John D.  Rockefeller III, as part of an agreement to begin varying their twice-yearly  meetings beyond Washington and Moscow.  </P> <P> Before they began, they took a moment to survey a breathtaking vista of glacial  mountains, gaudy yellow aspen trees -- and a pair of courting moose.  </P> <P> "We had to tie the moose down with chains," Baker quipped.  </P> <P> "Yes, I noticed that the moose were tied up," Shevardnadze said with a laugh.  </P></p>

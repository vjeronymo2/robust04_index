			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Water babies THE CHAIRMEN of the UK's privatised water companies have not hitherto been seen as negotiators in the Gordon Gekko class. Yet in one week's frantic haggling in July 1989, they appear to have out-negotiated ministers and civil servants to the tune of Pounds 2bn. The story is told in the National Audit Office's account of water privatisation, released on Saturday. Even through the foot-deep litter of Whitehall caveats, it is possible to detect what really happened. The government's merchant bank adviser, Schroders, told it that - partly because of regulatory uncertainty - water companies' shares would have to yield more than those of British Gas. It argued that the companies would need to cover their interest payments four times over with profits for a mass market privatisation to succeed. That was what the government wanted, but it tried to keep interest cover to three times. Enter, in that crucial July week, the water chairmen, playing their trump card: unless the government loosened controls on prices, and gave them stronger balance sheets, they would have to make 'heavy qualifications' (the NAO's words) in their flotation prospectuses. Over the next few days, the government caved in: it relaxed price ceilings; switched from net debt for the companies of Pounds 435m to a cash injection of Pounds 1.1bn; jacked up predicted future costs; and gave way on interest cover. Since much of the companies' riskiness had now been eliminated, was it still necessary to offer such a generous yield? Apparently so. The average yield was set at 8.55 per cent, compared with British Gas's 7 per cent. The sale went well. Since then, the water companies' shares have outperformed the market - and British Gas - by 30-50 per cent. They now yield less than Gas. Water privatisation raised Pounds 3.6bn for the taxpayer, some Pounds 2.13bn less than the government's 'illustrative' estimates before the July negotiations started. Let us have simpler, more leisurely privatisations in future, says the NAO. Let us have better negotiators, too.</p>

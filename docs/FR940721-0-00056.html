			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AAMA stated that the listed components represent less than three percent of material value, but 30&hyph;35 percent of the number of part numbers in a passenger motor vehicle. That organization argued that the recommended list would exclude a minimal value from the definition of passenger motor vehicle equipment, while significantly reducing the number of parts and suppliers that have to be solicited for content information. AAMA also recommended that outside and allied suppliers be permitted to default the values of these components to the country of origin of the passenger motor vehicle equipment in which they are incorporated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford stated that items such as paints, sealers and solvents should not be included in the definition of passenger motor vehicle equipment. That company stated that both bulk parts and raw materials should be excluded from the vehicle content calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford noted that the Labeling Act defines  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> passenger motor vehicle equipment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as ``a system, sub-assembly or component'' received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on, or attachment to, the vehicle. Ford argued that if Congress had intended to add bulk items or items such as paint and solvents or bulk parts, such as wheel weights and rivets, to the calculation, it would not have used the terms ``system, sub-assembly or component.'' That company stated that in other sections of the Act, where Congress intended raw and bulk materials to be included, it used the terms ``foreign content'' or ``material.'' Ford stated that paint, solvents, and sealers should not be considered systems, sub-assemblies, or components because, among other reasons, these items only have part numbers when ordered in bulk quantities. That company supported the list of additional exclusions set forth in AAMA's comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of manufacturers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan supported treating paint, sealers and solvent as equipment. Honda stated that it believes that NHTSA appropriately defined minor parts to be excluded from the calculation in the NPRM. Nissan, however, stated that it is not sure whether everything other than attachment hardware can be properly considered passenger motor vehicle equipment and suggested that NHTSA consider how other regulatory and/or legislative schemes may determine whether a particular item is an auto part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Isuzu stated that it believes attachment hardware such as nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins and braces must be included in, rather than excluded from, the definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment.'' That company stated that the vehicle manufacturer specifies part numbers for these parts. It is not easy to identify these parts on the carline parts list and then separate them from other parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW stated that it supports including items that become a permanent part of the vehicle such as adhesives, sealers, and paint. However, that manufacturer recommended that consumable items such as windshield washer and gasoline not be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APMA stated that it supports the exclusion of paint, sealers and solvents on the grounds that they are almost invariably of local origin, and their exclusion will reduce the regulatory burden to manufacturers and paint suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The UAW stated in its comment on the request for comments that, to avoid undermining the intent of the Labeling Act, the exclusion for minor parts should be narrowly construed. The UAW stated that it does not believe the definition should be interpreted to exclude paint or sealer, or raw materials, fasteners, or general purpose hardware. The UAW stated that many of these items have substantial value, and that excluding them would only serve to provide consumers with a misleading impression of the domestic versus foreign content of motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, the agency has decided to exclude some additional items from the definition of ``motor vehicle equipment,'' but not the entire list suggested by AAMA. With respect to AAMA's comment that it would prefer that all items not covered under NAFTA Annex 403.1 be excluded, the agency notes some major items of motor vehicle equipment are not covered by that annex, including air bags. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to use NAFTA Annex 403.1 as the basis for determining what additional ``minor parts'' should be excluded. NHTSA also notes that it cannot adopt Isuzu's suggestion to include attachment hardware such as nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins and braces within the definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment,'' since those items are expressly excluded by the statutory definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has decided to exclude the following additional items from the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> passenger motor vehicle equipment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  phosphate rinse, tire assembly fluid, gasoline, oil, windshield washer fluid, fasteners, rivets, grommets, and wheel weights. The first five items are consumable items which are either consumed in the assembly of the vehicle or are replaced within the first few days or months of vehicle ownership. Therefore, the agency believes that those items should not be considered part of the vehicle. The last four items are either forms of attachment hardware similar to the other ones listed in the statutory definition, or types of items whose collective value for a particular motor vehicle will always be negligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is not adopting the other exclusions suggested by AAMA because the items are not similar to the ones listed in the statutory definition and because the collective value of the items for a particular motor vehicle can be substantial. With respect to Ford's comment concerning the meaning of ``system, subassembly, or component,'' the agency believes that the term ``component'' is sufficiently broad to include such things as paint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the minor items which are excluded from the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> passenger motor vehicle equipment, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the agency is permitting allied and outside suppliers to treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country of assembly of the equipment. NHTSA notes that this treatment is only necessary to the extent that such minor items are part of other equipment supplied by a supplier. To the extent that such minor items are supplied directly to a manufacturer, or are used by a manufacturer in assembly of a vehicle, they are not considered passenger motor vehicle equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Items To Be Provided on the Label; Wording of the Label (Section 583.5)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to affix to all new passenger motor vehicles a label which provides the following five items of information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S./Canadian Parts Content <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _the overall percentage, by value, U.S./Canadian content of the motor vehicle equipment installed on the carline of which the vehicle is a part;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Major Sources of Foreign Parts Content <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _the names of the two countries, if any, other than the U.S./Canada, which contributed the greatest amount (at least 15 percent), by value, of motor vehicle equipment for the carline, and the percentage, by value, of the equipment originating in each such country;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Delors is dubbed harmless by Clarke EFFORTS by the government to rehabilitate Mr Jacques Delors with the Conservative party were renewed yesterday as Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, mounted a defence of the European Commission president. 'Jacques Delors is harmless compared to some of the rivals being put in against him,' Mr Clarke said on TV-am. 'I think we ought to wait and see who becomes president without deciding that this man is responsible for every piece of nonsense that has come out of Brussels in the last few years.' Mr Delors is expected to be reappointed president this week with UK government support. Mr Clarke said Mr Delors 'will follow through what he says about not wanting the Commission to be over-centralised, not wanting the Commission to interfere in things which would be better run by national governments. Then he will be in line with what we believe we have negotiated in Maastricht.' As well as the presidency issue, Euro-sceptics will soon seize on the 48-hour working week as a target if the UK is outvoted on the issue at the social affairs council in Luxembourg on Wednesday. Senior ministers are to meet before the council to decide the UK's voting stance. The government's determination to isolate the Euro-sceptics was underlined yesterday when Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, emphasised that the decision to delay further parliamentary discussion of the Maastricht bill until the autumn should not be seen as reducing the commitment to 'keep Britain at the heart of Europe'. The Institute for Public Policy Research, the leftwing think tank, today outlines recommendations for the UK presidency of the EC, including better access for eastern European goods in western markets and EC intervention to compensate for market failings in areas such as labour skills and income support.

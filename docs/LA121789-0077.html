			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: NARRATIVES OF THE WRECK OF THE WHALE-SHIP ESSEX BY OWEN  CHASE ET AL (DOVER: $4.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> On Aug. 12, 1819, 11 days after Herman Melville was born, the American whaler  Essex was attacked and sunk by an enraged bull sperm whale, estimated to be 85  feet long. First Mate Owen Chase published his recollection of the attack in  1851, supplemented with brief accounts by the captain and second mate. As even  a cursory reading reveals, Melville used these memoirs as the basis of the  final, climactic chapter of "Moby Dick." (His copy of "Narratives" survives,  along with 18 pages of notes.) Not surprisingly, Chase's descriptions of the  whale's fury lack the power of Melville's writing. But his memories of the  terrible suffering the crew endured as they struggled to reach the coast of  South America -- more than 2,000 miles from the site of the attack -- in open  whaleboats retain their strength and poignance.  </P></p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Irish Continental advances to IPounds 4.1m Irish Continental Group, the Irish Sea ferry operator, which bought B&amp;I ferries a year ago, reported pre-tax profits up 29 per cent to IPounds 4.1m, (Pounds 4.3m), for the year to October 31. Turnover rose sharply from IPounds 30.9m to IPounds 98.2m. The company said an extraordinary charge of IPounds 1.7m arose from its 'withdrawal from the dedicated car-carrying business.' Earnings per share rose from 14.8p to 21.8p</p>

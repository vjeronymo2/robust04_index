			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr </F> al-'Attas with London MBC TV correspondent 'Aziz Fahmi, in  Florida; date not given--recorded]    [Text] Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has  described the decision to dismiss him as unconstitutional. He  said in an interview with an MBC correspondent in Florida, 'Aziz  Fahmi, that the United States is continuing its contacts with  him. He said the war constitutes a real danger for Yemeni unity.    [Al-'Attas] The declaration of war was clearly an act  harming  unity and breaking every bond between the sons of the Yemeni  people. We did not expect our brothers in Sanaa to resort to  such methods. This is why, as I have already said, they have  portrayed the situation as an annexation of the south to the  north. Their behavior shows that they are secessionists. With  regard to the war, which totally contradicts unity, there can be  no unity with war. Whatever the situation and whichever side's  forces occupy the land of the other party, it cannot be seen as  a victory.    [Fahmi] What is the constitutional stance on the  presidential  measures to dismiss you and all the southern officials?    [Al-'Attas] Undoubtedly, the measures are not  constitutional.  It is the right of the House of Representatives under normal  circumstances to withdraw confidence from the government or from  any minister. But the Presidential Council has no right to  dismiss a minister or the prime minister. So this decision is  not constitutional, even under normal circumstances, never mind  in the circumstances in Yemen now, which are not normal.    [Fahmi] What is the U.S. Administration's stance on events  in  Yemen and has it accepted your dismissal as prime minister?    [Al-'Attas] We maintain dealings with the U.S.  Administration  and are still in contact with the U.S. State Department. In my  meetings with State Department officials, since the start of the  crisis they have expressed their dissatisfaction with the  military course of the political crisis in the country. [end  recording]    Later tonight, a U.S. State Department spokesman clarified  to  MBC that his country has adopted no stance on the position of  al-'Attas, dismissed by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.  The U.S. official, who asked to remain anonymous, said that  Washington is focusing on stopping the acts of aggression  between the Yemenis and on finding ways for negotiations to be  held between the north and the south to reach a peaceful  solution.</p>

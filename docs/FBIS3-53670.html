			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A French woman was shot with two bullets in the head  this afternoon in Algiers. The woman, aged 45, was married to  an Algerian and the mother of three children. She worked with  the French Consulate in Algiers. She was the fourth French  citizen to be killed in Algeria since last September, and the  25th foreigner killed in the country.    The Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] has condemned what it  has  called an odious crime. The French ambassador was received this  evening by Algerian Prime Minister Redha Malek. He told him  about the concern of the French Government. As a sign of  mourning, all French services in Algeria will be closed  tomorrow, 16 January.</p>

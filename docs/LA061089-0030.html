			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY TROOPS FIRE ON BEIJING CROWDS  </P> <P> As I watched the killing and maiming of the young in China and waited for our  government's democratic outrage, I began to wonder if we haven't lost something  quite dear as well. It was the loss of some of our democratic spirit as our  leaders coolly and calculatedly made their tepid response of "deploring the  situation" in between boat rides in Kennebunkport.  </P> <P> We were told by our government that it was not in our "best interest" to be too  strong in our condemnation. We have "strategic military interests in China"  that must be "preserved." We have the beginning of economic trade that is  profitable to us. And our own President must maintain the special ties of  friendship he has developed with the current leadership in China because it is  to our "advantage."  </P> <P> Everything that was said made some intellectual sense. But where was our  democratic soul? Could we see young people shot in the back and crushed by  government tanks because they advocated the ideas of our own Thomas Jefferson  and think only of our special economic and military interests? Could we see a  government eat its young alive and feel nothing but fear for our business  interests?  </P> <P> During the election of 1988, we heard a lot about saluting the flag and  respecting our country. Why can't we now hear something about respecting our  democratic heritage and defending the people who espouse our ideals? Why  doesn't our government feel some responsibility for its rhetoric about freedom  that may have led the youth of China to act upon our ideals to their detriment?  Have we gained economic and military power only to lose our democratic soul?  </P> <P> ROSE ELIZABETH BIRD  </P> <P> Palo Alto  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NBA NOTES;  </P> <P> PORTLAND'S BRANCH IS PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT HIS RESERVE STATUS  </P> <P> Former Maryland star Adrian Branch was embarrassed that the media flocked to  him after Portland dropped a last-second game in Washington last week. "But  it's home," he said.  </P> <P> Branch is a reserve for Portland, after NBA stops in Chicago, Cleveland, Los  Angeles and New Jersey. You may remember the last time you saw Branch.  </P> <P> It was right after the Lakers had beaten Boston for the 1987 title, and if you  looked closely, you could see Branch in the champagne-shower celebration. But  even then, he knew he wasn't long for Showtime.  </P> <P> "I was treating every game like it was my last," said Branch, who has appeared  in 57 games this season for the Trail Blazers and averages eight points a game  as a reserve, "not having the comfortable cushion of having an extended  contract. But it's been fun while it lasted, and give or take one or two things  I did or didn't do, I've maxed out on my opportunity."  </P> <P> Portland took a look at Branch this summer and invited him to camp. He was not  given much of a shot to make the club and wasn't put in the team's media guide.  But he has shot 47 percent from the floor and is the Trail Blazers'  instant-offense type.  </P> <P> "You don't worry about what you can't do, just concentrate on what you can do,"  he said. "And take it from there, just go out there and boogie.  </P> <P> "It's just the coaches deciding to take a chance on me. And they liked what  they saw. I always felt I was ready to come out of the blocks, but what I saw  and what other people have seen was sometimes different."  </P> <P> Dallas Mavericks forward Roy Tarpley has been cleared to resume practicing with  his teammates as part of a continuation of his after-care program, a team  official said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Tarpley, on suspension for a drug-related violation, will attend the Mavericks'  practice Thursday morning, said Kevin Sullivan, director of media services for  the team.  </P> <P> Dr. Dave Lewis of the ASAP Family Treatment Program in Van Nuys, Calif., gave  the okay for Tarpley to practice, Sullivan said.  </P> <P> "Roy to date has been in complete compliance with his after-care plan and we  want him to continue that recovery plan," Lewis said.  </P> <P> "We want him to begin to practice with the team and see how he handles that  situation. We will continue to assess his progress. If he continues to be in  compliance, we'll go to the next step."  </P> <P> Tarpley was suspended from NBA action Jan. 5 for failure to comply with his  league-mandated after-care program. Tuesday night's game against the Utah Jazz  is the 46th he has missed since the suspension. He has lost $6,300 for each  missed contest.  </P> <P> Although Tarpley can practice with the Mavericks, he cannot be removed from the  suspended list, Sullivan said. He cannot travel with the team nor can he attend  home games.  </P> <P> A nice touch from the Phoenix Suns when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played his last  regular-season game there: among the farewell gifts given to Abdul-Jabbar was a  Kennedy 1964 half dollar mounted on a plaque.  </P> <P> Not much, until you recall Abdul-Jabbar's history involving Phoenix and Kennedy  half dollars.  </P> <P> On March 19, 1969, the Milwaukee Bucks and Suns flipped for the rights to the  first pick overall, using a Kennedy half dollar.  </P> <P> Then-commissioner Walter Kennedy flipped. The Suns called heads. It came up  tails. Milwaukee took the then-Lew Alcindor. Phoenix took Florida's Neal Walk.  The rest is history.  </P> <P> Now that Michael Jordan is tearing it up at point guard, triple-doublewise and  otherwise, might the Chicago Bulls be rethinkig their draft strategy?  </P> <P> Before the move, it was almost a certainty that Chicago would be looking for  someone to replace Sam Vincent, someone who could hit a jumper and distribute  the ball to Jordan and friends, or a power forward.  </P> <P> Now, they've found the point guard -- Jordan.  </P> <P> "I would like to see Michael play point guard the rest of his career," Bulls  Coach Doug Collins told the Chicago Tribune. "Of course, that would change our  draft picture. But that's my opinion, and the draft is up to Jerry" Krause, the  general manager.  </P> <P> Speaking of rearranged priorities, the Clippers sound more and more like a team  that will deal its lottery pick, which, if things continue the way they are,  will be no worse than fifth or sixth.  </P> <P> Their first priority is finding a jump-shooting guard, though, and there  probably aren't any in the league available better than Michigan's Glen Rice or  Arizona's Sean Elliott. But if you're the New Jersey Nets, and you don't have a  first, do you make a call out west about Buck Williams? Larry Brown has already  said the Spurs would consider dealing their first pick if Williams' name came  up.  </P> <P> In another for-instance, Brown mentioned another Williams. Name of John. Plays  for the Bullets.  </P> <P> The Celtics are playing very well right now, especially at home, but unless  things change drastically they're going to be playing either Detroit (3-1  against Boston this season) or Cleveland in the first round. Despite the  Pistons' manhandling of the Celtics in the playoffs last season, it may be  worse for Boston to play the Cavaliers.  </P> <P> After Cleveland pounded Boston in the Richfield Coliseum Sunday, the Hartford  Courant noted that Cleveland has held Boston to its two worst shooting  performances of the season, has beaten Boston seven straight times in the  Coliseum by an average of 17.4 points and that Boston is 0-20 against winning  teams on the road.  </P> <P> Add Portland: It's obvious that firing Mike Schuler and trading Kiki Vandeweghe  haven't provided the spark the Trail Blazers were hoping for.  </P> <P> When Portland fired Schuler Feb. 18, the team was 25-22. It proceeded to lose  three in a row. On Feb. 23 they traded Vandeweghe to the Knicks for New York's  1989 first choice, after Vandeweghe nixed a deal that would have sent him to  Indiana. Since then, the Trail Blazers are 8-13 and in danger of being caught  by Dallas for the final Western Conference playoff spot.  </P> <P> Coach Rick Adelman was upset after Friday's loss because of lapses that, he  said, contributed greatly to the Trail Blazers' recent six-game losing streak.  </P> <P> "When you keep giving up offensive rebounds, you have to be perfect at the  end," he said. "That's real frustrating. I just feel until our team realizes  it, that you have to do it for 48 minutes, you can't just do it for six or  seven minutes at a clip, we're going to keep having disappointments.  </P> <P> "We had lapses in each game. The only game that was different was the Knick  game, when we were ahead, and then we had a lapse in the middle of the fourth  period that got them in the game. We've been playing well enough in stretches  but not consistently for 48 minutes."  </P> <P> Yes, that is the Sacramento Kings who have gone 7-8 since starting the season  15-41. A .467 pace doesn't sound like a lot, until you consider they were  playing at a .275 clip beforehand. And in those seven wins are victories over  Houston, Golden State, Phoenix and Utah.  </P> <P> The trades bringing Wayman Tisdale and Danny Ainge west are more than just  coincidentally related to the upsurge. Ainge has averaged 21.7 points since  coming to the Kings, almost six more than he had been averaging with Boston.  Tisdale's shooting percentage has come down, but not greatly (48.5 percent from  50 percent), and his scoring average is at 19 points, three above his Indiana  totals.  </P></p>

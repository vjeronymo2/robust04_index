			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The repatriation of Kim  In-so and Ham Se-hwan and the release of An Hak-sop were  demanded strongly in various countries.    The Russian committee for the promotion of the repatriation  of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to the North and the release of An  Hak-sop held an emergency meeting recently and sent a letter to  Kim Yong-sam.    Noting that the South Korean authorities have kept old men  Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan from returning to their hometowns  where their families and relatives are waiting for them for more  than 40 years, the letter urged Kim Yong-sam to return them to  the DPRK, stop persecuting old man An Hak-sop at once and take a  necessary measure so that he may live and work as he wishes.    Franco Akame, former chairman of the National Defence  Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy, in a letter to  the South Korean puppet ambassador to Italy demanded that the  South Korean authorities immediately repatriate old men Kim  In-so and Ham Se-hwan to North Korea.    If the South Korean authorities persist in their inhumane  treatment and tortures against unconverted long-term prisoners,  not repatriating them, they would have to pay dearly for it, he  warned in the letter.</p>

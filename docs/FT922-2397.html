			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (4): A balmy resort off the beaten track - Tourism is the islands' leading source of revenue MADEIRA'S natural beauty, temperate climate and lack of crime are its greatest attractions, according to tourists questioned in a recent survey carried out for the regional government. What spoiled things, they said, was the heavy traffic, noise and pollution in the capital, Funchal, where the holiday hotels are concentrated. At Reid's, the palatial 101-year-old hotel that caters to the top end of the tourist market, a related concern is frequently expressed. 'What guests don't like is all this building work,' says Mr Peter Spath, the hotel's German-born general manager. 'They have seen other examples like the Canaries and Torremolinos, and they're scared it will become the same here.' These two complaints epitomise the difficulty facing Madeira's tourist industry: how to achieve further growth without harming the island's natural assets and antagonising the very segment of the market on which tourism depends most heavily. The majority of tourists are middle-aged or elderly people from Britain, Germany and Scandinavia, who escape the north European winter for the tranquillity and balmy temperatures of an Atlantic island lying 400 miles west of Morocco. A good proportion come back again and again. Madeira has attracted tourists for 200 years, building its reputation in the last century as a health resort for Europe's wealthy and titled. At first they came on ocean liners, later on flying boats, until the opening of the airport at Funchal in 1964 put the island on the modern tourist map. It has so far avoided the mass market - there are, for example, only 15,000 hotel beds compared with nearly 200,000 in the Canaries, and they are concentrated in four-and five-star hotels. But tourism is profitable and the industry is expanding fast. It has become Madeira's leading source of revenue, contributing 23 per cent of GDP and employing about a fifth of the workforce directly and indirectly. Today, Madeira depends on tour operators for nearly 70 per cent of its market. The change is not to every islander's taste. 'We're even getting tourists who bring their own food,' sniffs an elderly expatriate. In the past few years, many summer visitors have begun to arrive from Portugal, Spain, Italy and France. The low season is confined to May and June, and international conferences are being encouraged to take up the slack. About 470,000 visitors are expected this year, the same number as last year, when Madeira benefited from an extra influx of tourists scared away from the Mediterranean by the Gulf war. The success of the industry inevitably suggests further growth. Demand is reflected in the 75 per cent occupancy rate in Madeira's hotels. Ageing populations in Europe and America mean more, better-off customers with time on their hands, and Madeira has a particularly young population available to serve them. But the government is aware of the dangers of rapid development. 'The quality of the environment will be important,' says Mr Miguel de Sousa, vice-president in charge of the economy. 'People will seek quality. If Madeira is successful, it will be on that basis.' The plan is therefore to limit the increase in accommodation so that the island has a maximum of 22,000 beds by the end of the century and to set guidelines for new developments. Mr Carlos Alberto Silva, director of tourism, admits that Madeira has not been strict enough with developers in the past. 'Now we're making new investments more sensitive, using roofs with tiles to keep the local character,' he says. High-rise concrete hotels are still springing up in and around Funchal, but there are examples of more harmonious building, such as the 38 apartments and six town houses that comprise the luxurious Reid's Gardens development, with red-tiled roofs and architecture which blends with the famous hotel on the promontory above. The government is encouraging new, smaller hotels and guesthouses in the west of the island. A highway between Funchal and Ribeira Brava, 40 km to the west, is due to be finished at the end of 1994. It will cut the journey from half an hour to 10 minutes and bring the countryside to the city, says Mr Silva. It will also ease the congestion in Funchal, where half the island's 250,000 people live. Another important development will be the 1,000-metre extension of the airport runway, due to be completed in 1996 or 1997. This will allow intercontinental flights, enabling the island to promote itself in the US and Japan, and in South America, where many Madeiran emigrants live. Few young families come to Madeira because it has no sandy beaches. But there is a 9km beach on Porto Santo, an hour and half's boat ride or 15 minutes' flight away. The number of beds there has doubled to 800 in the past three years, and further expansion is planned, up to a maximum of 2,500 beds, in the hope that tour operators will begin to sell package holidays there - the island, although otherwise undeveloped, has a 3,000 metre runway. The lack of beaches on Madeira has encouraged the industry to develop other outdoor activities and niche markets. Deep sea fishing and diving is becoming popular. Two new golf courses, of 18 and 27 holes, are under construction outside Funchal. Up to 30 different walks are available along the irrigation channels, or levadas, that criss-cross the mountains. For the business market, a 1,500-capacity conference centre is due to open in two years' time outside Funchal. So far there has been little foreign investment, but some of the big international hotel chains are beginning to show an interest. All this bodes well for the industry, though not in every case for the environment. Some islanders and long-standing visitors fear that Madeira's beauty will be ruined by tourism. Others are more optimistic, believing that the island's cliff-lined coasts and rugged, inhospitable interior will prove their own best defence against the excesses of man.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Safeway in Dollars 1.7m loss for quarter SAFEWAY, one of the largest US food retailers with more than 1,100 stores in the US and Canada, yesterday reported a Dollars 1.7m loss after tax in the three months to March 27, compared with a Dollars 22.9m surplus, before extraordinary items, in the same period of 1992. Sales during the period edged ahead from Dollars 3.39bn to Dollars 3.4bn. Operating profits fell from Dollars 102.4m to Dollars 42.3m, while interest expenses decreased from Dollars 70.3m to Dollars 63.2m. Safeway was subject to a Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, and remains fairly heavily indebted. The California-based company blamed the loss on its problems in Alberta. Low-cost competitors have undermined Safeway's position there, and the US company has negotiated a new contract with local employees which rolls back wages and provides a voluntary buy-out programme. Safeway said yesterday that the number of employees accepting the buy-out by April 30 'far exceeded expectations'. However, the first quarter figures included a Dollars 27.5m charge, after tax, to cover the buy-out programme. The company also cut prices sharply in Alberta - a move which boosted first-quarter sales but hit operating margins.</p>

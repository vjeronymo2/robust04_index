			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Bonn and Tokyo stress political role THE LEADERS of Germany and Japan agreed in Bonn yesterday that their countries should play a greater part in international politics, in keeping with their economic importance. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, called for political questions - such as arms control and drug trafficking - to be given greater prominence by the Group of Seven industrialised states in their preparation for the July world economic summit in Munich. He sought the support of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as of President Francois Mitterrand, whom he met in Paris on Wednesday, for closer Japanese involvement in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Japanese argument to step up the political content in the G7, a suggestion regarded with some suspicion in Paris, is based on the grounds that this is one of the very few world groupings in which Japan plays a full role. His plea was met with understanding by Chancellor Kohl, according to an official spokesman. Mr Kohl spoke of the need to provide more assistance for the economic and political stabilisation of the states of the former Soviet Union, the one point on which the two sides are still divided. Mr Miyazawa outlined the continuing Japanese problem with the Russian federation over the Kurile islands, occupied by Soviet forces after the second world war. He made it clear that while Japan had agreed to support financially the Dollars 24bn package of assistance for the current year put together by the G7, the IMF and the World Bank, any further assistance would depend on reaching agreement with Russia on the islands. The issue seems likely to be raised by Japan at Munich, when G7 leaders are expected to meet President Boris Yeltsin of Russia in a separate forum after their summit meeting. Ian Davidson adds from Paris: President Mitterrand promised moral support to Japan in its efforts to secure the return of the northern territories. But he did not respond to Mr Miyazawa's request that the issue be placed on the Munich agenda, telling the Japanese prime minister this was essentially a bilateral problem between Japan and Russia, which should be settled by negotiation. France and Japan agreed to step up their political and economic dialogue, to the gratification of the French authorities, following the chill provoked by the anti-Japanese rhetoric of the previous French prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHAMIR, SHARON EXCHANGE VERBAL BLOWS;  </P> <P> CLASH OCCURS OVER TALKS WITH PALESTINIANS ABOUT ELECTION PLAN  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and hawkish rival Ariel Sharon clashed angrily in  a closed-door meeting Wednesday night over talks with Palestinians on an  Israeli plan for elections in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> Political sources said Trade Minister Sharon, who insists there must be no  balloting before an end to the uprising, attacked Shamir in front of Likud  Party ministers.  </P> <P> Israeli newspapers, briefed by ministers close to Shamir, published  near-identical accounts of the exchange.  </P> <P> Asked by Sharon why he had not been informed of the talks with local Arabs,  which Sharon views as harmful to Israel's security, Shamir was quoted as  saying:  </P> <P> "Everyone in this room hears secrets from me, and they do not leak them. You  leak everything. It's impossible to tell you anything."  </P> <P> Sharon retorted: "I am not prepared and not able to compete with you in  vulgarity. I have only contempt for your behavior."  </P> <P> Shamir: "You create an ugly atmosphere and hatred among us."  </P> <P> Sharon: "I can only laugh at your statements."  </P> <P> Shamir: "We'll see who laughs last."  </P> <P> Newspapers quoted ministers close to Shamir as saying the premier may be forced  to fire Sharon if he does not stop such attacks.  </P> <P> As defense minister, Sharon led Israel's costly 1982 invasion of Lebanon to  evict PLO guerrillas. He was forced to resign in 1983 for indirect  responsibility in a massacre by Lebanese Christians of Palestinian civilians in  refugee camps in an Israeli-controlled area of Beirut.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Palestinian lawyers today announced a one-month boycott of Israeli  military courts in the occupied West Bank, accusing Israel of violating basic  legal principles.  </P> <P> Bahig Tamimi, head of the Arab Lawyers Assn., said the 250 lawyers in his  organization will refuse to appear before the military courts until Aug. 20.  </P></p>

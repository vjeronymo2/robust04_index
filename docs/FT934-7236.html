			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Packer raises stake in John Fairfax MR KERRY Packer, the Australian businessman, has raised his interest in John Fairfax, the newspaper publisher, to 14.97 per cent - within a whisker of the maximum 15 per cent stake permitted. Nine Network Australia, the quoted media company in which Mr Packer's Consolidated Press holds a large minority interest, said it had bought 29.5m participating convertible notes in John Fairfax from Hellmann &amp; Friedman, the US investment banking business. The price was ADollars 3.05 per note, or close to ADollars 90m (USDollars 59m) overall. The purchase takes Nine Network's total holding in Fairfax to 82.39m shares and notes, or 10.42 per cent of the newspaper group's issued capital. When added to 36m shares held by ConsPress, the total stake in Fairfax held by Nine and its associates is 118.39m shares and notes, representing 14.97 per cent of Fairfax. Nine Network Australia said it agreed to buy the notes in Fairfax in line with its policy 'of being a long-term strategic investor in Fairfax'. A political dust-up developed yesterday after Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon, said he was interested in increasing his 25 per cent stake in John Fairfax. The stake is pegged at this level by foreign ownership rules, but Mr Black claimed, on ABC television, he had spoken to Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, about a relaxation of the limit. His comments were given an added twist because, in a newly published biography, Mr Black said Mr Keating had undertaken to consider lifting foreign ownership restrictions on the Fairfax papers if the papers became more disciplined in terms of political balance. The suggestion that ownership concessions could be tied to editorial coverage prompted angry outbursts from opposition leaders. However, Mr Keating said he had not received any specific proposal from Mr Black to increase his holding in Fairfax. 'I saw Conrad Black the other day . . . and mostly as all proprietors do, he asked for something,' Mr Keating was reported as saying. 'In Conrad's case he wants a bigger share of John Fairfax. I've told him that there are real national interest questions and something easily given isn't something generally worth having.' Asked if he had made any increase conditional on balanced reporting, Mr Keating replied: 'I had a conversation with Mr Black late last year when John Hewson (leader of the opposition Liberal Party) offered him 50 per cent of equity in Fairfax, and I said to him I wouldn't consider that, but I would consider going to 25 per cent. 'I said we'll think about (a request to lift Black's holding above a then 14.9 per cent) but we want a commitment from you that the papers will be balanced, and if there is any notion of bias, that is, that you barrack for the coalition on the basis of conservative proclivities in other places, then there's no way you would qualify as the kind of owner we would like.'</p>

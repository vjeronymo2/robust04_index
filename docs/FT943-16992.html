			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Technology: Smart selling to big spenders - Databases will soon be able to tell stores what individual customers like for breakfast, explains Victoria Griffith in a series on electronic retailing Every salesperson would like to see into the minds of customers, to know exactly what they want and when they want it. While telepathy is beyond modern technology, many retail businesses are turning to the next best thing  -databases with extensive information about consumers. In the US, Europe and Asia, companies are developing sophisticated computer-based programs to store customer details, from addresses and telephone numbers to monthly consumption of fax paper and expensive wines. Clever marketing executives can turn this information to their advantage. If a New York resident shops regularly at Giorgio Armani on Madison Avenue and is known to spend time in France on business, Armani might be well advised to tell the consumer about its Paris store. Information can also help retailers screen out less attractive customers - ones who only buy deeply discounted items, for example, may not be worth courting. Most marketing is still highly unselective. Gourmet cooks are unlikely to dine at McDonald's but still see commercials for Big Mac hamburgers on television. A proportion of McDonald's advertising budget, therefore, is spent on people who will probably never enter the fast-food outlet. Targeted marketing, on the other hand, allows companies to reward loyal customers and avoid wasting money on promotions to unlikely buyers. Because it can cost so much to attract new customers, maintaining a loyal customer base can make a huge financial difference. 'The longer a company keeps a customer, the more money it stands to make,' says Frederick Reichheld of Bain and Co, a Boston-based consulting group. 'This is not only because companies do not need to spend as much money on advertising to recruit new customers. Faithful customers are also important because the longer they have done business with a company the more money they tend to spend.' The methods that retailers use to build their databases vary. Consumers must be enticed to reveal information about themselves. For catalogue companies, which have addresses for all their customers, the task is easier. LL Bean, a Maine-based sporting and leisure goods mail-order company, has sales histories that go back decades. Retail stores, such as consumer goods manufacturers, have a harder time tracking purchasers. Asking people to write in for free products is one way to build up a database. US cigarette companies have used this method extensively over the past few years, maintaining comprehensive lists of smokers. The scheme also means that smokers may be the only ones to receive magazines that carry cigarette advertisements - the non-smokers receive the same publications without the advertisements. Retailers often ask customers to fill out a card so they can be informed of forthcoming sales. In this way, shops can build up a substantial mailing list. But such methods produce limited results, usually nothing more than an address and perhaps a telephone number. Retail tracking is more efficient when done with magnetic stripe cards that automatically register purchases in a computer program. Staples, the Boston-based office-goods retailer, offers shoppers a free membership card when they make their first purchase at the store. The card entitles shoppers to discounts on selected items and provides valuable information to the chain. Since customers are encouraged to use their card with each purchase, the company can track how much of certain items the customer is buying, at what times of the year and at what prices. Staples can evaluate a number of company strategies. It can assess the impact on sales of a particular fax paper being displayed prominently in a store. It can also use the database to bring back customers who have defected. If a consumer has purchased large amounts of copy paper each month for two years and suddenly stops, a company representative can try to find out why and respond. Staples now provides a delivery service after discovering that the lack of one was a main reason for defections. The widespread use of credit cards means they can be an important source of information. American Express provides a service to retailers that can help target specific customer needs. In the UK, it is about to experiment with a new system that would provide information about products to likely buyers on the monthly credit card bill. 'If someone buys a lot of food at a department store but has never entered the wine section, the store might offer a free bottle of wine with the next purchase,' says Maureen Bailey, for the group. 'That information would show up on the American Express bill.' Companies are increasingly exchanging information, maximising information about consumers and cutting the cost of building and maintaining the database. An important cross-fertilisation scheme is being launched later this year in the UK. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph of the US is setting up a new scheme, called Istel, to help retailers build databases and provide incentives to loyal customers. Under the programme, customers will be invited to join the Istel club, entitling them to a magnetic stripe card and potential discounts on various items available in do-it-yourself shops, grocery stores, petrol stations, clothing and toy shops, and other retail groups. The scheme has a recruitment target of 8m card holders, and AT&amp;T estimates that consumers will be able to save about Pounds 180 a year by using the card when they shop at member stores. AT&amp;T will process the information obtained from the card users for the retailers. 'The grocer may like to know who is a high spender within the scheme but is not shopping with them,' says Ruth Kemp, for the group. 'Then they can offer incentives to use their store. Retailers will also know for the first time who their customers are. 'When people move house, for example, retailers often lose valuable customers. With the information on the database it will be possible to track customers. They could tell them where their nearest store now is, offer them incentives to shop there and provide them with a 'welcome to your new home' pack.' Not everyone is happy with retailers' new love affair with databases. The US media has heavily criticised the 'Big Brother' aspect, which allows companies to record so many details about people's lives. AT&amp;T says it will proceed with caution. 'All the current data protection laws will be strictly adhered to and the card holder information will remain confidential to each individual retailer,' says Kemp. 'Customers may choose not to be sent any direct marketing. Our research shows that consumers' irritation with direct marketing is with unsolicited mail that is of no interest to them. 'The information held will result in tightly targeted direct marketing, so consumers should receive information that is genuinely of interest to them. For example, if we see you are buying a lot of garden products, you may well be interested in receiving a spring bulb catalogue.' Despite concerns over information flow, membership schemes that offer discounts and purchasing incentives seem to be the retailers' best chance of keeping track of customer purchases. 'As part of a scheme or club, people's sense of belonging is established by regular communication,' says Kemp. 'Participants do not see this type of communication as invasive.'</p>

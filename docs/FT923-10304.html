			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / BT chairman attacks watchdogs MR Iain Vallance, BT chairman, yesterday accused the regulators of privatised industries of threatening the success of the privatisation programme of the 1980s. He coupled the attack, at his annual shareholders' meeting in Birmingham, with a warning that BT would find it very difficult to accept the tighter price-controlled regime put forward by Oftel, the industry regulator. If Oftel and BT cannot agree on controls, the issue will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Oftel has told BT to cut the price of a basket of its basic services each year by inflation minus 7.5 percentage points, compared with 6.25 points at present. The company has also been told to ensure small retail customers share in the price cuts. Mr Vallance said the proposed new price regime was 'extremely tough by any standard' and many of the detailed provisions would add to the negative impact of the proposals on BT. He called for a change in the regulatory regime which would leave 'management free without interference' and the need for a commercial price structure based on cost. Mr Vallance said: 'It is also unclear how the regulators themselves are to be held accountable. The regulated industries have little right of appeal, and, in practice, no effective recourse to judicial review. 'We firmly believe that there is an issue of governance concerning the regulators which the government must tackle if the real successes of the privatisation programme of the 1980s are not to be undermined.' Mr Vallance complained that if BT failed to agree with Oftel, the only course was to allow the matter to be referred to the MMC. 'This is by any standards a major undertaking, involving huge demands on senior management time.' BT and Oftel have recently talked privately about the possibility of referring the proposed new price regime to the MMC, which has the power to impose a solution. However, as BT and Oftel have threatened to go to the MMC several times in the past, the present dispute seems to point to the two sides' tough negotiating stances rather than a total breakdown of talks.</p>

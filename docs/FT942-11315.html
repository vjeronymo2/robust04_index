			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: E London is urged to reject BNP Voters on the Isle of Dogs, east London, yesterday came under strong pressure to reject the far-right British National Party as they went to the polls in an unusually tense atmosphere. An increase in racial violence since the BNP won its first local authority seat - in a Tower Hamlets council by-election on the island last September - led to voting taking place under conditions of tight security. Large numbers of police were visible near polling stations and on the streets of the island. Fears of intimidation led to a measure remarkable in a British election  - legal monitors at polling stations. Liberty, the civil liberties organisation, took the decision to station a team of 30 lawyers on the Isle of Dogs after complaints by Asian residents that they had faced abuse and threats during the by-election. Party representatives, community workers and clergy yesterday all offered to accompany voters who might fear intimidation. The Rt Rev Richard Chartres, Anglican bishop of Stepney, and the Rt Rev Victor Guazzelli, Roman Catholic bishop of East London, joined a vigil for racial harmony at the Isle of Dogs parish church which included Christian, Jewish and Islamic prayers. The bishops were among east London clergy who put their names to a strongly-worded statement expressing concern at the BNP, but adding: 'As church leaders in the East End we feel for all the people of the area and their disillusionment with the political process, which so far seems to have failed them.' Part of the reason for the BNP finding acceptance, said the statement, was that Tower Hamlets - one of the poorest areas in Europe - suffered high unemployment and lack of housing. There was a stark contrast between office development in Docklands and poverty and deprivation in the community. The editors of the East End's two newspapers urged their readers to consider the potentially negative consequences of voting BNP. Mr Tom Duncan, editor of the Docklands Recorder, wrote: 'Vote if you feel you must for the British National Party - but do so in the knowledge that you are voting for people who have nothing to offer you other than hatred and even more misery.' As the polls closed and police reinforcements moved in, two fears hung over east London. The more immediate was that the BNP might strengthen its position, provoking further racial disharmony and violence in a borough where a third of the population is from ethnic minorities. The second was that the BNP would be resoundingly defeated - and that the government and national political parties would see last year's by-election result as an aberration with no lasting lessons. The problems facing east London were 'beyond the capacity of local resources to solve,' warned the clergy statement.</p>

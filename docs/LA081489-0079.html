			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EVEN SOME OF THE BAD GUYS WILL MISS HIM  </P> <P> Sitting in the lounge of Reuben's restaurant, John McClain looks more like one  of the courthouse lawyer crowd surrounding him than a guy who first became a  cop during the heyday of "Dragnet."  </P> <P> His suit looks expensive, he drinks Grand Marnier. The only thing unfashionable  about him are the Pall-Mall nonfilters he puffs for the next seven hours on  this, the last night of his 30-year career with the Santa Ana Police  Department.  </P> <P> Can this be the guy who solved all but one of his murder cases before turning  in his badge last week? The detective who wooed a confession out of a killer  who ate his victim's heart? An investigator who gets thank-you's and Christmas  cards from burglars and murderers he has busted?  </P> <P> You bet, say his fans, including prosecutors and judges, criminal defense  attorneys and his barber of 15 years, and many others who dropped by the bar to  say farewell. One fan, a free-lance writer, hopes to feature McClain in a  detective magazine.  </P> <P> "If we have a half-dozen outstanding homicide police detectives in this county,  he is absolutely one of them," said James G. Enright, Orange County's chief  deputy district attorney.  </P> <P> But with his 30 years on the force, McClain, 53, is eligible for a pension  equal to 75% of his salary. He plans to take some time to decompress, then  pursue a new career with the skills of his old profession: consulting for law  firms that specializes in defending cops.  </P> <P> Says Enright: "He will be missed."  </P> <P> McClain grew up in a succession of homes in Southern California, the result of  his parents' divorces and remarriages. He sometimes loses count of them all.  Football offered him a sense of belonging and he played on scholarships for  both Riverside City College and San Diego State. A knee injury (his third)  ended his college football career.  </P> <P> He joined the Army and became a military policeman, serving 1 1/2 years in  Korea. He finished his 3-year tour at Ft. Lewis, Wash.  </P> <P> In 1959, McClain decided while reading a magazine that he would become a cop, a  story he tells with his trademark dry humor. The magazine combined scantily  dressed women and "articles like, 'I Fought My Way Out of a Tribe of  Blood-Thirsty Pygmies in the South African Jungle,' " McClain said. "High  adventure stuff."  </P> <P> "I was lying around in the barracks . . . wondering what I was going to do  next, and picked up this magazine. There was a page full of things for men  interested in high adventure, including job openings for police officers in  Santa Ana."  </P> <P> He bought a '52 yellow and black Mercury and headed south. The car broke down  along the way, so he rolled it off a cliff and hitchhiked the rest of the way.  He joined the Santa Ana police force that month and married a few years later.  He has a daughter, 28, and a son, 27, from that marriage, which ended in  divorce. He has since remarried.  </P> <P> In 1964 McClain left patrol for the investigations bureau, where he handled a  variety of crimes. "Resorting," a now defunct city law, was one of them. Men  and women who stole off to have sex out of wedlock in motels were guilty of  "resorting," said McClain, who mused that he always felt sheepish arresting  someone "for resorting to something we were all interested in doing."  </P> <P> At both solving a crime and finding the bad guy, McClain was gifted, former  partners and co-workers said.  </P> <P> In those pre-Miranda rights days, he said, it was much easier to get a burglar  to confess. But former partners and colleagues say McClain also made his own  luck because of his way with people. They say he is able to size them up,  figure out how to appeal to them, then say just the right thing to get them to  talk.  </P> <P> There was the case of Bob, a member of a gang suspected of commiting a rash of  burglaries 25 years ago, including a break-in at the presidential campaign  headquarters of Barry Goldwater.  </P> <P> Unlike most burglars, Bob did not drink or take drugs. He just got in with the  wrong crowd. When Bob was captured in Florida, McClain flew back to bring his  prisoner home for trial. The jailers there barely provided Bob with food and  water and, in fact, treated him roughly. McClain fed Bob, then gave him what he  calls "The Program."  </P> <P> The shackles could be removed and Bob could walk to the car with dignity if he  agreed to walk one step ahead and one step to the left of McClain. "That way,"  McClain recalled telling him, "everybody won't be staring at you like a dog,  and more importantly they won't be staring at me. Now, if you pull something  funny, it's not going to be like TV where I chase you up and down escalators.  I'll just have to shoot you dead. OK, Bob?"  </P> <P> Bob nodded. They got in the car and McClain told Bob he wanted him to tell the  truth, to unburden himself of the burglaries by telling him all about them,  every one of them.  </P> <P> With a heavy sigh, Bob confided that, yes, he had given it deep thought in his  jail cell and he wanted to tell the truth -- about all three burglaries.  McClain then proceeded to explain the "Posse Comma Tosse" law. He told Bob that  if he revealed the whole truth about the number of break-ins, McClain would be  able to take him to California for trial. Otherwise, McClain would have to  invoke the nonexistent "Posse Comma Tosse" law and leave Bob to the  inhospitable jailers in Florida.  </P> <P> That's when Bob admitted his math was a little off -- there were actually four  dozen burglaries in which he had participated. Then he took notebook and pencil  and wrote down every one of them and included the where and when and how they  were accomplished.  </P> <P> Twenty-five years later -- and one day before McClain's retirement -- Bob (who  served several years in prison for the crimes) showed up at police  headquarters. He had read about McClain's retirement and wanted to wish him  well, to tell him he was making a clean living installing car stereos, to thank  him for turning his life around.  </P> <P> "He said he wanted to thank me for treating him like a man when I could have  treated him like a dog," McClain said, still marveling at the whole thing.  </P> <P> "That is a classic McClain story," said Jay Mosely, a deputy district attorney  who has known McClain for 24 years.  </P> <P> In 1965, McClain moved to crimes against persons, a detective bureau that  investigated murders, rapes, armed robberies and other assaults. These, he  said, were "real crimes, crimes that everybody just knows are wrong. You can't  undo the fact that someone was killed, but the work itself was great."  </P> <P> For the next 10 years, McClain developed a reputation for being "one of the  young, hard-working hotshot detectives," Enright recalled. Of the 37 murder  cases he was assigned, McClain solved all but one. And in that case, the only  witness to the crime -- the victim -- died after refusing to identify his  assailant.  </P> <P> Former partner Larry J. Cornelison, now resident agent in charge of the Santa  Ana office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, tells the  story of the pair's investigation into a grisly hatchet slaying of a service  station attendant.  </P> <P> There were few leads until a man called detectives to report that he had spent  the night in jail with a man who bragged of the killing, a man who wore what  turned out to be the brand new but blood-spattered denim jacket of the victim.  McClain and Cornelison traced the jacket to a drifter named Steve Hurd and  arrested him.  </P> <P> Hurd insisted he was someone else, that he had stolen the jacket from the real  Hurd. As they sat across the table from Hurd, McClain and Cornelison gave the  guy the two-punch. Cornelison preached of the immorality of stealing the  jacket. McClain, who had been nodding sympathetically as Hurd spoke, all of a  sudden slammed his hand down on the table and said, "You took the most  important thing to this guy, you took his life!"  </P> <P> Hurd hung his head in his hands and tearfully confessed to his role in the  hatchet killing -- plus one more murder.  </P> <P> "He was very charitable at this point and he said, 'Well, now that I'm telling  you this I might as well tell you about the other one," McClain recalled. "And  we said, 'Uh, sure.' "  </P> <P> It turned out that the suspect had been involved in the brutal slaying of a  schoolteacher whose heart had been removed by Hurd and his fellow  Satan-worshipers and consumed by them.  </P> <P> Hurd was convicted of the crimes and is still in prison.  </P> <P> McClain "just knows what to say at the perfect time," Deputy D.A. Mosely said.  </P> <P> The veteran detective-sergeant's career almost ended eight months ago when  then-Chief Clyde Cronkite gave him four days' notice that he was being  transferred from the detective bureau to patrol.  </P> <P> "They picked the wrong guy to mess with," said Don Blankenship, president of  the Police Benevolent Assn. "Guys were figuring, if they would do this to this  guy, it could happen to anybody."  </P> <P> Charging that his transfer and that of several others was punishment for their  roles as union wage negotiators, McClain won a Superior Court restraining order  temporarily blocking the transfer. A few weeks later, Cronkite quit and new  Chief Paul Walters reinstated McClain and others.  </P> <P> McClain said he decided five years ago to quit police work as soon as he  reached the age when his retirement pension was at its highest. That was Aug.  8, last Tuesday.  </P> <P> "You're almost crazy not to leave when you reach this point so you can go work  somewhere else. At 75% of my salary? And besides, I think 30 years is enough at  this. There's more to life than this."  </P> <P> McClain was remarried nearly 9 years ago to Bonnie, real estate broker and  herself a former Santa Ana police officer and the city's first woman sergeant.  </P> <P> Besides pursuing a job as a consultant to law firms that specialize in  defending cops, McClain is busying himself making a blackjack table for a small  retirement party he is throwing himself this weekend.  </P> <P> "I got a little weepy when I turned in the badge," he said, "but I have no  regrets. It was a good job."  </P></p>

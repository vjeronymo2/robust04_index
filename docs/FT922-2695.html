			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Letter: A single currency in fact if not in name Sir, 'A Big Idea is still needed, in default of the Maastricht ambitions, to hold European currencies together' (Samuel Brittan, Economic Viewpoint, June 11). The Big Idea is the single European currency. It is central to the Maastricht Treaty. Mr Brittan is keener on the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) than on economic and monetary union (EMU). Yet the ERM is, as Sir Alan Walters pointed out, half-baked. Mr Brittan's ideas for developing the ERM can be carried out only by moving through stages two and three of EMU as agreed in the treaty by all 12 EC governments. The convergence on price and exchange rate stability which Mr Brittan wants can be achieved only by a mutual discipline of the kind laid down in the treaty. As long as the ERM allows for realignments, national politicians, as devaluers of last resort, will want to be free to use them, and fixed exchange rates will lack credibility in the markets. Mr Brittan's market-based approach to competing currencies will not work as long as governments maintain laws which discriminate against foreign currency in favour of domestic currency. The importance of legal tender laws (in the wider sense of that term) has not, as he claims, been exaggerated, but underestimated. There will inevitably be a transition period in stage three of EMU when national currencies are completely fixed, as Mr Brittan wants, and the ecu is still a parallel currency. We will have a single monetary policy, and thus a single currency in fact if not in name. The Maastricht Treaty wisely does not go into detail on such points, but it provides the framework within which they can be settled later.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> d. The Owner, acting through the Engineer may from time to time during the progress of the construction of the Project make such changes, additions or subtractions from the Plans, Specifications, Construction Drawings, List of Materials and sequence of construction provided for in the previous paragraph which are part of the Contractor's Proposal as conditions may warrant: Provided, however, that if any change in the construction to be done shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension will be granted if the Bidder shall make a written request therefore to the Owner within (10) days after any such change is made. And provided further, that if the cost to the Bidder of construction of the project shall be materially increased by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Bidder for the reasonable cost thereof in accordance with a Construction Contract Amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder, but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Bidder shall have made a written request therefore to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. The Bidder will not perform any work hereunder on Sundays unless there is urgent need for such Sunday work and the Owner consents thereto in writing. The time for completion specified in subsection a of this Section 1 shall not be affected in any way by inclusion of this subsection nor by the Owner's consent or lack of consent to Sunday work hereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2. Environmental Protection. The Bidder shall perform work in such a manner as to maximize preservation of beauty, consideration of natural resources and minimize marring and scarring of the landscape and silting of streams. The Bidder shall not deposit trash in streams or waterways, and shall not deposit herbicides or other chemicals or their containers in or near streams, waterways or pastures. The Bidder shall follow the criteria relating to environmental protection as specified herein by the Engineer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3. Tools, Equipment, and Qualified Personnel. The Bidder agrees that in the event this Proposal is accepted it will make available for use in connection with the proposed construction all necessary tools and equipment and qualified superintendents and foremen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4. Changes in Construction. The Bidder agrees to make such changes in construction previously erected in the Project by the Bidder as required by the Owner for prices arrived at as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. For substations and other units where only a portion of the complete unit is affected by the change, the compensation for such change shall be as agreed upon in writing by the Bidder and the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. For all other units, the compensation for such change shall be the reasonable cost thereof as agreed upon by the Bidder and the Owner, but in no event shall it exceed two (2) times the labor price quoted in the Proposal for the installation of the unit to be changed. Such compensation shall be in lieu of any other payment for the installation and removal of the original unit. (If a new or replacing unit is installed, payment for such new or replacing unit shall be made as shown in the final inventory.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No payment shall be made to the Bidder for materials or labor involved in correcting errors or omissions on the part of the Bidder which result in construction not in accordance with the Plans and Specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5. Construction Not in Proposal. The Bidder also agrees that when it is necessary to construct units not shown in the Proposal it will construct such units for a price arrived at as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The cost of materials shall be determined by the invoices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The cost of labor shall be the reasonable cost thereof, but in no event shall it exceed an amount determined by calculating the ratio of the total labor costs to the total material costs in the section of the Proposal involved, and multiplying the cost of materials for the unit in question by this ratio: Provided, however, that in respect of sections H, M, and N, the ratio shall be calculated for only those units of the section which are similar to the new unit for which a price is to be determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6. Supervision and Inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The Bidder shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent (hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where construction is being carried on. The Bidder shall also employ, in connection with the construction of the Project, capable, experienced and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given to the Superintendent shall be binding upon the Bidder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder if in the judgment of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner or the Supervisor, if any, shall have the right to require the Bidder to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner or Supervisor; but the failure of the Owner or Supervisor to give any such directions shall not relieve the Bidder of its obligations to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The construction of the Project and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection, tests, and acceptance by the Owner and the Administrator and the Bidder shall furnish all information required by the Owner or by the Administrator concerning the nature or source of any materials incorporated or to be incorporated in the Project. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials, and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the construction of the Project. The Bidder shall provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests and shall maintain an office at the site of the Project, with telephone service where obtainable and at least one office employee to whom directions and instructions of the Owner may be delivered. Delivery of such directions or instructions in writing to the employee of the Bidder at such office shall constitute delivery to the Bidder. The Bidder shall have an authorized agent accompany the Engineer when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. In the event that the Owner, or the Administrator, shall determine that the construction contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent and location of such defects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhal Sela' and On Levi] </F>   [Text] The PLO has ordered the cancellation of all  contractual relationships between Civil Administration bodies in  Gaza and Jericho and Israeli companies and public organizations.  If this order is followed, the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho  might find themselves cut off from the supply of essential basic  services, such as electricity, water, medication, gasoline, food  products, and other essential consumption goods.    The Israeli delegation to the talks on civilian issues was  notified of the move by Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the  corresponding Palestinian delegation. DAVAR learned this from  senior members of the Israeli delegation. The order came as an  unpleasant surprise to the Israeli delegation and caused grave  concern regarding the immediate future. The Civil  Administration had asked to hand over the management of the  affairs under its jurisdiction in an orderly manner that would  include an overlap and transfer of the services it currently  provides to the residents of Gaza and Jericho.    Furthermore, according to the agreements in principle, the  Civil Administration system was supposed to be handed over to  the Palestinians in its entirety and continue working in its  present form. According to the Palestinian development plan,  changes in this system were to be made gradually, based on  available budgets.    The Israeli delegates proposed that the contracts be  canceled  in a few months, after the autonomy administration begins  operating and is well established, but the Palestinians rejected  the proposal. In view of this, all suppliers and companies with  which the Civil Administration had contractual relations have  been notified that their contracts will be terminated as of 17  May.    The residents of the territories, who know that there are no  other sources that can provide the services, were also surprised  by the order. In discussions with them, it became apparent that  Palestinians from outside the territories who are participating  in the talks on civilian issues do not have the slightest idea  about how life is run in the territories. For example, the  Palestinians from outside the territories did not know that all  electrical power in the territories comes from Israel.    The contracts in question provide the legal framework for  the  establishment of business ties between residents of the  territories and Israeli suppliers, through the Civil  Administration. The supply of power to Gaza, for example, is  based on a contract between the Israel Electric Corporation and  the municipalities and local councils in the Gaza Strip,  according to which those bodies and not private persons are the  "consumers" of the service. If these contracts are terminated  before an alternative source of power is found, Gaza will be  left without electricity.    It was learned yesterday that, after they realized that it  might cause distress in the coming several weeks, members of the  Palestinian delegation expressed regret over their decision to  cancel the contracts. Nonetheless, the contracts were not  renewed and no new ones have been signed.</p>

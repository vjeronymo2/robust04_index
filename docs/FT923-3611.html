			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Californian sushi may fall victim to Japanese rice ban A JAPANESE plan to import frozen sushi - a raw fish and rice ball - from the US may be blocked by the National Food Agency, which enforces the Japan's ban on imported rice. Sushi Boy, an Osaka-based food distributor and retailer, wants to import sushi from California, where the rice ball will be blended in the traditional way and frozen for shipment. Because the company claims it will be able to sell the sushi for 30 per cent less than local prices, its competitors are alarmed. But the most important barrier is the Food Agency, which has the duty to ensure that Japan's rice import ban is not violated. There are exceptions to the import ban. Individuals can bring in rice for personal use, and companies are permitted to import prepared rice dishes such as pilaff, as long as at least 20 per cent of total weight is in vegetables or meat. Importers of prepared dishes must also prove that the rice cannot be easily separated, because the Food Agency is wary of companies attempting to get around the ban by filtering vegetables out of the pilaff and reselling the rice. The agency said its biggest concern in the Sushi Boy case was that the structure of sushi would allow for easy separation of the rice: 'We want to see exactly how the ingredients are prepared.' The agency, for example, allows imports of curried rice in which the rice and curry are blended, but forbids curried rice in which the curry comes in a separate sachet. Mr Masahiro Nanba, a manager of Sushi Boy's trade department, said its sushi would easily meet the weight requirements. The average slice of tuna weighs 10 grams, while the rice tips the scales at 23g. He was also confident that the tuna and the rice would not separate in transit: 'By freezing the sushi, we should be able to ensure that the two stay together.'</p>

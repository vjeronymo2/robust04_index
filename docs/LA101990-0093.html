Today, I will bet $25  to win and place on Hajasala in the fifth race.  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger's Thu. bankroll: $2,126  </P> <P> Thursday's Loss: $30  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $2,096  </P> <P> SURELOCK, wishing trifecta wagering were legal, was a winner when his exacta  box of Really Brilliant, Saratogan and Charging Raj ran one, two, three in the  eighth. Today, he will try to continue his success with $40 to win and place on  Comical in the seventh.  </P> <P> SURELOCK's Thu. bankroll: $700  </P> <P> Thursday's Profit: $14  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $714  </P> <P> Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in.

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / A very British system The tumbril may be on its way to Mr Norman Lamont, perhaps rightly so. Yet he should not resign over the recent stories about his personal financial affairs. As Mr Kenneth Clarke says, these are plain silly. It is of little interest that Mr Lamont used a credit card to buy Pounds 17.47 worth of drink. Whether it was champagne or wine matters even less. If his account was overdue, titch. That is why they are called credit cards. Access and Visa would collapse if everyone paid on time. This episode puts the chancellor in a favourable light. It proves that he is not drinking at the taxpayer's expense. The other matter is hardly more serious. The Treasury paid some Pounds 4,000 towards a Pounds 23,000 legal bill. The chancellor had discovered that a tenant of his was a 'sex therapist'. Mr Peter Carter-Ruck's legal firm was brought in to see her off. The use of such a golden sledgehammer to crack a rather small nut would hardly have been necessary if Mr Lamont had not been a prominent minister. Who cares if an ordinary citizen discovers that his or her tenant is a 'sex therapist'? It was reasonable for taxpayers to make a contribution. The provenance of the Pounds 19,000 from Conservative supporters is murky, but in the absence of evidence to the contrary we must accept that the chancellor does not know who they were. There is one flaw. Mr Lamont's apparently supine acceptance of the Carter-Ruck invoice shows a lack of fighting spirit. You or I might have sent it back embroidered with the words 'you must be joking', or some similar phrase. Even lawyers can be embarrassed into a discount. None of this need have happened if the chancellor were independently wealthy, or if he were paid more than Pounds 63,047 a year. So little? The system is uniquely British. It attracts ambitious politicians, but not for the money. The recompense is an intangible package of non-monetary rewards. Members of the cabinet enjoy power. They are cosseted by officials who flatter them, pack their red boxes and order their chauffeurs. They are called 'chancellor' or 'secretary of state'. They may enjoy, as does Mr Lamont, an official country residence. They can, occasionally with justice, tell themselves that they are doing good for their country. No wonder they feel, and sometimes are, important. What they do not feel is rich. Many is the minister who has remarked on the civil service habit of withdrawing the official limousine. If your first engagement is Treasury business and your second an address to Conservatives, you may be left stranded in the dusk in outer Manchester awaiting the chairman of the local party in a Mini. In his memoirs, The View from Number 11, former chancellor Nigel Lawson says that it took years to persuade the Treasury to contribute to the cost of a cleaner for the flat in Number 11 Downing Street. His wife, Therese, tells of how rooms that visitors might enter are adorned with pictures from the government collection, 'preferably by British painters'. But there are none in the bedrooms or on the upstairs landing, since visitors are not expected there. At first sight this seems ridiculous, but think. The British system of government is notoriously secretive. We are in the middle of what will at the very least be a 17-year period of rule by a single party, with the likelihood that it will be further extended. The level of corruption is long established and well understood. It is traditional. Not much has changed since Labour was in office. Contributions to party funds are helpful ways of attracting the conferment of honours. The wining and dining of politicians and senior officials is a sensible business expense for companies that wish to express opinions on impending regulations. Privatisation has provided jobs for former servants of the crown who just sat there as huge balloons of wealth rose up beneath them. Sometimes gifts to ministers may be accepted. These may purchase the ineffable pleasure of their company - but not, so far as we can tell, very much more. This is an essentially English way of nibbling at the fruits of power. By comparison with accounts of what happens in Washington DC it is harmless if not quite squeaky clean. We must keep it that way. Tortuous civil service rules prevent ministers from entertaining personal friends at the state's expense in their official residences. This is part of a web of defences that should assure us that our domestic level of corruption will not spill over. We cannot always rely on whistle-blowers. Our only protection is a magic spell, a cast of mind, that has officials tying themselves in knots every hour of every day in an effort to preserve what they regard as their own purity as custodians of the public interest. That, and our constant, watchful, media-fed suspicion. As to Mr Lamont, if he cannot regain the markets' confidence in his ability to manage the economy he should be shuffled out of the chancellorship, perhaps to the Home Office. But that is another story.</p>

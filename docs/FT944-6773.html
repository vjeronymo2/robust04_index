			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Israeli groups woo London and New York investors - International offerings The efforts of Israeli companies to raise capital from international investors - highlighted by this week's roadshows for Tadiran, the electronics concern - are poised to move into a higher gear. Tadiran, one of more than a dozen technology or export-oriented Israeli enterprises to come to the international markets in the last couple of years, hopes to raise up to Dollars 80m through a simultaneous offer of shares in New York and London, and a listing in Tel Aviv. However, following progress this year towards a peace settlement in the region, a wider range of Israeli companies are coming to the market seeking to raise capital. Mr Niel Siebag-Montefiore, corporate finance director at BZW, said recently that European institutional investors were increasingly willing to buy Israeli stock. 'Three years ago, Israel was still a financial pariah in Europe but there has been a huge change since and investors now accept Israel as just another country suitable for foreign investment,' he said. A banker with Lehman Brothers, which has been involved in 18 deals since 1991 and now has an office in Tel Aviv, says international investors have begun to regard Israel as an emerging market. At the same time, political progress should end Israel's international isolation, opening up new markets for its exporters as well as closer economic integration with its neighbours. 'Investors believe Israel will become a regional centre,' he says. In total Israeli companies are expected to seek to raise up to Dollars 2bn next year. In the biggest deal, Bezeq, the state-owned telecommunications company, is expected to sell 25 per cent of its shares to raise about Dollars 700m. The offering, which will cut the government's stake to 51 per cent, will be made in New York, London, Tel Aviv and possibly a market in the Far East. Morgan Stanley has been appointed to advise on the sale. The government also wants to sell 22 per cent of Israel Chemicals, the country's leading chemical and fertiliser company, through a global offering in February 1995. The sale will reduce the government stake to 28 per cent and is expected be worth Dollars 190m. Wertheim Schroeder is advising on the privatisation and Lehman Brothers will be the global co-ordinator. A third serious candidate for privatisation by global offering in 1995 is El Al, the state-owned airline. The government plans to sell 51 per cent of the company worth Dollars 75m-Dollars 200m. BZW is expected to advise on the sale. Large private companies seeking a listing include Africa Israel, a leading investment company with interests in property, insurance and tourism, which plans to raise Dollars 150m - Dollars 200m in New York, London and Frankfurt. Morgan Stanley has been appointed global co-ordinator. Koor Industries, Israel's largest industrial group, expects to reduce its holding in Tadiran to 52 per cent. In addition, Koor expects to offer a large tranche of shares for sale on international markets by mid-1995. The Histadrut, Israel's trades union federation, plans to sell the 22 per cent stake in Koor owned by its Hevrat Haovidim holding company to repay heavy debts. Zim Israel Navigation, which ranks among the world's 10 largest container shipping companies, also expects to make a global offering in 1995. The government is also considering the possibility of selling shares in the big two banks - Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi.</p>

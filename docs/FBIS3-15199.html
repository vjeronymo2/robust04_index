			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] President Aliyev had private talks in Baku on  Tuesday with Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian  president's special envoy to the talks on Karabakh, and with  Georgiy Kondratiyev, a Russian Defence Minister's Assistant. In  an interview with Interfax, Aliyev's spokesman Tofik Abbasov has  described the talks as productive. In his words, the Russians  were familiarized with Baku's attitude toward a settlement. He  said that Moscow's plan for a settlement took Azerbaijan's view  only partially into account.    In his words, Aliyev wants the belligerents to stop fire  immediately, withdraw their troops, get down to negotiations.  However, all these steps should be backed up by the pull out of  Armenian forces from the occupied Azerbaijani lands, the  guaranteed return of refugees to Karabakh and other seized  territories, and their subsequent safety.    Asked by Interfax whether Baku agrees to cease fire this  month in line with the protocol signed in Moscow on February 18  by the defence ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan with a  Karabakh representative through Russia's mediation, Abbasov  explained that these documents are not binding but are only a  document of intent, which could take effect only after a  presidential visa.    So far Aliyev has not signed the accords, but, as Abbasov  believes, Azerbaijan's official consent to a truce is possible.  IF Note: According to the Moscow protocol, a cease-fire in  Karabakh is to be followed by a disengagement of troops by the  warring sides and by a pull out of military hardware from the  zone of fighting. Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Karabakh are  to post inspectors in the corridor that will form to monitor  compliance with the protocol. 35 mixed monitoring teams are to  be deployed in three zones, including the Kelbajar, Agdam,  Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan regions of Azerbaijan. Food will  be supplied to Karabakh through the Lachin Pass. Russia's  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev warned that if this accord on a  settlement in Karabakh were wrecked, he would resign as a  mediator.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong by </F> Hwang Chae-hong, second director of the TONG-A ILBO Political  Department, in Seoul on 17 February]    [Excerpts] [Hwang Chae-hong] It is fortunate that a  crisis [paguk] on the North Korean nuclear issue was avoided.  Why do you think North Korea changed its attitude and decided  to allow nuclear inspections right before plans to refer it to  the UN Security Council?    [Hong Sun-yong] There are various opinions regarding North  Korea's intentions. I would like to assess positively  [kungjongjoguro pyongga] North Korea's intentions. In my  opinion, North Korea did not allow nuclear inspections for many  reasons, but it finally recognized the fact that it could not  avoid isolation as an outlaw by the international community if  it continued to refuse international inspections. [passage  omitted]    [Hwang] The government has insisted on resolving the North  Korean nuclear issue in a peaceful way through dialogue. Is  there any special reason for the government to carry on with  this strategy?    [Hong] Our emphasis on a policy of dialogue was based on the  possibility of sanctions by the international community. We  have pursued a carrot-and-stick policy, and the carrot side has  just borne fruit.    [Hwang] In any case, has the government stressed the  dialogue policy because it realized the possibility of changes  in North Korea's attitude through a secret South-North dialogue  channel?    [Hong] There is no secret dialogue channel. Under the  current situation, in which South and North Korea mistrust each  other, it is highly possible that communication through any  secret channel will just amplify the mutual misunderstanding.  [passage omitted]    [Hwang] Some people criticize that the United States assumed  a leadership role in the nuclear negotiations while we, a party  directly concerned, played a supporting role. What is your  opinion?    [Hong] The suspicion about North Korea's nuclear development  is an important matter that not only directly relates to peace  and security of the Korean peninsula, but also is considered a  challenge to the international order based on the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. Therefore, the United States stepped  forward and played an important role. We should admit the U.S.  role. [passage omitted]    [Hwang] The ROK and the United States said they would  suspend the Team Spirit exercise this year if North Korea allows  nuclear inspections. When will they announce the suspension of  the exercise?    [Hong] They will express their willingness for a conditional  suspension when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspection team enters North Korea, and will make a final  decision when the IAEA inspection is successfully conducted and  when progress is made in South-North dialogue. [passage omitted]    [Hwang] What are the prospects for South-North dialogue,  which is likely to be resumed in the near future?    [Hong] As North Korea agreed to make meaningful progress in  South-North dialogue before the third round of U.S.-North Korean  talks, South and North Korea will hold working-level contacts,  which were severed October 1993. The government position is  that the South-North envoy exchange is another precondition for  the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. [passage omitted]    [Hwang] People are concerned about the fact that North Korea  has adhered only to dialogue with the United States, while it  has just formally acceded to South-North dialogue.    [Hong] North Korea's attitude is unpredictable. It is not  probable, however, that the United States trusts North Korea and  will promote improvement of relations under the situation, in  which South Korea does not trust North Korea. The shortest way  to Washington is through Seoul. [passage omitted]    [Hwang] There is a view that the refusal of strong countries  to allow developing countries to possess nuclear weapons is  wrong.    [Hong] In my opinion, it is more important now to increase  nuclear transparency. It is undesirable to attempt to have  nuclear reprocessing facilities to achieve peace and security on  the Korean peninsula. In the present situation, nuclear  reprocessing facilities are not economical. [passage omitted]    [Hwang] What is your opinion on the possibility of holding  South-North summit talks?    [Hong] Building mutual confidence between South and North  Korea by accepting the principle of peaceful coexistence first  is more important than arguing when to hold the summit talks.    [Hwang] It is reasonable to hold the summit when conditions  are met. Is it possible, however, that the top leaders of South  and North Korea will meet first to reach some important  agreements, which can be implemented on a working level?    [Hong] That is theoretically possible. It would be nothing  but a temporary unity [ponghap] or a compromise [tahyop] for the  top leaders, who have different senses of value and systems, to  hold talks. From a long-term viewpoint, it would not be of much  help for the reunification of the country. [passage omitted]</p>

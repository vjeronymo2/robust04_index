			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (10): Put your shirt on it - The textile industry This year the Egyptian shirt was added to the host of thorny trade issues taxing American government officials. Exports of shirts to the US rose by a record 569 per cent in 1993 - to 6.5m shirts worth Dollars 30m - and American trade negotiators have called for a quota to prevent further rises. Such a reaction has astonished those working in Egypt's textiles industry. The US exports over Dollars 2bn worth of goods to Egypt every year, compared to a total of only Dollars 450m in Egyptian exports to the US, so the shirt-makers complain that the Egyptian shirt hardly threatens the balance of trade. On the one hand the dispute is a serious concern to the Egyptian government. On the other, it is proof that the country's structural adjustment programme is at least working successfully in the field of ready-made garments. The textiles sector is Egypt's oldest and largest manufacturing base. It contributes to the economy an annual EPounds 4bn, of which exports account for about EPounds 1.7bn. But for years it has been dogged by problems of excess labour, outdated technology, and a lack of quality control as a result of the state's monopoly over cotton and most of the country's spinning and weaving mills. But future prospects are bright. A growing number of flourishing small clothes manufacturers in the private sector are breathing renewed life into the business. There are between 500 and 600 medium-sized, mainly state, textile factories and over 1,000 cottage industry operations in Egypt. However, 90 per cent of the ready-made garments sector is in private hands, ranging from traditional tailors to sophisticated manufacturers producing garments under franchises from, for example, Italy's Benetton, America's Wrangler, and France's Naf Naf. Most focused on the domestic market. Many are now gearing up for lucrative foreign markets. Mr Samir el Serafy, a director of a private sector clothes factory in Alexandria, believes that the future of Egypt's textiles industry no longer lies with the large-scale public sector manufacturers of cloth and fabric, but with smaller, privately-run producers of finished goods. 'The decline in the cotton sector and its export market has created a market for ready-made clothes which is better achieved by the private sector than the state,' he says. The secret of their success, he claims, is a strict policy of quality control. 'This is where we can beat the public sector hands down.' Mr Serafy's company, Societe Franco Egyptienne de Confection, exports clothes and other garments to the Gulf states, France and the UK (where he supplies the retail company Habitat with curtains, table-cloths and bed-sheets). He employs about 400 staff, and many of his designs are manufactured under a franchise from the French company Indreco. With an annual turnover of EPounds 10m-EPounds 11m, the company began pushing its exports last year and has already earned over EPounds 340,000 in foreign sales in the first three months of 1994. The private sector's total output of cloth - that is, finished clothes and fabric - was about 85,000 tonnes in 1993; tiny, compared to the public sector's output of about 130,000 tonnes. But this balance is likely to change as the private sector expands and the state eventually sells off its spinning and weaving operations. In the meantime the public sector, where output is mostly yarn and fabric, is also keen to take a part of the ready-made garment market. Mr Fathi Ahmad Ali, who recently became head of the publicly-owned Misr Fine Spinning and Weaving company with a staff of 25,000, annual turnover of EPounds 450m and exports of EPounds 200m, also argues that the only way to turn round losses of EPounds 60m a year is to improve the quality of its output. The expected freeing of Egyptian cotton prices later this year and an eventual lowering of tariffs, should benefit the textiles sector. As a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), most Egyptian clothes manufacturers support abolition of the multi-fibre agreement. The manufacturers say that they do not fear competition from east Asian producers when protectionist measures are removed. They argue that production costs will be kept low by importing medium to short staple cotton from abroad, instead of using the relatively expensive and high quality home grown extra-long and long staples, and employing cheap but skilled labour. If they succeed, then the era of the Egyptian shirt has only just begun.</p>

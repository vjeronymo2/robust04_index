			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Mario Soares has telephoned Jonas Savimbi  [leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola--UNITA] at the request of the UN secretary general, but  has not been very forthcoming on the details of the conversation:    [Begin recording] [Soares] Yes, I have, I spoke with Dr.  Savimbi today, and also with the UN secretary general.    [Unidentified correspondent] Can you tell us what the  conversation was about?    [Soares] I can tell you that a major effort is under way  toward attaining peace. As you know, the UN secretary general's  representative, Mr. Bey, has been to Huambo and Luanda in Angola  and is now back in Lusaka. I believe that the delegations are  back in Lusaka. The prospects are good, and I convey my best  wishes that a cease-fire and peace will be achieved. [end  recording]</p>

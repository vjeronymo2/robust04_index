			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure jumps 52% and calls for Pounds 21m Stanley Leisure, the betting shops and casino chain, yesterday announced a 52 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits and launched a rights issue to raise Pounds 21.1m net of expenses. The proceeds of the issue will be used to reduce borrowings and enable the group to take advantage of further acquisition opportunities. Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said the group was moving up from the 'second division to the first division' in its markets. He pointed out that there were 40 chains of 10 or more betting shops, with a total of some 1,000 shops, which could become takeover targets. Stanley's pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 5.36m for the six months to October 31, compared with Pounds 3.53m. Turnover increased from Pounds 108.5m to Pounds 131m. The group now claims to be the fourth largest UK bookmaker, with 401 shops following last year's Pounds 6m acquisition of the Selwyn Demmy chain. It also has 18 casinos, making it the third biggest UK operator. The cash call will comprise the issue 7.98m new shares at 275p a share on a 3-for-17 basis underwritten by Hambros. Brokers to the issue are de Zoete &amp; Bevan. Mr Steinberg will not take up his rights entitlement. That will reduce his holding in the company from 30.4 per cent to 25.9 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Group borrowings were Pounds 35.5m on December 19, giving gearing of 36.7 per cent. After the rights issue, borrowings will be reduced to Pounds 14.5m, and gearing to 15 per cent. The shares closed yesterday at 333p, down 2p. The average stake at the betting shops rose by 7 per cent, from Pounds 3.42 to Pounds 3.66. Figures for the division were helped both by acquisitions and by the introduction of evening opening at the betting shops, the group said. Average spend in the casinos rose to Pounds 86 (Pounds 82). Earnings per share rose from 5.48p to 8.34p. An interim dividend of 1.75p (1.52p) is declared. The group also forecast a final dividend of 3.5p, making a 5.25p (4.32p) total for the year ending May 1. COMMENT Stanley Leisure may be in the gambling business, but there is little of the gambler in this management which has made slow but sure progress in a tricky sector. Mr Steinberg is quick to stamp on any suggestion of more ambitious expansion plans, but the rights issue will put the group in a strong position to continue with the acquisition policy that has stood shareholders in good stead so far. Full year profits of Pounds 11m would put the group on a p/e of 20 - not cheap, but probably a safe bet.</p>

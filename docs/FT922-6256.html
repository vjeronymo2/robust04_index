			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Co-op merger may lead to new regional group NEGOTIATIONS between the Enfield and St Albans Co-operative Society, which has a turnover of Pounds 43.6m, and the Co-operative Wholesale Society are likely to lead to a new regional grouping with sales of more than Pounds 143m. The proposed merger means a single region can be created with neighbouring South Midlands (Pounds 72m turnover) and Milton Keynes (Pounds 28m). CWS's retail turnover will rise to around Pounds 2bn, increasing its Co-op retail share by one percentage point to 28.13 per cent. It overtook Co-operative Retail Services as the largest retail society when it merged with the Greater Nottingham society in March. Mergers last year between Co-op retailers reduced the number of societies from 69 to 65. The co-operative movement's congress in Scarborough yesterday announced sales of Pounds 7.3bn last year. It maintained its 7.8 per cent share of the food market and 4.6 per cent of the total retail market. The trading surplus fell to Pounds 173m from Pounds 175m in 1990.</p>

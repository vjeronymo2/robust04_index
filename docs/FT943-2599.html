			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Everyone losing in Danish poll: Rasmussen likely to stay on as head of minority government There will be many losers and no winners in the election to the Danish parliament on Wednesday, unless the opinion polls are badly misleading. The opposition Liberal and Conservative parties, hoping to form a coalition government, will make gains, but not enough to control a majority. The four-party centre-left coalition government, headed by the Social Democratic leader, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, will lose seats, but Mr Rasmussen is expected to hang on as head of a minority administration. Such a government, however, would be dependent on the parliamentary support of the left-wing Socialist People's party, an uncomfortable ally. The SPP has no inhibitions about government spending, and is not put off by the fear of speedier inflation, a stance which the financial markets have already noted. Mr Rasmussen's campaign has gone sour. For months he has promised that his government would 'put a downward kink in the unemployment curve'. However, despite an expansive fiscal policy, which will give the country a GDP growth rate of 4 per cent or more this year, the July unemployment figures played into the opposition's hands: they showed an upward kink in the jobless curve from 12.3 to 12.5 per cent, seasonally adjusted. Welfare is the election's other central issue. Mr Rasmussen, promising more and better welfare, has not always scored well on this issue either. In a campaign devoted almost entirely to photo opportunities, he strode into a Copenhagen hospital last week, taking the hands of a frail patient and telling her how much better the hospitals would be if his government was confirmed in office. A television crew stayed behind when Mr Rasmussen rushed on and asked her if she believed the prime minister's promises. Her convinced and articulate negative was the highlight of the main evening TV news. Small mishaps, perhaps, but the SDP's opinion poll ratings, excellent at the start of the campaign, have weakened by the day. Gallup at the weekend gave the SDP about 33 per cent, compared with 37.4 per cent in the last election. Nor has the campaign been a great success for Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Liberal leader, or Mr Hans Engell, the Conservative leader. Their only chance of a forming a government requires the parliamentary support of the right-wing populist Progress party, but wooing the populists worries moderate voters. They find the Progress party's refugee policy, calling for closed frontiers, and with racist undertones, particularly distasteful. Mr Poul Schluter, Conservative prime minister for 10 years from 1982 (and now a Euro MP), undoubtedly expressed the feeling of many moderate non-socialist voters when he said last week that he was unhappy at the prospect of a formal alliance between the Liberals and Conservatives and the Progress party. The Liberals and Conservatives are also making heavy weather of their message that a country where government expenditure has reached 64 per cent of GDP and which has the highest tax burden of any country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, about 49 per cent of GDP, needs to reform the welfare state before the welfare state precipitates economic collapse. No less than 44 per cent of the adult population is dependent on transfer incomes such as benefits and pensions from the government, and the state sector provides 35 per cent of total employment. There are echoes in this of the campaign for yesterday's election in Sweden where the incumbent centre-right of government Mr Carl Bildt sought to persuade voters that drastic cuts in government spending were required to solve the crisis that has already hit Sweden's public finances. 'It's a difficult message,' said Mr Ellemann-Jensen. 'Almost 50 per cent of the voters think we are going to take something away from them.' The Liberals and Conservatives want to concentrate resources on the health system, education and social services, and to curb cash welfare benefits. Only one thing looks as if it could upset Mr Rasmussen's chances of a second term. This is that one or more of the small centre parties in his present coalition, the Radical Liberals, the Centre Democrats and the Christian People's party, become so worried by the prospect that the SPP will obtain leverage on the government that they switch their allegiance and back a government headed by either Mr Ellemann-Jensen or Mr Engell.</p>

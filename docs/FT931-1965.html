			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Schering expects 4% growth in turnover SCHERING, Germany's pharmaceutical and agrochemical group, expects turnover to increase by 4 per cent to DM5.4bn (Dollars 3.25bn) this year. But it warned that reforms to the country's health system would affect sales. Mr Guiseppe Vita, chairman, said sales in Germany would fall to about DM680m, compared with last year's DM730m. Doctors would be buying cheaper pharmaceutical products, and domestic manufacturers would face stiffer competition from the reimport of pharmaceutical products from other European countries, he said. Net profits last year amounted to DM262m, a fall of 4.4 per cent on the previous year. Mr Vita said profits has been lifted by about DM20.1m from the sale of the group's industrial chemicals, organic chemicals, and electroplating operations. Extraordinary profits amounted to DM124.8m. Excluding gains earned from the sales of the three divisions, operating profits in 1992 fell by 8 per cent, or DM43m, to DM503m on the previous year, while per share earnings for 1992 fell to DM38, against DM44 for 1991. Last year, pharmaceuticals accounted for 95 per cent of the group's earnings, an increase of 17 per cent in 1991. Mr Vita said pharmaceutical sales were expected to increase by 5 per cent this year.</p>

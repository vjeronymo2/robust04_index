			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Fashion: Fading appeal of bright colours - A look at the growth of a subtler, kinder aesthetic of fabric dyes SITTING AT Henley a few weeks back I listened to two septuagenarian oarsmen discussing, with a gravitas that verged on the comic, the comparative pinks of their Leander club socks. 'Marvellous shade', one acknowledged, pointing at the other's flamingo-hued ankle, and continued, 'the trouble is, mine are new and still look rather garish even though I laid them out on the lawn in the sun and rain for the last two weeks.' His companion gravely nodded in sympathy. The issue, of course, was fading. No self-respecting Leander man wants to be seen in a brand new pink blazer, tie or socks, for long-standing membership of the sport's inner sanctum speaks volumes. But the faded socks, while losing none of their piquancy, did look a good deal better. The incident reminded me of a tip I read in Lady Diana Cooper's memoirs, The Rainbow Comes and Goes. Whenever she redecorated one of her homes she would lay the new upholstery and curtains out on the lawns leaving the elements to undermine the manufactured brightness. Even the most zinging Bloomsbury colours were toned down, ridding the aniline dyes of their harshness. Synthetic aniline dyes were invented in 1841 by the chemist C. J. Frizsche. By the 1860s they were being mass-produced for dress and interior decoration and reds and purples, historically the most expensive colours to produce, became widely available. The Victorians latched on to their brightness with glee because it had once been a sign of wealth and it became highly fashionable among the nouveaux riche merchants to have mind-bogglingly bright homes and clothes. William Morris, the artist, led the inevitable reaction. He experimented with natural dyes, particularly favouring indigo and madder because they faded beautifully, reminding him of the Medieval tapestries that he so admired. Sadly, apart from a few sidetracks by craftsmen and aesthetes, garishly bright dyes have dominated this century's palette, culminating in the shocking pink, vibrant tangerine and other day-glo colours that fought for our attention and our purses in the late 1950s. In recent years dye manufacturers have actually prided themselves in creating colours that will not fade and celebrities such as Jeff Banks advertise the advantages of detergents that do not fade clothes in the wash. Thankfully a new colour aesthetic is emerging of a subtler and kinder sort. Some seek it in the faded charm of vintage clothes or Grunge, others prefer the subtle and rich (rather than bright) colours and textures of designers such as Issey Miyake and Romeo Gigli who are interested in the dye processes of India and the Far East where natural dyes are still widely used. It is rich, rather than bright, colours that fade the most beautifully and it is a faded richness that tends to flatter northern European complexions more than Matisse brights or those mushy 'pastels' served up in chain stores. And many would argue that muted rather than poster-paint brights look more refined. But sadly the mass market manufacturers are reduced to pumping out these flat, hard colours that defy fading as natural dyes are so expensive. At a cottage industry level natural dyes are less harmful to the environment but they are impractical on a commercial scale because, according to the colour chemist Brian Burdett at Shirley Technology (part of the British Textile Technology Group), 'the planet cannot grow sufficient natural dyes to meet our needs and the application of natural dyes needs chemical additives that are more harmful than synthetic dyes.' Instead, his team is working on a cross between natural and synthetic dyes, using micro fungi which produce pigments. The idea was born when one of them noticed the colourful fungi that developed on the foam of home-brew beer when it went wrong. Its appealing colour would dye the plastic container and was difficult to remove. Research revealed that mildews and other micro fungi can produce amazing colours. The project has succeeded in creating colour pigments in cool conditions, which require neither heat nor chemical additives. With the application of environmentally-sound chemistry they will soon produce a commercially viable dye. I hope it fades with charm. Meanwhile Eric Bremner at Laura Ashley has also tuned into this colour-tempering aesthetic. He will be introducing a mechanised fading system in the company's printing works in Wales to recreate that oldy-worldy look that so many admire in old fabrics. This shift in aesthetics can do no harm to the environmental movement which is trying to encourage us to get over our newness neurosis. Perhaps we will all concur with the rarified sensibilities of Lady Diana Cooper and my Leander friends - allowing the colour of our clothes to age gracefully.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: When member states, not the United Nations, are to blame Sir, Your leader, 'Disunited nations' (June 15), rightly advises the Security Council's five permanent members to examine their own responsibility for some recent events, rather than blame the UN. The five should begin to act more often as if they were members of the UN, not detached spectators pursuing their own interests. Their reputation is not enhanced when, for example, they complain of the inadequacies of UN security action while never having attempted to activate the Military Staff Committee provided for under Article 47 of the charter nearly 50 years ago. When the UN has a defined role and support, as in Cambodia, the chances of success are much increased. On other occasions as in Somalia and Iraq, when member states use the UN to cover a part of their actions, but exclude it from significant participation - and perhaps sometimes from consultation - there are serious difficulties. In these and other cases member states shelter behind the knowledge that the secretary-general will not name and criticise them. There is a pressing need to improve media coverage of the UN, and to distinguish its role more clearly from that of member states. The aim should be to facilitate the constructive criticism of the actions of all concerned, which is urgently required. Even those of us who are reasonably informed need a much clearer view of events than we are now receiving.

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Taylor has urged the Liberian Council of  State to review its internal rules. He said there is a need for  the State Council to review its rules, with the view of making  it more open.    The president has extended an open invitation to the Council  of State of the Liberian Transitional Government to visit  Gbarnga and the rest of the country. He said it is important  for the Council of State to visit Gbarnga and other parts of the  country, to fully establish its authority throughout Liberia.  The president said, if the Council of State does not  immediately take up the invitation to visit Gbarnga and the rest  of the country, it will be placing its authority in question.    The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader  stressed the need for the Council of State to fully establish  its authority throughout the Republic of Liberia, as spelled out  in the Cotonou Accord.</p>

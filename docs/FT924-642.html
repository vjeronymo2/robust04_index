			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Letter: St Andrews apostrophed In your otherwise excellent report on university research ('Top-quality research 'is scarce' ', December 18), you include in your list of universities that of St Andrew's. I have never heard of this university, although I am fortunate to have a research degree from St Andrews University in Fife. Perhaps we will be seeing a Leed's University in next year's table.

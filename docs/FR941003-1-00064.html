			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council has added new provisions to assist agencies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting their responsibilities under the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in Section 110(a)(2) of the 1992 NHPA amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which requires agencies to develop preservation programs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that the agencies' procedures for compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 106 are consistent with the Council's procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Sections 800.3&hyph;800.6). The provisions implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principle that agency procedures establishing a preservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program must be consistent with the Council's regulations by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing standards for consistency (Section 800.4) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes through which the Council can evaluate whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these standards have been met (Section 800.5 and 800.6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart C_The Section 106 Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The heart of the Section 106 process is in Subpart C. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions in this Subpart have changed to allow for more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency-SHPO decisionmaking without Council involvement. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset the Council's removal from routine cases, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart gives the Council the authority to resolve disputes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between Federal agencies and SHPOs and to monitor agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance and provides an expanded opportunity for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public to request the Council to intervene in particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 800.7(a&hyph;e) sets forth the steps that an agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official must go through prior to the identification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic properties. These provisions emphasize the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for early planning and coordination, both with reviews under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other authorities and with other individuals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations, prior to the initiation of the identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stage. The identification and evaluation stages (Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 800.8) remain essentially the same as the present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, except that the regulation adds a provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing for Council review of agency decisions made during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the identification and evaluation stages (Section 800.8(e)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a supplement to Section 800.8, a non-binding Appendix has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been added to provide additional clarification on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification process and the establishment of the area of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised regulations eliminate the determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect step (and the existing Criteria of Effect) currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Section 106 process and allow an agency to apply the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria of adverse effect directly after completing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification stage (Section 800.9(a)). An agency is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer required to notify the Council of a finding of no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse effect, but the Council may review such a finding if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested or if the Council deems it appropriate (Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 800.9(d)). The revised regulations also eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions to a finding of adverse effect and incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those exceptions into a new provision allowing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditional no adverse effect agreements (Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 800.9(b)(2)). The intent of the addition of the conditional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no adverse effect agreement provision is to allow agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and SHPOs flexibility in reaching routine agreements while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintaining agency accountability. It formally recognizes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice that has already become widespread under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to resolve adverse effects more efficiently, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised regulations provide more autonomy to the SHPO and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal agency. The revised regulations establish a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method for resolution of adverse effects without the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council's participation, changing the current two-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Memorandum of Agreement process (Sections 800.10(a)(1) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 800.10(c)(1)). Under this provision, if the Council elects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not to participate in the negotiation, the agency and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SHPO may execute a Memorandum of Agreement which is sent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Council, but need not be executed by the Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Section 800.10(c)(1)). The revised regulations also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify the use, force and effect of a Memorandum of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agreement and its provisions (Section 800.10(d)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a Memorandum of Agreement cannot be reached during two-party consultation, the parties must seek the Council's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation and enter three-party consultation before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminating negotiations. If a Memorandum of Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be reached, the revised regulations set forth more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detailed provisions on termination of negotiations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council comments (Section 800.11)). With regard to Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, the new regulations require that the head of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency respond to the Council's comments in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 110(l) of the NHPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In responding to comments made by respondents to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council's survey of Section 106 users and in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance the Council's removal from routine Section 106  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, the revised regulations establish a new section on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency monitoring and compliance (Section 800.12). This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section provides for the review of an agency official's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings, providing more detail than the review procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the current regulations at Section 800.6(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The monitoring and compliance section also includes a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision for the issuance of a notice of violation to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency which has violated or, in the case of a preliminary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of violation, is about to violate the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NHPA. In response to the 1992 amendments which added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 110(k), the Council has established procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing anticipatory demolition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Alternative Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Subpart provides options for complying with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of Section 106 other than those set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart C. Its purpose is to encourage agencies to integrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Section 106 process into their internal planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. Section 800.16 of the revised regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explains that counterpart procedures, as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 800.4 and 800.5(a), Programmatic Agreements, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in Section 800.5(b), provide alternative means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. In accordance with Section 101(d)(5) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHPA, the Council has added a new provision to establish a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process by which an Indian tribe may substitute its tribal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic preservation regulations for the Council's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations for review of undertakings on tribal lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Section 800.17). The Council has also attempted to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the unique situations created by disasters or emergencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has revised its emergency regulations to emphasize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for the development of agency counterpart procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which establish a plan for considering historic properties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during responses to disasters and emergencies. The revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency regulations delete reference to 36 CFR Part 78 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to encourage agencies to develop their own procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for dealing with disasters. The Council has limited the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability of the regulations to natural disasters or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergencies declared by the President or by an Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Coordination With Other Authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an expansion and revision of the current regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding agency coordination, requested by surveyed users,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the revised regulations establish more detailed guidance on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordination with the National Environmental Policy Act and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate other relevant statutes where coordination is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desirable (Section 800.19).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Issues Deserving Special Attention From Commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the development of these revisions, the Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that several issues warranted special attention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from commenters. These issues fall into three categories:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) areas of particular concern to the Council on which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> views of users and the public are particularly solicited;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) provisions that could be drafted in one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative ways and views are sought on the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative; and (3) questions about actions that could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken to improve the functioning of the Section 106 process,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but that would not be specifically included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The Council invites commenters to give these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues special consideration and provide views for its use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

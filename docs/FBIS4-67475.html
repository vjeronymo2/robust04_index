			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A geographical  information industry is taking shape in China as the country's  survey and mapping research institutes and universities have in  recent years achieved research breakthroughs.    These advances have come in the fields of surveying  resources  and monitoring the environment and natural disasters by using  high- and remote-sensing technologies, including satellite  sensing.    Official sources have said that China has established a  dozen  large-scale geographical information systems, including a  national territory survey, flood forecast on the lower reaches  of the Yellow River and anti-disaster measures.    Others include a monitoring information system for the  "three  norths" (north, northeast and northwest China) forest belts and  environmental development, one for Shanghai's urban  construction, one for the underground pipe network in urban  Beijing and one for the basic land conditions in northeast  China's Liaoning Province.    Speaking at today's inaugural meeting of the China  Geographical Information Association, director of the State  Bureau of Surveying and Mapping Jin Xiangwen said that China's  construction of a geographical data bank has gone into high gear.    He said that a data bank on the primary geographical  conditions of the national territory has been built up at the  scale of one to one million, adding that a new one at one to  250,000 is in the pipeline.    Meanwhile, he said, China has started building a  high-precision data bank of the earth compiled from satellite  information.    A digital survey and mapping system is being constructed to  gradually integrate aerial and remote-sensing surveys and the  information system for the national territory integrated into a  whole, according to the official.    Jin said that his bureau has set up digital production bases  in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xian, Chengdu and Harbin.    Meanwhile, China has set up a key national lab for resources  and environment information, a key national lab for surveys and  mapping using remote-sensing data and a research institute for  mapping and geographical information systems.</p>

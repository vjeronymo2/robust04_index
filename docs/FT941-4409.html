			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Management: Low tech, high yield: Richard Tomkins on how Rubbermaid became a corporate hero New Yorkers joke that when the world ends, they want to be in Cleveland, Ohio. 'Why Cleveland?' you dutifully ask. 'Because everything happens 10 years later in Cleveland,' they reply. Ohio has the unhappy reputation of being one of the US's less dynamic states. It is the sort of place you might expect to find a company with a faintly comical name like Rubbermaid making boring household goods like plastic buckets, sandwich boxes and washing-up brushes. And indeed, about an hour's drive from Cleveland in a town called Wooster, there is a company called Rubbermaid making those very things. But it isn't behind the times. On the contrary, it is among the most innovative companies in the US, introducing new products at the rate of more than one a day. Rubbermaid's reputation for innovation has earned it the respect of corporate America. For the last nine years, the company has been placed among the nation's 10 most admired companies in Fortune magazine's annual survey of 10,000 company directors, senior executives and financial analysts. In the latest survey, published last month, it clinched the number one spot. It is not just the rate of new product development that has attracted attention to Rubbermaid. Earnings growth averaged 18 per cent a year in the 10 years to 1992, giving shareholders a total return (in dividends and capital appreciation) of 25 per cent a year over the same period. Last year, net profits rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 211m (Pounds 144m) on turnover up 9 per cent at Dollars 2bn. How does Rubbermaid do it? It is hard to imagine a sector with less obvious potential than Rubbermaid's. Dustpans, brushes, buckets and mops have changed very little since their invention. Technology does not come much lower. Yet, in a way, it is the very dullness of the business that explains Rubbermaid's success. Access to the industry is so easy, and competition so fierce, that invention is a do-or-die affair. While Rubbermaid's products may not be the cheapest on the shelves, consumers have to be convinced that they offer superior value because they do the job better than anybody else's. Rubbermaid's approach is evident in its most basic products. Its plastic buckets, for example, do not deform and spill their contents when full, and have sturdy, comfortable handles. Its laundry baskets are contoured so that they sit on the hip. Its food storage boxes have wide protrusions on the lids to make them easier to open. And then there are the totally new products, like the step-stool that saves space by incorporating a tool box under its lid or the litterless lunch kit containing a set of re-usable food and drink containers. According to Wolfgang Schmitt, Rubbermaid's chairman and chief executive, the main source of its inventiveness is its obsession with trends - whether fashion-led, sociological, demographic or global. 'We have a philosophical belief that there is no such thing as a totally negative trend. Given enough time and effort and inquisitiveness, in every change there is an opportunity for someone.' The step-stool and other space-saving products developed out of the trend towards smaller households; the litterless lunch kit came in response to growing environmental awareness; and a children's laundry hamper that encourages youngsters to tidy up after themselves evolved from a study showing that working mothers no longer had time to do it for them. But who generates the ideas? The short answer is teams. Rubbermaid has set up 20 business teams, each of them dedicated to a specific product line. Each team - typically comprising one person each from marketing, manufacturing, finance, research and development, and sales - takes responsibility for every aspect of its product line's performance, including product development and, ultimately, profitability. This means that every Rubbermaid product is continually being examined by a business team to see if it can be improved or replaced with something better. Although most new products are developed by these teams, other employees are encouraged to come up with ideas, too. And the teams shamelessly plagiarise their own and each other's ideas: the step-stool, for example, has evolved into several other products based on the idea of a container that you can stand on, such as a children's step-stool that doubles as a toy box. Suppliers are another good source of ideas. Schmitt gives the example of a supplier who came up with a new type of plastic for making ice-cube trays. There was nothing particularly wrong with the old material, but the new plastic made it easier to get the cubes out of the trays and lasted longer because it was more flexible. Rubbermaid wrote off Dollars 1m to re-tool rather than pass up the opportunity to offer a better product. Then again, says Schmitt, some of Rubbermaid's best ideas are suggested by customers. Take, for example, mailboxes - the sort that sit on a pole at the end of the drive. These are notoriously vulnerable to damage from vehicles. One customer saw an advertisement for a Rubbermaid refuse bin that sprang back after being crushed by a truck, and called in saying: 'I wish my mailbox did that.' Result: the indestructible mailbox. Rubbermaid is ruthless in its pursuit of new ideas. The company demands that 33 per cent of its revenues should come from products introduced in the last five years, so its business teams are under constant pressure to invent. As fast as new products come on to the market, old ones - or new ones that never quite made it - are dropped. Such is the rate of replacement that maturing products tend to disappear off the shelves long before customer demand has dried up. Perhaps it all sounds just too good to last. Indeed, as Rubbermaid gets bigger, it may find it harder to sustain the same rate of growth - particularly as it ventures into more troublesome overseas markets, where it is now trying to expand. Besides, awards for excellence have a nasty habit of marking the turning point for companies on which they are bestowed. All Schmitt can do is point to the record. Innovation has been ingrained in Rubbermaid's culture since it diversified from toy balloons into dust pans 60 years ago, he says. That is one thing that is not going to change.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Poland warned over gas pipeline POLAND'S sovereignty could be endangered by a proposed plan that would supply Russian natural gas to the country along an east-west pipeline, Mr Jan Olszewski, a former prime minister, warned yesterday. Mr Olszewski was speaking on the eve of a two-day visit to Poland by the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin. During the visit an agreement to build the pipeline is expected to be signed. Mr Olszewski, whose right-wing Coalition for the Republic is one of more than a dozen political groups contesting parliamentary elections scheduled for September 19, contended that the pipeline would 'nullify chances of obtaining gas from other sources such as the North Sea'. Russia currently exports 6.5bn cubic metres a year of natural gas to Poland, whose domestic production amounts to 3.5bn cubic metres a year. Estimates of Poland's natural gas needs in the year 2010 assume that consumption will treble from present levels. The pipeline would carry 67bn cubic metres a year 4,000km from the Jamal Peninsula in the Arctic Circle to western Europe. Details of financing of the project have still to be divulged, but Poland could take delivery of 14bn cubic metres a year of gas as part of the agreement. The Polish sector of the pipeline would be owned by a joint Polish-Russian operating company. The issue of ownership has been the subject of debate by critics of the project. The state-owned Polish Oil and Gas Company has been negotiating the pipeline agreement with Gazprom, its counterpart in Russia. The Polish company has also been exploring the possibilities of building a pipeline linking North Sea gas deposits with Poland's Baltic coast to bring in a further 10bn cubic metres a year.</p>

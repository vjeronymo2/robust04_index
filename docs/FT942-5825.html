			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Academics take issue with Nasdaq spreads - A study which sharply criticised dealers on the screen-based Nasdaq market has reopened the issue of the quality of US stock markets The long-simmering debate over the quality of US stock markets heated up last week when an academic study sharply criticised dealers on the Nasdaq market for maintaining unnecessarily wide spreads between buy and sell prices. Wide spreads are bad for investors, because they are denied the opportunity to pay a little less when buying a stock, or receive a little more when selling. Dealer firms like wide spreads, because they translate into bigger profits - the wider the spread, the more money the dealer can make on the difference between the price he pays and the price at which he sells. The study - conducted by two college finance professors, William Christie of Vanderbilt University and Paul Schultz of Ohio State University - found that for 71 of the 100 most actively traded Nasdaq stocks of 1991, dealers rarely, if ever, listed stock quotes ending in an odd-eighth of a dollar when posting bid (buy) and offer (sell) prices on their computer screens. Instead of using the full range of eighths, such as Dollars  1/8 , Dollars 3/8 , Dollars  5/8 and Dollars  7/8 , the study found that dealers almost always quoted spreads of even-eighths, such as Dollars 1/4 , Dollars  1/2 , Dollars  3/4 or a whole dollar. In contrast, spreads quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange (ASE) were found to be consistently narrower than those on the Nasdaq, with the exchanges' 'specialists', or dealers, regularly using odd-eighths as well as even-eighths when quoting prices. Nasdaq, the large screen-based dealer market, run by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) is the second-largest forum for trading equities in the US after the NYSE, and its system of competing dealers posting buy and sell prices on computer screens has been duplicated by exchanges around the world, including London. The study has attracted attention because the authors not only criticised the wide spreads posted by Nasdaq dealers, but also argued that the extremely rare use of odd-eighth quotes suggested dealers may be working in concert to keep spreads wide. 'Despite extensive research, there is little explanation as to why as many as 50 dealers, all in competition, would neglect one-half of all possible price options if not for implicit collusion,' said Mr Christie and Mr Schultz. The study was immediately seen as providing support for the long-held view of floor-based exchanges that their system of allowing the flow of orders to set prices - with specialists ready to step in and participate in a trade only when necessary - provides investors with a better service than Nasdaq's system of letting dealers set prices to attract orders. Although the NYSE declined to comment, sources at the exchange said privately that the findings proved the Nasdaq system did not encourage competition. The NASD quickly attacked the study's findings, arguing that there was no evidence of collusion between dealers. While he did not dispute the study's facts on spread sizes, Mr Richard Ketchum, vice-president, said the wide spreads were a reflection of one of Nasdaq's strengths, 'a great deal of liquidity at a single price'. This has always been the main argument put forward for the Nasdaq system: that what investors lose from wider spreads, they more than get back from the guarantee of liquidity afforded by the multiple dealer system. By allowing dealers to maintain, and profit from, spreads of a quarter of a dollar, the NASD says it is ensuring that there will always be enough dealers in the market. It argues that tighter spreads would, by cutting into dealers' profits, deter dealers from making a market in many stocks and reduce liquidity. While this argument makes sense when discussing the liquidity of small, lightly-traded stocks, it carries less weight when it comes to the biggest stocks on the Nasdaq system, like Apple Computer, Intel and Lotus Development. Even with these three giants, which in theory should attract a multiplicity of dealers eager to compete for business, the Christie-Schultz study found that spreads were almost never quoted in odd-eighths. The study on Nasdaq spreads, however, does raise the wider issue of the quality of US stock markets, and whether they provide investors with the best possible service. Mr Junius Peake, professor of finance at the University of Northern Colorado and a long-time observer of US stock market practices, says dealers are able to keep spreads wide to maximise their profits because the systems are designed that way. 'As long as the trading systems are built by entities controlled by market-makers, such as the NASD and the exchanges, they will be built to serve those interests first. Only when we have independent commercial operators trying to serve the best interests of the end-user, the investor, will the system be designed to best serve investors.' Systems which do not rely on intermediaries to bring buyers and sellers together do exist. The majority of trades on the NYSE and ASE, for example, are completed without a specialist becoming involved. Yet the specialist, through his monopoly on the trading of each stock, still exerts considerable control over pricing in the market, and the exchanges, like Nasdaq, are controlled by their communities of dealers and brokers. There are a handful of trading systems and markets run by independent entities - including Instinet (run by Reuters), Posit (run by Jeffries &amp; Co), and the Arizona Stock Exchange - which allow investors to deal exclusively with each other, but they account for only a fraction of all trading on US stock markets. They are growing as more investors find they prefer non-dealer systems in certain circumstances, but the lack of liquidity restricts their usefulness to investors, particularly individuals.</p>

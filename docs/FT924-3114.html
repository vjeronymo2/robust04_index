			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo to invest in Chilean mine MINERA Mantos Blancos, the Chilean copper mine controlled by Anglo American of South Africa, plans to invest Dollars 290m over the next five years to maintain production at its existing mine and develop a new deposit. Mantos Blancos needs to double the girth of its open-pit mine near Antofagasta in the Atacama desert to reach the ore body's remaining reserves. The expansion, which is expected to cost Dollars 85m, will extend the life of the mine beyond the year 2010. Output is expected to remain steady at about 75,000 tonnes a year. The company will also invest Dollars 56m to switch production from copper oxides to copper cathodes, which are more environment-friendly. In addition, Mantos Blancos is developing a second ore body called Mantoverde, which is expected to enter production in 1994 with an annual output of nearly 40,000 tonnes. Mr Ricardo Martinez, Mantos Blancos' spokesman, says the company is still studying its funding options. Mantos Blancos will have to find Dollars 92m to pay for its share of the Collahuasi copper project should Royal Dutch/Shell and Falconbridge accept Minorco and Mantos Blancos as their new partners. Minorco, the Luxembourg-based associate of Anglo American, has made a Dollars 185m bid for Chevron's 33 per cent stake.</p>

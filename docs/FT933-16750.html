			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / NZ to open access to fiscal information NEW ZEALAND is to pass legislation by September to ensure the public has access to a regular flow of up-to-date budgetary and other fiscal information, Ms Ruth Richardson, minister of finance, announced in last night's budget. The legislation will be similar to that which gives the Reserve Bank independence from the government in setting monetary policy. Ms Richardson said that the new law was prompted by the fact that the previous Labour government failed to acknowledge a deteriorating economic situation which had led to a much worse fiscal outlook. Under the new legislation, future governments will be required to provide six-monthly economic and fiscal outlooks and monthly 'outturns.' In addition a comprehensive fiscal and economic update must be given at the start of each general election campaign. Each budget must also contain medium term fiscal outlooks with the reports based on generally accepted accounting practice as well as improved budget documentation. The budget confirmed predictions that, despite elections in four months, it would contain few giveaways. Ms Richardson announced a deficit of NZDollars 2.2bn (Pounds 791m) for the new 1993-94 financial year in a budget she described as 'aiming for consistency' in economic policy. She estimated that the deficit for the 1992-93 year, which ended on Wednesday, at NZDollars 2.3bn, a NZDollars 1bn cut on the figure in last year's budget. She said that the total government debt programme this financial year would be NZDollars 4.45bn due to maturing debt, net lending and other influences. Ms Richardson said that the projected financial deficit for next year was for a deficit of NZDollars 2bn followed by one of NZDollars 1.1bn in 1995-96. The government hoped to balance its budget by 1996 - 97.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 26 (XINHUA) -- The collection of the  revenue shared by the central and local governments has been  going well since China adopted the new revenue-sharing system  two months ago.    According to figures released by the Finance Ministry, the  total volume of value-added tax collected in the first two  months of this year amounted to 21.5 billion yuan.    Of this amount, the central coffers took 71.1 percent while  the local governments shared a total of 28.9 percent, close to  the projected sharing ratio of 3:1.    Liu Zhongli, finance minister and director of the State  Taxation Bureau, expressed satisfaction over the implementation  of the revenue-sharing system, which became effective January 1  this year to replace the former turnover tax system.    The reform of the taxation system, based on a rational  division of responsibilities and rights, was aimed to strengthen  the ability of the central government in exercising  macro-economic regulation.    Liu said the past two months saw a rapid increase in  revenue.  By the end of February the country's total revenue (excluding  debts) was up 32.1 percent over the same period of last year.    He said the detailed rules and regulations on implementing  the new taxation system issued early this year properly  addressed the concerns of foreign-funded enterprises and cleared  the doubts of foreign investors -- their total payment of taxes  did not increase under the new system.    This was done because the additional payment under the new  system would then be returned to the foreign-funded enterprises  to ensure their original interests, he said.    However, he said, this period of "tax compensation" will not  exceed five years, and those enterprises founded after January 1  this year will be subject to the new taxation system.    As to the value-added tax on land, Liu said it was designed  to prevent land speculation, not to discourage foreign  investors, especially real estate businessmen engaging in  developing residential quarters.    He reiterated three governing principles: value-added tax  (VAT) will be levied on land, with domestic and overseas  investors on an equal footing; land VAT should be unified  everywhere in China; and government departments will give  consideration to public reaction and formulate relevant  regulations.    Liu did not give a timetable for promulgating the detailed  rules and regulations on levying land vat, but he added they  will be made public "as soon as possible".</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Yi Tong-pok, former special </F> assistant to the ROK prime minister, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's  Yukiyoshi Fujimura in Seoul; date not given; first paragraph is  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] The ROK has so far taken a generally calm attitude  with regard to the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected  development of nuclear arms. However, after North Korea started  to adopt a tough position, beginning with the replacement of  nuclear fuel rods, quarters concerned and experts in South Korea  are beginning to take a more pessimistic view that "may be the  suspicions are true." One such person is Yi Tong-pok, former  special assistant to the prime minister, and spokesman for the  ROK delegation during the North-South prime ministerial talks.  We interviewed Yi on what the DPRK will do next.    [Fujimura] How do you view the tough attitude adopted by  North Korea?    [Yi] Looking at the recent exchanges, I do not think they  are merely using the development of nuclear arms as a "nuclear  card." They have now clearly indicated their intention to  develop nuclear arms.    [Fujimura] What do you think is the present state of their  development of nuclear weapons?    [Yi] North Korea already possesses enough plutonium to make  one to three atomic bombs. Given another two years, they will  actually be able to make nuclear bombs. They are also building  two new reactors. Compared to existing reactors, one will have  10 times the capacity of current reactors, and the other, 40  times. Together, they can produce 200 kg of plutonium each year.  This means that if things go on like this, North Korea will  become a nuclear superpower in three or four years.    [Fujimura] Will North Korea compromise under the pressure of  economic sanctions?    [Yi] Because the United States has been sending the wrong  signals to North Korea recently, North Korea is taking the  United States lightly. It probably thinks that the United  States is incapable of imposing economic sanctions.    [Fujimura] Do you think there is a possibility that North  Korea will start a war?    [Yi] I cannot really say the possibility does not exist, but  I think the possibility is very slim. North Korea has merely  conducted test launches of its missiles; they are not yet ready  for active deployment. With their present military capability,  they are quite incapable of launching an attack.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Architecture: Music to the eyes - Colin Amery on the work of Christian de Portzamparc To win a Nobel Prize in any field is considered to be the ultimate accolade for anyone's career. The equivalent award in the field of architecture is the Pritzker Prize, sponsored by the American Hyatt Foundation. During the last decade it has honoured the good and the great of the architectural profession. It came as something of a surprise when it was awarded last week to the relatively unknown 50-year-old French architect Christian de Portzamparc. He is the first architect of the post-war generation to win the prize, and the first Frenchman. For enthusiasts of the relatively arcane in contemporary architecture, Christian de Portzamparc is already something of a hero, and it is possible to bring yourself up to date with his relatively small output of work by visiting five sites in and around Paris. When Portzamparc spoke at the prize-giving ceremony in Columbus, Indiana he said that his 'interventions' in cities are what he regards as his key works. He speaks lovingly of cities and the need for architects to think urbanistically in ways that can refashion and civilise our cities. On the Rue Nationale in south-east Paris he is rehabilitating a series of blocks of public housing built in the 1960s. These blocks are typical of so many that were built at that time - 12 to 14 storeys of rigid and dull concrete frame building - uniform and soulless. In Britain and the US the current mood would demand that these structures were demolished. Instead, in Paris, new balconies and white and yellow awnings have been added, together with some new low-rise buildings to house a community centre and a school. Just off the Rue Nationale itself, in the Rue des Hautes-Formes, Portzamparc has built arches across the street to soften the effect of some housing built in 1979, to attempt to create an sense of an enclave that is enhanced by trees and trellis. But these minor changes are not a lot more significant than a touch of lipstick on the lined face of an elderly and faded blonde; and scarcely enough to merit a major international prize. It is the few completed Portzamparc buildings that justify the prize. The City of Music - a conservatoire in the far north-east of Paris - is designed by Portzamparc as part of the Parc de la Villette, one of the last of the Grands Projets intended to make Paris the cultural and educational centre of Europe. This is the best place to see the work of this architect. He has adopted a hybrid modern style that seems to look back to the 1930s in its curvilinear language and yet in its random geometry is much influenced by Le Corbusier. It is a curious and disturbing marriage of styles - the Portzamparc designed Holiday Inn near the same site is a sinuous green slab that would look at home in Miami. It is the second phase of the City of Music that has just been completed. It comprises an elliptical concert hall which has an amazing spiralling lobby all round it. The rather tough and angular entrance facade belies the elegance within - the recital rooms have curved walls and the hall itself is simple but very stylish. The large conical recital room that looks like a streamlined ship's funnel has a quite remarkable interior. The ceiling soars upwards into the cone-shaped roof and is panelled with timber in a pattern that resembles the roof of the Pantheon. It is an almost ritualistic space - the concert platform like the altar and the audience a congregation, drawn together by the unexpected intimacy of this large space. A very accessible example of his work is the Cafe Beaubourg which adjoins the Pompidou Centre. He has installed a sweeping grand staircase - all 1930s  -and the cafe occupies two large floors decorated with murals of Portzamparc's actual designs. Another key public building where his work can be seen is the addition to the Bourdelle Museum which houses a collection of classical sculpture. Outside Paris is his School of Dance for the Paris Opera at Nanterre - a pair of post-modern pavilions. Further afield is his apartment block - a square tower with a circular roof - in Fukuoha in Japan. What is apparent from all his buildings is that he is full of architectural ideas. They have not yet gelled into a coherent Portzamparc language. His work is very hybrid and is still evolving. He only opened his office in 1970 and 24 years is not long in the life of an architect. Despite this major prize, I would say the jury is still out on whether he is simply a stylist or whether his architecture is of such significance that it will change people's lives.</p>

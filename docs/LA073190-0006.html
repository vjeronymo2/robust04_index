			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> STATE CRACKS DOWN ON AVOCADO THEFT  </P> <P> Routine inspections at Ventura County markets and restaurants have turned up  nearly 30,000 pounds of avocados that officials suspect were stolen.  </P> <P> Donella Boreham, who heads the inspection program for the state Department of  Food and Agriculture, said inspectors in the three-county area of Ventura,  Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties issued 392 warnings to dealers of  uncertified avocados, nearly 30% of all warnings issued in the state.  </P> <P> By law, anyone who purchases or transports avocados must have a receipt proving  where the avocados were purchased. Avocados transported without a receipt are  presumed stolen, and inspectors can confiscate the fruit and issue a citation,  officials said. But not all of the suspect avocados were seized.  </P> <P> Howard Seelye, a spokesman for the California Avocado Commission in Santa Ana,  said the year-old anti-theft program is part of the commission's effort to  crack down on avocado theft rings.  </P> <P> Avocado industry experts say thieves sell stolen avocados to restaurants and  wholesale dealers. This week, avocados are fetching about $1.60 a pound, a high  price, Seelye said.  </P> <P> With a $55-million avocado crop, Ventura County ranks second in the state in  avocado production with about 750 growers. Commission officials estimate that  between $1 million and $2.75 million worth of avocados are stolen each year in  the county. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

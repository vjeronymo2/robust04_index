			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: RVI returns to black RENAULT Veicules Industriels (RVI), the truck and van maker run by Renault, France's state-owned car group and Volvo of Sweden, managed to muster a modest profit last year despite the depressed state of the US and European markets. This represents a return to the black for RVI after making a loss of FFr102m (Dollars 18.8m) in 1990. The company achieved this despite seeing sales fall by nearly 7 per cent to FFr27.5m in 1991 from FFr29.65m in the previous year. The links between Renault and Volvo, which owns 45 per cent of RVI, recently came under scrutiny during the controversy over Volvo's plans for a merger with Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group. Mr Pierre Colmant, director, said RVI had managed to maintain its European market share at 11.8 per cent. The number of RVI registrations for trucks over 5 tonnes fell by 10.9 per cent, slightly more than the European market as a whole, which slipped by 10.5 per cent to 259,000 units. In France RVI managed to perform better - or less badly - in sales terms than the rest of the market. In the US, where the market was more depressed than in Europe, RVI sold 11,300 models, against 17,000 in the previous year.</p>

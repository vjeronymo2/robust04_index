			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 AMERICANS, 6 OTHER FOREIGNERS FLEE KUWAIT  </P> <P> A group of nine foreigners, including three Americans, bolted across the  Kuwaiti desert to this border town Friday in an effort to avoid an Iraqi order  to gather at a downtown hotel.  </P> <P> "No one responded to the Iraqi call, as far as I know, but everyone is making a  rush to get out of Kuwait," said Stephanie McGehee, 37, a part-time reporter  and photographer for the Associated Press who was in the group.  </P> <P> Contact with McGehee, from the San Diego county town of Leucadia, was lost two  days after the Aug. 2 invasion as the Iraqis gradually cut off all telephone  and telex lines.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Iraqi military authorities ordered Britons and Americans to  assemble at Kuwait hotels but then failed to turn up to meet them. There are  about 4,000 Britons and 2,500 Americans in Kuwait. McGehee said she escaped  along with two other Americans, a Briton, a Canadian and four Indians.  </P> <P> She said she had heard that only two Britons showed up at the Regency Palace  hotel in response to the Iraqi order. They were told: "We have no room for you,  stay in the ballroom."  </P> <P> "We believe it was all only an Iraqi show, but everyone is trying to get out,"  she said.  </P> <P> McGehee said she and the others all dressed as Kuwaitis. She spoke Arabic, so  she sat next to the driver. She said she carried the identity card of a  Lebanese friend.  </P> <P> "As soon as we left the paved road, we ran into Iraqis, and they said we had to  go back," she said. "We moved away and then took another turn through the  desert sands and made a dash for it," she said. "It was very, very  terrifying.".  </P></p>

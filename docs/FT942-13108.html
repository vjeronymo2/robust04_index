			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Exchange launches plan to promote smaller companies The London Stock Exchange yesterday launched a seven-point plan to promote the interests of smaller companies and to encourage greater investment in - and trading of - their shares. The exchange also said that for the first time it would actively market itself and its services for small companies and for others whose shares it lists. 'We need to get a much stronger marketing focus at the exchange,' said Mr Michael Lawrence, chief executive. The exchange plans to extend its marketing activities outside the UK and will actively encourage non-UK companies to seek listings in London. The exchange has been under pressure to improve its facilities for small companies since December 1992 when it announced it would close the Unlisted Securities Market, on which shares of some smaller companies are traded. The City Group for Smaller Companies, an interest group of venture capitalists, stockbrokers and corporate financiers, has urged the creation of a new exchange to promote trading in small company shares, under the Stock Exchange's aegis. Yesterday, the exchange stopped short of endorsing that goal, announcing steps which would 'obviate the need for a new exchange', according to Mr Giles Vardey, director of markets development and marketing. He said some of the measures would have been necessary because of changes in European legislation. The main points are: The development of an equivalent of the Stock Exchange 'Yellow Book' to set listing requirements for those companies not on the official list whose shares are traded under section 535.2 of the exchange's current rules. Creation of a specialist smaller companies group within the exchange and of a dedicated marketing team to educate companies about the benefits of the exchange's markets and to champion 'smaller company issues'. The exchange has proposed to the FT-SE Actuaries steering committee a new index which would draw in those companies now too small to fall into the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share index. Enhancement of the trading system to allow prices of less-liquid securities to be displayed on screens to encourage trading. Development of the exchange's regional role. It will encourage regional brokers to promote investor interest in locally based company shares and will work with Scottish Enterprise on a pilot scheme to be introduced elsewhere. Creation of a proposed new venture capital investment trust sector within the FT-SE indices to encourage fund managers to set aside capital for the new trusts which qualify for tax relief under the November 1993 Budget.

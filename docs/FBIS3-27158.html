			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Bill Aikman,  spokesman for the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  said today that by the NATO deadline the bosnian serbs had  surrendered 260 big guns to UN Forces.    The Serbs have also withdrawn most of their heavy weapons to  areas 20 kilomaters away from sarajevo, and 23 of the 41 Serb  positions have been dismilitarized, he added.    Nine other Serb positions have been supervised by UN  military  observers and the rest will be inspected by UN Commander General  Michael Rose and the Commander of UN Forces in Sarajevo Andre  Sulairu.    The Muslims also surrendered 45 heavy guns to UN forces,  Aikman said.    The UN secretary-general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi,  declared in Zagreb that air strikes against Serb positions are  unnecessary.    However, U.S. President Bill Clinton and NATO  Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said NATO's threat remains in  effect.    They stressed that any side opening fire or refusing to  withdraw heavy weapons will be subject to NATO force.    Although the possibility of air strikes has temporarily  faded, the military threat remains as NATO aircraft continue to  closely monitor the situation in Sarajevo.</p>

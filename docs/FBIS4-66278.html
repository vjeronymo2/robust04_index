			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Yan Jiuzu (0917 0036 4371): </F> "Commercialization of S&amp;T Achievements Plagued by Eight  Problems"]  <H5>  [6 Apr p 3] </H5>   [Text] For the nation as a whole, whether or not scientific  and technological [S&amp;T] achievements are promptly transformed  into productive forces is a vital issue that will determine  whether the Chinese economy will grow steadily and rapidly in a  sustained fashion and whether the Chinese people can proudly  take their place among the nations of the world. For an  enterprise, it is also a paramount issue that will decide  whether or not it will hold its own on the market where  competition is becoming more and more ferocious. Thus far we  have been less than adept at handling these two major issues,  with the result that the transformation of S&amp;T achievements  is  plagued by eight major problems. For the enterprise, there is no  running away from these obstacles either. What are these eight  obstacles? How can we overcome them? This article will run a  series of five articles starting today. We will begin by  discussing the eight factors that hamper the transformation of  S&amp;T achievements into productive forces. Next we will look at  S&amp;T work in the United States and Japan and find out how  S&amp;T  achievements there are turned into productive forces. Will the  series of articles set our readers thinking and making mental  associations? Will they come up with some good suggestions about  S&amp;T work in China and the transformation of S&amp;T  achievements?  Jot them down and mail them to us; S&amp;T work needs  participation  and strategizing by the public.    -- The effective energy utilization rate in China is only  two-thirds that of advanced nations.    -- The large-area dissemination and application rate of  S&amp;T  achievements in China is merely 15 percent.    -- Only 4 percent of China's high-tech products are  exported.    -- Only 34.5 percent of China's national-level major S&amp;T  achievements are commercialized. - China spends a mere 0.71  percent of its gross domestic output on research and development  [R&amp;D].    -- There are eight major problems in the transformation of  S&amp;T achievements in China.    Importance and Urgency    The Chinese economy has been expanding rapidly in recent  years. Rapid growth, however, masks such problems as poor  productivity, low profits, irrationality in the industrial  structure, and lack of competitiveness. These problems will  inevitably crimp further economic growth.    China's international trade has grown significantly in the  last few years, with exports almost hitting $400 million in  1992. Ten years ago, China accounted for 1 percent of global  trade; now its share has risen to 2.5 percent. Manufactured  goods used to make up 50 percent of Chinese exports; to date  they constitute 80 percent. Nevertheless, most of the increase  in exports still occurs in labor-intensive industries like  textiles and footwear. Chinese exports enjoy an edge--in price,  not in quality or technological content.    China is a relatively resource-poor nation. In this nation  that requires 1.1 billion tons of standard coal each year to  keep the economy growing, however, the effective energy  utilization rate is only two-thirds that of advanced nations. In  China, for instance, it takes 400 grams of coal to generate one  kwh of electricity, 100 grams more than other nations. We  consume 30 percent more energy than elsewhere to manufacture a  ton of steel, 70 percent more to make a ton of cement, and 100  percent more to turn out a ton of glass.    To sum up, China must rely on S&amp;T progress and  accelerate the  transformation of S&amp;T achievements if the Chinese economy is  to  continue to grow steadily and healthily for a long time to come.    Present Situation And Gap    Some research units have calculated the rates of  contribution  of S&amp;T progress to economic growth since reform went under  way  and the open policy was introduced: 16 percent in the 1980's and  rising to 20 percent in the 1990's. Transactions on the  technology market rose from 2.1 billion yuan in 1985 to 15.6  billion yuan in 1992, a 640 percent gain. The rate of the  large-area dissemination and application of S&amp;T achievements  is  only 15 percent. According to classified standards statistics  compiled by the General Administration of Customs, while  high-tech products made up 4 percent of China's total exports in  the 1980's, the corresponding figures for other newly  industrialized countries [NIC's] during the same period ranged  from 10 to 15 percent. New products accounted for 32 percent of  total sales by U.S. firms in 1986; the projected figure for the  1990's is 50 percent.    We can see from the above data that although China has made  significant headway in S&amp;T achievements transformation since  reform went under way and the open policy was introduced, it  still trails the developed nations and the NIC's. Without a  wealth of new products with S&amp;T content, it will be  impossible  for China to beat the competition on the world market in the  months and years ahead. Thus identifying the structure that will  accelerate S&amp;T achievements transformation has become a hot  topic in the S&amp;T policy debate in China.    Problems and Difficulties    -- Institutional barriers. Scientific research versus  production. High-tech research versus traditional industrial  transformation. Making use of industry-based technical centers  versus raising the technical standard of enterprises. Importing  technology versus developing it on our own. Problems abound when  it comes to planning comprehensively and coordinating and  balancing the two sets of issues, revolving around the nation's  priority tasks. Our S&amp;T work is characterized by large-area  low-level duplication. Numerous S&amp;T achievements are not  effectively and promptly applied in production. The same piece  of technology may be imported many times over, which prevents  what limited funds we have from being utilized properly. All  these problems are commonplace. They involve not only the  macro-management of the economic system and S&amp;T system, but  also  the sound division of labor and optimal configuration of such  systems. To effectively marry S&amp;T with the economy at a high  level, we must improve the existing S&amp;T management system and  economic planning management system and establish a mechanism  whereby scientific research organizations and institutions of  higher education can participate in major national economic  projects.    Developed nations have taken a host of measures in recent  years to speed up S&amp;T advances, economic growth, and S&amp;T  achievements transformation. Take the United States, for  instance. The U.S. Government has stepped up the  macro-management of science and technology in recent years,  doubling its attention to the role played by research and  consulting in S&amp;T decision-making. Former President George  Bush  elevated his scientific adviser to presidential assistant, equal  in standing to the assistant to the president for national  security affairs, who could participate in national economic and  security policy-making at the top level. In February 1990 he  revived the Presidential Scientific Advisory Commission and put  it on a par with the Council of Economic Advisers. This was  followed by the restructuring and strengthening of the Federal  Scientific, Engineering, and Technological Coordinating  Committee to enable it to play an even more extensive role in  inter-departmental S&amp;T policy coordination. It was precisely  because of the heavy involvement of the U.S. Government that the  United States was able to turn the tide in the global computer  chip war and beat Japan.    -- Weak consciousness. With its huge population and poor  foundation, China is economically and culturally backward. In  China the development of social productive forces is hampered by  a variety of serious constraints: demographic, resource, and  environmental. Traditionally we have tried to develop the  economy by consuming huge amounts of resources. Efficiency was  low and social productivity was equivalent to barely 5 percent  of the best in the world. We will be doomed if we do not size up  the times and grasp the opportunity with a sense of urgency and  a sense of crisis and truly base economic construction on S&amp;T  advances and the improvement of the quality of the labor force.  The new global technological revolution is more than an economic  challenge to us, it is also a political challenge. The more  economically and culturally backward a nation, the greater its  need to make science, technology, and education its top priority  and put them to use to achieve a quantum leap in the development  of productive forces and productivity. In this area we should be  more alert, more conscious.    The relations between S&amp;T, on the one hand, and the  economy,  on the other, has never been properly straightened out over the  years. Agencies which manage S&amp;T and their counterparts in  charge of the economy have been converging institutionally and  overlapping functionally. In the process, we have ignored to  achieve a sound division of labor between the two. Meanwhile,  departmentalism, localism, both byproducts of the  small-agriculture mentality, and the idea of preventing an  outflow of profits have also inhibited the formation of a  fruitful partnership between S&amp;T and the economy.    If cadres at all levels continue to fail to truly appreciate  the importance of S&amp;T and remain content with the kind of  short-term progress resulting from continued extensive  development, if they still do not realize the danger posed by  the widening gap with the West and fail to think in terms of the  nation's general interests, then the future looks grim as far as  China's four-modernization drive is concerned.    -- Institutional malfunctioning. In a market economy the law  of value plays a dominant role and all means of production  circulate on the market and participate in competition. Hence  the formation of the average rate of return. As organic capital  formation increases, moreover, there is a tendency for the  average rate of return to decline steadily, forcing enterprises  to scramble for relative surplus value by working harder to  improve production technology. At a time when international  competition is getting ferocious, in particular, a number of  illegal channels "leading to excessive profits" are often  blocked, thus leaving S&amp;T competition the sole forum for  legitimate competition. The enterprises' urgent demand for  S&amp;T  progress is precisely why the market economy can accelerate the  transformation of S&amp;T achievements.    However, even in developed capitalist nations with a market  economy, government spending on S&amp;T channeled through the  planning mechanism almost equals what industry itself invests in  S&amp;T. The reason is this. While S&amp;T typically wrestles  with mid-  and long-term economic development problems, market demand is  basically short-term or near-term. Macro-planning by the state,  therefore, is needed to compensate for this weakness. Thus, if  we organically and flexibly deploy the two mechanisms--market  and planning, S&amp;T will successfully drive economic growth in  a  sustained manner and an endless flow of S&amp;T achievements  will be  transformed into competitive new products.    S&amp;T planning under a planned economy differs from  S&amp;T  planning under a market economy. The former is technology-led,  shaped mainly by what is in the plan and the technology  development plan. The latter is market-driven, essentially a  response to short-term and long-term market demand. S&amp;T  achievements transformation is much more rapid under the latter.    -- Sluggish demand. Enterprises are the principal  transformers of S&amp;T achievements, but their demand for  S&amp;T is  less than robust. The reasons are multifaceted. Based on the  findings of surveys on some enterprises and scientific research  institutions, they can be summarized as follows: 1) Since China  is still in transition from a planned economy to a market  economy, enterprises still have not realized their own  decision-making authority. According to a survey on 6,800 large  and mid-sized enterprises across the nation, only 15 percent  have been truly vitalized. Government intervention remains  excessive. 2) For the two-thirds of the nation's large- and  medium-sized enterprises which are still losing money, these are  tough times. They lack the economic means to go after S&amp;T  progress. 3) Enterprise leaders do not have a strong awareness  of science and technology. 4) Funds are lacking for transforming  S&amp;T achievements. According to statistics, of the  achievements  already transformed, self-raised funds were used in 56.8 percent  of the cases; government funds allocated under the S&amp;T plan,  21.6 percent; loans, 5.2 percent; and venture capital, a mere  2.3 percent. The transformation of S&amp;T achievements embraces  the  entire process from the laboratory to industrialized production,  of which the most difficult stages are intermediate testing and  industrialized trial production. They require investment on a  large scale but is highly risky. 5) There are no common  interests between enterprises and scientific research units.  Enterprises complain that the units turn out immature  achievements, poor in quality but high-priced. Scientific  research units criticize enterprises for not understanding the  value of technical commodities. The gap between enterprises and  research units has never been properly bridged. Studies have  been conducted on the standard of technology currently provided  by research units in the country. Of the large enterprises  surveyed, 77.4 percent considered it "average," 19.6 percent  said it is "not high," and only 3 percent deemed it "fairly  high." Even among small- and medium-sized enterprises, 59  percent said it is "average" and 28 percent regarded it as "not  high." In addition, 38 percent of large enterprises and 62  percent of small- and medium-sized enterprises considered  existing technology transfer costs "too high." In contrast, 90  percent of scientific research thought they are "too low." 6)  R&amp;D funds are not actually made available. Under State  Council  regulations, enterprises may set aside 1 percent of their sales  revenue to fund R&amp;D. According to statistics, however, one  third  of enterprises set aside 1 percent while two-thirds fail to do  so. According to surveys on the metallurgical, chemical,  mechanical, and electronic industries, the set-aside rates are,  respectively, 0.5 percent (1.5 percent), 1.1 percent (3.3  percent), 1 percent (4.5 percent), and 5.5 percent (10 percent).  (Figures in parentheses are averages of similar industries  overseas) The spending gap between China and other countries is  1:3 on the average. 7) Scientific research units balk at  transferring their achievements and would rather commercialize  them themselves. Statistics show that of all national-level  major achievements, 34.5 percent were transferred and  commercialized while 56.2 percent were commercialized by the  research units themselves. The reason is that transfer fees were  lower than R&amp;D costs in 50 percent of the projects  transferred.  With transfer, moreover, there is no guarantee that intellectual  property rights would be protected. Of the projects surveyed, no  protective measures were taken in 45.7 percent of the cases. 8)  Enterprises have meager capacity for technology development.  Statistically, 54 percent of large and mid-sized enterprises  have their own technological development offices, but only  one-third are really doing their job. Enterprises account for  just 29.5 percent of all professional and technical personnel in  the nation, only 24.6 percent of them senior personnel. 9)  Enterprises prefer importing foreign technology and equipment to  using domestic S&amp;T achievements. According to studies on the  machinery and electronic industries, 39.8 percent of the new  technology applied was imported while barely 2.8 percent was  domestic in origin. Altogether China spent more than $100  billion in the past decade importing technology and equipment,  far higher than what the nation spent on R&amp;D at home. The  reasons are manifold, eg., imported technology is mature,  dependable, and of a higher standard, and can be swiftly put to  work. Importing foreign technology also provides opportunities  for overseas training.    As part of corporate restructuring in recent times, a new  form of enterprise has emerged in the United States. For the  specific purpose of developing a particular product, a number of  companies and scientific research institutions may get together  to form an "ad hoc" company. When the mission in question is  accomplished, the company is disbanded. U.S. corporations too  have been undergoing restructuring in recent years. They  discover that the bigger a company, the more bureaucratic it  becomes. This is the main organizational reason why the United  States has lost out to Japan in international competition over  the past few years. Japanese companies are structurally  connected both horizontally and vertically. Big companies and  big corporations are composed of small companies level upon  level, with the small companies enjoying a substantial measure  of independence. These days big U.S. corporations are scrambling  to break up into smaller units to make themselves more flexible.  It was against this backdrop that the idea of an "ad hoc"  company was born.  <H5>  [8 Apr p 3] </H5>   [Text] There are eight major problems in S&amp;T  achievements  transformation in China.    -- Under-investment. Not enough is being spent on S&amp;T  achievements transformation relative to R&amp;D funding. The  shortfall differs from industry to industry, but usually ranges  from hundreds of percent to 1,000 percent. Without increasing  investment, all the talk about accelerating S&amp;T achievements  transformation will remain empty talk. The question is: Who will  pay and how? How much money should be invested in a particular  stage of the transformation process should depend on its  riskiness and nature. S&amp;T achievements derive from R&amp;D.  To  ensure an unbroken flow of achievements, we must begin by  boosting investment in R&amp;D. Although they are currently in  the  grip of an economic recession, developed nations around the  world have been boosting their R&amp;D spending sharply relative  to  the GNP, almost reaching 3 percent. It may be that people who  control the purse strings in those countries truly appreciate  the importance of S&amp;T in the modern world. Moreover, the  leaders  of a number of NIC's and developing nations who have seen the  light are also scrambling to increase S&amp;T investment. By the  end  of the century S&amp;T funding will reach 5 percent in South  Korea  and 2 percent in India, up from the current 0.9 percent. Other  countries like Brazil, Egypt, and Thailand are also rushing to  augment S&amp;T spending.    In China, R&amp;D spending accounted for 0.72 percent of  the GNP  in 1991 and dropped to 0.71 percent in 1992. The decline had  something to do with the rapid expansion of the GNP in 1992, but  it also shows that R&amp;D spending has failed to keep pace with  GNP. If we persist in our present mentality and continue to  force economic growth by desperately expanding the scale of  operations and boosting sham GNP through waste, instead of  relying on S&amp;T to bring about economic development, China  will  be overtaken by other developing nations, never mind catching up  with the advanced nations. We must commit ourselves to  increasing S&amp;D spending to 1.5 percent of the GNP by the end  of  the century, up from the current 0.71 percent.    Enterprises should increase investment in S&amp;T even as  the  government does likewise.    Venture capital should be used to finance the transformation  of most S&amp;T achievements. According to estimates by venture  capital companies overseas, in the 1970's it was possible to  make a profit when one project out of ten survived and in the  1980's, two out of 10. The transformation of high-tech  achievements will not be a success unless we go all out to put  the venture capital business on a sound footing.    There are over 600 venture capital investment companies in  the United States with a combined capital exceeding $100  billion. About 3,000 high-tech companies rely on these funds to  finance their operations. For the most successful venture  capital companies in the United States, the annual rate of  return can run as high as 50 percent. More typically the rate of  return is around 35 percent.    Intermediate testing, industrial testing, and production,  all  stages in the transformation of S&amp;T achievements, should  mainly  be financed by credit. State banks should set aside funds  specifically to make S&amp;T loans. Between them, the Industrial  and  Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank made S&amp;T  loans totalling 3.84 billion yuan during the Seventh Five-Year  Plan and over 3 billion yuan in 1991 alone. But this is far from  sufficient. By 1995 S&amp;T lending should exceed 10 billion  yuan.  Already S&amp;T lending in the Seventh Five-Year Plan has paid  off.  The 3.84 billion yuan in S&amp;T loans extended by the banks had  financed 6,300 projects as of 1990, boosting output value by 15  billion yuan and profits and taxes by 3.4 billion yuan and  earning $850 million in foreign exchange.    -- Lack of personnel mobility. The most effective way to  speed up S&amp;T achievements transformation is to enable such  achievements to move with their vehicles--S&amp;T personnel. But  since there are all sorts of barriers to the circulation of  qualified personnel, the magnitude of such circulation is  severely limited. Involved here is a host of issues tied up in  social and economic reform: housing, health insurance, old age  insurance, permanent residency registration, education for their  children, and the job title system. It is proposed that the  government speed up the reform of the social security system,  particularly unemployment insurance, pension insurance, and  health insurance. In addition, housing reform should be  accelerated. When achievements circulate along with qualified  personnel, disputes will occur over intellectual property  rights. The state should draw up the appropriate policies, laws,  and regulations to encourage circulation and protect  intellectual property rights at the same time.    With qualified personnel immobile and small and mid-sized  enterprises, particularly township and town enterprises,  desperate for expertise, there has arisen the "second job"  issue. Wages of S&amp;T personnel should be decontrolled and the  government should collect taxes based on a progressive income  tax system. The job titles of S&amp;T personnel may be divided  into  national-level and local-level ones. National-level job titles  may be evaluated in accordance with national standards while  local ones should be evaluated by the units themselves. To sum  up, the government should introduce a "three-decontrol" policy  with regard to S&amp;T institutions and S&amp;T personnel, namely  decontrolling the hiring of personnel, decontrolling the  distribution system, and decontrolling job titles.    In accordance with the principle of "stabilizing one end and  deregulating one part," the management of S&amp;T institutions  should vary depending on their type. There should be strong  government support for institutions conducting basic research  and public-interest research. Institutions and scholars who  receive official aid should be evaluated every few years and  measures taken depending on evaluation results. Open  market-oriented research organizations should be left to the  market; such organizations should be given decision-making  authority in their operations and held accountable for their own  profits and losses.    With the exception of scientific research institutions which  handle state secrets and commercial secrets, other research  institutions should be thrown open to society across the board.  Controls on equipment, machinery, and personnel should be  lifted. The fee-for-use and fee-for-service system may be  adopted to accelerate S&amp;T achievements transformation. "Going  outside" is not enough; we should also take pains to "invite  them in."    Major scientific research institutions may consider  vitalizing a section or office first by allowing it to join  forces with one part of an enterprise to form a "flexible  company." Once the task in question is completed, the company  will be dissolved.    Decontrol S&amp;T personnel. Allow them to circulate freely  in  accordance with market supply and demand. The government should  take pains to adopt a variety of incentives to encourage S&amp;T  personnel. As far as the acceleration of S&amp;T achievements  transformation is concerned, in the past most incentives were  targeted at people in R&amp;D, while little was done to encourage  people who had made outstanding contributions to design,  intermediate testing, and production development. High-tech and  new technology development zones have been instrumental in  high-tech development. A number of special policies should be  introduced on a trial basis in the high-tech development zones  with hopes of accelerating high-tech commercialization,  industrialization, and internationalization. To boost investment  in high-tech, for instance, the Australian government has  formulated a "150 percent tax rebate policy." Here in China, the  government has adopted a "three-exemptions-and-two-cuts" policy  in high-tech development zones. For people engaged in genuine  R&amp;D, incentives should be made even more attractive in the  future. This is because high-tech development is highly  intellectual and highly risky and requires substantial inputs,  so incentives should be augmented.    Let us take a look at the current state of China's high-tech  development zones. The Zhongguan Cun development zone boasts the  highest concentration rate of expertise in the world, yet other  than the Stone Group, whose sales exceed 1 billion yuan,  everybody else operates on a fairly modest scale. The biggest  problem is that it is everybody for itself in the zone. There is  no systems design, no coordination. Instead the companies are  like stragglers and disbanded soldiers, each fighting its battle  on its own. At best the zone can be described as a place where a  number of high-tech companies are concentrated. It has not yet  developed the collective edge of a high-tech development zone.    -- Importation mismanagement. When it comes to importing and  transforming advanced foreign technology promptly, Japan must be  the most successful in the world. In the 20 years between 1968  and 1988, Japan spent $6.3 billion importing a total of 30,000  pieces of technology. Had Japan tried to develop the technology  itself, it would have cost them 14 times more in R&amp;D funding  and  taken four times as long. By importing the technology, Japan  reaped $1,000 billion in direct profits. What a big pay-off!    There is no denying the contribution of technical imports to  the sustained and rapid growth of the Chinese economy in the 13  years since reform went under way and the open policy was  introduced. According to 1990 statistics, China spent $100  billion importing technology and equipment in the previous 10  years, about $15 to $18 billion on the importing of technology  alone. While no exact data exist on the direct benefits of such  imports, the macroeconomic results have been quite good.  However, the management of importation has many problems, which  can be summarized as follows:    The phenomenon of "imports hurting domestic industries."  There were many technologies and much equipment which China was  able to provide. Still, vast sums were spent buying from  overseas. Not only was precious foreign exchange wasted, but  these imports also dealt a blow to domestic industries and  S&amp;T  work.    "Duplicate importation." According to 1988 data, 113 color  TV  production lines were imported, as well as 33 low-quality  micro-electronic parts production lines, 70 refrigerator  production lines, and 15 copier production lines. In the case of  color TV production lines, the rate of capacity utilization is  less than 50 percent.    Little spent on absorption, assimilation, and innovation  relative to the spending on importation. Japan spends between $5  to $7 on absorption, assimilation, and innovation for every $1  it spends on importing. China spends very little on the former.  At one point in the past, China put together a "12 dragon"  absorption and assimilation plan but implemented only part of it  for lack of funding. Take, for instance, China's iron and steel  enterprises. They have a $6 billion import budget but spend a  mere 490,000 yuan on absorption and assimilation.    -- Incomplete laws and regulations. As noted above, the  transformation of S&amp;T achievements has been badly hurt by  disputes between enterprises and scientific research  organizations over intellectual property rights. Successful  technology transfer must take place within the appropriate legal  framework. A legal framework is needed to give technology  transfer a favorable environment.    It is suggested that the government accelerate S&amp;T  law-making  to protect intellectual property rights. This is a prerequisite  for accelerating S&amp;T achievements transformation.</p>

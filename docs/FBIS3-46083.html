			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Li Xin Yan (2621 2450 1750) and RENMIN </F> RIBAO reporter Hu Yueping (5170 6460 1627)]    [Text] Guiyang, 16 Jan (XINHUA) -- During his recent  investigation and study tour of Guizhou, Li Tieying, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, state councillor,  and minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring  Commission, emphatically said that as China has entered a new  period of accelerating reform and economic development, it is  necessary to conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in  light of realities in Guizhou, have a profound understanding of  the blueprint and overall framework adopted at the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and try to carry them  out by emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, and  undertaking bold exploration so as to find out a way to  prosperity which is practical to the people of an inland  prov)nce.    Li Tieying went to Guizhou to conduct investigation and  study  from 12 to 15 January. He went down to such grass-roots units  as plants, rural areas, grain depots, and development zones in  Zunyi, Anshun, Guiyang, and other places to understand  conditions there. He also held discussion meetings with  responsible persons of provincial party committee, government,  and departments concerned. He fully affirmed the results  achieved by Guizhuo province since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPCCentral Committee. He said: Tremendous changes have  occurred in Guizhou over the past 15 year of reform. In 1987,  it doubled its industrial and agricultural output value. It is  expected that the province will redouble its industrial and  agricultural output in 1996 so as to enable it, an inland  province with protracted backwardness in economy, to make  remarkable progress. This is a result of long-term struggle of  34 million people of all nationalities under the leadership of  provincial party committee and government. He expressed his  hopes that Guizhou will continue to emancipate the mind,  undertake bold exploration, and further accelerate the pace of  reform and opening to the outside world.    After reviewing the course of China's reform and opening up  to the outside world in the past 15 years and also summing up  China's experiences in this respect, Li Tieying pointed out:  Whenever a locality has done a good job in emancipating its  mind, it will do well in reform and development. There may be  differences in geographical environment, natural resources, and  the pace of economic development between the hinterland  provinces and the coastal areas, but there should not be  differences in matters of emancipating the mind, changing old  concepts, and seeking truth from facts. He who has emancipated  his mind will be able to proceed from reality to understand the  conditions in a province and a region, as well as the conditions  of the masses, will cast away many ideological shackles and  conventions, will draw on the experiences of developed areas,  and create new experiences in line with reality, thereby  fundamentally reforming the old system that has prevented the  development of the productive forces and promoting local  economic development. Various major reform measures will be  introduced this year. I hope the provincial party committee and  the provincial government will study them carefully and ensure  their meticulous and smooth implementation.    Li Tieying stressed: Our reform tasks are extremely arduous.  They will not only bring pressure but also provide us with  opportunities. The hinterland provinces should be good at  seizing the opportunities, make good use of their advantages,  deepen the reform, open wider to the outside world, and  accelerate economic development. He said: Although Guizhou is  not situated along the Chang Jiang, the coast, and the border,  it has, what Premier Zhou Enlai used to praise, beautiful  mountains and rivers, pleasant weather, rich natural resources,  and hard working people. Although Guizhou is the only  agricultural province without a plain, 97 percent of its hilly  areas possess rich resources. It should make great efforts to  exploit resources from its hilly areas. Li Tieying expressed  great interest in Guizhou's rich mineral and energy resources  and its unique tourism resources formed by its beautiful typical  karst landform and strong ethnic flavor. After inspecting the  Anshun Wax Printing General Plant, he spoke highly of wax  printing, a manual printing technology employed by the ethnic  minorities since ancient times. In a happy mood he wrote an  inscription which reads: "The flower of art has lasted thousands  of years, while the ethnic treasure is still surprisingly  beautiful." He expressed the hope that Guizhou's wax printing  will be quickly made into colorful serial products to be  marketed domestically and internationally.    In discussing the reform of the administrative system for  grain, Li Tiying said: It is necessary to pay close attention  to and be cautious in the reform of this system. This reform  should be regarded as a major reform and should be carefully  studied. At present, what is most important is to do everything  possible to stabilize grain prices and to make concerted efforts  to ensure a bumper harvest this year.    As the Spring Festival is approaching, Li Tiying expressed  the hope that the governments and departments at all levels will  carefully make arrangements for market supply in order to enable  the masses, particularly those in poor areas, to enjoy a happy  Spring Festival.</p>

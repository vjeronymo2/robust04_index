			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / The declining rewards for accepting equity risk It has become accepted that equities should provide a rate of return substantially higher than on less risky alternatives such as bonds or short-term money market instruments. Indeed, such an excess return is built into pension fund costings and into many retail investment products. But is the equity risk premium fading away? The very long-run picture for the UK is set out each year in the Barclays de Zoete Wedd Equity-Gilt Study which covers a period going back to 1919. This year's edition showed that the excess return on UK equities compared with three-month Treasury Bills was 6.7 per cent annualised over this 75-year period. Roughly similar results are obtained in the US. During the 1980s equities continued to deliver in this prolific way, only more so. The average equity return during the decade was 23.3 per cent a year, against 12.1 per cent on Treasury Bills. British pension funds not surprisingly ended the decade with large surpluses. So far in the 1990s, however, equities have disappointed. The annual excess return compared with cash has been only 1.6 per cent. Another BZW publication, the Global Market Digest, shows that this pattern has been repeated in many countries, with the excess annual return since the beginning of 1990 being only 1.3 per cent in the US and actually negative in Germany, France and Japan. For still strongly positive results you have to go to Hong Kong and other Asian countries. Of course, a run of a few bad years does not prove anything. The decade of the 1970s was also a bad period for excess returns, but that was a period of very high inflation and commodity price shocks. There is no such ready explanation for the trend of the 1990s. But the evidence is beginning to mount up. The persistence of such a high equity risk premium has in any case been something of a puzzle. Although individual equities are volatile, institutional investors can diversify, and so long as they have reasonable time-horizons they may view equity portfolios as being only moderately risky. They certainly do not require a premium of 6 per cent or more. So far this year, after all, equities in many countries have turned out to be much less volatile than bonds - supposedly the safer investment. Long gilts, for instance, are down about 18 per cent whereas the All-Share Index is off by only 9 per cent. Wall Street has displayed minimal volatility for the past two years. The key may be in the historical composition of the long-run excess return to equities. Much of it has come, in the past 10 years or so, from an upward adjustment to the valuation basis. Investors are ready to accept a lower equity risk premium on a forward-looking basis, but the process of adjustment paradoxically generates temporarily higher returns. Eventually, though, the revaluation process ends and future returns settle at a much lower level: perhaps 1990 marked a turning-point here. The theory gains some credence from the roughly coincident shift of equity money towards emerging markets. The timing has owed much, of course, to political developments, but there has apparently been a search for a more attractive risk/return combination than that which can currently be found in mature western markets. For instance, cross-border investors channelled Dollars 61bn (Pounds 39bn) into emerging markets in 1993 and, according to Baring Securities, at the end of the year they held emerging market equities worth Dollars 200bn against just Dollars 2bn in 1986. Even in less buoyant conditions, another Dollars 40-Dollars 50bn of new money is likely to be transferred this year. It is true that levels of underlying profit have recovered strongly in the US and the UK, and are in process of doing so in continental Europe. Labour is competing only weakly against capital for its share of the economic cake. Dividends are growing quite rapidly. But the return to equity investors in a secondary market depends crucially on the initial valuation basis as well as on company profitability. Share prices have moved to an historically high ratio to the book values of underlying assets. It is hard, however, for investors to look forwards and backwards at the same time.</p>
